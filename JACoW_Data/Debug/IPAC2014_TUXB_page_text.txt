The 3D electromagnetic Field Simulator GdfidL computes Wakepotentials on standard CPUs with a Speed comparable to GPU-Based Implementations. This is achieved via Computing only in interesting Cells, having the FD-Coefficients in compressed Form, traversing the Grid in a Cache-friendly Order and applying a blocked Update Scheme which is NuMA-aware. A Dispersion optimised Scheme is described. Fields in dispersive Materials are computed via solving the Equations of the Electron Hulls of the Material. Moving Mesh Computations have the Grid-generation on the Fly.
