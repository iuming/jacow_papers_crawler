Electron cooling of an ion beam is considered in a ring with coupled optics matched with the solenoid of a cooling section. Betatron motion of ions is then represented as a superposition of the two independent circular modes of the two uncorrelated uncoupled canonical emittances, similar to the drift and cyclotron modes of an electron beam in a solenoid. Then cooling of the ion cyclotron mode is not limited by the ion space charge. Cooling of the drift mode is attained by use of dispersion of both beams introduced to the solenoid section. Ion optics organized in this way allows one to drastically diminish the space charge impact on the 4D emittance at beam stacking in a booster and cooling in a collider ring, thus enhancing the cooling rate. Equilibrium due to the IBS is estimated. We also evaluate the gain in luminosity by means of a round to flat beam transformation around the Interaction Point.

The optical stochastic cooling (OSC) represents a promising novel technology capable to achieve fast cooling rates required to support high luminosity of future hadron colliders. The OSC is based on the same principles as the normal microwave stochastic cooling but uses much smaller wave length resulting in a possibility of cooling of very dense bunches. In this paper we consider basic principles of the OSC operation and main limitations on its practical implementation. Conclusions will be illustrated by Fermilab proposal of the OSC test in the IOTA ring.

Test design of a single-pass mid-infrared Cr:ZnSe optical amplifier for an optical stochastic cooling (OSC) proof-ofprinciple experiment foreseen at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) ring part of Fermilab Accelerator Science & Technology (FAST) facility. We especially present an estimate of the gain and evaluate effects of thermal lensing. A conceptual design of the amplifier and associated optics is provided.
