The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Linear Accelerator (Linac) delivers a high power proton beam (>1 MW) for neutron production with high neutron availability (>90%). For beam acceleration, the Linac has both normal and super conducting RF sections, with the Super Conducting Linac (SCL) portion providing the majority of beam acceleration (81 of 96 RF cavities are super conducting). Operationally, the goal is to achieve the highest possible beam energy by maximizing SCL cavity RF gradients, but not at the expense of cavity reliability. One mechanism that has negatively impacted both SCL cavity RF gradients and reliability is beam lost into the SCL due to malfunctions of upstream components. Understanding the sources and impacts of errant beam on SCL cavity performance will be discussed.

The Proton Improvement Plan, Stage Two (PIP-II) is a program of upgrades proposed for the Fermilab injection complex, which central part is an 800-MeV, 2-mA CW SRF linac. A prototype of the PIP-II linac front end called PIP-II Injector Test (PIP2IT) is being built at Fermilab. As of now, a 15-mA DC, 30-keV H− ion source, a 2 m-long Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a 2.1-MeV CW RFQ, followed by a 10-m Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) have been assembled and commissioned. The MEBT bunch-by-bunch chopping system and the requirement of a low uncontrolled beam loss put stringent limitations on the beam envelope and its variation. Measurements of transverse and longitudinal beam dynamics in the MEBT were performed in the range of 1-10 mA of the RFQ beam current. Almost all measurements are made with 10 μs beam pulses in order to avoid damage to the beam line. This report presents measurements of the transverse optics with differential trajectories, reconstruction of the beam envelope with scrapers and an Allison emittance scanner, as well as bunch length measurements with a Fast Faraday Cup.
