We have recently become able to study atoms of antihydrogen - the antimatter equivalent of hydrogen. The question to be addressed is fundamental and profound: 'Do matter and antimatter obey the same laws of physics?' The so-called Standard Model of fundamental particles and interactions requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. I will discuss the latest exciting development in antihydrogen physics: observation of a laser-driven transition (1S-2S) in trapped antihydrogen*. Precise measurement of the frequency of this transition could well be described as the 'holy grail' of physics with anti-atoms. To study antihydrogen, it must first be produced, then trapped**, and then held for long enough*** to observe a transition, using very few anti-atoms. I will discuss the techniques necessary to achieve this latest milestone, and then consider the future of optical and microwave**** spectroscopy, and gravitational studies***** with antihydrogen.
