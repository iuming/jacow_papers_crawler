This report presents the first operation experience of the electron beam diagnostics at FLASH2. FLASH2 is a new undulator line at the FLASH linac at DESY. Most electron beam diagnostics installed, like the beam loss monitors, cavity beam position monitors, toroids, beam halo monitors, have been designed for the European XFEL, and will provide operational experience beforehand. A few systems, as for example the button beam position monitors and the ionization chambers, have been developed for FLASH. The controls use the new MTCA.4 standard. Both linacs, FLASH and the European XFEL, require similar performance of the diagnostics systems. Many beam parameters are similar: bunch charge of 0.1 to 1 nC, pulse repetition frequency of 10 Hz, while others will be more critical at the XFEL than the ones currently used at FLASH, like the bunch frequency of up to 4.5 MHz. versus 1 MHz. The commissioning of FLASH2 and its diagnostics is ongoing. The beam monitors have accompanied the first beam through the linac, fine tuning for some systems is still to be done. The achieved performance will be presented in view of their use at the European XFEL.
