The heaviest known elements (up to 118Og) were synthesized at the U-400 cyclotron (FLNR JINR, Dubna) by using a beam of 48Ca ions. During the tests of the DC-280 cyclotron, intense beams of 48Ca ions were produced. For the synthesis of the elements 119 and heavier, intense and stable beams of medium-mass elements are required, such as 50Ti and 54Cr. Before starting the main experiments, we test the production of 48Ti ion beam, which is less expensive than 50Ti. The article describes the method, technique, and experimental results on the production of 48Ca and 48Ti ion beam at the DC-280 cyclotron from the DECRIS-PM ion source.

Sources of dense plasma fluxes with wide aperture are extensively used in applied science, i.e. surface treatment, and as a part of neutral beam injectors. ECR discharge in a solenoidal magnetic field (i.e. with no magnetic mirrors for plasma confinement), sustained by a powerful radiation of modern gyrotrons is under consideration at IAP RAS as a possible alternative to widely used vacuum arc, RF and helicon discharges. The use of a high frequency radiation (37.5 GHz) allows to obtain a discharge at lower pressure, sustain almost fully ionized plasma with density more than 1013 cm-3, whereas the power on the level of several hundreds of kW allows one to create such a plasma in considerably large volume. In the present work fluxes of hydrogen plasma with the equivalent current density of 750 mA/cm2 and the total current of 5 A were obtained. A multi-aperture multi-electrode extraction system design capable of forming the non-divergent ion beam was developed with the use of IBSimu code.

The CAPRICE ECRIS installed at the High Charge Injector (HLI) of GSI produces highly charged ion beams from gaseous and metallic elements. A high demand of metal ions comes from the nuclear physics, material re-search, and Super Heavy Element group (SHE), and the most requested element, besides 50Ti, is 48Ca. When this chemical reactive material is deposited inside the plasma chamber at internal components the stability can be com-promised. Furthermore, it is difficult to find a working point to guarantee a long-term stability as the oven re-sponse time and the reaction of the ECRIS are relatively slow. The monitoring by using an Optical Emission Spectrometer (OES) facilitates immediate reactions when-ever plasma instabilities occur. For this reason, a real-time diagnostic system based on an OES has been in-stalled at the ECRIS at HLI for routine operation during the beam-time 2020. The measured spectra revealed a parasitic oven heating by coupled microwaves often com-promising the ion source performance. Therefore, a tung-sten grid has been installed to shield the oven orifice from the coupled microwaves. The results in terms of 48Ca beam intensity and stability are reported here.

GANIL has been producing many stable beams for nearly 40 years. Constant progress has been made in terms of intensity, stability and reliability. The intensity for some stable metallic beams now exceeds or approaches the pµA level at an energy up to 95 MeV/u: 1.14 pµA for 36S (65% enriched) at 77 MeV/u, 0.35 pµA for 58Ni (63%) at 74 MeV/u. The presentation highlights recent results obtained for 28Si, 184W and 130Te using the GANIL ‘s LCO (Large Capacity Oven) on the ECR4 ion source. To produce the tungsten beam, two injection methods were compared. For the first one, we evaporated some tungsten trioxide (WO3) with GANIL ‘s LCO. For the second one, the injection in the plasma chamber was made by using MIVOC (Metallic Ions from VOlatile compounds) with a tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)6) compound. It was the first time that we used metal carbonyl compounds and the result is promising. All the tests have been qualified to obtain the level of intensity and beam stability. Theses good results led us to propose them for Physics experiments.

For the Super Separator Spectrometer (S3) [1] currently under construction on Spiral 2 facility, metallic beams of high intensities must be delivered to impinge a target aiming to produce rare radioactive isotopes for fundamental nuclear studies. First requested beams are 58Ni, 48Ca, 50Cr, 50Ti or 50V with an intensity about 1,2.1013 pps. The metallic ion beams will be produced by the Phoenix V3 ECR ion source combined with a resistive oven newly designed to cope with the beam specifications. The evaporation of low vapor pressure metallic elements (Ti, V…) requires temperature within a range of 1900°C to 2000°C. A new design of a resistive oven has been developed for this purpose. The oven reached 2000°C in a test vacuum chamber during 8 days. It has worked out in the Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source ECR4 at GANIL for Titanium beam production. Further tests using this ion source are under preparation for Ti and V beam production. Flux and angular distribution of atoms released by the oven are going to be measured off-line for optimizing crucibles geometries. Finally, the oven will be integrated into the Phoenix V3 ECRIS for Ti and V production.

The diffusion of electrons from ECRIS plasmas results in the emission of bremsstrahlung distributions from the plasma chamber. ECRIS bremsstrahlung measurements that are both time- and energy-resolved are often challenging to perform due to the 10’s; 100’s ms timescale that the plasma evolves over. However, the advancement of low-cost microcontrollers over the last decade makes timing and gating photon spectrometers easier. We present a proof of principle measurement which uses an Arduino microcontroller as a gate-and-delay generator for a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. An example plot of the time-resolved bremsstrahlung spectrum, triggered by beam current variation induced by kinetic instabilities, is shown.
