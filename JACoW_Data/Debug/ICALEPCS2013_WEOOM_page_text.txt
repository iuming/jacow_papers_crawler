How do you build an monument scale sculptural machine that will last as long as civilization? How do you engage the people that visit it? For the last fifteen years The Long Now Foundation and Alexander Rose have been working on building this icon of long-term thinking. Rose is currently managing the 10,000 Year Clock project underway in West Texas where they have used purpose designed robots and explosives to excavate over 500 vertical feet through solid rock to house the Clock. Alexander will discuss the research and design process that has taken him as far as the arctic Seed Vault in Svalbard, to the ultra-secret Mormon geneological vaults in Salt Lake City. He will show the building process now underway for the 10,000 Year Clock that includes fabrication of the massive Clock itself.
