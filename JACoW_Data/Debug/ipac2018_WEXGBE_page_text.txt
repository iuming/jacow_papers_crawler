Top-up operation, which nowadays is standard for lepton colliders and synchrotron light sources, has been developed over last decades. The accelerator performances have been drastically improved through top-up operation. However, future electron storage rings are designed, aiming at further high performance, to operate with strong nonlinear magnetic fields that may restrict their dynamic aperture. Consequently, the conventional off-axis injection and accumulation may become impossible. New injection schemes have been proposed and under development to overcome the difficulties and limitations expected in these machines. This paper reviews top-up injection schemes, including novel ideas recently proposed.

With the advent of multi-bend achromat lattices, extremely low emittances are to become the norm in storage ring-based X-ray photon sources. In these lattices, the ratio of beam energy lost to radiation in the Insertion Devices (IDs) to the overall beam energy loss is relatively larger than in 3rd generation light sources. As a result, these machines are more sensitive to the energy loss variations occurring as the users operate variable-gap IDs and to the concurrent variations in radiation damping time, equilibrium emittance, and ultimately transverse properties of the beam. With possibly tens of variable gap IDs continuously and independently varying their gaps to meet the experiment needs, the resulting variation in emittance and beam sizes can be significant and can jeopardize the experimental performance in some of the beamlines. In this paper we describe and discuss possible methods for compensating such emittance variations and maintaining constant transverse beam properties for the experiments.

Intrabeam Scattering (IBS) effects will become a limiting factor for the attainable emittances and single-bunch currents in future electron storage rings and light sources. IBS studies were performed for BESSY II at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and for the Metrology Light Source (MLS) at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) to quantify the IBS contributions to equilibrium beam sizes in these machines and make predictions for the BESSY II upgrade project, BESSY VSR. The energy dependence of IBS effects (γ −4 ) makes especially the MLS machine susceptible to IBS effects due to the relatively low energy ranges at which it can be operated (50 MeV-630 MeV). We compare experimental data with simulations and present IBS simulation results for BESSY VSR.
