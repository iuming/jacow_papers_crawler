An Electron Ion Collider (EIC) has been identified in the Nuclear Physics Long Range Plan as the priority facility for new construction. This talk presents the overview and status of the Jefferson Lab design of an EIC (JLEIC). It features frequent collisions of small electron and ion bunches providing a luminosity of 1033-1034 cm-1s-1 in a broad range of the center-of-mass energy. The small size of ion bunches is maintained against intra-beam scattering by a novel high-energy bunched beam electron cooling system. The figure-8 shape of the electron and all ion rings allows for preservation and ease of manipulation of the electron polarization and the spin of any ion species. The interaction region is designed to accommodate a full-acceptance detector with complete coverage and geometry tagging in the forward and ultra-forward directions. The talk highlights recent progress in the JLEIC accelerator design and various aspects of R&D including the electron and ion complexes, integrated interaction region design, optimization of non-linear dynamics, electron and light ion polarization schemes, RF systems, crab crossing scheme, high-energy electron cooling, and magnet design.

A design is presented for a hadron collider in which the magnetic storage ring is configured as a circular pipeline, supported in neutral buoyancy in the sea at a depth of ~100 m. Each collider detector is housed in a bathysphere the size of the CMS hall at LHC, also neutral-buoyant. Each half-cell of the collider lattice is ~300 m long, housed in a single pipe that contains one dipole, one quadrupole, a correction package, and all umbilical connections. A choice of ~4 T dipole field, 2000 km circumference provides a collision energy of 700 TeV. Beam dynamics is dominated by synchrotron radiation damping, which sustains luminosity for >10 hours. Issues of radiation shielding and abort can be accommodated inexpensively. There are at least ten sites world-wide where the collider could be located, all near major urban centers. The paper summarizes several key issues; how to connect and disconnect half-cell segments of the pipeline at-depth using remote submersibles; how to maintain the lattice in the required alignment; provisions for the injector sequence.

Development of the superconducting RF crab cavities is one of the major activities under the high luminosity LHC upgrade project that aims to increase the machine discovery potential. The crab cavities will be used for maximizing and leveling the LHC luminosity hence having tight tolerances for the operating voltage and phase. RF field stability in its turn is sensitive to Lorentz force and external loads, so an accurate modelling of these effects is very important. Using the massively parallel ACE3P simulation suite developed at SLAC, we perform a corresponding multiphysics analysis of the electro-mechanical interactions for the RFD crab cavity design in order to ensure the operational reliability of the LHC crabbing system.
