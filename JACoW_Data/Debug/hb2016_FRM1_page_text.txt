Particle accelerators developed last century are approaching the energy frontier. Today at the terascale the machines needed are extremely large and costly, even the smaller scale lower energy accelerators are not small. For a number of years plasma based particle accelerators driven by either lasers or particle beams are showing great promise as future replacements, primarily due to the extremely large accelerating electric fields they can support, about a thousand times greater than conventional accelerators leading to the possibility of compact structures. But will they be a serious competitor and displace the conventional “dinosaur” variety? The impressive results that have so far been achieved show considerable promise for future plasma accelerators at the energy frontier as well as providing much smaller “table-top” ion and electron accelerators. A number of schemes are now being investigated for both high energy lepton and hadron beams. In this talk I will give an overview of the current laser plasma acceleration techniques, in particular the possibility of plasma acceleration of high intensity hadron beams in the future.
