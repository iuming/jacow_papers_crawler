The measurement and correction of optics parameters has been a major concern since the advent of strong focusing synchrotron accelerators. Traditionally, colliders have led the development of methods for optics control based on turn-by-turn centroid data, while lepton storage rings have focused on closed orbit response techniques. Recently considerable efforts are being invested in comparing these techniques in different light sources and colliders. An emerging class of less invasive optics control techniques based on the optimization of performance related observables is demonstrating a great potential. A review of the existing techniques is presented highlighting comparisons, merits and limitations.
