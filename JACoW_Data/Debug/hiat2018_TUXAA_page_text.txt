The new Radioactive Ion Separator (RAISOR), formerly Argonne In-flight Radioactive Ion Separator (AIRIS), was recently installed and commissioned at the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (ATLAS). RAISOR is a chicane of four dipoles with four complementary quadrupoles, and will enable the selection of secondary radioactive ion beams produced via the in-flight method. RAISOR will expand the scope of the in-flight beam program at ATLAS by improving beam purity, increasing the allowable primary beam intensity, and enabling secondary beam delivery to all ATLAS high energy target stations. Along with the magnets, new diagnostics and high power slits were installed to identify low intensity secondary beams and safely dump the high intensity primary beam, respectively. Commissioning results and the expected performance of the full system will be presented.

BRIF progress and BISOL proposal will be presented, BRIF is an ISOL facility based on a 100 MeV proton cyclotron as driver, a mass resolution 20000 ISOL in between, and a current 15 MV tandem as post accelerator. The BRIF project is commissioned by producing 20Na beam for decay study, with plan of post accelerating RI beams in year of 2018. BISOL, or Beijing ISOL (previous called CARIF), is an ISOL facility based on 60 MW research reactor CARR and a 40 MeV deuteron LINA as drivers, an ISOL in between to separate fission beam, and a 150 MeV/u LINAC as post accelerator. By using ISOL+PF approach, BISOL is of advantageous of producing very neutron rich RI beams. The BISOL project is listed by national long-range plan in 2017. With feasibility report expected to be approved in 2019, by the year of 2025, BISOL will becoming a facility that is capable of detecting the location of neutron drip line.

The detector system ROSE, allowing to perform 4D emittance measurements on heavy ion beams independent of their energy and time structure, has been build and successfully commissioned in 2016 at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany. This method to measure the four dimensional emittance has then been granted a patent in 2017. The inventors together with the technology transfer department of GSI have found and industrial partner to modify ROSE into a standalone, commercially available emittance scanner system. This is a three step process involving the hardware, the electronics and the software working packages. It is planned to have a configurable customer product ready by end of 2020. In this contribution I will present the actual status and introduce the multiple possibilities of this 4D emittance scanner.
