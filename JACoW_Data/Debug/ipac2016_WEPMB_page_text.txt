CEA is committed to delivering a Medium Energy Beam Transfer line and a superconducting linac (SCL) for SARAF accelerator in order to accelerate 5mA beam of either protons from 1.3 MeV to 35 MeV or deuterons from 2.6 MeV to 40 MeV. The SCL consists in 4 cryomodules. The first two identical cryomodules host 6 half-wave resonator (HWR) low beta cavities (β = 0.09) at 176 MHz. The last two identical cryomodule will host 7 HWR high-beta cavities (β = 0.18) at 176 MHz. Low-beta and high beta cavities have been optimized to limit electric and magnetic peak fields in the cavity, and to minimize the dissipated power. Manufacturing constraints and helium cooling were taken into consideration to minimize the risk during manufacturing and operation. Preliminary mechanical studies of the cavity and of the tuning system, as well as preliminary studies of the couplers and pick-up antennas were carried out. This work will be presented in this poster.

In the framework of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF), which consists of two high power CW accelerator drivers, each delivering a 125 mA deuteron beam at 40 MeV, a Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator (LIPAc) is presently under construction for the first phase of the project. Eight power couplers are needed for the cryomodule of LIPAc. After the validation of the two prototypes, the manufacturing of the Series Power Couplers was lunched. This paper will report the status of the manufacturing progress. It will also describe the acceptance tests in addition to the criteria adopted for these critical RF power units. The manufacturing imperfections and some finishing techniques used for the different parts will be also presented and discussed.

The cavity performance tests, that is, vertical test (V.T.) and cryomodule test (C.T.), in the cavity/cryomodule mass production for XFEL have been done since 2012 at DESY, and is still on-going at present. At the comparatively initial stage of the mass production, the error estimation in the cavity performance tests was done for understanding how precisely those measurements are done at AMTF (Accelerator Module Test Facility). There are two parameters for the error estimation in V.T. One is the cable calibration parameter, and the other is the external Q-value, which is related to the power emitted from cavity. The measurement precision in the external Q-value depends on the measurement of coupling coefficient (β) strongly. Therefore, it is essential not to miss the β measurement for the precise measurement in V.T. On the other hand, as for C.T., the change of parameter (Kt), which is related to the evaluation of accelerating gradient, was used. As the result of the data analysis for Kt, the error was estimated to be 6%, and is related to the cavity performance degradation from V.T. to C.T. In this paper, the detailed data analysis and error estimation will be presented.

For CW operation of superconducting cavity, reduction of heat load at cavity surface is one of important topics, since generated heat load is much higher than that of pulse wave. Using Large Grain (LG) Nb for superconducting cavity has possibility to reach higher Q0 than using Fine Grain Nb, which reduces heat load to 2K Helium. KEK Cavity Fabrication Facility(CFF) group had successfully produced superconducting 1-cell cavity made of LG Nb in 2013, and reached high Q0 at the vertical test (maximum field of 45 MV/m). Then, KEK CFF group started producing first superconducting 9-cell LG cavity in 2015, which will be completed in the end of December 2015. Whole processes of producing this cavity from sliced Nb are done in KEK. In this report, process flow and strategies of producing 9-cell cavity and results of vertical test will be presented in detail.

A superconducting RF (SRF) gun can generate a high current and high energy beam. It has a possibility to achieve requirement from high performance ERL and high repetition FEL. Target values of the L-band KEK SRF gun are that beam repetition is 1.3 GHz, beam current is 100 mA, beam energy is 2 MeV, emittance is 1 mm mrad or less. The number of cell is 1.5. Accelerating energy of 2 MeV corresponds to 42 MV/m of maximum surface field. The photocathode is designed to be illuminated by excitation laser from backside. The SRF gun cavity consists of the 1.5 cell accelerating cavity, cathode plug and choke filter for protecting the heating of cathode plug. To evaluate these parts individually, these parts are added step by step. High gradient test of the accelerating cell without cathode plug and choke filter was done. The surface peak electric field reached 66 MV/m, and this meet the target value 42 MV/m sufficiently. Next high gradient test will be done after adding the choke filter. The choke filter is designed to be simple to wash choke cell easier. In this conference, we will report the design, fabrication and high gradient performance of the SRF gun cavity with choke filter.

A horizontal test cryostat was designed and constructed at AR East building on KEK. Main purposes of test stand are improvement of module assembly technique and effective development of module components. Diameter of vacuum chamber is 1 m and its length is 3 m, which is enough to realize performance test of L-band 9-cell cavity with full assembly, including input couplers, HOM dampers/couplers and frequency tuners. On the sides, several ports are prepared to access to components, such as coupler and tuners. A cold box is placed on the top of the chamber. Liquid He is filled in a 4K-pod and 2K He is supplied through a J-T valve. A He pumping system is prepared. Inside of the chamber was covered with 80K shield, which is cooled by Liquid nitrogen. A cavity is supported on 5K table, which is also used as 5K thermal anchors. After cooling down to 80K using liquid Nitrogen, 4K He was stored and pumped down to 2K. The cooling test was successful. In this presentation, details of design and construction of the horizontal test cryostat is described and results of the cooling tests are shown. High power tests will be realized in near future.

Recently Nitrogen doping(N-doping) technique was proposed and drastic improvements of Q-values were reported. Since high-Q operation of SRF cavities are very attractive for CW machine, we started investigation on performance of Nitrogen doped SRF cavities. Nitrogen doping systems were prepared on two vacuum furnaces, which have been used for annealing of SRF cavities. Two fine grain single cell cavities have been used for the study. After 800 degree, 3 hours annealing, N-doping were carried out under several Pa of Nitrogen pressure and followed by post annealing. Three kind of different conditions, pressure and duration time, were attempted. After applying EP-2, cavity performances were evaluated by vertical tests. Against our expectations, we observed lower Q-values, at every measurements, than those measured without N-doping. In this presentation, we describe details about N-doping system and parameters and results obtained by vertical tests. Some discussions are also given against our results.

The high power test for STF-2 cryomodule has completed successfully in 2015. Before cooldown of cryomodule, at first, the input coupler conditioning at room temperature is done with detuned cavities. After cooldown, the cavity conditioning, which is the main part in the performance test, is done by monitoring the radiation level measured at three locations around the cryomodule, and the heating and RF output at two HOM (Higher Order Mode) couplers. Consequently, it became clear the average accelerating gradient is 30 MV/m for STF-2 cryomodule (39 MV/m at max. and 15 MV/m at min.), and the second cavity string with four cavities had the significant performance degradation by heavy field emission due to the additional clean room work in the STF tunnel. As the following next steps, there are the LFD (Lorenz Force Detuning) measurement, LFD compensation by piezo, and long run for check of stable operation at high gradient. In the long run around 32 MV/m, each cavity without degradation showed the stable operation with the successful LFD compensation by piezo and RF feedback system. In this paper, the detailed test result will be presented.

In order to realize a compact industrial-use X-ray source based on the laser-Compton scattering, a superconducting spoke cavity for an electron accelerator operated at 4K is under development. While the initially proposed operating frequency was 325MHz considering the 4K operation, we decided to start from the half scale model at 650MHz to accumulate our production experience of spoke cavity within our limited resources. In the present contribution, procedures and results of multipactor simulations for 650MHz spoke cavities are briefly introduced.

We set up a measurement system for superconducting characteristics on thin-film samples at KEK. The system includes small-sized and middle-sized cryostats, where critical temperature, critical magnetic field, Residual Resistiviy Ratio (RRR), Superconducting RF (SRF) resistivity can be measured on thin-film samples. A small-sized cryostat has a compact refrigerator to cool down samples for the measurements of critical temperature and RRR. On the other had, we can cool down various setups with a middle-sized cryostat by using liquid helium. A thin-film sample is set into a mushroom cavity and the SRF characteristics of the thin-film sample can be measured. In another setup, a sample is set with a small coil and the third harmonic measurement is done on the sample around the critical temperature. Finally, a thin-film sample is set into the bore-center of superconducting magnet and the magnetization of sample is measured with external magnetic field around the critical temperature. This article presents the details of the system and some measurements of samples by the system.

We are developing the manufacturing method for superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities by using a hydroforming instead of using conventional electron beam welding. We expect higher reliability and reduced cost with hydroforming. For successful hydroforming, high-purity seamless niobium tubes with good formability as well as advancing the hydroforming technique are necessary. Using a seamless niobium tube from ATI Wah Chang, we were able to successfully hydroform a 1.3 GHz three-cell TESLA-like cavity and obtained an Eacc of 32 MV/m. A barrel polishing process was omitted after the hydroforming. The vertical test was carried out with very rough inside surface. We got amazing and interesting result.

We have been studying nondestructive inspections for super-conducting spoke cavities. The temperature mapping (T-map) and X-ray mapping (X-map) are powerful inspection methods to locate a hot spot during the vertical RF tests. There would be a defect under the hot spot and the defect may be the cause of a quench. Our XT-map system (a combined system of T-map and X-map) has a high resolution in space. Because the huge amount of sensor signals are multiplexed at a hi-speed scanning rate in the vicinity of the sensors, the small number of signal lines makes the installation process easy and reduces the system complexity. Our XT-map got useful results on finding a defect in vertical RF tests of International Linear collider super-conducting cavity. The XT-map system is useful as low cost nondestructive inspections for superconducting spoke cavity. The study will be reported. progresses will be reported.

We have launched a 5-year research program to develop superconducting spoke cavity for laser Compton scattered (LCS) photon sources. For realizing a wide use of LCS X-ray and γ-ray sources in academic and industrial applications, we adopt the super-conducting spoke cavity to electron beam drivers. The spoke cavity has advantages such as relative compactness in comparison with an elliptical cavity of the same frequency, robustness with respect to manufacturing inaccuracy due to its strong cell-to-cell coupling, the better packing in a linac to install couplers on outer conductor. On the other hand the spoke cavity has disadvantage of more complicated structure than an elliptical cavity. Though our proposal design for the photon source consists of the 325 MHz spoke cavities in 4K operation, we have begun to fabricate the half scale model of 650 MHz spoke cavity in order to accumulate our cavity production experience by effective utilization of our limited resources. In this paper, we present our fabrication status.

Both large circular collider such as CEPC and high current ERL facility need high HOM damping superconducting cavity. The slotted cavity is an option for such applications. It has three slotted waveguides which can highly damp the HOM and extract high HOM power out. However, the HOM absorbers for such facility are usually put outside of the cryomodule to decrease the influence of HOM power on the cryogenic system. Large slot waveguide need to make smaller transition structure to adapt this situation. A rectangular waveguide to coaxial waveguide structure was designed to the slotted cavity. In this paper, we will show the cavity HOM damping design scheme with this structure.

Recently, nitrogen doping (N-doping) technology has been proved to increase Q0 of superconducting cavity obviously, which lowers the BCS surface resistance. After N-doping, Q0 of 9-cell 1.3 GHz cavity can be increased to 3*1010 at Eacc = 16 MV/m, while 1.5*1010 without N-doping [1]. Since 2013, there have been over 60 cavities nitrogen doped at FNAL, JLAB and Cornell. The Circular Electron Collider (CEPC) has been proposed by IHEP in China, while requests Q0=4e10@Eacc=15.5 MV/m for 650 MHz cavity. It's hard to achieve without N-doping. So research of N-doping was begun in cooperation with Peking University in early 2015. Experiments of niobium samples have showed that nitrogen concentration at niobium surface increased a lot after N-doping. After then, several single-cell 1.3 GHz cavities completed vertical tests, but there're no successful test results of Q0 increasing, yet.

For the XFEL project proposed by IHEP, a sophisticated beam spreader is required to separate a single beam into multiple beams. One of the deflecting cavities used in the spreader has been investigated and optimized. It is a 325 MHz, compact RF-dipole superconducting cavity, with the transverse R/Q of 2900Ω, geometrical factor G of 88.5 Ω, and the Helium pressure sensitivity df/dp of 3.4 Hz/mbar. At the nominal deflecting voltage of 7MV, the peak electric field Epeak is 41 MV/m and peak magnetic field Bpeak is 48 mT. This paper will present the detailed RF and mechanical designs.

After upgrading the post-processing system, several superconducting cavities were RF tested at Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) in China recently. The test results of 14 spoke 012 cavities and 6 spoke 021 cavities which used at China ADS injector I and linac all exceeds our design objective. Moreover, a spoke 040, a 650MHz elliptical cavity and a 325MHz HWR cavity are also vertical tested and the test results are all significantly surpass our design value. The post processing of these cavities including Buffered Chemical Polishing (BCP), high temperature heat treatment and High Pressure water Rinsing (HPR) is presented here.

After the successful development of the IHEP01 and IHEP02 1.3GHz 9cell superconducting cavity, we developed a 1.3GHz Tesla-Like 9cell superconducting cavities in collaboration with KEK. The cavity was made by niobium material produced in OTIC, Ningxia, China. After completeing welding, leakage check, BCP, HPR, we sent the cavity to KEK and used the standard procedures of ILC cavity for processing. These include electron polishing, vacuum furnace outgassing, tuning for field flatness and frequency, light EP, baking and vertical test. We target to have a high Q0 cavity for this experiment. In this paper, we will report the experimental status of the IHEP03 cavity.

Clean and smooth surface is important to get low sur-face resistance for superconducting material. SRF (Super-conducting Radio Frequency) cavity made of niobium which is superconducting material and also one of the rare metal. The procedure of niobium quality control was set up to get high performance SRF cavity. The procedure consists of three parts; certificates check, Nb specification verification, and surface inspection and measurements of thickness, roughness, flatness. Three important properties which are RRR value, chemical composition and me-chanical properties were verified to conform Nb specifica-tion. The range of thickness, roughness and flatness for niobium as SRF cavity raw material were obtained by measurement.

SRF cavities of superconducting linear accelerators in RAON are developed and tested at 2K/4K. 1st Quarter Wave Resonator (QWR) and Half Wave Resonator (HWR) are fabricated by a domestic vender and tested in the TRIUMF's facility. The measured Q factors are above the required values at the operating gradients. And the predicted multipacting phenomena are observed in the test and easily conditioned. The Q factors decreased after a slow cooldown and enhanced at 4K tests by a low temperature baking. Based on these tests, modified bare cavities are newly developed, jacketed and will be tested with tuners and power couplers.

Niobium superconducting cavity is treated with high pressure rinsing to clean the inner surface of the cavity. Either organic or inorganic residues on the inner surface of the cavity can cause serious problems during the cavity operation. A thermal quenching - superconducting material loses its superconductivity - is a typical phenomenon brought out by harmful defects by increasing critical temperature. We have performed high pressure rinsing experiments to check out a prototype HPR machine. HPR experiments were performed with a simplified cavity structure, and analyzed as a function of the pressure, the distance from a nozzle, and the sizes of defects on the niobium surface. In this presentation, we will discuss the performance of the prototype HPR machine.

Laser plasma wakefield acceleration (LPWA) is one of most popular novel trends of acceleration. The LPWA has two serous disadvantages as very high energy spread and low part of electrons capturing into acceleration. The waveguide and klystron type beam pre-modulation schemes was proposed *, ** to growth capturing and to limit the energy spectrum of 2-3 % for 200-300 MeV beam. One interesting effect was detected due to numerical simulation of beam dynamics in plasma channel. Not captured electrons are escape to the channel border fast and this effect should be explained. It was shown that such effect is caused by effective potential function which forms very high defocusing transverse field after its trailing edge. The results of such explanation verified by numerical simulations are discussed in report for linear and bubble LPWA modes.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is an accelerator-driven neutron spallation source built in Sweden. It will deliver the first protons to a rotating tungsten target by 2019 and will reach the full 5 MW average beam power in the following years. The superconducting Spoke cavities are considered compact structures at low frequencies and having an excellent RF performance in both low and medium velocity regimes, therefore ESS will include a total of 26 double-spoke cavities. The testing of the double-spoke prototype cavity at high power has been conceded to Uppsala University, Sweden, where the Facility for Research Instrumentation and Accelerator development (FREIA) has been equipped with superconducting cavity test facility. A bare spoke cavity has been tested at the FREIA Laboratory with a self-exited loop at low power level to confirm its vertical test performance at IPNO. Similar test results as IPNO's previous test were obtained with FREIA system. In this paper we present the methods and preliminary study results of the cavity performance.

The HIE ISOLDE project [1] reached a major milestone in October 2015, with the start of the first physics run with radioactive ion beams. This achievement was the culminating point of intense months during which the first cryomodule of the HIE ISOLDE superconducting Linac and its high-energy beam transfer lines were first installed and subsequently brought into operation. Hardware commissioning campaigns were conducted in order to define the envelope of parameters within which the machine could be operated, to test and validate software and controls, and to investigate the limitations preventing the systems to reach their design performance. Methods and main results of the first commissioning of HIE ISOLDE post accelerator, including the performance of the superconducting cavities with beam, will be reviewed in this contribution.

The accelerator complex of the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) consists of two 500-MHz RF systems: one RF system with two KEKB-type single-cell SRF modules is operated for the 3-GeV storage ring of circumference 518 m, and the other with one five-cell Petra cavity at room temperature is for the concentric full-energy booster synchrotron. This report overviews the installation, system integration, commissioning, and initial operation of the 500-MHz RF systems for the TPS with emphasis on our solution to approach the highly reliable SRF operation at its maximum design beam current of 500-mA. Lessons learned during the project are reviewed.

Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a modern light source with 3 GeV electron energy and low emittance. The bunch length is about 3 mm at designed beam current of 500 mA and operating gap voltage of 3.2 MV. The short bunch length results in short Touschek lifetime and high parasitic loss of insertion device (ID). Some of the undulators are operated in vacuum at TPS, therefore the head load become an important issue. To install higher harmonic cavity is a solution for improving the Touschek lifetime and the heat load by lengthening the bunch length. The effect of installing 3rd harmonic cavity for TPS is investigated. The expected maximum elongation factor for bunch lengthening, as well as the effect on the Touschek lifetime and heat load of ID are presented in this paper.

Bulk niobium cavities are widely employed in particle accelerators to create high accelerating gradient despite their high material and operation cost. Advancements in technology have taken bulk niobium close to its theoretical operational limits, pushing the research to explore novel materials, such as niobium based alloys. Nitrides of niobium offer such an alternative, exhibiting a higher Tc compared to bulk niobium. Replacing then the niobium with a material with better thermal conductivity, such as copper, coated with thin films of nitrides in a multilayer S-I-S would lead to improved performance at reduced cost. Physical vapour deposition (PVD) is currently used to produce these coatings, but it suffers from lack of conformity. This issue can be resolved by using chemical vapour deposition (CVD), which is able to produce high quality coatings over surfaces with a high aspect ratio. This project explores the use of CVD techniques to deposit NbN thin films starting from their chlorinated precursors. The samples obtained are characterized via SEM, FIB, XRD, and EDX.

The performance of superconducting RF cavities made of bulk Nb is limited by a breakdown field of Bp=~200 mT, close to the superheating field for Nb. A potentially promising solution to enhance the breakdown field of the SRF cavities beyond the intrinsic limits of Nb is a multilayer coating suggested in [1]. In the simplest case, such a multilayer may be a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (S-I-S) coating, for example, bulk niobium (S) coated with a thin film of insulator (I) followed by a thin layer of another superconductor (S) which could be e.g. dirty niobium [2]. Here we report the first results of our measurements of field penetration in Nb thin films and Nb-AlN-Nb multilayer samples at 4.2 K using the magnetic field penetration facility designed, built and tested in ASTeC.

The LHC double quarter wave (DQW) crab cavities have two different types of Higher Order Mode (HOM) couplers in addition to a fundamental power coupler (FPC). The FPC requires conditioning, so to achieve this we have designed a radio-frequency (RF) quarter wave resonator to provide high transmission between two opposing FPCs. For the HOM couplers we must ensure that the stop-band filter is positioned at the cavity frequency and that peak transmission occurs at the same frequencies as the strongest HOMs. We have designed two test boxes which preserve the cavity spectral response in order to test the couplers.

Diamond's CESR-B cavities are iris coupled and have fixed Qext. For reliability, the cavities are operated at lower voltages. This results in the optimum condition for beam loading being satisfied at a much lower power typically about 100 kW. For operation at 300 mA with two cavities, the RF power needed per system exceeds 200 kW. Consequently, the cavities need to be operated under-coupled. To lower the Qext and move the optimum operating point nearer to 200kW, 3 stub tuners are used in the waveguide feed line. The difference in the height of the coupling waveguide on cavity and that of the vacuum side waveguide on the window assembly results in a step transition which affects the Qext. The present window/step location results in Qext higher than that without the window. The Qext can be lowered by re-locating the RF window or by shifting the step change in the waveguide cross-section from its present location. This needs modification to the Pump Out box. The pros and cons of the proposed modification to the pump out box in terms of standing waves and multipacting characteristics studied with CST Studio are discussed in this paper.
