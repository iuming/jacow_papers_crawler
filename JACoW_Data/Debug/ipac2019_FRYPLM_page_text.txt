X-ray Imaging: Faster, Smaller and Brighter

X-ray science, and structure determination in particular, has continuously developed since 1895 with an increase in source brightness over that time of about 30 orders of magnitude. The development has culminated in large accelerator-driven radiation sources such as undulators and free-electron lasers, which are a big feature of the DESY campus. The bright laser-like beams from these sources have precipitated methodological advances for imaging complex forms of matter, such as biological macromolecules or man-made nanostructures. An understanding of how to synthesise atomic-resolution images was developed 100 years ago by Bragg, and still forms the basis for ongoing research in structure determination and coherent imaging, but in ways that perhaps Bragg would not have imagined. Our ambitions are to use these new capabilities to overcome bottlenecks in macromolecular imaging and to form ultrafast snapshots of molecules in action, to piece together their motions and reactions.

Significant progress has been made over the last decade in optical laser performance including repetition rate, average and peak power, and laser-system footprint making these systems attractive for many applications including novel accelerators. Most novel acceleration schemes require high-power lasers. The talk will present drive laser requirements for current novel accelerator schemes, industry plans to meet these requirements, and the future for high-power lasers.

FRYPLM3
Overview of Light Source Developments in Asia

China has been pursuing multiple light source projects. The first high energy next-generation light source project, HEPS, is under construction and other projects, including XFELs, are being developed. The Thai synchrotron light source facility, SLRI, has also started discussion on a new light source project. Australian light source, the ALS, has been operating well and is also considering the next steps. Korea and Japan have built several light source facilities based on storage rings as well as XFELs, and are now looking for their future plans. The closing talk is expected to overview these activities across Asia, and to provide future perspectives of light sources development across the region.
