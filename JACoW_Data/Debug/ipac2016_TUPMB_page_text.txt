A major upgrade project known as ESRF-EBS, Extremely Brilliant Source is planned at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in the coming years. A new storage ring will be built, aiming to decrease the horizontal emittance and to improve the brilliance and coherence of the X-ray beams. The lattice of the new storage ring relies on magnets with demanding specifications: dipoles with longitudinal gradient (field ranging from 0.17 T up to 0.67 T), strong quadrupoles (up to 90 T/m), combined function dipole-quadrupoles with high gradient (0.57 T and 37 T/m), strong sextupoles and octupoles. The design of these magnets is based on innovative solutions; in particular, the longitudinal gradient dipoles are permanent magnets and the combined dipole-quadrupoles are single-sided devices. The design of the magnets is finished and prototypes of innovative magnets have been built. The procurement of the magnets has started. Call for Tenders have been sent to a pre-qualified short list of magnet manufacturers. The longitudinal gradient dipoles will be assembled and measured in house. The design of the magnets, the prototype results and procurement status will be presented.

The THOMX facility is a compact X-Ray source based on the Compton back scattering aiming at a flux of 1011 to 1013 ph/s in the range of energy from 40 to 90 keV. Due to the compactness and the expected stability of this machine, high requirements are set for all magnets in terms of design and manufacturing. First, the design optimization of the magnets is presented, leading to high performance in terms of harmonics. Issues regarding the cross-talk between quadrupole and sextupole fields are then discussed.

The Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) is a new 3 GeV synchrotron radiation laboratory in the design stage. The ILSF storage ring (SR) is based on a Five-Bend Achromat lattice providing an ultr-alow horizontal beam emittance of 0.48 nm-rad. The ring is consisting of 100 pure dipole magnets, 320 quadrupoles and 320 sextupoles. In this paper, we present some design features of the SR magnets and discuss the detailed physical and mechanical design of these electromagnets. The physical designs have been performed relying on two dimensional codes POISSON [1] and FEMM [2]. Three dimensional RADIA [3] and MERMAID [4] were practiced too, to audit chamfering values and get the desired magnetic length.

The compact Energy Recovery Linac (cERL) was con-structed and operated at KEK. For the cERL we designed and fabricated the eight main bending magnets, fifty seven quadrupole magnets, four sextupole magnets and sixteen small bending magnets [1]. These magnets are used at 3 MeV (for low energy part) and 20 MeV (high energy part) beam energy now, but we designed them to be used maximum 10 MeV and 125 MeV beam energy for future upgrade of the cERL. The magnetic field analysis was done by 2D and 3D simulation code (OPERA) to design magnet shape. The main bending magnets and quadrupole magnets are made of electromagnetic steel sheet and the other magnets are made of electromagnetic soft iron. In this paper, we show the detail of the design-ing and fabricating work of those magnets.

The H− stripping painting injection is adopted in the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) of China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). Painting injection is realized by eight pulse bump magnets. The pulse bump magnet is the key of the performance of painting, as well as the beam loss control. The manufacture and the field measurement of the eight pulse bump magnets have been completed. In the development of the magnets, some key technical problems on fabrication of coil were solved, and the field measurement results show that the magnets fulfil the design specification.

Beam-based alignment (BBA) techniques are important tools for beam orbit steering in linear accelerators or transfer lines. In this paper this technique and the control system application programs developed based on XAL platform were applied to the beam commissioning for Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) of CSNS to get the transverse misalignments of beam position monitor (BPM) and quad. The results shows that the absolute values of BPMs offsets are less than 0.6 mm and quads offsets are less than 0.05 mm，that is much smaller than the tolerance of the misalignment.

Vibrating wire technique is a promising measure-ment method for small-aperture Permanent Magnet Quadrupoles (PMQs) in linear accelerators and scan-ning nuclear microprobes. In this paper, we describe the improved vibrating wire setup for measuring an individual PMQ with the minimum aperture of several millimeters. This setup is aiming at measuring the magnetic center. The advantage of this setup is that any mechanical measurement on the wire, which may be the main error source, is avoided. Experiments of the 20 mm-aperture Halbach-type PMQs for Xi'an Proton Application Facility (XiPAF) DTL has been carried out. The research results of the magnetic center measurements show a precision of about 10 μm and robustness against the background magnetic field. Results of the magnetic center and field multipoles measurements agree with the ones obtained from the rotating coil.

Vibrating wire method and device are described to locate the magnetic center of a Quadrupole theoretically and experimentally. With rotating 180 degrees method, it is convenience to measure the position magnetic center from mechanical center. Tilt angle can also be measured because tilt of magnetic axis will cause the difference of measured magnetic center in different harmonic driving current frequency. Errors analysis shows that tilt of Quadrupole will cause the main error and improved device is described to adjust and measure the tilt angle to fix the errors caused by tilt.

Transverse gradient undulator (TGU) is attracting more and more attentions, especially for the rapid progress of laser plasma accelerator techniques. The transverse gradient of TGU is usually given by an empirical formula simply derived from the empirical formula of a uniform-parameter undulator. In this paper, we numerically investigate the transverse magnetic field of TGUs using the RADIA code. Through many simulations for TGUs with different magnet structures, we have given the dependences of transverse gradient parameter on the cant angle, the undulator period and the average gap. Based on these results, when the cant angle is small and the rate of the gap and period is in the range of 0.4-0.6, the simulation results agree with the empirical formula well. But, with the growing of the cant angle, or with the growing of the deviation of the rate of the gap and period from the range of 0.4-0.6, the difference between the simulation results and the empirical formula becomes larger.

An in-vacuum undulator and an in-vacuum wiggler have been developed for CLS at SSRF recently. The period lengths of the undulator and the wiggler are 20mm and 80mm respectively. Both IDs have the minimum gap of 5.2mm. The field integrals were measured for each magnet block with two poles and were sorted in-situ as they were installed on to the girders. Finally the field integrals of the undulator and the wiggler were shimmed by using the 'Magic Fingers' at the ends with a special algorithm. This paper reports the procedure and the results of the measurement and the optimization for the field integrals.

A compact system for industrial electron accelerators irradiation field formation is described. This system permits to get uniform distribution of electron beam current along the direction perpendicular to product movement with the width 50 - 100 cm. Its main element is a non-linear quadrupole lens, based on rare-earth permanent magnet material. This system can be used instead of an electromagnet of the conventional beam scanning systems, making much more comfortable conditions for products irradiation. Operation principles, results of calculations and test results of the system for CW 1 MeV and pulse 10 MeV electron linear accelerators are described.

Based on SINP MSU experience in developing continuous wave (CW) normal conducting (NC) electron linacs, we propose an optimal design for such accelerators with beam energy of up to 10 MeV and average beam power of up to several hundred kW. As an example of such design, we discuss the 1 MeV industrial CW linac with maximum beam power of 25 kW, which was recently commissioned at SINP MSU.

Additionally there is a mode of operation for experiments in the ring. Beams for all modes of operation are injected through one transfer channel. Extremely high acceptance of the ring (240 mm*mrad) leads to large apertures of all magnetic elements including the septum magnet. Meanwhile planned parameters of the magnetic field and magnetic field quality are comparatively strict. The present state of the design of the pulsed injection septum for the CR is presented in this article together with the concept of the injection system.

In this work we present the results of the measurement campaign of the main bending magnets of the SESAME storage ring, that were fully characterized at ALBA-CELLS magnetic measurements facility. A total of 17 combined function dipoles ' 16 series magnets plus a pre-series one ' has been tested and characterized. This campaign has been performed using a dedicated Hall probe bench. The main measurements include the transfer function at the center of the magnet and field maps of the three components of the field in a plane around the nominal trajectory of the electron beam, at two different operating currents. In this paper we describe the experimental setup and procedures, before reporting the main results, including statistics of magnet-to-magnet reproducibility and integrated field quality. Finally, we show how the measured data can be exploited for an optimal 3D alignment of the dipoles in the machine.

The IFMIF-EVEDA* Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator (LIPac) is a 9 MeV, 125 mA CW deuteron accelerator to validate the technology to be used in the future IFMIF accelerator. The acceleration of deuterons will be done through two stages. The matching between them will be done in the Medium Energy Beam Transport line (MEBT). In this section, the transverse focusing of the beam is carried out by five quadrupole magnets with integrated steerers, grouped in one triplet and one doublet**. These magnets have been designed by CIEMAT, and manufactured by the Spanish company ANTECSA. After manufacturing, they were fully characterized at ALBA-CELLS magnetic measurements facility. In this paper we describe the characterization bench used to measure the magnets, the measurement protocol and the alignment procedure, as well as the results obtained and the iteration process followed in order to shim the magnets to fulfill with beam dynamics requirements.

The FACET-II facility, currently being designed at SLAC, will contain a small ~20 m circumference, 335 MeV, positron damping ring. The ring has to fit in the existing linac tunnel, meaning that a compact lattice with short distances between magnets is required. The detailed magnet design is done in Opera-3d, with a finite element model of a full damping ring arc being simulated. This article presents this magnet design in a relatively early stage, with iteration between magnet and lattice design currently in progress.

The MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring magnets are integrated "magnet block" units consisting of several consecutive magnet elements precision-machined out of a common solid iron block. In the 3 GeV ring, there are 140 magnet blocks containing a total of 1320 magnet elements. During the manufacturing phase of the project, a field measurement was performed for each magnet element, by Hall probe and/or by rotating coil. This article presents an overview of the magnetic field measurement results that were obtained for the full production series.

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has been engaged in an internal laboratory directed research and development project to define a suitable accelerator physics lattice to support the diffraction limited upgrade of the Advanced Light Source*. Diffraction limited lattices require strong focusing elements throughout. Magnetics design is challenging in that the high gradient magnetic structures are required to operate in close proximity. Lattice development requires a coordinated engineering design effort to ensure the lattice design feasibility. We will present a review of the results of our magnet scoping studies as well as conceptual design specifications for the ALS-U lattice dipole, quadrupole, and sextupole magnet systems. Additionally we will present a conceptual design of refined super-bend magnets for the ALS-U lattice including a discussion of their potential impact on beam emittance.

A compact microtron can be an effective gamma source that can be transported to locations outside the laboratory. As part of a Phase I project we have studied a portable microtron that can accelerate electrons with energies of 6 MeV and above as a source for gamma and neutron production. The mass of the magnet is a significant contribution to the overall mass of the system. This paper will discuss conceptual designs for both permanent magnet and electromagnet systems. The choice of mictrotron RF frequency range is determined by the application requirements. The RF frequency influences the size of the microtron magnet and consequently its weight. We have looked at how the design would vary with the different frequency configurations.

The Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research (FAIR-project) is now under construction. The heavy ion synchrotron SIS100 and the Super Fragment Separator (Super-FRS) use mainly superferric magnets as beam guiding elements. We present the design status of the magnets next to the experience obtained on the first magnets which were produced for SIS100. Finally we give an overview of the preparation for the series production and testing of the cryomagnetic modules.

The procurement of the SIS100 dipoles was contracted without building and testing an appropriate model magnet. So the thorough test of the first of series magnet is the key issue for the final realisation of the complete series production. The core of these tests is the measurement and analysis of the magnetic field of the first dipole. We describe the adapted measurement technics next to a detailed analysis of the obtained field quality and point out the critical issues of the series production

SuperKEKB is now being constructed with a target luminosity of 8×1035 which is 40 times higher than the KEKB luminosity. The luminosity can be achieved by the "Nano-Beam" accelerator scheme, in which both beams should be squeezed to about 50 nm at the beam interaction point, IP. The beam final focusing system consists of 8 superconducting quadrupole magnets, 4 superconducting solenoids and 43 superconducting corrector coils. The QC2 magnets are designed to be located in the second closest position from IP as the final beam focusing system of SuperKEKB. The two types of quadrupole magnets have been designed for the electron and positron beam lines. The QC2P for the positron beam is designed to generate the field gradient, G, of 28.1 T/m and the effective magnetic length, L, of 0.4099 m at the current, I, of 877.4 A. The QC2E for the electron beam line is designed to generate G=28.44 T/m and L=0.537 mm, 0.419 mm (for QC2LE, QC2RE) at I=977 A. In the paper, we will present the designs and the constructions of the two types of the quadrupole magnets.

A superconducting solenoid for J-PARC muon facility was newly designed and manufactured. High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) has been operating the J-PARC Muon Science Establishment (MUSE) since 2008. Among its four muon beam lines, the decay muon line (D-Line) has been extracting and providing surface muons and positive decay muons up to a momentum of 50 MeV/c for various users, utilizing a superconducting solenoid. The D-Line as well as the other J-PARC facility suffered severe damages from the earthquake on March 11, 2011. It necessitated rebuilding of the damaged superconducting solenoid. New design parameter of the solenoid is as follows: length of solenoid: 6 m, diameter of warm bore: 0.2 m, magnetic field of bore center: 3.5 T, rated current: 415 A, superconducting wire: NbTi/Cu, quench protection: quench back heaters. The six-meter-long solenoid consists of twelve pieces of 0.5-meter-long superconducting coils. The entire solenoid is forced-indirectly cooled by supercritical helium flow. This report describes the design and manufacturing process of the newly built superconducting solenoid for D-Line of J-PARC muon facility.

We have been developing magnets utilizing first generation HTS wire for this decade. HTS materials have advantages over LTS materials. Magnets can be operated at 20 K or higher temperature and the cooling structure becomes simpler. Owing to a large margin in operating temperature, it is possible to excite HTS magnets by AC or pulsed currents without quenching. After successful performance tests of proto type models, two magnets have been fabricated for practical use. A cylindrical magnet generates a magnetic field higher than 3.5 T at the center to polarized 210 neV neutrons. A dipole magnet is excited by pulse currents in order to deliver accelerated beams to two target stations by time sharing. Their design and operational performance are discussed.

The Super-FRS is a new fragment separator to be built as part of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) [\ref{fairweb}] at Darmstadt. The acceptance tests and magnetic measurements of the superferric separation dipoles and multiplets (containing quadrupole and higher-order magnets) will be performed at CERN in collaboration with GSI/FAIR [\ref{abstractfacility}]. This paper presents the methods and challenges of the magnetic field measurements, and the required instruments for measuring the transfer function, field quality, and magnetic axis. A prototype for each system has been produced in order to validate the measurement methods, the instruments, and the mechanical integration. In this paper will present the design and production of the prototypes, the design of the instruments for the series measurements, and the results of the metrological characterization.

The energy stored in the LHC beams is substantial and requires a complex machine protection system to protect the equipment. Despite efficient beam absorbers, several failure modes lead to some limited beam impact on superconducting magnets. Thus it is required to understand the damage mechanisms and limits of superconducting magnets due to instantaneous beam impact. This becomes even more important due to the future upgrade of CERNs injector chain for the LHC that will lead to an increase of the beam brightness. A roadmap to perform damage tests on magnet parts has been presented previously*. The polyimide insulation of the superconducting cable is identified as one of the critical elements of the magnet. In this contribution, the experimental setup to measure the insulation degradation of LHC main dipole cables due to exposure to high temperature is described. Compressed stacks of insulated Nb-Ti cables have been exposed to a heat treatment within an Argon atmosphere. After each heat treatment, high-voltage measurements verified the dielectric strength of the insulation. The results of this experiment provide an upper damage limit of superconducting magnets due to beam impact.

Availability is one of the key performance indicators of LHC operation, being directly correlated with integrated luminosity production. An effective tool for availability tracking is a necessity to ensure a coherent capture of fault information and relevant dependencies on operational modes and beam parameters. At the beginning of LHC Run 2 in 2015, the Accelerator Fault Tracking (AFT) tool was deployed at CERN to track faults or events affecting LHC operation. Information derived from the AFT is crucial for the identification of areas to improve LHC availability, and hence LHC physics production. For the 2015 run, the AFT has been used by members of the CERN Availability Working Group, LHC Machine coordinators and equipment owners to identify the main contributors to downtime and to understand the evolution of LHC availability throughout the year. In this paper the 2015 experience with the AFT for availability tracking is summarised and an overview of the first results as well as an outlook to future developments is given.

Work for the SuperKEKB luminosity upgrade of the KEKB asymmetric e+e− collider is near completion. In this paper we review the design, production and testing of superconducting correction coils, that are needed to achieve the desired IR optics performance, and are integrated with the final focus magnets. For SuperKEKB 43 coils were produced at BNL using Direct Wind techniques. These coils underwent preliminary warm field harmonic quality assurance measurements before shipment to KEK. At KEK final cold measurements of these coils were made prior to their ultimate integration with the SuperKEKB IR magnets. SuperKEKB corrector production was challenging due to the large number of coil types and configurations that had to be fitted into very limited available space. Also the nature of the SuperKEKB optics sets fairly stringent local field quality requirements for these coils.

A fundamental consideration in designing a high energy collider Interaction Region with electron beams is to avoid production of excessive experimental detector background due to synchrotron radiation. Circumventing such radiation is especially problematic with colliding beams having quite different magnetic rigidities as occurs in both electron-hadron and asymmetric-momentum electron colliders where one must shield an incoming electron beam from the strong magnetic fields needed to focus the other beam. After reviewing some magnetic configurations used to date, we introduce a new 'sweet spot' coil concept that was invented for the eRHIC project proposed at BNL. Sweet spot coils have conductors arranged so that there is an open, low field strength path through the main high field superconducting coil structure. Sweet spot configurations tend to be more efficient than other active and passive shielding solutions. Dipole and quadrupole sweet spot magnet designs examples are presented in this paper along with ongoing R&D to implement and test these concepts.

The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a long-term collider project, which will serve as a Higgs Factory and offer a unique opportunity for direct searches for New Physics in the high-energy range far beyond LHC reach [1]. In the frame of this project, a large 2K cryogenic system will be built to provide coolant for superconducting cavities used in booster ring and collider ring. All the superconducting cavities will be working under 2K. This paper will give a brief introduction to the preliminary considerations of this large cryogenic system, including the general layout, heat load estimation, helium refrigerator, schematic flow diagram as well as the main parameters and working process

In the FREIA laboratory at Uppsala University we test the super-conducting spoke-cavities for the European Spallation Source. Liquid Helium for cooling the cavities is provided by a liquefaction plant from which also a local user community at the University is served. Recently we encountered a leak due to a faulty valve which went undetected for some time and caused significant loss of Helium. In order to prevent such mishaps in the future we implemented a Helium tracking system that includes detailed accounting of Helium leaving and entering the closed system as well as all volumes containing Helium in the system. We describe the technical implementation and experience to date.

This paper presents the different control strategies deployed in the LHC cryogenic system in order to compensate the beam induced effects in real-time. LHC beam is inducing important heat loads along the 27 km of beam screens due to synchrotron radiations, image current and electron clouds. These dynamic heat loads disturb significantly the cryogenic plants and automatic compensations are mandatory to operate the LHC at full energy. The LHC beam screens must be maintained in an acceptable temperature range around 20 K to ensure a good beam vacuum, especially during beam injections and energy ramping where the dynamic responses of cryogenic systems cannot be managed with conventional feedback control techniques. Consequently, several control strategies such as feed-forward compensation have been developed and deployed successfully on the machine during 2015 where the beam induced heat loads are forecast in real-time to anticipate their future effects on cryogenic systems. All these developments have been first entirely modeled and simulated dynamically to be validated, allowing then a smooth deployment during the LHC operation.

A helium phase separator with a condenser is under fabrication and assembled at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC). The objective of a helium phase separator with its condenser is to separate two-phase helium flow and to re-condense vaporized gaseous helium with a cryocooler of Gifford-McMahon type. We developed a 100 litre (ltr) helium phase separator with a small heat loss as a prototype. The experimental results for the total cooling capacity of the phase separator are 0.73 W at 1.67 bara, which includes the effect of thermal conduction and thermal radiation from the environment. The helium liquefaction rate is 2 ltr/day with a 100 ltr vessel. The mechanism of heat transfer in phase separator was investigated and discussed. This paper presents the experiment of helium liquefaction process of 100 ltr separator with condenser, which was a key component of the helium phase separator.

For the past few years, the technology of X-ray photon source is getting more and more advanced, more and more countries are now striving to build the biggest synchrotron facility to meet its' need. In Taiwan, the construction of an electron accelerator with the energy of up to 3.5 GeV is constructed to fulfill the strong demands for an X-ray photon source with high brilliance and flux. Thus, to let the TPS be under stable operation, the cryogenic system is therefore very important. The refrigerant of the TPS Cryogenic System is Liquid Helium, to maintain liquid helium in its state, the temperature has to be maintained under 4.5K, however to let liquid helium turn into gas helium, only 20 W is needed. Therefore, the Multi-Channel Line is developed in our system to prevent heat from conduction in and letting liquid helium vaporize. Several mechanical parts have been designed to reduce heat loss and meet its needs, for example the Spacer. The paper presents a design methodology of long multi-channel helium cryogenic transfer lines. It describes some aspects thermo-mechanical calculation, supporting structure and contraction protection.

In the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project, the collimators in the SPS-to LHC transfer lines will undergo important modifications. The changes to these collimators will allow them to cope with beam brightness and intensity levels much increased with respect to their original design parameters: nominal and ultimate LHC. The necessity for replacement of the current materials will need to be confirmed by a test in the High Radiation to Materials (HRM) facility at CERN. This test will involve low Z materials (such as Graphite and 3-D Carbon/Carbon composite), and will recreate the worst case scenario those materials could see when directly impacted by High luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) or Batch Compression Merging and Splitting (BCMS) beams. Thermo-structural simulations used for the material studies and research, the experiment preparation phase, the experiment itself, pre irradiation analysis (including ultrasound and metrology tests on the target materials), the results and their correlation with numerical simulations will be presented.
