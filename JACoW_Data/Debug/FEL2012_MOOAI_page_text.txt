Leaning from X-ray laser technology development, now we know of the high performance electron beams; its generation and handling. Using X-ray FEL beams, now we start developing new technologies matching with such a high coherent intensity X-ray shot. Among them, imaging of atomic level structure is common target with electron microscopy. Learning between two communities will be very important and I personally believe it become more creative for us. I will present personal perspective on interdisciplinary science along with this direction.
