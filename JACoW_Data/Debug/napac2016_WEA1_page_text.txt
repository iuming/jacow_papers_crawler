An experimental study is presented of a corrugated structure that uses wakefields to remove linear energy correlation in a high energy (4.4 - 13.3 GeV) electron beam (a dechirper). Time-resolved measurements of both longitudinal and transverse wakefields of the device are presented and compared with simulations. We demonstrate flexible control of the LCLS FEL bandwidth and present novel uses of the device in addition to energy chirp control.

We discuss recent developments of numerical methods for computation of wakefields excited by short bunches in accelerators. They include a low-dispersive computational algorithm, conformal approximation of the boundaries, surface conductivity, and indirect wake potential integration. The implementation of these methods in the electromagnetic code ECHO for 2D and 3D problems are presented with a special emphasis on a new ECHO2D code for fast calculations of wakefields in rectangular geometries. Several examples of application of the code to calculation of wakefields for the European Free Electron Laser project and in the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) project are considered.

The APS-Upgrade will require the injector chain to provide high single bunch charge for swap-out injection. One possible limiting factor to achieving this is an observed reduction of injection efficiency into the booster synchrotron at high charge. We have simulated booster injection using the particle tracking code elegant, including a model for the booster impedance and beam loading in the RF cavities. The simulations point to two possible causes for reduced efficiency: energy oscillations leading to losses at high dispersion locations, and a vertical beam size blowup caused by ions in the particle accumulator ring. We also show that the efficiency is much higher in an alternate booster lattice with smaller vertical beta function and zero dispersion in the straight sections.

Collimation with hollow electron beams or lenses (HEL) is currently one of the most promising concepts for active halo control in HL-LHC. In previous studies it has been shown that the halo can be efficiently removed with a hollow electron lens. Equally important as an efficient removal of the halo, is also to demonstrate that the core stays unperturbed. In this paper, we present a summary of the experiment at the LHC and simulations in view of the effect of the HEL on the beam core in case of a pulsed operation.

Funding: This work was supported by Department of Energy contract DE-AC02-98CH10886.
The microwave instability in the NSLS-II has been studied for the current configuration of insertion devices, 9 In-Vacuum Undulators (IVU's), 3EPU's, 3 Damping Wigglers. The energy spread as a function of single bunch current has been measured based on the frequency spectrum of IVU for X-Ray Spectroscopy (SRX) beam line. The results for two lattices, bare lattice with nominal energy spread 0.0005 and a lattice with one DW magnet gap closed (nominal energy spread 0.0007) are compared. In addition we used a Spectrum Analyzer to measure the beam spectrum. The instability thresholds for two different lattices cross-checked numerically using the particle tracking code SPACE and longitudinal impedance.

McMillan map is an important discrete time model of 1D transverse nonlinear accelerator lattice. We provide a full analytical theory based on parametrization of individual canonical biquadratic curves*. Using the normal forms provided in* we were able to generalize this result to entire phase-plane of finite trajectories and calculate mechanical action-angle coordinates. The bifurcation map for canonical McMillan map including stability of fixed points is provided. In addition, we discuss the connection of these results with possible 2D generalizations - axially symetric and 2D-magnetostatic McMillan lenses.
