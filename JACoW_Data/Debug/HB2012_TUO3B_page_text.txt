In the present design of the European Spallation Source (ESS) accelerator, the Warm Linac will accelerate a pulsed proton beam of 50 mA peak current from source at 0.075 MeV up to 80 MeV. Such Linac is designed to operate at 352.2 MHz, with a duty cycle of 4% (3 ms pulse length, 14 Hz repetition period).In this paper the main design choices and the beam dynamics studies for the source up to the end of DTL are shown.

The European Spallation Source, ESS, uses a linear accelerator to deliver the high intensity proton beam to the target station. The nominal beam power is 5 MW at an energy of 2.5 GeV. The superconducting part covers more than 95\% of the energy gain and 90\% of the length. The beam dynamics criteria applied to the design of the superconducting part of the linac including the frequency jump at a medium energy of 200 MeV as well as the beam dynamics performance of this structure are described in this paper.

Linac4 is a 160 MeV H− ion linear accelerator, presently under construction, which will replace the 50 MeV Linac2 as injector of the CERN proton complex. Linac4 is a 90 m long normal-conducting Linac made of a 3 MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) followed by a 50 MeV Drift Tube Linac (DTL), a 100 MeV Cell-Coupled Drift Tube Linac (CCDTL) and a Pi-Mode Structure (PIMS). Starting in 2013, five commissioning stages, interlaced with installation periods, are foreseen at the energies of 3, 12, 50, 100 and 160 MeV. In addition to the diagnostics permanently installed in the Linac, temporary measurement benches will be located at the end of each structure and will be used for beam commissioning. Comprehensive beam dynamics simulations were carried out through the Linac and the diagnostic benches to define a commissioning procedure, which is summarised in this paper. In particular, we will present a method for emittance reconstruction from profile measurements which keeps into account the effects of space charge and finite diagnostics resolution.

End to End Beam Dynamics and Design Optimization for CSNS Linac

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) will use a linear accelerator delivering a 15mA beam up to 80MeV for injection into a rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). Since each section of the linac was determined individually, a global optimization based on end-to-end simulation results has refined some design choices, including the drift-tube linac (DTL) and the medium energy beam transport (MEBT). The simulation results and reasons for adjustments are presented in this paper.

We present the start-to-end simulation result on the high-current proton linac for the Compact Pulsed Hadron Source (CPHS) at Tsinghua University. The CPHS project is a university-based proton accelerator platform (13 MeV, 16 kW, peak current 50 mA, 0.5 ms pulse width at 50 Hz) for multidisciplinary neutron and proton applications. The 13 MeV proton linac contains the ECR ion source, LEBT, RFQ, DTL and HEBT. The function of the whole accelerator system is to produce the proton beam, accelerate it to 13 MeV, and deliver it to the target where one uniform round beam spot is obtained with the diameter of 5 cm.
