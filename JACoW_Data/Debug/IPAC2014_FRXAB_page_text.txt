RF systems are a major part of both the capital and operating costs of contemporary light sources and directly impact their capability, reliability and availability. The RF community has been discussing for many years the best choice of CW RF power source for light sources. In the domain of great average power, the choice is among a klystron, inductive-output tube, and solid-state RF amplifier. Here we review their current development and challenges and offer a perspective from a point of view of operating a light source with high reliability and availability.
