Emerging evidence indicates that the therapeutic window of radiotherapy can be significantly increased using ultra-high dose rate dose delivery (FLASH), by which the normal tissue injury is reduced without compromising tumor cell killing. The dose rate required for FLASH is 40 Gy/s or higher, 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than conventional radiotherapy. Among the major technical challenges in achieving the FLASH dose rate with X-rays is a linear accelerator that is capable of producing such a high dose rate. We will discuss the design of a high dose rate 18 MeV linac capable of delivering 100 Gy/s of collimated X-rays at 20 cm. This linac is being developed by a RadiaBeam/UCLA collaboration for a preclinical system as a demonstration of the FLASH effect in small animals.

We report on the development of a cryogenic X-band (11.424 GHz) accelerator to provide electron beams for Very High Energy Electron therapy. The distributed coupling linac is designed with a 135° phase advance, capable of producing a 100 MeV/m accelerating gradient in a one-meter structure using only 19 MW when operating at 77 K. This peak power will be achieved through pulse compression of a 5-8 MW few-µs pulse, ensuring compatibility with a commercial power source. We present designs of the cryogenic linac and power distribution system, as well as a room temperature pulse compressor using the HE11 mode in a corrugated cavity. We discuss scaling this compact and economical design into a 16 linac array that can achieve FLASH dose rates (> 40 Gy/s) while eliminating the downtime associated with gantry motion.

Here we present, the design and optimization of a 100 kV DC thermionic electron gun, and a transport channel that provides transverse focusing through a normal conducting solenoid and longitudinal bunching with the help of a single gap buncher for a 1.3 GHz, 40 kW, 1 MeV superconducting electron accelerator. The accelerator is proposed to treat various contaminants present in potable water resources. A 100 kV thermionic electron gun with LaB6 as its cathode material was intended to extract a maximum beam current of 500 mA. To minimize beam emittance, gun geometry i.e. cathode radius, and height and radius of the focusing electrode are optimized. The minimal obtained emittance at the gun exit is 0.3 mm.mrad. A normal conducting focusing solenoid with an iron encasing is designed and optimized to match and transport the beam from gun exit to the superconducting cavity. Finally, a 1.3 GHz ELBE type buncher is designed and optimized to bunch the electron beam for further acceleration.

An accelerator-based boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has been studied intensively in recent years as one of the new cancer therapies after many clinical research with nuclear reactors. In the iBNCT project, the accelerator configuration consists of an RFQ and a DTL which have proven achievements in J-PARC. Meanwhile, a high duty factor is required to have a sufficient thermal neutron flux needed by BNCT treatments. After a failure of the klystron power supply occurred in Feb. 2019, beam operation was resumed in May 2020. To date, an average current of about 2 mA with the beam repetition rate of 75 Hz has been achieved with stable operation. Irradiation tests with cells and mice are ongoing together with characteristic measurements of the neutron beam. In parallel with that, we have been gradually improving the accelerator cooling-water system for further stability. In this contribution, the present status and prospects of the iBNCT accelerator are reported.

Proton Therapy (PT) was first proposed in the 1940s. Application of this knowledge was largely led over the next fifty years by accelerator laboratories, but now also by commercial companies. Availability of PT is increasing but is limited by three factors: facility size, prompt/induced radiation, and treatment cost. Compact cyclotrons/synchro cyclotrons for single-room facilities have reduced space requirements. linacs can avoid high radiation levels. Yet treatment costs have remained stubbornly high, driven largely by maintenance and staffing costs over the typical 20-30 year facility lifetime. Current technology cannot simultaneously reduce these three factors. By using a long linac, the Alceli approach sacrifices size limitations, to gain massive improvements in treatment cost and radiation levels. Quadrupling the length of a linac results in a sixteen-fold reduction in RF power per cavity. Along with other innovations in our design, this leads to a modular warm linac with distributed solid-state RF amplification, easy and cheap to manufacture and maintain, requiring no water cooling, and a treatment cost of 1/10th of current facilities, making PT much more affordable.

The unique feature of the LANSCE accelerator facility is multi beam operation. Accelerator delivers 100 MeV H+ and 800 MeV H− beams to five experimental areas. The LANSCE front end is equipped with two independent injectors for H+ and H− beams, merging at the entrance of a Drift Tube Linac (DTL). Existing Cockcroft-Walton (CW) - based injector provides conservation of high value of beams brightness before injection into DTL. To reduce long-term operational risks and support beam delivery with high reliability, we designed an RFQ-based front end as a modern injector replacement for the CW injectors. Proposed injector includes two independent low-energy transports merging beams at the entrance of a single RFQ, which accelerates simultaneously both protons and H− ions with multiple flavors of the beams. Paper discusses details of beam physics design and presents injector parameters.

RF test for quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and half-wave resonator (HWR) superconducting cavities is performed at low temperature. The quality factors of the superconducting cavities are measured as a function of accelerating field. The magnetic heating effect for the quarter-wave resonator (QWR) is studied. For the half-wave resonator (HWR), the Q slope degradation is investigated with x-ray radiation and field emission.

TIME Co. developed a new 4-vane RFQ structure that can be used for a very high-duty factor operation. We eliminated the tuners to flatten the field distribution. The tuners increase RF contacts which may trigger unex-pected local heat spots and subsequent discharges. In addition, we hollowed out the entire vane to achieve large cooling water channels. A high-power test showed that the commissioning was completed within one day. We could input a nominal RF power without experienc-ing almost any discharge. The applied duty factor was 5 % at the 200 MHz resonant frequency, and the meas-ured frequency shift was not detected.
These activities have been carried out in collaboration with Tokyo Institute of Technology and RIKEN.

A new beam diagnostics method to reconstruct the full 5-dimensional phase space (x, x’, y, y’, t) of bunches has recently been proposed. This method combines a quadrupole-based transverse phase-space tomography with the variable streaking angle of a polarizable X-band transverse deflecting structure (PolariX TDS). Two of these novel structures have recently been installed at the ARES beamline at DESY, which is a linear accelerator dedicated to accelerator research and development, including advanced diagnostics methods and novel accelerating techniques. In this paper, realistic simulation studies in preparation for planned experimental measurements are presented using the beamline setup at ARES. The reconstruction quality of the method for three beam distributions is studied and discussed, and it is shown how this method will allow the visualization of detailed features in the phase-space distribution.
