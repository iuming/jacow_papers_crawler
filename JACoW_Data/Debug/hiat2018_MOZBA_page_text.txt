Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) is a cyclotron, synchrotron and storage ring accelerator complex, which accelerates ions of hydrogen to uranium from low to medium energy. Since the complete of HIRFL-CSR project in 2008, under the support from CAS, efforts have been put to improve the infrastructure for machine performance, including improvement of EMC environments, power distribution stations, PS stations, cooling water system, RF system of cyclotrons and adoption of EPICS control system, etc. New generation SC ECR source-SECRAL2 with high performance is put into operation. Experiments of electron cooling with pulsed electron beam are performed for the 1st time. Stochastic cooling and laser cooling are realized in CSRe. The performance of RIBLL2 and CSRe are gradu-ally improved. The ISO mode of CSRe for precise atomic mass measurements is well studied and reaches state-of-art mass resolution of storage rings. The operation status and enhancement plan of HIRFL will be briefly reported in this paper.
