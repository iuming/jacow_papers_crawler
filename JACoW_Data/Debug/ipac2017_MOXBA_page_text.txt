The construction of the European Spallation Source (ESS) is advancing at a high pace with the support of many laboratories and institutions all over Europe. Prototyping and manufacturing for the accelerator are in full swing in more than 23 laboratories distributed over 12 European partner countries. The origin and goals of the ESS will be briefly outlined in this paper. The milestones achieved, both in Lund and at the partner labs will be described as well as the plans up to operations.
