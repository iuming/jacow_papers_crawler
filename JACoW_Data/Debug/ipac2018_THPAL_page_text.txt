New RF system has been upgraded several times for high-current operation, especially for extra beam power and detuning angle. The current was increased gradually resulting in more and more frequency detuning, and an effective method is to tune the temperature of cavity to compromise detuning. Of course, the power dissipated in cavity and high intensity beam are approximately 120kW resulting in too many power modules operated in the high risk of failure. The specific analysis and simulation were introduced in detail.

A 200MeV compact isochronous superconducting cyclotron, named SC200, for proton therapy is under development by collaboration of ASIPP (Hefei, China) and JINR (Dubna, Russia). The radio frequency (RF) system as one of most significant subsystems in cyclotron consists of acceleration cavity, low level RF, RF source and transmission network. SC200 has two cavities connected in the centre, which are operated at 91.5 MHz with second harmonic. To meet the required acceleration voltage, the cavities have been carefully designed with comprised choices between several aspects, such as Q factor, mechanic stability and so on. The low-level RF (LLRF) system has been implemented by using the FPGA to achieve the significant accelerating voltage with an amplitude stability of <0.2% and a phase stability of < 0.1 degree. The cavity and LLRF system have been tested outside of cyclotron, the results will be presented. For future, the commissioning of whole RF system will be started after the assembly of SC200 at the end of 2019.

An S-Band High-Gradient (HG) Radio Frequency (RF) laboratory is under construction and commissioning at IFIC. The purpose of the laboratory is to perform investigations of high-gradient phenomena and to develop normal-conducting RF technology, with special focus on RF systems for hadron-therapy. The layout of the facility is derived from the scheme of the Xbox-3 test facility at CERN* and uses medium peak-power (7.5 MW) and high repetition rate (400 Hz) klystrons, whose RF output is combined to drive two testing slots to the required power. The design and construction of the various components of the system started in 2016 and has been completed. The installation and commissioning of the laboratory is progressing, with first results expected before mid 2018. The technical characteristics of the different elements of the system and the commissioning status together with preliminary results are described.

Superconducting RFQs (SRFQs), the first SC RFQs ever made operational for users, have been operated on the PIAVE SC heavy ion linac injector at INFN-Legnaro since 2006. The structure is split into two resonators and is limited to the accelerating RFQ sections. The resonators had never exceeded 80% of the design accelerating fields. In 2015, an upgrade plan started, aimed at increasing the accelerating fields, while improving their slow and fast tuning systems, repairing degraded components, imple-menting a LASER alignment method. The upgrade plan was successfully concluded in summer 2017. The resona-tors were kept stably locked for days at a field larger than the nominal one. Eventually, a test beam was accelerated successfully for 72 hours, with negligible locking issues. SRFQs entered once again routine operation in December 2017. The new features will allow to accelerate heavy ions with an A/q value as high as 8.5 (versus a former maximum A/q=7.5), allowing operation of the very first accelerated uranium beams at INFN-LNL, after the relat-ed authorizations shall have been issued.

The cooling of beams of exotic nuclei (both in energy spread and in transverse oscillations) is critical to downstream mass spectrometry devices and can be provided by collisions with light gases as in the Radio Frequency Quadrupole Cooler (RFQC). As in other traps, several electromagnetic systems can be used for beam deceleration confinement and deceleration, as a radiofrequency (rf) quadrupole, a magnetic solenoid and electrostatic acceleration. Since rf contributes both to beam cooling and heating, operational parameters should be carefully optimized. The LNL RFQC prototype is going to be placed inside the existing Eltrap solenoid, capable of providing a magnetic flux density component Bz up to 0.2 T, where z is the solenoid axis. Setup progress and related rf component development are reported; in particular simple matching boxes are discussed; the differential gas pumping system is also described.

The R&D of high gradient radiofrequency (RF) devices is aimed to develop innovative accelerating structures based on new manufacturing techniques and materials in order to construct devices operating with the highest accelerating gradient. Recent studies have shown a large increase in the maximum sustained RF surface electric fields in copper structures operating at cryogenic temperatures. These novel approaches allow significant performance improvements of RF photoinjectors. Indeed the operation at high surface fields results in considerable increase of electron beam brilliance. This increased brilliance requires high field quality in the RF photoinjector and specifically in its power coupler. In this work we present a novel power coupler for the RF photoinjector. The coupler is a compact X-band TM01 mode launcher with a fourfold symmetry which minimized both the dipole and the quadrupole RF components.

The Beam Test Facility is part of the DAΦNE accelerators system of INFN Frascati National Laboratory. It is a transfer-line optimized for electrons and positrons extracted from the DAΦNE LINAC. An upgrade of the line is scheduled for two purposes: reach a beam energy of 920 MeV (with respect to the actual 750 MeV) and add a new branch to the present transfer line. This new layout foresees six new quadrupoles one fast ramped dipole, two H-shape and one C-shape sector dipoles. The design of the magnets has been completely performed at INFN involving Electromechanical Enterprise partner in the design phase in order to optimise the manufacturing process. This effort lead to a complete set of detailed CAD drawings that can be directly used by manufacturer to build the magnets. The goal is to boost the manufacturing of prototypes and small series from Small and Medium Enterprises. Magnetic measurements will be performed at INFN. This poster is focused on the realization of the two full iron yoke H-shape and C-shape dipoles, respectively with 45 and 15 bending angle. They are characterized by a high flux density of 1.7 T in a gap of 35 mm. They have a bending radius of 1.8 m

The Beam Test Facility (BTF) is part of the DAΦNE accelerators system of INFN Frascati National Laboratory. It is a transfer-line optimized for electrons and positrons extracted from the DAΦNE LINAC. An upgrade of the line is planned in order to reach a beam energy of 920 MeV (with respect to the present 750 MeV), adding a new branch to the present transfer line. The design of the magnets for this new layout has been completely performed at INFN, including electromagnetic, mechanical, thermal and hydraulic aspects. This effort lead to a complete set of detailed CAD drawings that can be used by Industrial partners to build the magnets. The manufacturing processes have been studied in detail: the goal is to boost the manufacturing of prototypes and small series from Small and Medium Enterprises. Magnetic measurements will be performed at our Institute. In this report we describe two types of magnets for this project. The first magnet is a C-shape fast ramped dipole, designed for a beam deflection of 15 degrees; the rise time is 100ms, the gap is 25mm with a magnetic field of 1.11 T. The second is a family of seven quadrupoles with a gradient of 20 T/m and a bore of 45mm.

The Superconducting Darmstadt Linear Accelerator S-DALINAC uses twelve Niobium Cavities with a RRR of 280 which are operated at 2 K. The operating frequency is 3 GHz; the design value of the accelerating gradient is 5 MV/m. To achieve the target value of 3 x 10˄9 for Q0, different surface preparation methods were applied and systematically tested using a vertical 2 K cryostat. A well-established technique is the so called Darmstadt Soft Chemical Polishing, which consists of an ultrasonic cleaning of the cavity with ultrapure water followed by oxidizing the inner surface with nitric acid. After rinsing with water the niobium oxide layer is removed with hydrofluoric acid in a separate second step. Finally the structure is rinsed and then dried by a nitrogen flow. Until now each cavity in operation was chemically treated with a proven record of success. In order to understand and to optimize the process on the niobium surface, systematic tests with samples were performed and analyzed using material science techniques like SEM, SIMS and EDX. We will report on the results of our research and we will give a review on our experiences with varied chemical procedures.

NICA is a new accelerator complex under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, to study properties of hot and dense baryonic matter. Magnetic system of the NICA collider includes 80 twin-aperture dipole and 86 quadrupole superconducting magnets. The collider twin-aperture magnet is 1.94 m long, 120 mm/70 mm (h/v) aperture with window-frame design similar to the Nuclotron magnet. The measurement of the magnetic field parameters is supported to be conducted for both apertures of each collider magnet. This paper describes magnetic measurements methods and the development of the dedicated system for serial dipole magnets of the NICA collider.

In recent years, it is pointed out that the maximum accelerating gradient of a superconducting RF cavity can be pushed up by coating the inner surface of cavity with a multilayer thin-film structure that consists of alternate insulator and superconductive layers. In this structure, the principal parameter that limits the performance of the cavity is the critical magnetic field or effective Hc1 at which vortices start penetrate into the first superconductor layer. We made a sample that has NbN/SiO2 thin-film structure on pure Nb substrate by DC magnetron sputtering method. In this paper, we will report the measurement results of effective Hc1 of the sample by the third-harmonic voltage method.

Quadrupoles for Thomx Facility have been carefully designed and measured due to high constraints of the storage ring. The need of a compact accelerator, 70 m2 on floor, as well as a beam life time of 20 ms, led to the following requirements for the quadrupole : a gradient of 5 T/m with 20.5 mm radius bore, harmonic content better than few 1.10-3 at the reference radius of 18 mm, no cross-talk with sextupole placed within 5 cm and a precision of the magnetic axis of 100 μm and the roll angle of 300 μrad for measurements and alignment. Total of 41 quadrupoles have been built and all measured by a rotating coil at ALBA and SOLEIL, providing multipole components, transfer function and magnetic center. Cross-check measurements have also been carried out with a versatile stretched wire from ESRF at LAL. This paper mainly describes results of simulations with OPERA and RADIA and provides the results of measurements with these three benches. These results will be compared and highlighted important points for the alignment and installation of quadrupoles in an accelerator.

HOMs in the DQW crab cavity can produce large heat loads and beam instabilities as a result of the high current HL-LHC beams. The DQW crab cavity has on-cavity, coaxial HOM couplers to damp the HOMs whilst providing a stop-band response to the fundamental mode. Manufacturing experience and further simulations give rise to a set of desirable coupler improvements. This paper will assess the performance of the current HOM coupler design, present operational improvements and propose an evolved design for HL-LHC.

Lawrence Bekerley National Laboratory (LBNL) is en-gaged in the development of magnets for the upgrade of the ALS synchrotron (ALS-U) [1]. The proposed ALS-U lattice is a 9-bend achromat reproducing the existing 12-fold symmetric ALS foot print. The ALS-U lattice requires strong focusing elements and the dipole magnet requires high gradient larger than 46 T/m. This paper presents the detailed design of the R&D dipoles under construction.

A versatile 4 MeV and 7 MeV deuteron beam transport line is being developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in support of an accelerator-driven source for fast neutron imaging. The beamline design requires precise alignment and high quality quadrupole magnets to transport a low emittance beam to the target through diagnostics, a bending dipole, and a differential pumping line with minimum beam loss and emittance growth. Vector magnetic field measurements of these magnets have been completed using a mobile version of an existing magnet mapping capability. This magnet mapping system is being used to ensure the delivered magnets meet the field uniformity specification, and that the mountings are aligned and capable of reaching the specified alignment tolerances. Details of the magnet measurement and calibration process that enable accurate field measurements to represent the intrinsic magnet field quality and not the systematic error of the measurement setup are presented.

This paper assesses the continued suitability of an existing Water Cooling System (WCS) for cooling intermediate and high-power RF power amplifiers at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). At LANSCE, the high-power and intermediate power amplifiers installed in the 70s were at end-of-life with obsolete parts and no suitable replacements available to extend their life. The LANSCE Refurbishment Project was initiated (now complete) to replace these amplifiers and to utilize already existing WCSs. Two existing WCSs were repurposed and one new WCS was designed and installed. Unscheduled, intermittent water system trips on one of the WCSs has prompted the engineering group to drill down into the original decision, build a flow model and assess some of the legacy components' suitability to solve the problem. This paper discusses the general approach, troubleshooting and solution recommendations to be made for resolution of the intermittent issues.

We present the design for a simple, variable-focus solenoidal lens with integrated emittance filtering. The design was developed as a first-iteration injection optics solution for transport of a beam from a field-emitter cathode into a dielectric laser accelerator structure. The design is easy to fabricate and, while based on permanent magnets, can readily be modified to allow for remote control of the focal length. The emittance is controlled via selection of collimating irises. The focal length can be changed by altering the spacing between two permanent ring magnets. Results from fabrication and initial testing will be presented.

LANSCE has restored the proton drift-tube linac (DTL) to high-power capability after the original RF-power tube manufacturer could no longer supply devices that consistently met our high-average power requirement. Thales TH628L Diacrodes® now supply RF power to three of the four DTL tanks. These tetrodes reused the existing infrastructure including water-cooling systems, coaxial transmission lines, high-voltage power supplies and capacitor banks. Each transmitter uses a combined pair of power amplifiers to produce up to 3- MW peak and 360- kW of mean power. A new intermediate power amplifier was simultaneously developed using a TH781 tetrode. Design and prototype testing of the high-power stages was completed in 2012, with commercialization following in 2013. Each installation was accomplished during a 4 to 5 month beam outage each year from 2014-2016. A new digital low-level RF control system was designed, built and placed into operation in 2016. The interaction of the dual power amplifiers, the I/Q LLRF, and the DTL cavities provided many challenges that were overcome. The replacement RF systems have completely met our accelerator requirements.

The MAX IV LINAC operates both as a full-energy injector for two electron storage rings, and as a driver for a Short Pulse Facility (SPF). A soft X-ray Laser (SXL) beamline will also be installed in the end of the existing LINAC. For SPF and SXL operation, it is important to characterize beam parameters such as bunch profile, slice energy spread and slice emittance. For these measurements, two 3 m long transverse deflecting RF structures with a matching section are being developed. The structures are operating at S-band and have variable polarizations. When fed via a SLED pulse compressor, the two structures can generate a total integrated deflecting voltage higher than 100 MV which is sufficient for measurements with temporal resolutions down to 1 fs. This paper describes the initial RF design of the deflecting structures.

The MAX IV 1.5 GeV ring is an electron storage ring for production of synchrotron light in the IR to soft X-ray spectral range. The ring will deliver light to its first users during 2018. Bunch-By-Bunch (BBB) feedback has been needed to suppress coupled-bunch mode instabilities (CBMIs), and the feedback has this far been provided in all three planes by a single stripline kicker. This is done by combining the horizontal and vertical baseband feedback signals with the longitudinal feedback signal that is upconverted to the 150 MHz - 250 MHz range. The combined signal is then fed to two stripline electrodes. The layout of the BBB feedback system in the MAX IV 1.5 GeV ring is presented in this paper. Results from instability studies are also discussed.

Horizontal electropolishing (HEP) is an established tech-nique for surface treatment of niobium accelerating cavi-ties. Vertical electropolishing (VEP), in which the cavity is electropolished in the vertical posture, is in R&D phase for parameter optimization. We performed HEP and VEP of a niobium single-cell coupon cavity to compare the effect of both the methods on surface state and removal at different positions of the cavity. HEP was performed at STF, KEK with the standard EP parameters. VEP was performed at Marui Galvanizing Company with a cathode called 'Ninja cathode' that can be rotated during the VEP process. The optimized cathode design and VEP parame-ters resulted in symmetric removal as obtained with the HEP technique and yielded a smooth inner surface of the entire cavity

VEP parameters and process have been already optimized with single-cell 1.3 GHz niobium cavity at Marui Galva-nizing Company working in collaboration with KEK. A unique cathode called 'Ninja cathode' with an optimized shape was applied to single-cell cavities. The cathode was effective to stop the bubble accumulation in the upper half-cell of the cavity and yielded smooth surface and uniform removal in the cell. This work shows parameter study with the Ninja cathode and a 9-cell coupon cavity which contains totally 9 coupons and viewports in the first, fifth, and ninth cells. Effects of temperature and acid flow in the cathode housing were studied using coupon currents and by observing bubbles through the viewports. The adequate parameters found with 9-cell coupon cavity were applied on a 9-cell cavity to be tested in vertical cryostat. The VEP and vertical test results are reported.

Our Nb accelerating cavity vertical electropolishing (VEP) facility development group which was led by KEK started single-cell VEP facility development from 2014. This is based on horizontal electropolishing (HEP) techniques developed by KEK over 10 years and stainless steel electropolishing techniques developed by Marui over 30 years. We have reported results of Nb cavity VEP with Ninja cathode so far. In order to achieve international linear collider (ILC) construction, it is said that cost reduction and productivity improvement are necessary, however in case of 9-cell cavity, uniform inner surface polishing is difficult, as well known to predecessors. In this article, we will present the first report of VEP facility development from initial transparent plastic mock-up to improvement for Nb 9-cell cavity.

Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing Nb cavity vertical electropolishing (VEP) technologies in collaboration with KEK. Until now, we reported that inner surface state and removal thickness distribution were improved in VEP with Ninja cathode and coupon cavity. This time, a 1.3GHz Nb single-cell cavity VEP with Ninja cathode was performed in Marui and vertical test was performed in KEK. The inner surface state and removal thickness distribution were satisfactory. And as a result of vertical test, the accelerating gradient of 32MV/m (Q0=8.0E9) was achieved.

We report a study of internal dark current generation by multipactor inside a 17 GHz single cell standing wave disk-loaded waveguide accelerator structure. The multipactor takes place on the side wall of the central cell, driven by the local rf electric and magnetic fields. Theory indicates that a resonant multipactor mode with two rf cycles can be excited near 45 MV/m gradient and a single rf cycle multipactor mode near 60 MV/m. The accelerator structure had two thin slits opened on the side wall of the central cell to directly extract and measure the internal dark current. The dark current was measured as a function of the gradient up to a gradient of 70 MV/m. The experimental results agreed well with theory, showing the two predicted multipactor modes. To further study the effect of the central cell side wall surface properties on the structure performance, we prepared and tested a second structure with the central cell side wall coated with a layer of diamond-like carbon. The comparison of the results showed that the coating reduced the internal dark current and thus enhanced the structure performance considerably.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is developing a 5-cell 644 MHz βopt=0.65 elliptical cavity for a future linac energy upgrade to 400 MeV/u for the heaviest uranium ions. Superconducting elliptical cavities operated in continuous wave, such as the ones for FRIB, are prone to microphonics which can excite mechanical modes of the cavities. It has been shown that the detuning due to microphonics can be mitigated with the use of piezo actuators (fast tuner) as opposed to the costly option of increasing the input RF power. The FRIB slow/fast dynamic tuner will be based on the Fermilab experience with similar tuners like those developed for the linac coherent light source (LCLS) II and proton improvement plan (PIP) II. This paper will present the results of tuner properties on the bench.

The superconducting (SC) linac of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) under construction will deliver 200 MeV/u, 400 kW beam to the target for producing rare isotopes at Michigan State of University (MSU). For further beam energy upgrade, we have designed the β = 0.65, 5 cells, 644 MHz elliptical cavity. The beam energy can be upgraded to 400 MeV/u by installing 11 cryomodules to the available space in the FRIB tunnel.

High gradient superconducting cavities (SRF) will be needed for future accelerators. The higher gradient can achieve the high energy with fewer cavities. However the accelerating field of niobium cavities is limited by the peak magnetic field on the cavity surface. Cavities coated with Nb3Sn have a significantly larger Hc2 allowing the cavity to achieve a larger gradient. Measurements of Nb3Sn coated cavities have achieved about half the theoretical predicted gradient. It is possible to improve Nb3Sn plated cavity performance.

State-of-the-art Nb3Sn wires have plateaued in the performance of the critical current density Jc. Chemical and geometrical optimization of the wire layout have produced Nb3Sn wires with average Jc(4.2K, 16T) ~ 1,300 A/mm2. A future high energy hadron collider that is being considered to follow the LHC would need larger Jc and be cost effective. The approach to improving the performance of Nb3Sn conductor would be to introduce enhanced flux pinning mechanisms with nano-engineering techniques.

A simplified analytical model based on the charge drift approximation has been developed. It considers the resonant interaction of the synchronous wave with the flow of Larmor electrons in a magnetron. The model predicts stable coherent generation of the tube above and below the threshold of self-excitation. This occurs if the magnetron is driven by a sufficient resonant injected signal (up to -10 dB). The model substantiates precise stability, high efficiency and low noise at the range of the magnetron power control over 10 dB by variation of the magnetron current. The model and the verifying experiments with 2.45 GHz, 1 kW magnetrons are discussed.

State of the art high-current superconducting accelerators require efficient RF sources with a fast dynamic phase and power control. This allows for compensation of the phase and amplitude deviations of the accelerating volt-age in the Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities caused by microphonics, etc. Efficient magnetron transmitters with fast phase and power control are attractive RF sources for this application. They are more cost effective than traditional RF sources such as klystrons, IOTs and solid-state amplifiers used with large scale accelerator projects. However, unlike traditional RF sources, controlled magnetrons operate as forced oscillators. Study of the impact of the controlling signal on magnetron stability, noise and efficiency is therefore important. This paper discusses experiments with 2.45 GHz, 1 kW tubes and verifies our analytical model which is based on the charge drift approximation.

The ceramic materials used in the beam pipe for super-conducting RF accelerators have the problem of charging due to the electron cloud and secondary electron emission. A novel solution is in the application of conductive nanoparticles to the lossy ceramic. The lossy ceramic is pre-processed to provide for pores that will accept the conductive nanoparticles and then coated with a thin film to prevent the nanoparticles from entering the environment. The same process was also done with sub-micron carbon particles. Measurements of surface conductivity with and without a vacuum compatible sealant are reported on along with microwave measurements.

The LUCRECE project aims at developing an elementary RF system (cavity, power source, LLRF and controls) suitable for continuous (CW) operation at 1.3 GHz. This effort is made in the framework of the advanced and compact FEL project LUNEX5 (free electron Laser Using a New accelerator for the Exploitation of X-ray radiation of 5th generation), using superconducting linac technology for high repetition rate and multi-user operation (www.lunex5.com). In this context, based on its large experience on coupler design and RF conditioning, LAL Laboratory is in charge of the design and the fabrication of RF couplers that could operate at up to 15-20 kW in CW mode. For this purpose, geometry based on CORNELL 65kW CW couplers will me modified to fulfil the LCLS2 type cavity with the high necessary coupling level. Electromagnetic simulations and optimisation and associated thermal heating will be discussed. Methods to decrease the thermal impact, and strategy for RF conditioning will be considered.

A novel injection-locked 1497 MHz 13 kW AM magnetron design is presented. The anode design to minimized eddy currents due to the changing magnetic field is presented. Thermal calculations of two design options are also presented. An extra degree of freedom in the anode construction is made possible by the fact that the magnetron is injection locked. This fact presents some additional design details that can be utilized in the cooling network for the magnetron anode.

Permanent magnets made of rare earth elements alloys allow to develop compact dipole magnets for the applied electron accelerator. These devices can be used for the beam trajectory bending as well as for the beam characteristics measurements. For NSC KIPT linear accelerator «EPOS» a dipole magnet on the base of Nd-Fe-B alloy has been designed and developed. The magnet provides 90 degrees bend of 23 MeV electron beam. The design value of magnetic field at the beam design trajectory is 0.5 Т. The magnet effective length is 242 mm. The magnet temperature can be changed with thermos-stabilization system. For NSC KIPT 10 MeV LU-10 applied accelerator a dipole magnet of Sm2Co17 alloy has been manufactured. The maximum magnet field of the magnet is 0.3 Т. The magnet layout allows easy magnet assembling at the accelerator chamber. The magnet is used for the beam energy measurement and accelerator beam energy turning. After energy turning the magnet should be removed from the accelerator lattice.

Magnets of applied electron accelerators are under direct effect of electrons and bremsstrahlung radiation stipulated by the electron beam. The choice of the materials for the rare elements alloy accelerator magnets has the decisive importance for the long term magnet parameters keeping. The experimental studies of the magnetic fields around the Nd-Fe-B and Sm2Co17 alloy magnets under effect of the electron beam have been done. The samples of 30х24х12 mm geometrical sizes were bombarded by electron beam of applied NSC KIPT accelerator KUT-1 with electron energy of 10 MeV and were irradiated by correspondent bremsstrahlung. The magnetic field value around Nd-Fe-B alloy samples was decreased nonlineary under electron beam bombarding with change of irradiation doze from 16 to 160 GRad. Under effect of bremsstrahlung the magnetic field value around samples was not changed. The repeated sample magnetizations allowed to restore the initial magnetic field distribution around magnets. The magnetic field distribution around Sm2Co17 alloy samples was not changed under effect of the electron beam and bremsstrahlung within irradiation dozes mentioned above. The induced activity in the Nd-Fe-B and Sm2Co17 alloy samples was changed slightly during the experiments.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a modern 3 GeV low emittance light source with RMS bunch lengths of about 3 mm at a beam current of 500 mA and operating gap voltage of 3.2 MV. With a higher harmonic cavity, we could increase the Touschek lifetime and lower the heat load of in-vacuum undulators by lengthening the bunch lengths. Preliminary studies show that for full and uni-form fill patterns, the bunch lengths could be increased by a factor of four. However, this calculation ignores phase transient effects and may overestimate the effect of harmonic cavities. A multi-bunch, multi-particle tracking method has been developed to determine the bunch lengths for non-uniform fill patterns, which also takes phase transient effects into account and the expected maximum bunch lengthening factor for different TPS operation conditions are discussed.

In this paper, we discuss an energy-savings control sys-tem for the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) booster RF sys-tem. During top-up storage ring operation, a timing con-trol is activated to reduce the booster RF transmitter en-ergy consumption when no injection is required. When-ever injection into the TPS storage ring is needed, the booster RF transmitter is immediately adjusted to operat-ing conditions. This timing-control system will save an energy of 380, 000 kWh annually.

After an actual operation of the phase-shifted magnet's power supply was conducted, it was found that the currents in the two modules of magnets would be coupled each other. In order to solve this mutual coupling current, a decoupling controller is designed. From the experiment results indicate that it does not only solve the issue of coupling current but also shorten the rising time of the power supply current. This helps to increase the power supply bandwidth.

Since December 31th 2014, the first synchrotron light from Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) was stored in the storage ring, the challenge to operate both Taiwan Light Source (TLS) and TPS smoothly and reliably became a significant issue for all members in NSRRC. On the one hand, the beam quality of former TLS must not been impaired due to the occupied resources by TPS, on the other hand, the most efforts were devoted to achieving steady operation of TPS. In order to operate both ring stably, some mutual backup structures were designed in the compressed air system and the chilled water system between TLS and TPS. The primary advantage of these mutual backup systems is minimizing the risk of beam-trip while any one of the utility system fails. Secondly, the mutual backup structures provide more flexible usage to accomplish energy conservation. From both risk-reduction and energy conservation points of view, the backup systems will do a great deal of good in the future.

The vibration status is a critical problem for the utility system, especially for those continuously operate deionized and cooling water pumps used in synchrotron accelerator. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the vibration level and spectrum condition for TPS water pump systems. In order to predictive maintenance before pump systems fail, the vibration monitoring system was constructed. After vibration test for several months, the alignment of some of the ice water pumps were found mismatched because of poor system positioning and operate continuously. Besides, the ice water pump were redundantly operated and switch over every Monday morning. The recorded data showed the system sometimes switch fail because of control status or system stability. Thus, the water pump systems were repaired and maintained base on vibration monitoring system. There is still some remain problems for ice water pump systems. The utility systems could prevent malfunction through regular vibration inspection and daily data acquisition.

In-vacuum undulators with a small gap and short period have been applied in synchrotron accelerators for hard X-rays users for years. However, beam-induced heat load resulted from synchrotron radiation or the image current will not only degrade the performance of undulator but damage the magnet foil. It is difficult to quantitatively study heat transfer phenomenon of the magnet foil through physical experiment. In this study, finite element analysis was applied to study the effect of beam-induced heat load on an in-vacuum undulator.

The high power klystron is a radio frequency amplifier for TLS linac operation. It is a crucial device for electron acceleration in linac. How to evaluate its efficiency, lifetime and performance of klystron in operation is one of the major concern in this report. The key klystron parameter perveance is introduced and used for performance evaluation and operation status monitoring. It is important to execute periodic monitoring on perveance for ensuring a stable linac operation. Klystron characteristics diagnostics can be achieved through perveance measurement. A couple of klystron diagnostic parameters concerning perveance are explored for field examination purpose. Perveance comparison with factory acceptance test data is also presented.

In this paper we describe the modifications of power supplies needed to operate the storage ring with a low momentum compaction factor (low alpha) to generate short x-ray pulses. This design includes an external polarity reversal circuit in quadrupole and sextupole magnet power supplies. The polarity reversal circuit contains four relay module where each relay can receive signals from the D-type analog interface. The power supply control system must be enhanced to switch output polarity. The operating principle and analyses of polarity reversal are discussed in more detail. Finally, a prototype polarity reversal circuit with 30 V, 250 A and 7.5 kW output power is implemented in the laboratory to verify the expected performance for the TPS low alpha operation.

In this study, a high step down DC-DC converter was successfully integrated using switch capacitor and isolated transformer techniques. Switching capacitor techniques has use of capacitor parallel energy storage and series release of the way to improve the voltage conversion ratio. In addition, the output voltage ripple will be smaller due to the input current being continuous, the inductance is an element to prevent a surge current. The isolated transformer techniques has use of inductor coil turns ratio to achieve high conversion ratio. But, the leakage inductor and parasitic capacitance on the power switch will be resonant to generate a surge voltage spike when the power switch S is turned off. So that, additional a passive clamp circuit, energy of leakage inductor will be recycled to clamp capacitor and voltage stress of main power switch. The power switch S can be selected a lower Rds(on) components and reduce the conduction losses to improve power converter efficiency. Step down mode operation principle and steady-state analysis were discussed in this paper. Finally, simulation and prototype circuit is implemented in this laboratory to verify the performance, the step-down DC-DC converter is input voltage 400-V, output voltage 48-V and output power 960-W.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is currently operated in top-up mode for users. In order to improve the stability of the synchrotron light source, vibrations related to the vacuum system have been investigated and improved by turning off pumping systems and reducing the flow rate in chamber cooling water circuits. In this paper, vibrations in different vacuum chambers with normal cooling water condition were investigated, their sources were recorded and clarified and properties of different materials for water tubes were also compared.

The future light source with ultra-low emittance, typically < 500 pm rad, requests the beam duct with inner aperture < 20 mm for the electron storage ring. Besides, the cross section of the beam duct must be kept smooth for lowering the impedance. The aluminum extruded beam duct of 10 mm inside and 1 ~ 2 m in length was developed for this purpose. The beam duct was machined in ethanol to obtain a clean surface for a lower thermal outgassing rate. To mitigate the impedance of the flange connection, a special designed diamond-edge gasket and the aluminum flange without knife edge were developed. The inner diameters of both flange and gasket, 10 mm, are the same as that of beam duct. The sealing of the gasket has been proved leak-tight. The ultimate pressure and the thermal outgassing rate of the beam duct has achieved < 2.0·10-10 Torr and < 1.4·10-13 Torr l/(s cm2), respectively after baking. Those results fulfill both the ultrahigh vacuum and lowest impedance are applicable for the next generation ultra-low emittance light source.

Aluminium vacuum chambers cleaned with ozonated water show a reduction of residual carbon and lower surface outgassing rate after baking. We would like to investigate if stainless steel chambers show similar ef-fects. A stainless steel test chamber was cleaned by stand-ard chemical cleaning only and then compared with an-other one after immersion in 30ppm ozonated water for thirty minutes. Both samples were baked, then photon exposed and the photon desorption yields were deter-mined by vacuum gauges and residual gas analysers at the TLS 19B beamline. The test results on photon stimulated desorption yields and partial pressure variations with and without ozonated water cleaning of the stainless steel tubes will be discussed in some detail.

Since the TPS is capable to operate at higher currents, long-term 400mA conditioning runs were conducted. Current-dependent temperature data of BPMs were collected and analysed for both, aluminium and stainless steel BPM chambers. To better understand beam coupling effects in different types of TPS BPMs, electromagnetic and thermal simulation models were established. In this paper, we discuss associated results of such studies.

Klystrons and IOTs are widely used or proposed to be used in accelerators as high-power RF sources. Development and optimization of klystron and IOT designs is aided by the use of different simulation tools, including highly efficient large-signal codes. We present an overview of the advances in the code development and modeling using Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) set of TESLA-family of large-signal codes, suitable for the modeling of single-beam and multiple beam klystrons and IOTs. Original 2D large-signal algorithm of the code TESLA* was developed for the modeling of klystrons based on (relatively) high Q resonators and is applicable to the multiple-beam devices in an approximation of identical beams/beam-tunnels. Parallel extension of TESLA algorithm (code TESLA-MB**) enabled an accurate, quasi-3D modeling of multiple-beam devices with non-identical beams/beam-tunnels. Recently developed more general TESLA-Z algorithm*** is based on the impedance matrix approach and enabled geometry-driven large-signal modeling. Examples of applications of TESLA-family of codes to the modeling of advanced single-beam and multiple-beam klystrons (and IOTs) will be presented.

A cryogenic C-band photocathode RF electron gun cavity has been studied at Nihon University LEBRA in cooperation with KEK. The RF properties of a cold model measured at 20 K have shown good agreement with those expected from computer simulations using the cavity surface resistance predicted by the theory of the anomalous skin effect. Recent studies on the vacuum RF breakdown at high electric fields suggest that the temperature in the cavity surface during the high power RF pulse has a significant effect on the behavior of the breakdown rate. In order to investigate the breakdown property of the cryogenic cavity aiming at a very high accelerating field with as low breakdown rate as possible, one-dimensional simulations of the temperature rise in the cavity surface have been done for various combinations of the RF pulse width and the peak input RF power. The evaluation will be taken into consideration in the design of a new high power cryogenic cavity that has basically the same configuration with the cold model.

The new 20 kA, 80 V power supply for the main magnet of the 520 MeV H− Cyclotron at TRIUMF was awarded to OCEM. It has replaced the original system (commissioned in 1976) based on a series pass regulator. The final acceptance tests have demonstrated the com-pliance with the project specifications, especially for the high current stability required for the Cyclotron operation. The current stability is ±5 ppm, including current ripple, for a period of more than 8 hours of continuous operation. In addition, the magnetic field can be further stabilized us-ing feedback of a flux loop signal. OCEM designed the power supply to use the third gen-eration of Function Generator/Controller (FGC3) control electronics from CERN. This was chosen to obtain the high current stability required by TRIUMF. This collaboration was facilitated through a Knowledge Transfer agreement between CERN and OCEM. The power supply commis-sioning has been performed as a collaboration between OCEM, TRIUMF and CERN. This paper describes the topology of the power supply, the control electronics, the high-precision current measure-ment system and the associated software as well as the commissioning results carried out with the magnet.

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) employs tapered ridge waveguide iris couplers to power six drift tube linac (DTL) cavity structures with pulsed RF systems using 2.5MW klystrons at 402.5MHz. All DTL iris couplers have been operating continuously for more than a decade without replacement. Transferring high RF energy to the cavities requires robust RF and mechanical performances with respect to power dissipation, electrical breakdown, and vacuum pressure. Considering the upcoming full 1.4MW operation and the future proton power upgrade (PPU) project, the structural design and the material selection needed to be reviewed for potential spare manufacturing. The existing design and the modified design with improvements to the coupler have been numerically studied. For the study, 3D models were used for RF and structural characterizations of the waveguide iris couplers on the DTL cavity. RF and thermo-mechanical co-simulations were performed to assess the effects of using the different materials and the structural modification.

Recent success of laser-assisted charge exchange for 10 μs duration Hydrogen ion beams at SNS motivates laser development necessary for efficient stripping of 1.0 ms duration beam at full duty cycle. To overcome the laser power challenge, the interaction point was chosen inside an optical cavity. A doubly-resonant enhancement cavity and a novel locking technique have been developed, and a coherent enhancement of 402.5 MHz, 50 ps, 1.05 MW peak power ultraviolet (355 nm) laser pulses operating at 10-μs/10-Hz burst mode has been demonstrated. This will enable 1.0 ms duration laser macropulses at 60 Hz to be stored inside such a cavity to achieve efficient stripping at SNS.

Work function and surface chemistries of SiC-polished, electropolished, and nitrogen-doped niobium coupons were analyzed before and after plasma processing using a neon-oxygen gas mixture. These studies represent an initial enquiry into the feasibility of applying the plasma processing technique designed at ORNL for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) to the nitrogen-doped Nb cavities for the Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II). Work function of all measured samples was increased after plasma processing, which indicates the strong potential of the plasma processing technique as a tool for increasing the accelerating gradient of nitrogen-doped cavities.

LHC High Luminosity Upgrade will be developing two local crabbing systems to increase the luminosity of the colliding bunches at the ATLAS and CMS experiments. One of the crabbing systems uses the rf-dipole cavity design that will be crabbing the beam in the horizontal plane. The fully integrated crabbing cavity has two higher order mode couplers in damping those excited modes. Currently two sets of HOM couplers have been fabricated at Jefferson Lab for prototyping and testing with the LARP crabbing cavities. This paper presents the measurements of the higher order modes with the prototype HOM couplers carried out at room temperature.

A collaboration between DESY, PSI and CERN has been established to develop and build an advanced modular X-band transverse deflection structure (TDS) system with the new feature of providing variable polarization of the deflecting force. This innovative CERN design requires very high manufacturing precision to guarantee highest azimuthal symmetry of the structure to avoid the deterioration of the polarization of the streaking field. Therefore, the high-precision tuning-free production process developed at PSI for the C-band and X-band accelerating structures will be used for the manufacturing. We summarize in this paper the status of the production of the prototype and the waveguide networks foreseen in the different facilities.

As a windowless vacuum device, the 10 mm diameter 60 mm long plasma window designed by Peking University only achieved to separate 28.8 kPa from 360 Pa experimentally with 50 A direct current and 2.5 kW power. Based on our 10 mm diameter plasma window, we have proposed a cascaded plasma window to achieve the isolation of atmosphere and high vacuum. In this paper, a numerical 2D FLUENT-based magneto-hydrodynamic simulation on 10 mm diameter cascaded plasma window was developed. The gas inlet, arc creation and plasma expansion segments are all contained in this model. A set of parameters including pressure, temperature, velocity and current distribution were obtained and analysed. In our first simulation, the isolation of 100 kPa and 50 Pa pressure has been realised, and some interesting phenomena occurred.

CIFNEF(Compact Intense Fast NEutron Facility) project will accelerate and deliver a 5 MeV deuteron beam to the targets to produce high-intense neutrons. A 2.5 MHz pulsed deuteron beam with bunch width within 2 ns is needed on the targets at last. To fulfill the special requirements of the beam dynamics, two types of bunchers are adopted in the CIFNEF. One is a 10.156 MHz buncher used in the low energy beam transport (LEBT) line to longitudinally focus the 50 keV deuteron beam to the RFQ longitudinal acceptance with 4 kV effective voltage. A lumped element model is adopted because of the low frequency and it consists of an inductance coil in parallel with the capacitance of drift tube. The other one is an 81.25 MHz buncher used in the high energy beam transport (HEBT) line to longitudinally focus the 5 MeV deuteron beam to 2 ns. A QWR cavity with 2-gaps is used to provide 150 kV effective voltage. Thermal and structural analyses have been carried out on these two bunchers. Details of simulations of these two bunchers are presented and discussed in this paper.

The Compact Laser Plasma Accelerator (CLAPA) has been built recently at Peking University, which composed of a 200TW laser acceleration platform and a beam line system. Proton with energy spread of <1%, up to 10 pC charge and different energies below 10 MeV have been produced and transported to the irradiation platform. Emittance is a critical parameter for beam transportation. The preliminary emittance measurement has been per-formed for CLAPA's proton beams using the quadrupole scan technique (QST). In the experiment, the focal spot size of the proton beam was changed by scanning the current of a quadrupole triplet magnet. The result shows that the normalized emittance is smaller than 0.01 mm·mrad for 5 MeV laser driven protons, which is on the same level of the previously reported work.

JLab upgrade program foresees new CW amplifiers operating at 1497 MHz and significantly increased efficiency vs. existing VKL-7811 klystron. One of possibilities for the replacement is usage of high electron mobility packaged GaN transistors applied in array of highly efficient amplifiers using precise in-phase, low-loss combiners-dividers. We present here performance of novel, compact 300 W pallets developed at MicroSemi specifically for this project including their new GaN transistor, as well as significantly upgraded divider and combiner. Design features and challenges related to amplifier modules (pallets), broadband 21-way dividers/combiners, as well construction and assembling of the entire system are discussed including measurements.

Currently, in the electron linac ELBE there is a single beam line. Therefore, at any given time only single user can use the beam. Moreover, as different user experiments require distinct beam intensity settings, not all the experiments fully utilize the 13 MHz CW beam capability of the facility. To utilize the full beam capacity, multiple beam lines can be established by using an array of transverse deflecting structures. For that, an RF cavity was the design choice due to its inherent advantages with respect to repeatability of the kick voltage amplitude and phase, and the possibility of CW operation in the MHz range. Potential design candidates are the CEBAF RF separator, the three proposed crab cavities for the HL-LHC upgrade project, and a novel NC deflecting cavity design. In this comparative study, the figures of merit of the cavities are computed from electromagnetic field simulations for a transverse voltage of 300 kV. This comparative study supported our selection of the deflecting cavity design for ELBE.

Experimental Methods for the Assessment of NEG Pumps Working in Dust-Sensitive Environments

NEG pumps have been widely adopted by many accelerator facilities since decades. However, their use in dust-sensitive areas - such as superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities - has always been limited by concerns about accidental dust emission, which could induce detrimental field emission. As future machines will necessarily rely on highly-efficient SRF cavities, able to supply very high accelerating gradients, requirements in terms of particle release from vacuum components (e.g., pumps and valves) are becoming more and more stringent. At the same time, achieving stable ultra-high vacuum conditions is crucial, as condensed residual gas might also be a potential source of field emission. At present, a unified standard procedure to assess dust generation and propagation along a machine is still missing and discussions are ongoing in the vacuum community. Recent experimental measurements demonstrated the compatibility of sintered NEG pumps with ultra-clean environments, due to their intrinsic very low dust release. In parallel, in-situ tests performed at different accelerator facilities showed absence of dust contamination from NEGs and no impact on cavities efficiency.

A new in-vacuum Lambertson septum magnet is being designed for the SPEAR3 storage ring, intended to replace the existing septum to allow injection into a new lower emittance operation mode for SPEAR3. The new septum design is constrained to fit in the same length and have the same bend angle as the existing injection septum, so as to minimize changes to surrounding storage ring and transfer line components, while also meeting stringent requirements on the stored beam leakage field. This has led to a design using Vanadium Permendur alloy for the septum pole pieces, with shaping of the inner profile of the stored beam channel to minimize the leakage fields indicated in 2D and 3D magnetic simulations.

Development of SRF accelerator technology that enables both higher gradient and higher efficiency is crucial for future machines. While much of the recent R&D focus has been on materials and surface science, our aim is to optimize the cavity geometry to maximize performance with current materials. The recent demonstration of a highly efficient parallel-feed NCRF structure at SLAC has served as a proof-of-concept. Applied to SRF, such a structure could dramatically reduce power consumption while boosting the achievable gradient. Instead of coupled elliptical cells, our structure employs isolated reentrant cells. To feed RF power to the cavities, each cell is directly coupled to an integrated manifold. The structure is made in two parts, split along the beam axis, which are then joined. Such a structure has been fabricated from bulk Cu and tested at SLAC - designed for X-band, it operates at a record gradient of 150 MV/m. Adapting to SRF at 1.3 GHz and fabricating from Nb, such a cavity could achieve more than 50% lower RF loss and 40% higher gradient compared to the TESLA cavity. We will describe our simulations and propose an experimental roadmap for demonstrating this technology.

In order to reduce the energy spread and to be able to use a 200 keV spin-polarized electron source, the initial part of the injector linac of the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC needs to be upgraded. The decisions on the cavity type, number of cells and value of geometric beta are motivated. The main part of this work is dedicated to the mechanical design of the cavity. A precise evaluation of the mechanical characteristics of an SRF cavity is necessary during the design stage. The dependence of the resonant frequency of the fundamental mode on external mechanical loads needs to be investigated for developing the tuning procedures. The results of the multiphysics simulations and of the optimization of the mechanical design are presented.

An ultra-high-speed short pulse switch for high power have been developed by using SIC - MOSFET which is one of next generation semiconductors. Semiconductor switches using SIC-MOSFETs are expected to replace the thyratron, and they are composed of circuits in which many semiconductor switches are multiplexed in series and parallel for high power. Semiconductor switches using SIC-MOSFETs are expected to replace the thyratron, and they are also designed by connecting many semiconductor switches in parallel-series. To realize a low switching noise, it is common to form a symmetrical circuit. However, as the number of parallel connections increases, the circuit length between input and output becomes longer, so the output waveform is distorted due to any timing jitter or level fluctuation. Therefore, we propose a radially symmetric type of a module switch which does not cause level fluctuation due to the timing jitter by equalizing the circuit length independently of the number of semiconductor switches. The design and preliminary test results of two types of switch circuits, radially symmetric type and line symmetric type are presented here.

The CLARA FEL at Daresbury Laboratory will employ four S-band linacs to accelerate electron bunches to 250 MeV/c. In order to compress the bunch sufficiently to achieve peak currents suitable for FEL lasing, one must compensate for curvature imprinted on the longitudinal phase space of the bunch. For CLARA a harmonic RF linearization system has been designed to achieve this requirement. The linearization will be achieved by an X-band travelling wave cavity of the PSI/CERN design, which incorporates wake-field monitoring of the bunch position. A five-axis mover will align the cavity to the beam axis. Pulse compression of a 6 MW klystron pulse will provide the required power to achieve a 30 MV/m operational gradient.

The CLARA accelerator at Daresbury Laboratory will have 8 normal conducting RF cavities. Automating the high power RF conditioning of these cavities will mean a repeatable, research-lead process is followed. An auto-mated algorithm has been written in Python. A prototype algorithm was used to condition the first CLARA travel-ling wave linac in October 2017. The linac was success-fully conditioned over approximately 12 million pulses up to 27 MW for a 750 ns pulse. A more complex and robust algorithm was used to re-condition the standing wave 10 Hz photoinjector after a cathode change. The photoinjec-tor was conditioned to 10 MW for a 2.5 μs pulse in Feb-ruary 2018 over 2.1 million pulses. Conditioning method; differences for travelling and standing wave structures; difficulties and interesting phenomena are all discussed.

As part of an ongoing programme of SRF Thin Films development, a radiofrequency (RF) cavity and cryostat dedicated to the measurement of superconducting coatings at GHz frequencies was designed to evaluate surface resistive losses on a flat sample. The resonator has now been used for measurements on Thin Film samples. Results from a test on a sample previously tested at Cornell University are presented. In order to simplify the measurements and achieve a faster turnaround, the experiment will be moved to a new cryostat fitted with a cryocooler. This will limit the measurements to low power only, but will allow a much faster sorting of samples to identify those that would benefit from further investigation. A description of the system and initial results will be presented.

An ongoing study on the superconducting thin films for future superconducting RF cavities requires an intense testing of various superconducting properties. We have designed, built and tested a new facility for complex superconducting thin film testing that includes: (1) RRR measurement with and without magnetic field, (2) planar and (3) tubular magnetic field penetration experiments, (4) a superconducting coaxial resonator for bulk niobium and superconducting thin film characterisation. The system is based on a closed cycle refrigerator, eliminating the need for liquid helium, thus making it simple and safe to operate. The details of the design and commissioning will be presented at the conference.

The pumping properties of the NEG coated vacuum chambers play an important role in the efficiency of vac-uum system of accelerators. The sticking probability of the NEG films is one the most important parameters to characterise the pumping properties of the NEG coated vacuum chambers. In order to investigate the NEG film sticking probability, Test Particle Monte-Carlo (TPMC) models were used. The models were based on the design of the installed experimental setup in ASTeC Vacuum Science group laboratory at Daresbury Laboratory (DL). The results of the simulations have been used for inter-preting the results of the measurements in the experi-mental setup.

The photoinjector of the CLARA FEL test facility Front End at Daresbury Laboratory is based on a S-band 10 Hz photocathode RF-gun operating with a copper photocath-ode which is driven by the third harmonic of a Ti:Sapphire laser (266 nm). The main aim of this study was to establish a procedure to prepare the Cu surface prior to installation so a Quantum Efficiency (QE) of 10-5 or higher can be achieved at laser power density below the ablation threshold of copper. The best results have been obtained by ex-situ chemical cleaning. This removed the surface oxide layer whilst at the same time producing a surface buffer layer. This inhibited the regrowth of native oxide for up to a week when exposed to normal ambient atmospheric conditions. With either chemical cleaning or Ar plasma cleaning after heating the sample in-situ to 150 °C for 90 minutes or 250 °C for 40 hours, almost all of the surface oxide was removed. For these surfaces a QE of 4.10-5 or better was measured. Oxygen plasma cleaning at 100% and 20% power produced CuO layer with surface carbon contaminant to 3 atomic %, however in-situ thermal cycling resulted in at best a QE of 3·10-6.

Non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating has been used for years in many particle accelerator facilities due to its evenly distributed pumping speed, low thermal outgassing, and low photon and electron stimulated desorption yields. We have previously demonstrated that quaternary Ti-Zr-Hf-V coating deposited from an alloy wire has the lowest desorption yields, the highest sticking probability and sorption capacity. In this work, we explore the single element targets which are widely available and can be produced in a form of a wire that is easy to apply for a uniform coating of various shapes of vacuum chamber. Single metal Zr coatings have been tested to find a more efficient and cheaper way of producing the NEG-coated vacuum chambers. Two samples coated with Zr of dense and columnar structure were analysed and results of the pumping properties are reported. The results show that pure Zr coating could be an economic solution, despite not being as effective as can be achieved with quaternary NEG film. It shows that columnar Zr coating can be activated and reaches full pumping capacity at 160°C. This is close to the activation temperature of Ti-Zr-Hf-V and lower than that for the widely used ternary Ti-Zr-V alloy.

Shanghai soft X-ray Free Electron Lasers (SXFEL) first uses C band accelerator structure to accelerate electrons at SINAP. SXFEL is an X-ray free electron laser facility, which requests very stable amplitude stability and very tight tolerances of phase jitter. 50MW C-band klystron and 110MW modulator is used to provide power supply for accelerator structure. Typical specifications of the modulator are peak beam voltage 350KV, peak beam current 320A, 10Hz repetition rate, 3us flat-top pulse width. In order to meet these demands, we developed a reliable and stable high power pulse transformer. In this paper, the analysis and design of high power pulse transformer for C band klystron modulator are presented. The methods of shortening rise time, diminishing droop and diminishing flat top oscillation are highlighted. Detailed design, simulation and relevant experimental results are given. The relevant experiments show that this pulse transformer can meet the requirement of 50MW C band klystron.

Two cryogenic permanent magnet undulators (CPMU) have been developed and assembled into storage ring at SSRF，in order to reach larger magnetic field and to produce higher brilliance in the hard X rays domain. Lowering the temperature of permanent magnets increases the magnetic produced field about by 15%. A set of magnetic measurement system and a suitable magnetic field optimization method have been developed. The design of a magnetic measurement bench based on a Hall probe to perform low temperature measurement has been finished. In addition, a 50-period superconducting undulator prototype with 16mm period length is also being developed for more photons with some specific photon characteristic. And a special hall probe system has been built in order to characterize the magnetic field distribution of the SCU prototype.

Superconducting thin film is the promising technology to increase the performance of SRF cavities. The lower critical field Hc1, which is one of the important physical parameters characterizing a superconducting material, will be enhanced by coating Nb with thin film superconductor such as NbN. To investigate the performance of thin film, we developed the Hc1 measurement system using the third harmonic response of applied AC magnetic field. The measurement system consists of helium cryostat with two of GM refrigerators, sample Cu stage, solenoid coil Cu mount, solenoid coil, temperature sensors, and liquid helium level meter. AC magnetic field is produced by a coil which is driven by function generator and power amplifier at around 1 kHz. In order to control the temperature of the sample stage and coil mount, the depth of thermal anchors attached to the stage and the mount can be moved by the motor. By this temperature control the sample state can be easily transferred from Meissner state to mixed state. So that the measurement is repeated for various applied magnetic field, and the transition curve can be made. In this report, performance of the measurement system is described.

Solaris, a 1.5 GeV third generation synchrotron light source, was commissioned in 2016 April and is currently operated in decay mode. Two beamlines PEEM/XAS and UARPES were installed and now are being commis-sioned. Three more PHELIX, XMCD and diagnostic beamlines have received funding and will be installed and commissioned in next few years. With total accumu-lated beam dose near to 690 A.h and three orders of mag-nitude reduction of outgassing the design goal of 500 mA beam current and electron energy of 1.5 GeV has been achieved. As the beam current was increased, a few vacu-um problems were encountered, including vacuum leaks in RF and arc sectors and unexpected pressure bursts near photon absorbers. Lessons learned and operational expe-rience will be presented and discussed in this paper.

The SOLARIS 1.5 GeV storage ring is equipped with two 100 MHz active cavities and two 3rd harmonic passive cavities. They are in operation since 2015. For control of their respective working points, knowledge about cavity voltage and higher order mode (HOM) frequency spec-trum is mandatory. After their installation in the storage ring and connection of the RF feeder to a high power isolator and a transmitter, the influence of the external elements on the quality factor and the HOM spectrum should be verified with respect to simulations of a simpli-fied model of a stand-alone cavity. This paper will pre-sent results of in-situ cavity measurements to qualify the HOM placement and their quality factor. HOM meas-urements have been performed in the range 100 MHz to 1.3 GHz for active cavities and 300 MHz to 1.5 GHz for 3rd harmonic cavities at three different temperatures under ultra-high vacuum conditions for each cavity separately. The measurement and analysis methodology will also be presented

For the high-power RF test of the coaxial couplers which will be employed on the linac injector of the XiPAF (Xi'an Proton Application Facility) project, a high-power conditioning cavity was designed and manufactured [1]. There are some optimized aspects on the cavity and couplers to obtain better RF performance during the high-power testing process. The traveling-wave test and full-power-reflection test were executed to check whether the coupler can afford the enough power level for the linac operation, and whether only one coupler can afford the total power for the RFQ. The construction of the testing stand, optimization of RF parameters and results of high-power RF test are presented in this paper.

An analytical model of the helical RF resonator for the single charged 250 keV nitrogen ion implanter operating in CW was developed. The analytical model allowed to determine the geometry of the accelerating structure and to construct CST Microwave Studio and ANSYS HFSS models based on this analytical model. Results obtained from the analytical model and simulations were within 5% of each other. The experimental investigation of the accelerating section confirmed that the models are correct. The accelerating section was tuned and verified for the right accelerating field distribution and operating frequency. Finally, the section was successfully tested in 2 kW CW RF power.

The RF System of 520-MeV Cyclotron is operating at 23 MHz with 1 MW CW RF power. The RF dummy load is required to troubleshoot and tune the RF amplifier. The RF system is being constantly improved and the future goal is to increase cyclotron's beam current up to 400 μA, which requires increasing the RF amplifier's power. As a part of this goal, a new RF dummy load was designed.

Pure, intense rare isotope beams at a wide range of energies are crucial to the nuclear science programs at TRIUMF. The CANREB project will deliver a high resolution spectrometer (HRS) for beam purification, and a charge breeding system consisting of a radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) beam cooler and buncher, an electron beam ion source (EBIS), and a Nier-type spectrometer to prepare the beam for post-acceleration. Bunching the beam prior to charge breeding will significantly enhance the efficiency of the EBIS. The RFQ buncher will accept continuous §I{60}{keV} rare isotope beams from the ARIEL or ISAC production targets and efficiently deliver low emittance bunched beams. A pulsed drift tube (PDT) will adjust the energy of the bunched beam for injection into the EBIS to match the acceptance of the post-accelerating RFQ. Ion optical simulations were carried out to inform the design of the RFQ buncher and PDT. Simulations indicate that delivery of up to 107~ions per bunch with high efficiency is possible. Experience with previous beam bunchers was also brought to bear in the design effort. Installation of the RFQ is under way, and tests with offline beam are expected to be performed in late 2018.

At ISAC-TRIUMF, a 500 MeV proton beam is impinged upon thick targets to induce nuclear reactions to pro-duce reaction products that are delivered as a Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) to experiments. Uranium carbide is among the most commonly used target materials which produces a vast radionuclide inventory coming from both spallation and fission- events. This can also represent a major limitation for the successful delivery of certain RIBs to experiments since, for a given mass, many isobar-ic isotopes are to be filtered by the dipole mass separator. These contaminants can exceed the yield of the isotope of interest by orders of magnitude, often causing a significant reduction in the sensitivity of experiments or even making them impossible. The design of a 50 kW proton-to-neutron (p2n) converter-target is ongoing to enhance the production of neutron-rich nuclei while significantly reducing the rate of neutron-deficient contaminants. The converter is made out of a bulk tungsten block which converts proton beams into neutrons through spallation. The neutrons, in turn, induce pure fission in an upstream UCx target. The present target design and the service infrastructure needed for its operation will be discussed in this paper.

Nb3Sn and NbTiN are two potential alternative materials to niobium for superconducting RF cavities. In this study direct measurements of the magnetic penetration depth using the low energy muon spin rotation technique are presented, from which the lower critical field and the superheating field are derived. Comparison with RF data confirms that the lower critical field is not a fundamental limitation and predict a potential performance clearly exceeding current state of the art of niobium technology if the superheating field can be achieved. As a potential pathway to avoid premature vortex penetration and reaching the superheating field it is suggested to use a bilayer structure with the outer layer having a larger magnetic penetration depth.

Cryogenic infrastructure is an indispensable part of TRIUMF accelerator facilities. At the moment TRIUMF operates three helium cryogenic systems supporting operation of three major accelerator systems: 520 MeV proton cyclotron, superconductive radio-frequency (SRF) heavy ion linear accelerator at the Rare Isotope Beams (RIB) facility, and SRF electron linear accelerator (e-linac) at Advanced Rare IsotopE Laboratory (ARIEL). Applications of cryogenic thermal loads vary from cryogenic absorption pumping of the cyclotron vacuum tank to cryogenic cooling of superconducting (SC) RF cavities of production accelerators and support of research and development at SRF department. Wide range of production techniques for cryogenic refrigeration includes helium refrigerators based on both piston and turbine expansion coldboxes for both 4 K and 2 K temperature cryogenic loads. This paper presents the details of TRIUMF cryogenic systems as well as operational experience of various cryogenic installations.

The new Advanced Rare IsotopE Laboratory (ARIEL) is a major expansion of the Rare Isotope Beams (RIB) facility at TRIUMF. Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities cooled down to 2 K are the key part of ARIEL electron linear accelerator (e-linac). Design of the cryogenic system was bound to follow both phased project schedule and existing building infrastructure. Due to the scheduling of commissioning and R&D activities of ARIEL project, high availability requirements were set for e-linac cryogenic system during its commissioning stage. Various upgrades were introduced during system commissioning in order to improve overall availability and reliability of the system. This paper presents the details of operational experience, commissioning activities and continuous improvement of various operational aspects of e-linac cryogenic system.

The 35.4MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) at the ISAC-I facility at TRIUMF is designed to accelerate ions from an energy of 2.04 keV/u to 150 keV/u for a large range of mass-to-charge ratios (A/Q). A multi-harmonic, 11.8MHz, buncher is used to provide a time focus at the RFQ entrance. Due to limits in the ion source HV platform a boost in the energy is required for higher mass beams (20 ≤ A/Q ≤ 30) to provide energy matching into the RFQ. To achieve this, a 3-gap, 11.8 MHz RF booster has been installed into the ISAC-I facility downstream of the buncher and upstream of the RFQ. The device can operate as an accelerator to match into the RFQ or as a second pre-buncher to improve capture in the RFQ and reduce sensitivity to space charge. Proof-of-principle measurements demonstrating various aspects of the performance will be reported and compared against expectations.

A novel balloon variant of the single spoke resonator (SSR) has been designed, fabricated and tested at TRIUMF. The cavity is the β=0.3 325 MHz SSR1 prototype for the Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) in Korea. The balloon variant is specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of multipacting barriers near the operating point. A systematic multipacting study led to a novel geometry, a spherical cavity with re-entrant irises plus a spoke. The balloon cavity provides competitive RF parameters and a robust mechanical structure. Cold tests demonstrated the principle of the balloon concept. The fabrication experience and the preliminary test results will be reported in this paper.

As the performance limits of bulk Nb srf cavities are reached, our research is focused on materials with superior srf properties like Nb3Sn and NbN. Research on NbN resulted in the "nitrogen-doping" process used for increasing the quality factors of srf cavities for the LCLS-II project. This process leads to delta-phase Nb-N, a phase with higher critical sc parameters than bulk Nb. This phase is formed at temperatures of 800°C in nitrogen atmospheres of 10-2 mbar. Other crystalline phases of NbN have even better sc parameters. We concentrate our research on applicability of delta-phase NbN for cavities. The delta-phase forms at temperatures of above 1300°C, which is more than most of the furnaces at accelerator facilites are capable of. Since 2005 the Institute for Nuclear Physics at the Technische Universität Darmstadt operates a high temperature vacuum furnace which has been upgraded to allow temperatures of up to 1750°C and bakeouts of niobium samples and cavities in nitrogen atmospheres. We will report on the current status of our research on nitrogen bake-out procedures on Nb samples. The samples have been analyzed at the Material Science Departement with SIMS, REM and XRD.

Niobium is the standard material for superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. Superconducting materials with higher critical temperature or higher critical magnetic field allow cavities to work at higher operating temperatures or higher accelerating fields, respectively. Enhancing the surface properties of the superconducting material in the range of the penetration depth is also beneficial. One direction of search for new materials with better properties is the modification of bulk niobium by nitrogen doping. In the Nb-N phase diagram the cubic delta-phase of NbN has the highest critical temperature (16 K). Already slight nitrogen doping of the alpha-Nb phase results in higher quality factors.* Nb samples were N-doped at the refurbished UHV furnace at IKP Darmstadt. Reference samples were annealed in 1 bar nitrogen atmosphere at different temperatures. In this contribution the results on the structural investigations (x-ray diffraction and pole figure, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy) at the Materials Research Department of TU Darmstadt will be presented.

Particle accelerators feature ultra-high vacuum pipe systems with unique topography, i.e. with a multitude of different vacuum chambers of varying dimensions and varying pipe apertures. In order to be able to examine the interior of the entire vacuum system, even those parts which are not accessible without disassembling large parts of the accelerator, a semi-autonomous robot is being developed which shall traverse and visually inspect the vacuum system of particle accelerators. We present a generic concept based on distance sensors for the inspection robot to detect steps between vacuum chambers and gaps in the beamline. Movement strategies to autonomously overcome these basic obstacles are introduced. For evaluation we use simulations of ideal environments with flat surfaces as well as realistic beam pipe environments of the SIS100 particle accelerator. Additionally, a prototype of our robot concept confirms the implementation of all maneuvers. Results show that obstacles of previously unknown dimensions can be detected and reliably traversed.

Nb3Sn is a potential candidate for surface material of SRF cavities since it can enable the cavity to operate at higher temperatures with high quality factor and at an increased accelerating gradient. Nb-Sn films were deposited using magnetron sputtering of individual Nb and Sn targets onto Nb and sapphire substrates. The as-deposited films were annealed at 1200 °C for 3 hours. The films were characterized for their structure by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), morphology by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and composition by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The surface resistivity was measured down to cryogenic temperature to determine the superconducting transition temperature and its width. The composition of the multilayered films was controlled by varying the thickness of the Nb and Sn layers. The films showed crystalline Nb3Sn phases with Tc up to 17.6 K.

Nb3Sn is a potential candidate to replace Nb in SRF accelerator cavities to reduce cost and advance perfor-mance. Tin vapor diffusion is the preferred technique to realize such cavities by growing a few microns thick Nb3Sn coating on the interior surface of the niobium cavity. The coating process typically uses temperatures of 1100-1200 °C for 3-6 hours. It is important to better understand the coating process, and optimize the coating parameters to overcome the current limitation on the performance of Nb3Sn coated SRF cavities. We investi-gate Nb3Sn coatings prepared in the temperature range of 900-1200 °C and duration of 3 - 12 hours using various material characterization tools. Variation of these pa-rameters appears to have notable effect on microstructure and topography of the obtained surface.

The Nb3Sn-coated cavities aim to enhance perfor-mance and significantly reduce cost. Their fabrication involves tin vapor diffusion coating of Nb3Sn on the interior surface of a Nb cavity. Controlled removal of first few layers to obtain a smoother and cleaner surface could be desirable to improve the high field RF perfor-mance. Our first results from the application of elec-tropolishing and oxypolishing techniques on Nb3Sn-coated surfaces indicated reduced surface roughness, and the surface composition appeared nominally unchanged. Systematic studies explore the effect of different polish-ing parameters into the roughness and composition. We present the latest results from SEM/EDS and AFM studies of Nb3Sn-coated samples treated with electropolishing and oxypolishing.

Vacuum chamber surface characteristics such as the photon and secondary electron yields (PEY and SEY) are critical parameters in the formation of an electron cloud, a serious problem that limits the performance of proton and positron accelerators. A few years ago it was discovered by the Vacuum Solutions Group at Daresbury laboratory that Laser Ablation Surface Engineering (LASE) could provide surfaces with SEY<1 [1,2]. The LASE surfaces are considered as a baseline solution for electron cloud miti-gation in the Future Circular Collider (FCC). However, these surfaces are undergoing further optimisation for the FCC application. While keeping SEY<1 the surfaces should meet the following criteria: Low outgassing, Low particulate generation and low surface resistance. In this paper we will report a number of new surfaces created using the LASE technique with different laser parameters (wavelength, scan speed, pitch, repetition rate, power, and pulse length) and their effect on the SEY, surface re-sistance and vacuum properties, etc

Prototype cavities have been built at Jefferson Lab to increase the energy of future refurbished CEBAF cryomodules to 75 MeV in the most cost efficient way. Three such cavities, named "C75", have been built from ingot Nb material of different purity and have been processed and tested. The two better performing cavities have been assembled into a "cavity pair" and installed in the latest refurbished original CEBAF cryomodule. The cryomodule was installed and commissioned in CEBAF. The results from the commissioning of the C75 cavities, compared with the original CEBAF cavities, are presented in this article. The vertical test performance of the C75 cavities was preserved in the cryomodule with one of the cavities achieving the performance specification of an accelerating gradient of 19 MV/m with a quality factor of ~8×109 at 2.07 K. The performance in terms of microphonics and tuner operation was similar to that of original CEBAF cavities, as expected, and the high-order modes are properly damped. The quality factor of the two C75 cavities was the highest achieved in a CEBAF cryomodule, possibly due to the better magnetic flux expulsion of ingot Nb than standard fine-grain Nb.

The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is currently constructing a major upgrade to its accelerator, the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II). Several Department of Energy laboratories, including the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), are collaborating in this project. The cryomodules for this project each consist of eight 1.3-GHz cavities produced by two vendors, Research Instruments GmbH in Germany (RI*) and Ettore Zanon S.p.a. in Italy (EZ*), using niobium cell material from Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). During the initial production run, cavity performance from one of the vendors (Vendor A) was far below expectation. All the cavities had low Q0, later attributed to minimal EP as well as high-flux-trapping NX material, early quench behaviour below 18 MV/m, with many having Q0 roll-off at 12-16 MV/m. Production was stopped multiple times over the following 6 months, with test batches of cavities being made to ascertain the root cause of the problem. The final root cause of the problem was found to be inappropriate grinding of the RF surface prior to welding which left normal conducting inclusions in the surface. In addition, most cavities showed internal and external weld spatter which required post weld grinding and a very rough surface from operating the electropolishing machine in an etching rather than polishing regime. All issues have been corrected on new cavities and rework is underway on the originally effected cavities.

The development of next-generation SRF cavities requires the deployment of innovative material solutions with RF performance beyond bulk Nb. Theoretical interest has stimulated efforts to grow and characterize thin multi-layer superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) structures for their potential capability of supporting otherwise inaccessible surface magnetic fields in SRF cavities *. The ternary B1-compound NbTiN is among the candidate superconducting materials for SIS structures. Single crystal NbTiN films with thicknesses below 15 nm are also of interest for the development of high resolution, high sensitivity (SNSPD) detectors for particle physics application.

Pulse reversed electropolishing of niobium SRF cavities, using a dilute aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte without HF yields equivalent RF performance with traditional EP. Comparing with present EP process for Nb SRF cavity which uses 1:10 volume ratio of HF (49%) and H2SO4 (98%), pulse reverse EP (also known as bipolar EP (BPEP)) is ecologically friendly and uses relatively benign electrolyte options for cavity processing. In this study, we report the commissioning of a new vertical cavity processing system for SRF Nb single cell and multi-cell cavities with HF-free pulse-reverse electropolishing at Jefferson Lab, together with RF test of cavities being processed. We report the scale-up challenges and interpretations from process R&D to implementation.

JLab is developing new SRF cavity designs at 952.6 MHz for the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC). New cavities will be required for the ion ring, cooler ERL and booster and eventually for an upgrade of the electron ring to allow the highest possible bunch collision rate. The challenges include the need for high fundamental mode power couplers and strong HOM damping, with high HOM power capability. Initial focus is on the cooler ERL 5-cell cavity as this is a critical component for the strong, high energy, bunched-beam cooling concept. 1-cell and 5-cell Nb prototype cavities have been designed and fabricated. Details concerning the cavity fabrication and test results will be presented.

The scheme of using a high efficiency magnetron to drive a superconducting radio frequency (SRF) accelerator cavity needs not only the injection phase locking but also the amplitude modulation to compensate the cavity's microphomics caused cavity voltage change and the beam loading variation. To be able to do a fast and efficient modulation, the magnetron's magnetic field has to be trimmed by an external coil to compensate the frequency pushing effect due to the anode current change [1]. A low eddy current magnetron body has been designed and built [2]. This paper will present the analytical prediction, simulation and experimental results on the 2.45 GHz magnetron test stand with the modulation frequency up to 1 kHz. In addition, the progresses on the injection lock to a copper cavity, new 1497 MHz magnetron prototype, 13 kW high power magnetron test stand development and newly built low level RF (LLRF) controller for the amplitude modulation will be reported.

In the framework of a collaboration between CERN and JLab, an SRF accelerating cavity for energy recovery linacs operating at 802 MHz was developed in the context of the CERN's Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) design study. A single-cell and a five-cell cavity from fine grain high RRR niobium were built at JLab to validate the basic RF design in vertical tests. Two copper single-cell cavities were produced in parallel for R&D purposes at CERN. The cavity design has since been adapted as baseline for the main linac cavities in the proposed Powerful Energy Recovery Linac Experiment facility (PERLE) at Orsay. Details concerning the cavity fabrication and test results for the Nb cavities are presented.

TETD (Toshiba Electron Tubes and Devices Co., Ltd.) has been developing a high efficiency klystron improved bunch quality by the multi-stage of core oscillation design. For feasibility study, an S-band 7.5 MW klystron has been designed with the efficiency of more than 60% at 1.8μperveance. The first prototype was fabricated by modifying the interaction section of a commercial model to enhance the efficiency from 45% to 60%. The klystron was tested in June 2017, and 57% of efficiency at 6 MW output power was demonstrated. We are developing the second prototype which has the improved design for the higher efficiency at 7.5 WM output power. The design details and the test results of the first prototypes are presented.

We proposed an RF system with two klystrons, of which the powers are combined by a 3dB-hybrid. By managing the phases of the two klystrons respectively, the two pulses from the two output ports of the 3dB-hybrid can be of different powers, phases, and shapes. One of the two pulses can be set to an RF gun, while the other one can feed traveling accelerating structures. Two methods of phase modulation were proposed based on this scheme. Comparing with the state-of-art RF system, the new one can be of high efficiency or can generate electron beams with higher energy. The detailed analysis of the two methods and some experiments are described in this paper.

As one of the higher-order-mode (HOM) damping structures, X-band choke-mode accelerating structures had been studied for several years. However, the breakdown characteristics of the X-band choke are still unknown. Five different single-cell choke-mode accelerating structures and one reference structure were designed, fabricated and high-gradient tested to study the related RF breakdown characteristics. The absence of field emission current flash was proposed to be the sign of breakdowns occurring inside the choke, this was verified by the post-mortem observation. Evaluation of the breakdown rate revealed that there is memory effect with pulse width and electric field. The breakdown rate in a single RF pulse did not have the 5th order pulse width and 30th order electric field dependency predicted by the empirical formula.

Ferrite has the feature of the permeability depended on the external static magnetic field, thus could be used to shift the phase of the propagating radio frequency (RF) signal. In this paper, we introduce a novel design of ferrite-based RF phase shifter. The design changes the resonant frequency of a ferrite-filled pill-box cavity to implement the phase changing. This design has a lower local RF field and a higher sensitivity on the phase changing than those of waveguide phase shifter, which may bring advantages such as higher power capacity, fast changing speed and lower insertion loss. Theory and simulation results are also presented in this paper.

We designed, fabricated and high power tested an S-band spherical pulse compressor for the high-power test facility at Tsinghua University. The pulse compressor comprises a spherical resonant cavity with an unloaded quality factor of 100, 000 and an RF polarizer with two rectangular ports and a circular port. To achieve high efficiency and large power gain, the coupling coefficient was optimized to 8 with input pulse length of 3.6 us and compression ratio of 12. After conditioning the RF system, the pulse compressor generated RF pulses with peak power of more than 400MW. And during the operation, the pulse compressor has very low breakdown rate and was extremely stable.

The choke-mode accelerating structure is one of the higher-order-mode (HOM) damping structures. It has the advantage of relatively simple fabrication and low surface magnetic field. C-band choke-mode accelerating structures have been successfully applied in multibunch XFEL. However, the X-band choke-mode study remains in the theoretical design stage. The high-gradient performance of the choke is still unknown. Five different single-cell choke-mode accelerating structures were designed, fabricated and high-gradient tested to study the related RF breakdown characteristics. It was observed that high electric field and small choke dimension caused serious breakdowns in the choke which was the main limitation of the high-gradient performance. The Choke-mode accelerating structures reached 130 MV/m by decreasing the electric field and increasing the choke gap. A new quantity was proposed to give the high-gradient performance limit of choke-mode accelerating structures due to RF breakdown. The new quantity was obtained from the summary of the high-gradient experiments and could be used to guide high-gradient choke-mode accelerating structure design.

A proposed RF scheme based on correction cavity chain and storage cavity (CC-SC scheme) for klystron-based CLIC has the ability to generate flat output pulses. In the scheme, the correction cavity chain modulates the amplitude of the input pulse, while the storage cavity compresses the amplitude-modulated pulse. Resonant cavities of the correction cavity chain are of a relatively low unloaded quality factor and of small size, which results in the compactness of the RF scheme. The first prototype of a correction cavity chain was fabricated and cold tested at Tsinghua University and then delivered to CERN for high power test. Both the results of the cold and high power tests show that the correction cavity chain is of good performance. Feasibility and stability of the pulse compression system based on CC-SC scheme were demonstrated.

A compact X-band (9.3 GHz) RF rotary joint has been developed in the accelerator laboratory of Tsinghua University. Cold measurements on the rotary joint using Vector-Network showed good results. In recent high-power tests, the RF rotary joint was operated under a 1.6 MW X-band magnetron. The incident power, the transmitted power and the pulse width of this rotary joint have been measured. The transmitted power kept stable in different rotation angle. In this paper, the setup and results of the high-power tests of this RF rotary joint are presented.

Study of beam break up effect in linacs has been done in recent years. The beam-induced high order dipolar modes, especially the TM11-like mode were investigated for the linacs both in travelling wave and backward trav-elling wave. Measurements of beam-break up in a travel-ling wave linac were carried out and results are discussed. Moreover, a theoretical model was developed for the irradiation linacs to study the detailed interaction be-tween the transverse wakefield and the electron beam.
