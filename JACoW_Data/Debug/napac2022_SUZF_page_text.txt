Systems engineering has long been employed in defense and non-defense industries but not commonly in particle accelerator systems. The common definition of Systems Engineering is as follows "It is a transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enable the successful realization, use, and retirement of engineered systems, using systems principles and concepts, and scientific, technological, and management methods." This overview introduces participants to the fundamental principles of systems engineering and their application to the development of complex systems. Systems engineering helps address engineering challenges as well as how systems engineering is essential to project management. The overview will help the participant learn the language of methods and processes commonplace in industry. We will define the following through examples: systems, the systems development lifecycle, and methods of systems engineering, beginning with the system requirements. One example will be exploring a novel particle accelerator through systems engineering methods.
