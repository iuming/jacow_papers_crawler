The short wavelength and high peak power of the present generation of Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) opens the possibility of ultra-short pulses even surpassing the present (~10-100 attosecond) capabilities of other light sources – but only if x-ray FELs can be made to generate pulses consisting of just a few optical cycles. For hard x-ray operation (<~0.1nm), this corresponds to durations of approximately a single attosecond, and below into the zeptosecond scale. This talk will describe a proposed method [1] to generate trains of few-cycle pulses, at GW peak powers, from existing x-ray FEL facilities by using a relatively short 'afterburner'. Such pulses would enhance research opportunity in atomic dynamics and push capability towards the investigation of electronic-nuclear and nuclear dynamics. The corresponding multi-colour spectral output, with a bandwidth envelope increased by up to two orders of magnitudes over SASE, also has potential applications.
