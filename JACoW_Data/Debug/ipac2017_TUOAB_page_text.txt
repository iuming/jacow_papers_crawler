The Beam Gas Vertex detector (BGV) is an innovative beam profile monitor based on the reconstruction of beam-gas interaction vertices which is being developed as part of the High Luminosity LHC project. Tracks are identified using several planes of scintillating fibres, located outside the beam vacuum chamber and perpendicular to the beam axis. The gas pressure in the interaction volume is adjusted such as to provide an adequate trigger rate, without disturbing the beam. A BGV demonstrator monitoring one of the two LHC beams was fully installed and commissioned in 2016. First data and beam size measurements show that the complete detector and data acquisition system is operating as expected. The BGV operating parameters are now being optimised and the reconstruction algorithms developed to produce accurate and fast reconstruction on a CPU farm in order to provide real time beam profile measurements to the LHC operators.

A test coronagraph for the observation of beam halo has been installed in the Synchrotron radiation monitor line LHCB2 in 2015. This coronagraph is commissioned with LHC operation at 450GeV (injection energy). After some optical testing of the coronagraph with visible Synchrotron radiation in B2, we try to observe artificially-made beam halo. The beam halo of 10-3 order of magnitude against the beam core is excited by the kicker of the transverse damper. We have succeeded to observe a diffraction noise free image of beam halo. The effect of beam collimator is also observed. Reduction of beam halo intensity was found nicely proportional to the simultaneously-recorded beam loss.

The new beam loss monitor (BLM) system now in operation at the main ring of J-PARC consists of an isolated front-end current to voltage converter, a VME-based 24 bit ADC system. A dual detector system employs a proportional-type gas chamber (PBLM) and an air-filled ionization chamber (AIC). The system shows a wide dynamic range of 160 dB. It can detect the low level signal that would arise in the case of the detection of residual dose in the ring itself after the beam has been turned off as well as an event such as high level beam loss at the collimators. The signal rise time of the waveform obtained is 17 us which fast enough to meet the speed requirement of the Machine Protection System (MPS); which is that the MPS should dump the beam within 100 us when the beam loss signal exceeds the reference levels set in the ADC system.
