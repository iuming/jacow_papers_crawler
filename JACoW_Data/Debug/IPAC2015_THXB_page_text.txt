The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) energy upgrade from 6 GeV to 12 GeV includes the installation of eleven new 100 MV cryomodules (88 cavities). The superconducting RF cavities are designed to operate CW at an accelerating gradient of 19.3 MV/m with a QL of 3×107. Not all the cavities were operated at the minimum gradient of 19.3 MV/m with the beam. Though the initial 12 GeV milestones were achieved during the initial commissioning of CEBAF, there are still some issues to be addressed for long term reliable operation of these modules. This paper reports the operational experiences during the initial commissioning and the path forward to improve the performance of C100 (100 MV) modules.

In two-ring facilities operating with a crossing angle collision scheme, the luminosity can be limited due to incomplete overlap of the colliding bunches. Crab cavities are introduced to restore head-on collisions by providing destined opposite deflection to the head and tail of the bunch. Luminosity increase has been demonstrated at KEKB with global crab crossing, and the Large Hardron Collider (LHC) at CERN is currently designing local crab crossing for the Hi-Lumi upgrade. Future colliders may investigate both approaches. This paper reviews the challenges in the technology and implementation of crab cavities, discusses experience in past colliders, ongoing R&D and proposed implementations for future facilities such as HL-LHC, CLIC, ILC, and eRHIC/MEIC.

The design of the world's highest beam power (5 MW) spallation source target facility for safe and efficient operation is a great challenge. This talk presents an overview of the entire target monolith and associated critical systems with a focus on power handling, neutron source performance, remote handling, and design for maintainability.
