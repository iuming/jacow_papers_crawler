Global Industrial Development of Accelerators for Charged Particle Therapy

This paper describes the current situation concerning industrial accelerators for medical hadron therapy facilities. Starting from high level requirements and considerations for a therapy facility more specific requirements for the accelerator will be deduced. The Varian ProBeam cyclotron is shown as an example of a medical accelerator and a statistical overview on other accelerators in us is given. The focus is strictly on industrially available equipment. As hadron facilities are extremely complex systems, in the confined space of this paper some simplifications are unavoidable.

RF Sub-Systems for Cargo and Vehicle Inspection

X-ray screening for security is a well-established inspection technique. Whilst in terms of fielded systems the vast majority consist of low energy X-ray sources, typically used for hand baggage or mail screening. There is a smaller but high value niche market servicing the requirements for border security, and cargo and vehicle inspection (CVI). This latter application requires higher X-ray energies of up to 10 MeV using an electron linear accelerator (linac) source to penetrate fully loaded shipping containers. Increasingly, methods are required to improve throughput and provide a higher level of material discrimination during inspection. This paper will briefly review the elements required to make an effective X-ray source, whilst outlining the RF technology required to drive a linac-based X-ray security system. Following this, potential new developments in radiofrequency (RF) sub-systems will be discussed in the context of user benefits.

How To Produce 100 Superconducting Modules for the European XFEL in Collaboration and with Industry
1923


 

H. Weise

European XFEL accelerator module production is in almost full swing by the time of IPAC 2014. This is the first project of this size that includes many partner laboratories and transfer of technology for mass superconducting RF cavity and accelerator module production to industry. This talk will illustrate the organization of the production and the lessons learned, illuminating what one should or would do differently for future projects.

Challenges of the XFEL Cryomodule Integration and Industry Transfer
1929

The construction of the European XFEL Accelerator is based on in-kind contributions shared by several institutes throughout Europe and Russia. Within the French contribution, CEA is responsible for the assembly, in a dedicated facility located in Saclay, of the up to 100 cryomodules constituting the Linac. Since 2012, ALSYOM has been selected as the industrial partner for such assembly works. This presentation will detail the organization set up for this partnership and the related challenges of this transfer to Industry.

Big Science Projects - What is it that makes some a success and others to fail?

This presentation analyses the driving forces behind big science projects (which are very different compared to similarly complex but totally commercial projects). This presentation should be enlightening and a big help for anyone wanting to make business with big science projects.
