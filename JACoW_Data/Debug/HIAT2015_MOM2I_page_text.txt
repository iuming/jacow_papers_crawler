Recent years have witnessed a significantly increasing worldwide interest in charged particle therapy with protons and carbon ions, which allows uniquely precise delivery of a high dose to the target volume while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, carbon ion beams deliver a larger mean energy per unit length of trajectory in the body than protons and X-ray beams. This unique property includes a high biological effect when used in radiotherapy. Thus, we have high expectations for carbon ion radiotherapy as a promising treatment for intractable tumors that are resistant to X-ray beams.

Medical isotope research at TRIUMF is enabled by a fleet of proton accelerators, ranging from 13 to 500 MeV, coupled to deep expertise in high-power accelerator target design, isotope production and radiopharmaceutical chemistry. With these tools and knowledge, scientists at TRIUMF are pursuing applications in molecular imaging and targeted radiotherapy using known and novel isotopes. A brief update on recent efforts to demonstrate accelerator-based production of 99mTc via 100Mo(p, 2n) will be provided, followed by a summary of work on isotopes with potential theranostic applications. Recent efforts in the production and isolation of 209, 211At, 223, 224,225Ra, 225Ac and 213Bi from proton irradiation of 232Th will be discussed. Using TRIUMF's ISOL infrastructure, 209At, a γ-emitter, was isolated via implantation of 213Fr and used to label and image model targeting vectors in vivo. In parallel, 211At (via 211Rn implantation) was isolated as a promising α-emitting isotope to treat micro-metastases or monocellular malignancies such as leukemia. The implantation of 223, 224Ra as well as 225Ra, a parent of 225Ac and concomitantly 213Bi, were also studied as a means to obtain these promising isotopes with similar applications in targeted α-therapy. This presentation will conclude with a summary of TRIUMF's activities toward completing its 50 MeV, 500 kW Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL), a high-intensity e-linac.
