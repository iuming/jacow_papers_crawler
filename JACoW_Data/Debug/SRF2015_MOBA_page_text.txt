Efficient Magnetic Flux Expulsion During Cooldown

The talk will report recent experimental results and theoretical understanding of the magnetic flux expulsion during cooldown provided by large thermal gradients. The complete expulsion of the magnetic flux can lead to record-high Qs at accelerating gradients of ~20 MV/m. High Qs were achieved in ambient magnetic fields up to 190 mG. These findings open up a way to ultra-high quality factors at low temperatures and show an alternative to the sophisticated magnetic shielding implemented in modern superconducting accelerators.

One important characteristic of nitrogen-doped cavities is their very high sensitivity to increased residual surface resistance from trapped ambient magnetic flux. We have performed a systematic study on the losses by trapped flux, and their dependence on the mean-free-path (MFP) of the niobium RF penetration layer. Cavities with a wide range of MFP values were tested in uniform ambient magnetic fields to measure trapped magnetic flux and resulting increase in RF surface resistance. MFP values were determined from surface impedance measurements. It was found that larger mean free paths lead to lower sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux.

High-Q Operation of SRF Cavities: The Impact of Thermocurrents on the RF Surface Resistance
37

For CW applications much effort is being expended to minimize the power dissipation (surface resistance) of niobium cavities. Previous studies have shown that residual resistance can be reduced by performing a thermal cycle, a procedure of warming up a cavity after initial cooldown to about 20K and cooling it down again. It was postulated that thermocurrents during cooldown generate additional trapped magnetic flux that impacts the cavity quality factor. Here, we present a more extensive study that includes measurements of two additional passband modes and that confirms the effect. A change in surface resistance of more than a factor seven was observed. In this paper, we also discuss simulations that support the claim. While the layout of the cavity LHe tank system is cylindrically symmetric, we show that the temperature dependence of the material parameters results in a non-symmetric current distribution.

Nature of Quality Factor Degradation in SRF Cavities due to Quench

Superconductive quench is a well-known phenomenon that causes magnetic flux trapping in superconducting accelerating cavities increasing the radio-frequency surface resistance. This paper is addressed to the understanding of the quench-induced losses nature. We present the proof that the real origin of quench-related quality factor degradation is consequence only of ambient magnetic field trapped at the quench spot. Also, we show how the quality factor can be fully recovered after it was highly deteriorated quenching several times in presence of external magnetic field. Such phenomenon was found to be completely reliable up to certain values of applied magnetic field, above that the cavity quality factor cannot be fully recovered anymore.

Interstitial diffusion of atomic species into the surface of niobium has been found to yield significantly reduced srf surface resistance and lowered quench fields. This talk summarizes systematic efforts to explore the trade-offs of these phenomena with a goal of learning how to maximize Q0 in the 30 MV/m regime. The talk also summarizes N-doped cavity progress at JLab for LCLS-II.

As part of a multi-laboratory research initiative on high Q0 niobium cavities for LCLS-II and other future CW SRF accelerators, Cornell has conducted an extensive research program during the last two years on impurity-doping of niobium cavities and related material characterization. Here we give an overview of these activities, and present results from single-cell studies, from vertical performance testing of nitrogen-doped nine-cell cavities, and from cryomodule testing of nitrogen-doped nine-cell cavities.
