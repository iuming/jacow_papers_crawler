A comparative measurement campaign of the beam charge was carried out at SwissFEL using the following instruments: Faraday-Cup (FC), Wall-Current-Monitor (WCM), Integrating-Current-Transformer (Bergoz Turbo-ICT-2) and the reference cavity of the Beam-Position-Monitor (BPM). The goal of the measurement campaign was to determine an absolute charge measurement method for a general purpose of instrument calibration and machine routine operation. Results of the absolute charge calibration method proposed for SwissFEL will be presented.

Accurate non-destructive measurement of the absolute intensity of weak ion beams (< 1 uA) in storage rings is often restricted to special beam conditions and, even then, is associated with large uncertainties and tedious calibration procedures. However, experiments with rare ions in particular depend on excellent current resolution. In order to make these beams accessible, the Cryogenic Current Comparator (CCC) monitors deviations of the DC beam current on a scale of nA and compares the signal to a calibrated reference current. At the heavy-ion storage ring CRYRING at GSI a CCC prototype for FAIR was installed and first results of the commissioning are reported here. Preceding the operation with beam, a careful design of the beamline helium cryostat was required to provide the stable cryogenic environment needed for CCC operation. Mechanical and electro-magnetic perturbations that interfere with measurement of the beam’s faint magnetic field are suppressed by the internal structure of the system and a superconducting magnetic shield, while the remaining interference can be filtered with adequate signal processing. In this way, a current resolution in the nA range was demonstrated.
