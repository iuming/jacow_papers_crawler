The effects of space charge play a significant role in modern-day accelerators, frequently constraining the beam parameters attainable in an accelerator or in an accelerator chain. They also can limit the luminosity of hadron colliders operating either at low energies or with sub-TeV high-brightness hadron beams. The latter is applied for strongly cooled proton and ion beams in eRHIC – the proposed future electron-ion collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Several schemes were proposed to compensate for space charge effects in a coasting (e.g., continuous) hadron beam, and some have been tested. Using an appropriate transverse profile of the electron beam (or plasma column) for a coasting beam would compensate both the tune shift and the tune spread in the hadron beam. But none of these methods address the issue of compensating space-charge induced tune spread in a bunched hadron beam. In this paper we propose and evaluate a novel idea of using a co-propagating electron bunch with miss-matched longitudinal velocity to compensate the space charge induced tune-shift and tune spread. We present several practical examples of such a system.

Permanent EDMs (electric dipole moment) of fundamental particles violate both time invariance T and parity P. Assuming the CPT theorem this implies CP violation. The Standard Model (SM) predicts non-vanishing EDMs, their magnitudes, however, are expected to be unobservably small with current techniques. Hence, the discovery of a non-zero EDM would be a signal for “new physics”. As a first step towards EDM searches of charged particles in storage rings, R&D work at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY is pursued. On a longer time scale, the design and construction of a dedicated storage ring will be carried out. Spin-tracking simulations are absolutely crucial to explore the feasibility of the planned storage ring EDM experiments and to investigate systematic limitations. For a detailed study during the storage and buildup of the EDM signal, one needs to track a large sample of particles for billions of turns. Benchmarking experiments are performed at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY to check and to further improve the simulation tools and prototype accelerator components are tested. Finally, the layout of a dedicated storage ring has to be optimized by a full simulation of spin motion.

Intra-Beam Scattering (IBS) is one of the main limiting processes for the performance of low energy ion storage rings, such as the Extra Low ENergy Antiproton ring (ELENA) that is being constructed at CERN. IBS effects limit the achievable equilibrium 6D beam phase space volume during the cooling process, as well as the stored beam intensity. In this contribution we analyze the IBS effects on the beam dynamics of the ELENA ring in detail. Numerical simulations using the codes BETACOOL and MAD-X have been performed to compute the beam life time and the equilibrium phase space parameters with electron cooling in the presence of IBS.
