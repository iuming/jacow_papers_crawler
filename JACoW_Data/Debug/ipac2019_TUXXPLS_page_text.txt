The 113 MHz superconducting gun is used an electron source for the coherent electron cooling experiment. The unique feature of the gun is that a photocathode is held at room temperature. It allowed to preserve the quantum efficiency of Cs2KSb cathode which is adversely affected by cryogenic temperatures. Relatively low frequency permitted fully realize the accelerating field gradient what in in turn helps to achieve 10 nC charge and 0.3 microns normalized emittance. We present the achieved performance an operational experience as well.

Negative muonium ion production is one of methods to cool muons. Since its discovery in 1987 by interactions of muons with a metal foil, it has been discussed that the production efficiency would be improved using a low-work function material. C12A7 (12CaO·7AlO3) was a well-known insulator as a constituent of alumina cement, but was recently confirmed to exhibit electric conductivity by electron doping. The C12A7 electride has lower work function (2.9 eV) and it was reported that nearly the same negative current signal as that with a bi-alkali material coated metal were observed in H− formation. In this poster, the negative muonium production measurement with a Al foil and C12A7 electride film will be presented.

The dielectric-assist accelerating (DAA) structure is a dielectric-inserted normal-conducting cavity, which provides high Q value at room temperature. This accelerating structure is composed of dielectric disks and a dielectric cylindrical layer inserted in a copper cavity. For the realistic operation, the removal of heat from the dielectric cells and the vacuum evacuation of gas inside the cylindrical layers have not considered yet. In order to solve the problems, we propose the optimized design of the DAA structure, where the extended part of the dielectric disk is embedded in the copper cavity and the choke structure is applied. We show the result of the electromagnetic-field simulation of the extended DAA structure and the thermal simulation to clarify the relation between a duty factor and maximum temperature of the dielectric cells.
