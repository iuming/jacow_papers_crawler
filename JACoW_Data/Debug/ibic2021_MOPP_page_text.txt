The prototype front-end superconducting proton LINAC (CAFe) for the China Accelerator Driven Subcritical System (CiADS) has been constructed since 2011. After ten years hard work, in February of 2021, this LINAC reached its design goal with the successful commissioning of a 10 mA, 205 kW continuous-wave (CW) proton beam with the energy of 20 MeV. CAFe’s beam availability during long-term, high-power operation was measured to be 93- 96%, indicating high reliability: 12 hours of operation at 174 kW / 10 mA and 108 hours at 126 kW / 7.3 mA. To reach this final goal, challenges must be overcome including beam-loss control and detection, heavy beam loading and rapid fault recovery. During the whole process, beam instruments played a key point to overcome all those challenges. The beam diagnostics team delivered a comprehensive suite of instrumentation that supported the machine commissioning and operations, provided relevant feedback and beam interlock signal of the accelerator operation as well. A suite of instrumentation was commissioned and performed that includes a variety of current monitors, normal and cold capacitive BPMs, transverse and longitudinal profile monitors, multi-slit and single-slit scanning emittance stations, time-of-flight and magnetic field related energy and energy spread measurements, beam loss monitors and a target imaging system as well. The commissioning results and performance of these systems will be described, as well as the current and beam loss measurement for fast machine protection with the responding time of less than 10 us. Also the ten year’s lessons learnt will be described.

SOLEIL Synchrotron has an upgrade plan to replace its storage ring by a new one based on multi-bend (7/4BA) achromat lattice. The Conceptual Design Report (CDR) has been published recently and the Technical Design Report (TDR) phase should be finished for the end of 2023. For the beam instrumentation, most of the equipment will have to be replaced, to overcome cases of electronics obsolescence and to fulfil the new tight requirements. Among them, the most challenging ones are the micron resolution transverse beam size measurement, the beam position monitoring and the stability feedbacks. The present machine will be used to validate some prototypes and it is planned to upgrade part of the diagnostics ahead of the dark period to speed-up the commissioning of the new storage ring. This paper will present the diagnostics systems that are foreseen for the SOLEIL upgrade project.

The types of accelerators used in BNCT(Boron neutron capture therapy) systems worldwide are classified as cyclotrons, LINACs, and electrostatic accelerators. The cyclotron-based BNCT system is undergoing clinical trial approval. In order to develop BNCT, the efficiency of the electrostatic accelerator ion source is important. In particular, it should be possible to maintain the optimal beam current by controlling the extraction, plasma, filament, and arc of the ion source. A set value is required for the desired beam current. In this article, the performance of the beam current was confirmed by changing the extraction voltage using the ion source of the KIRAMS’s static accelerator. In this experiment, plasma voltage, bias voltage, and extraction voltage were set as fixed values. After the extraction voltage was set to 2 kV, the beam current was set to 1 mA, 1.5 mA, 2 mA, 3 mA for each experiment. After that, the data was extracted by adjusting the extraction voltage by 0 - 0.2 kV. The extracted data result shows how the output beam current changes when the extraction voltage changes.

MYRRHA (Multi-Purpose Hybrid Research Reactor for High-Tech Applications) aims to demonstrate the feasibility of high-level nuclear waste transmutation at industrial scale. MYRRHA Facility aims to accelerate 4 mA proton beam up to 600 MeV. The accurate tuning of LINAC is essential for the operation of MYRRHA and requires measurement of the beam transverse position and shape, the phase of the beam with respect to the radiofrequency voltage with the help of Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system. MINERVA is the first phase of MYRRHA. It includes several sections allowing beam acceleration up to 100 MeV. A BPM prototype was realized for the single spoke section (17 MeV-100 MeV). This paper addresses the design, realization, and calibration of this BPMs and its associated electronics. The characterization of the beam shape is performed by means of a test bench allowing a position mapping with a resolution of 0.02 mm.

The FLASH 1 beamline at DESY will be upgraded from fixed to variable gap undulators in the next years. For this the vacuum beamline has to be adapted. This reduces the inner diameter compared to the existing chamber. The vacuum components should fit to the new dimension to minimize transitions and therefore reduce wakefields which could interact with the electron beam and disturb the SASE effect. The electron beam position in the intersection of the undulators should be detected with a high resolution and a large charge dynamic range. Cavity BPMs are known to fulfill these requirements. The existing design with 10 mm inner diameter for the Eu-XFEL is reduced to 6 mm. Additional improvements are: widening of the dipole resonator waveguide to adapt to the dipole mode and antenna transmission. The resonator frequency of 3.3 GHz and loaded quality factor of 70 are maintained to use electronic synergies to other projects. The design considerations and simulation results of the cavity BPM will be presented.

The wake field of different modes of cavity BPM carries different bunch information, the amplitude and phase of the signals of different modes can be extracted through the signal processing method to obtain the characteristic parameters of the source bunch. In the application of bunch charge and position measurement, the accurate amplitude extraction method for cavity BPM signal is the primary issue to be considered when designing the data acquisition and processing system. In this paper, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, it is proved that the optimal algorithm of amplitude extraction for CBPM exists, and the dependence between the data processing window size and the decay time of the cavity BPM under the optimal design is given. In addition, the relationship between the optimized amplitude extraction uncertainty and the noise-to-signal ratio, sampling rate of data acquisition and processing system, and the decay time of the cavity BPM is also proposed, which can also provide clear guidance for the design and optimization of the CBPM system.

At the SuperKEKB injector linac, positrons are generated by striking electron beam at tungsten target. The secondary electrons are also produced during positron creation and accelerated in the positron capture section. A new wideband feedthrough-beam position monitor (BPM) system was developed for synchronous detection of secondary produced e- and e+ beams with temporal separation of about 180 ps. When e+/e− bunches pass through the accelerating structure or vacuum duct of different radius, they generate wakefields. These wakefields can be directly observed with the feedthrough-BPM. A simulation study has also been carried to validate the observed wakefield effects with the feedthrough-BPM. The effects of wakefields on beam parameters will be reported in this paper.

SHINE is a newly proposed high-repetition-rate X-ray FEL facility and will be used to generate brilliant X-rays between 0.4 and 0.25 keV. To guarantee the high performance of FEL light pulses, it put a strict requirement on the monitoring of electron bunch trajectory. The position resolution of each bunch at the undulator section is required to be better than 200 nm at a bunch charge of 100 pC. The cavity beam position monitor (CBPM) is widely used in FEL facilities for its unique high resolution and high sensitivity. The output signals of an ideal pillbox cavity are proportional to the resonant frequency. Compared with the C-band cavity, the X-band cavity is expected to have a higher signal-to-noise ratio which is especially helpful at low bunch charge. Therefore, an X-band CBPM prototype is developed for SHINE. This paper will focus on the difficulties encountered during the design and production process and the solutions.

The beam orbit stability is an important parameter to measure the stability of the synchrotron radiation source. As for the fourth-generation storage ring, the emittance and beam size continue to decrease and higher requirements are being put for-ward for beam orbit stability. There are two main factors that affect the stability of the beam orbit. One is the vibration of the ground and other systems, which requires highly mechanically stable support. The other is due to synchrotron radiation and changes in ambient temperature, which lead to the expansion and deformation of the vacuum chamber, causing BPM movement and misjudging the position of the beam orbit. The misjudging will introduce errors in the orbit feedback system and decrease the stability of the beam orbit. Therefore, a set of offline BPM (beam position monitor) displacement measurement system with high stability was built. However, considering the adverse effect of the INVAR36 on magnetic field and the drift of the displacement data, we added carbon fiber to the new support for BPM displacement measurement probes. Besides we realized the function of real-time reading BPM displacement data through EPICS. This article mainly introduces the support design and EPICS connection of the BPM displacement measurement system.

To measure the swap-out injection/extraction bunches of the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) storage ring, single-pass Beam Position Monitor (BPM) electronics will be installed in the first sectors after the injection with fast RF switches. The fast RF switch will select a bunch signal to be processed by the single pass BPM electronics, and have the remaining bunches processed by the regular BPM electronics. In addition to measuring the swap-out bunch during injection, the setup will be able to carry out various other measurements of any selected single bunch (or bunches). This paper presents the performance of the fast RF switches and related electronics.

RAON (Rare isotope accelerator complex for On-line experiments) is accelerator to accelerate heavy ion such as uranium, oxygen, and proton. At P2DT(Post to Driver linac Transport line) section where is located between SCL3 and SCL2, particle beam would be higher charge state by stripper. In bending area in P2DT, BPM(Beam Position Monitor) should accept the beam that has large size (~10 cm) horizontally. Required BPM transverse position resolution is 150 um. We simulated Large type BPM with CST particle studio. Fabricated LBPM was tested on the developed wire test bench that could move BPM for width of ±80 mm, height of ±40 mm with manual steering knob.

In the last years, there has been a growing interest in using the pilot-tone technique for long-term stabilization of electron beam position monitors in synchrotrons. At Elettra, after an internal development, the effectiveness of this approach was proven with tests in the laboratory and on the storage ring. The pilot-tone scheme will be adopted for the eBPMs that will equip Elettra 2.0, the low-emittance upgrade of the present machine. In order to support the development, industrialisation and production of the overall system, a partnership with Instrumentation Technologies has been signed. With the extensive experience with the Libera instruments, the company will be engaged in improving the BPM system developed by Elettra and getting it ready for serial production. This paper presents the current status of the BPM system, with an emphasis on the efforts done to improve the key performance of the system and to address its weaknesses (e.g. enhancing single bunch response and low currents sensitivity) within the industrialisation process, with the goal to get to a reliable system, easy to maintain and that meets the multiple project requirements for the new storage ring, the booster, the pre-injector and the transfer lines.

The AWAKE experiment studies the acceleration of electrons to multi-GeV levels driven by the plasma wakefield generated by an ultra-relativistic and high intensity proton bunch. The proton beam, being considerably more intense than the co-propagating electron bunch, perturbs the measurement of the electron beam position achieved via standard techniques. This contribution shows that the electrons position monitoring is possible by frequency discrimination, exploiting the large bunch length difference between the electron and proton beams. Simulations and a beam measurement hint, the measurement has to be carried out in a frequency regime of a few tens of GHz, which is far beyond the spectrum produced by the 1ns long (4 σ Gaussian) proton bunch. As operating a conventional Beam Position Monitor (BPM) in this frequency range is problematic, an innovative approach based on the emission of coherent Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation (ChDR) in dielectrics is being studied. After describing the monitor concept and design, we will report about the results achieved with a prototype system at the CERN electron facility CLEAR.

X-ray FELs deliver rapid pulses on the femtoseconds scale, and high peak intensities that fluctuate strongly on a pulse-to-pulse basis. The fast drift velocity, and high radiation tolerance properties of CVD (chemical vapor deposition) diamonds, make these crystals a good candi-date material for developing a multi-hundred MHz pass-through diagnostic for the next generation of XFELs. Commercially available diamond sensors work as posi-tion-sensitive pass-through diagnostics for nJ-level pulses from synchrotrons. Supported by the University of Cali-fornia and the SLAC National Laboratory, a collaboration of UC campuses and National Laboratories have devel-oped a new approach to the readout of diamond diagnostic sensors designed to facilitate operation for FEL-relevant uJ and mJ pulses. Single-crystal diamond detectors have been tested on the XPP end station of the Linac Coherent Light Source beam at SLAC. We present results on the linearity and charge collection characteristics as a function of the density of deposited charge.

One of the requirements for low-energy RHIC electron cooling (LEReC) is a small relative angle between the ion and electron beams as they co-propagate. In order to minimize relative electron-ion trajectories angle, BPM measurements of both beams must be very accurate. Achieving this requires good electronic calibration of the associated cables and RF components, due to their inherent imperfections. Unfortunately, these are typically frequency dependent, especially in the RF filter and amplifier stages. The spectral content of the ion vs. electron bunch signals varies significantly, presenting a calibration challenge, even when using the same sampling channels and electronics to measure both beams. A scheme of rapidly swapping the BPM signals from the pickup electrodes between the two signal cables (and sampling channels), using switches installed near the BPM was implemented to combat these calibration is-sues. Bias in each signal path appears as an offset which has an equal and opposite component when the cables are reversed. Taking the average of the two measurements with the channels in normal and reverse positions reduces this offset error. Successful transverse cooling of the RHIC ion beam has been verified after using this switching technique to provide continuous calibration of the BPM electronics [1]. Details of the processing hard-ware and switch control methodology to achieve this result will be discussed.

Keeping the beam current’s normal motion is an important mission for Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). So the Orbit (rms)x/y is an main parameter for SSRF’s running. However, the orbital resolution has been constrained by the accuracy of acquired data. To eliminate BPM’s failure causing the inaccurate orbital resolution, the work based on clustering analysis and BP neural network to removed the abnormal BPM and recalculate the resolution of orbit. Data came from the machine research. The analysis results showed that the rms value of orbit is 100.75±6.87 um (x direction) and 14.9±0.6 um (y direction) using all BPM’s data but the recalculate value is 98.03±6 um (x direction) and 2.6±0.4 um (y direction) when eliminate the data of faulty BPM. The analysis result indicated that the method can optimize the resolution of orbit and next work is further to evaluate the orbital resolution with more operation data.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be equipped with two hollow electron lenses (HEL) for the high luminosity upgrade, which allow for scraping of the LHC proton or ion beams transverse tails by overlapping a coaxial hollow electron beam over a 3 m length. A precise alignment of the two beams is essential for the HEL functionality, the bunched LHC hadron beam of up to 7 TeV beam energy, and the non-relativistic, DC-like electron hollow beam of 10 keV energy. The absolute and relative transverse positions of both beams will be monitored by two stripline beam position monitors (BPM), located in the HEL, and the pickup signal processed by a narrowband signal detection system. This paper summarizes the analysis of the expected proton and electron beam signals, including laboratory measurements, with aim of a narrowband diode-detection read-out electronics as BPM signal processor.

The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is both, the final machine in the pre-accelerator chain of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, and a machine providing several experiments with proton and ion beams. In the framework of CERN’s LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project, aimed at improving the performances of the pre-accelerators in view of the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC, the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system of the SPS was redesigned during Run 2 of the LHC and deployed during the subsequent Long Shutdown 2 (LS2). This new system is called ALPS (A Logarithmic Position System) and acquires the signals from some 240 BPMs. It is designed to improve the system’s reliability and reduce the required maintenance with respect to its predecessor. During the restart of the SPS in 2021, the BPM system was a key element of the fast recommissioning of the machine, proving the validity of the chosen design approach and pre-beam commissioning strategy. This paper aims to illustrate the design choices made for ALPS, the strategy for commissioning it with beam in parallel with the machine restart, the commissioning procedure and the results obtained.

In the HL-LHC era, the Interaction Regions around the ATLAS and CMS experiments will be equipped with 24 new Beam Position Monitors (BPM) measuring both counter-propagating beams in a common vacuum chamber. Numerical simulations proved that, despite using new high-directivity stripline BPMs, the required measurement accuracy cannot be guaranteed without bunch-by-bunch disentanglement of the signals induced by both beams. This contribution presents the proposed signal processing architecture, based on direct digitisation of RF waveforms, which optimises the necessary computing resources without a significant reduction of the measurement accuracy. To minimise the number of operations performed on a bunch-by-bunch basis in the FPGA, some of the processing takes place in the CPU using averaged data.

Harmonic Based Beam Position Measurements on Debunched Beams
104

In some accelerator environments, e.g. in linear accelerator (LINAC), the beam position is measured with a BPM operating at one particular strong harmonic component present in the beam signal. This approach has limitations once the beam gets debunched and the harmonic components drops. Nevertheless, from a signal processing point of view the signal-to-noise ratio can be still acceptable with highly debunched beams, leading, in principle, to a reasonable, even if degraded, position measurement. A simplified beam transport model developed for the CERN BI transfer line between LINAC4 and the PS Booster demonstrates, that in some case, the harmonic component cannot be used anymore for position measurement despite the fact it is still significative in amplitude.

As many synchrotron radiation sources, ALBA is also going through an upgrade project. At the same time, the world of BPM electronic is evolving fast to keep up with the stringent requirement of new facilities. In order to follow the situation closely and develop know-how for the future, we decided to install and test in our storage ring a BPM readout system composed by a Pilot-Tone generator (developed by Elettra) and a modified Libera Spark (by Instrumentation Technologies). We compare position measurement results and stability with the ones obtained by our standard Libera Brilliance and a Libera Brilliance+ electronics.

All 18 photon beam position monitors (PBPM) installed on the PLS-II are tungsten blade types. The elliptical polarized undulator (EPU) has the characteristic that the spatial profile of the beam varies depending on the polarization mode. This relates to the thermal load of the blade and changes in the blade material at fixed blade gaps are inevitable. In this paper, we analyze power density and flux density according to EPU mode and describe the process of installing PBPM with CVD-diamond blades on the PLS-II beamline for the first time.

A stripline beam position monitor has been developed with 8 feedthroughs in order to non-destructively measure the momentum spread of an beam. The beam momentum spread causes the variation of transverse beam width at a dispersive section and can be detected by the multipole moment based analysis of the beam-induced electromagnetic field. The feasibility of such a device has been tested with electron beam generated in the beamline of Injector Test Facility (ITF) at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). The result of beam test will be presented and the future plan for an application to bunch compressors at X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) of PAL will be followed.

The Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) for the new Thailand synchrotron light source, Siam Photon Source II (SPS-II), has been designed utilizing as the essential tool for diagnosing the position of the beam in the storage ring. Its design with four-button type BPM has been optimized to obtain the high precision of position data in normal closed orbit and feedback mode as well as turn by turn information. We calculate feedthroughs capacitance, sensitivities, induced power on a 50 Ω load, and intrinsic resolution by using Matlab GUI developed by ALBA, to find the appropriate position, thickness, and gap of the BPM button. Extensive simulation with the electromagnetic simulation tool CST Particle Studio was also performed to investigate the dependence of the induced BPM signal, wakefield, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR), and power loss on different BPM geometry.

The PETRA IV project at DESY aims to upgrade the present synchrotron radiation source PETRA III at DESY into an ultralow-emittance source which will be diffraction limited up to X-rays of about 10 keV. Using a multi bend achromat lattice, the small PETRA beam emittance translates directly into much smaller beam sizes at the insertion device source points, thus imposing stringent requirements on machine stability. In order to measure beam positions and control orbit stability to the requisite level of accuracy, a high resolution BPM system will be installed which consists of about 700 individual monitors with the readout electronics based on MTCA.4 as technical platform. In order to fulfill the requested long-term drift requirement to be less than 1 micron over a period of seven days, due to the PETRA-specific machine geometry the BPM cable paths have to be stabilized in addition. To achieve this demand, the well proven concept of crossbar switching was extended such that the analogue switching part is separated from the read-out electronics and brought as close as possible to the BPM pickup. This contribution summarizes first proof-of-principle measurements which were performed in the lab and at PETRA III using a modified Libera Brilliance+ with external switching matrix. These measurements indicate that the concept of external switching works well and that the performance of this modified test setup fulfills the specifications.

Synchrotron SOLEIL is preparing a machine upgrade based on multibend achromat lattice with a drastically reduced horizontal electron beam emittance (<100 pmrad). Foreseen quadrupole and sextupole strengths will impose a small vacuum chamber diameter and the future Beam Position Monitors (BPM) will have a 16 mm inner diameter (circular shape). To minimize the BPM contribution to the longitudinal impedance, and induced heating on their mechanics, the feedthrough and button shapes must be optimized. This paper summarizes the systematic electromagnetic simulations that have been carried on in order to distinguish the effect of single dimension changes (such as button thickness and shape, ceramic thickness and diameter) on the amplitudes and frequency position of the resonances. It also introduces the preliminary BPM design for the SOLEIL upgrade project.

The hard X-ray and soft X-Ray undulator beamlines of the LCLS-II X-ray FEL incorporate 65 X-band RF beam position monitors for accurate tracking of the electron beam trajectories and Beam-Based Alignment. For this crucial function, a design was jointly developed between PAL and SLAC, consisting of a monopole reference cavity and a dipole position cavity, with signals coupled out through coaxial vacuum feed-throughs. For the relatively large quantity needed, the production of completed units was contracted to the Korean company, Vitzrotech, who developed the manufacturing processes to successfully fabricate the needed quantity. Herein, an overview is given of the production experience, tuning, installation, and performance of these devices.

Construction of a new accelerator is always an opportunity to face challenges and make new developments. The BPM diagnostics installed in the SPIRAL2 linac and the associated instrumentation are part of these developments. BPM instrumentations are, of course, used to measure positions and phases of ion beams but also transverse shapes, called ellipticity, as well as the beam velocity. Specifications involve knowing and calculating the sensitivities in position and in ellipticity as a function of the beam velocities. These impose small amplitude differences between channels, which require precise calibration of electronics. This paper describes the modelling and analysis of the BPM behaviour according to the beam velocity, the technical solutions, modifications and improvements. An analysis of the results and evolutions in progress are also presented.

For the planned upgrade of synchrotron radiation sources PETRA (called PETRA IV) at DESY a much higher beam brilliance is requested. In order to measure according beam positions and to control orbit stability to the corresponding level of accuracy, a future high-resolution BPM system has to deliver the necessary requirements on machine stability. This needs to enable long-term drift requirements of even less than 1 micron beam position deviation per week. Such a specification goal requires an additional long-term drift stabilization of the beam position monitor (BPM) readout scheme for PETRA IV, which will include a compensation of BPM cable parameter drifts. This paper discusses a comparison of two common compensation schemes using different signal conditioning features, typically needed at machine topologies with long BPM cable paths. Certain critical aspects of the different schemes are discussed in this report, while existing successful measurements are referred in some references.

KEK LUCX facility* is a linear accelerator devoted to the beam instrumentation R&Ds for present and future accelerator systems and colliders. Parameters of electron beam generated by laser-driven photocathode-equipped gun are sensitive to laser wavelength, laser pulse intensity, duration (RMS), spot size (RMS) and spot position on the photocathode. Typically, tuning of such generation schema requires stable laser pulse generation and shaping, alignment of the laser transport line (LTL) and final focus optical system. Conventional diagnostics along LTL may include CCD cameras for position and profile tuning and monitoring including that at the virtual cathode position. An approach to achieve laser spot size and position with the high level of stability and reproducibility on the photocathode is associated with the implementation of geometric optics based software protocol which allows for automatic- or semi-automatic alignment of entire LTL. This approach was developed and applied for KEK LUCX RF gun LTL alignment. It employs two CCD cameras**, motorized mirrors and optical telescope designed for laser pulse delivery to the photocathode. The report shows the system stability and repeatability results, as well as commissioning technical notes.

A research program aimed at the production of novel radioisotopes for theranostics is ongoing at the 18 MeV cyclotron laboratory in operation at the Bern University Hospital (Inselspital). A method based on the bombardment of isotope enriched materials in form of compressed 6 mm diameter pellets was developed. To accomplish this challenging goal, accurate knowledge of beam energy, positioning and focusing as well as production cross sections are crucial. Investigations are carried on to assess all these items. In particular, an automatic compact focalization system was conceived and constructed to optimize the irradiation procedure. It is based on a 0.5 m long magnetic system, embedding two quadrupoles and two steering magnets, and a non-destructive beam monitoring detector located in front of the target. The profiles measured by a fiber detector are elaborated by a feedback optimization algorithm that acts on the magnets and keeps the beam focused on target to enhance the production yield. Following the first successful functional tests, the preliminary results on the production of medical radioisotopes are presented.

In order to improve the stability of the beam orbit, the fast orbit feedback system (FOFB) is employed to eliminate the undesirable interference from various sources. The paper will present the design of the design of the global Fast Orbit Feedback for Hefei Advanced Light Facility (HALF). The FOFB system aims to stabilize the electron beam position towards an ideal electron beam orbit. The FOFB system employs high-speed board series PXIe-7902 board of National Instruments (NI) to realize the design of the communication controller (CC) and the algorithm calculation. The PXIe-7902 called cell has a built-in Xilinx Virtex-7 586T and 24 two-way digital channels. Which allows connecting 12 Liberal BPMs at most to receive the beam position values. A two-tier communication architecture is applied in the CC design. The beam position monitors are directly connected to cell and do not communicate each other. Which liberates the tasks of BPMs and make the task concentrated on the cell. The correction output is connected to the power supply to adjust the correctors to reach beam stability.

The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is a 6 GeV synchrotron radiation light source being built in Beijing, China. The electron beam inside the storage ring is designed to run with ultra-low emittance. To ensure high beam quality, the coupled bunch instabilities need to be carefully investigated and controlled, therefore an effective feedback system is essential. Stripline electrodes will be used in HEPS storage ring as transverse feedback kickers. Besides, a tune kicker is designed to measure tune and clean undesired buckets. This paper will introduce the design of these kickers, which mainly includes the optimization of the shunt impedance and reflection parameters within the working bandwidth. The shunt impedance simulated by numerical code HFSS is well coincident with the theoretical results.

The bunch size of HEPS is up to micrometer level, so it is very vulnerable to external interference. FOFB(Fast Orbit Feedback) is used to counteract external interference and improve beam quality. HEPS Fofb independently developed hardware equipment, used to collect 576 BPM data, and then distributed to 192 fast corrector power supply after matrix operation and PI operation. Fofb is divided into 16 sub-sites, each sub-site uses a single circuit main board, each site processes 36 BPM data, 24 (X & Y axis) corrector power supply. Two Xilinx FPGA chips are mounted on the circuit board, one is for high-speed data processing, the other is network transmission and low-speed data processing. Because the single board processing business is very large, there are more than 15 channels of high current and low noise power supply, more than 60 channels of low jitter clock, and tens of centimeters of 10Gbps high-speed transmission path. This paper will introduce the simulation and design of power supply, clock and high-speed transmission in detail.

Since 2015 Alba is equipped with a transverse bunch by bunch feedback system, which not only damps the transverse coupled bunch instabilities in the machine, but also allows the impedance characterization of the storage ring. This characterization is produced by an internal sequence, which is programmed to excite and measure the growth and damping rates of each of the multi-bunch modes. This paper describes the measurement technique, presents the studies carried out to characterize the machine and different movable systems like the scrapers or in-vacuum undulators. Results are compared with the transverse impedance spectra obtained from computer simulations.
