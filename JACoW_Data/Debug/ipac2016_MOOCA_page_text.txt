We have successfully designed, fabricated, installed and tested a super-compact X-Band SLED system at SLAC. It is composed of an elegant mode converter/polarizer and a single sphere energy store cavity with high Q of 94000 and diameter less than 12 cm. The available RF peak power of 50 MW can be compressed to peak average power of more than 200 MW in order to double the kick for the electron bunches in a RF transverse deflector system and greatly improve the measurement resolution for both the electron bunch and the x-ray FEL pulse. High power operation has demonstrated the excellent performance of this RF compression system without any problems in RF breakdown, pulse heating and radiation. The design physics and fabrication as well as the measurement results will be presented in detail.

Vane RFQs are particularly well suited to high intensity proton acceleration, since they offer minimal RF power losses and best accelerating field accuracy. Cea-Irfu is involved in several developments of 4 vane RFQs namely IPHI, Spiral2, Linac4 and ESS. This paper gives an overview of the design flow and tools developed at Irfu in order to design, tune, condition and commission RFQs. SPIRAL2 RFQ will be mainly used to illustrate this design flow. This CW RFQ requires 180 kW to achieve the nominal accelerating voltage. It can accelerate a 5 mA proton or deuteron beam (A/Q=1 and 2) or a 1 mA ion beam with up to A/Q=3 at 0.75 MeV/A. Conditioning and commissioning of this RFQ are actually in progress.

Semiconductor thyristors have long been used as a replacement for thyratrons in low power or long pulse RF systems. To date, however, such thyristor assemblies have not demonstrated the reliability needed for installation in short pulse, high peak power RF stations used with many pulsed electron accelerators. The fast rising current in a thyristor tends to be carried in a small region, rather than across the whole device, and this localized current concentration can cause a short circuit failure. An alternate solid-state device, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), can readily operate at the speed needed for the accelerator, but commercial IGBTs cannot handle the voltage and current required. It is, however, possible to assemble these devices in arrays to reach the required performance levels without sacrificing their inherent speed. Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) has patented and refined the technology required to build these arrays of series-parallel connected switches. DTI is currently developing an affordable, reliable, form-fit-function replacement for the klystron modulator thyratrons at SLAC capable of pulsing at 360 kV, 420 A, 6 μs, and 120 Hz.
