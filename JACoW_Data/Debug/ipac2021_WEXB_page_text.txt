CEA in Kind contribution to the ESS superconducting LINAC includes 30 elliptical medium and high-beta cryomodules. CEA is in charge of the production of all the components (except the cavities delivered by LASA and STFC) as well as the assembly of the cryomodules and a few cryogenic and RF tests. The power couplers operating at a maximum power of 1.1MW on a 3.6ms pulse at 14Hz are conditioned at high RF power on a dedicated stand. The assembly of the cryomodules is performed at CEA by a private Company under the supervision of CEA. This paper presents the status of the cryomodules production and the infrastructure dedicated to this project at CEA Saclay.

The Main Ring (MR) of J-PARC has supplied high-intensity proton beams for the T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment since 2010. The present beam power reaches 515 kW. To observe the CP violation in the lepton sector, more protons need to be delivered to the neutrino target. The project upgrading the beam power to 1.3 MW started in the MR, where hardware upgrades and beam dynamics improvements are scheduled to handle higher repetition and increase protons per pulse. The MR upgrade and the Hyper Kamiokande project, which has recently been approved and started construction, will open up a new phase of leptonic CP violation studies.

Funding: This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357. This research used the ATLAS facility, which is a DOE Office of Nuclear Physics User Facility.
The recently approved multi-user upgrade of the superconducting ion linac, ATLAS, will enable simultaneous acceleration and delivery of two different ion beams to different experimental areas. In the initial phase, one stable, nearly continuous wave, beam from the ECR ion source and one pulsed radioactive beam from the EBIS charge breeder of the Californium Rare Isotope Beam Upgrade (CARIBU-EBIS) will be interleaved in time via an electrostatic deflector at injection, and accelerated through the first two sections of the linac. At that point, one of the beams is deflected via a pulsed switching magnet to a lower energy experimental area while the other is further accelerated through the third linac stage of ATLAS and delivered to a higher energy experimental area. Details of the proposed implementation and the expected gains from this upgrade will be presented. In addition to enhancing the ATLAS nuclear physics program, this upgrade will also increase the availability of beam time for applications such as material irradiation, isotope production R&D, and radiobiology studies with ion beams. A brief overview and typical results from these applications will be presented.

The ARIEL facility is being commissioned to triple the availability of radioactive ion beams with ISAC at TRIUMF. The ARIEL separator and front-end facility also referred to as radioactive ion beam (RIB) transport system, connects the two new ARIEL target stations to the existing ISAC facility. The RIB transport system acts as a switchyard, in excess of 200 meters of beamlines, for delivering two additional simultaneous beams from the two ARIEL target ion sources. The primary optical building blocks of the RIB transport system are the matching, periodic, order-reversing, low-beta-insertion, dogleg, and achromatic bend sections. These blocks consist of electrostatic optical elements such as quadrupole, bender, and steerer. The first phase of the ARIEL installation is completed, and commissioning is well underway. The paper will describe the recent commissioning and early operation results of the ARIEL RIB transport system.

The SPIRAL2 injector includes a 5 mA proton-deuteron ECR source, a 1 mA ECR heavy ion source (up to A/Q =3) and a CW 0.73 MeV/u RFQ. It has been successfully commissioned using a diagnostic-plate in parallel with the superconducting linac installation. The green light has been obtained for the LINAC commissioning in July of 2019, starting with the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) commissioning with protons then with helium in 2020. The MEBT line and tuning process are described. The main experimental results are given, including the emittance and profile measurements which are compared with TraceWin simulations. RFQ output energy variation has been found due to an input energy error, its correction optimizing the source platform voltage is presented.

An inter-digital H-mode drift-tube linac (IH-DTL) is under development in a muon linac at the J-PARC muon g-2/EDM experiment. It accelerates muons from 0.34 MeV to 4.3 MeV at an operating frequency of 324 MHz. The cavity can be miniaturized by introducing the alternative phase focusing (APF) method that enables transverse focusing only with an E-field. The APF IH-DTL cavity was modeled by a three-dimensional field analysis, and the beam dynamics were evaluated numerically. The beam emittance was calculated as 0.316pi and 0.189pi mm mrad in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. It satisfies the experimental requirement. Actually, the field error due to the fabrication errors and thermal expansion during operation causes an emittance growth. It was evaluated that the optimized tuners can suppress the emittance growth to less than 10%. In this paper, the detailed design of the APF IH-DTL including the tuner will be reported.

During Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE) of continuous beams in the Proton Synchrotron (PS) at CERN, losses are generated on the blade of both the active and non-active septum during the rise time of the extraction kickers. Utilising pCVD Diamond detectors, secondary signal generated from these losses is measured. The high time resolution of these devices allows for insight into the detail of the horizontal beam distribution during extraction, and hence useful information such as the horizontal beam emittance may be computed. In this contribution, FLUKA simulations to relate the detector response to the beam impact conditions on the blades of the two septa are presented. The dependence on the beam angle, magnetic fringe field, and positioning of the detector is explored. Finally, realistic beam distributions are used to determine expected signal profiles at each septum.

Comprehensive studies of high intensity proton beams in the 0.4-8 GeV FNAL Booster synchrotron have revealed interesting nonlinear dynamics of the beam losses and emittance growth at the record high dQSC=0.6. We report the results of the studies and directions of further improvements to prepare the Booster to the era of even higher intensity operation with new 0.8 GeV PIP-II linac.
