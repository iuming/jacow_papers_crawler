We present the last advances in the operation and construction of the ESS-Bilbao 3 MeV proton beam injector. The proton ECR source allows to change the distance between the plasma chamber and the first extraction electrode, acceleration gap. The beam has been characterised at different acceleration gaps by current transformers, wire scanners and photographs of 2d profiles. In addition, we present the status of the construction of the RFQ; which is at its beginning.

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is designed to deliver a 1.6GeV proton beam to a solid metal target for neutron scattering research. It will be constructed in two phases. In the 1st phase, the beam power is designed to be 100kW. In the 2nd phase, the beam power will be upgraded to 500kW by doubling the linac output energy and beam current. The accelerator complex consists of a 50keV H− ion source, a 3MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), a 80MeV Drift tube Linac (DTL), and a 1.6GeV rapid-cycling synchrotron (RCS). Until March 2016, the front end and the first tank of DTL have been fully commissioned. The primary design goals of peak current, transverse emittance and beam energy have been achieved. This paper reports on the methods and the results of the commissioning.

The ISIS spallation neutron and muon source has been in operation since 1984. The accelerator complex consists of an H− ion source, 665 keV RFQ, 70 MeV linac, 800 MeV proton synchrotron and associated beam transfer lines. The facility currently delivers ~2.8·1013 protons per pulse (ppp) at 50 Hz, which is shared between two target stations. High intensity performance and operation are dominated by the need to minimise and control beam loss, which is key to sustainable machine operation, allowing essential hands on maintenance. The facility has had several upgrades including an RFQ, ring Second Harmonic RF system, key developments of diagnostics and instrumentation required for improving beam control and a Second Target station. Upgrades being installed, or expected in the near future, include: a ring damping system, a new injector MEBT with fast injection chopper and an upgraded 50 Hz target. Operational experience of ISIS and the impacts of its past and future upgrades are discussed. Ideas for major upgrades to ISIS are briefly reviewed, as are the underlying R&D projects.

The commissioning phase of the IFMIF-EVEDA RFQ requires a complete beam characterization with simulations and measurements of the beam input from the IFMIF-EVEDA ion source and LEBT, in order to reach the RFQ input beam parameters. In this article the simulations of source LEBT RFQ will be reported with the corresponding set of measurements done on the Ion source and LEBT.
