The next ICALEPCS conference will take place in October 2017 in Barcelona, Spain. Barcelona is one of the largest European metropolis on the Mediterranean Sea. It was founded over 2000 years ago and since then it has been the traditional gateway to Spain. In Barcelona, diverse cultures (Greek, Phoenician, Iberian, Roman, Jewish, Arab, Christian) flourished and came to enrich its heritage. Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia and the second largest city in Spain. In just over two decades since it hosted the 1992 Olympic Games, Barcelona has completely transformed its range of facilities and attractions. It has done so by displaying a dynamic character and pioneering spirit, which are palpable in its new urban and architectural layout. The city enjoys mild climatic conditions, and offers the visitor its own unique lifestyle, which is particularly evocative and appealing. ICALEPCS'17 will be organized by the ALBA Synchrotron, the largest scientific infrastructure in Spain, located next to the Autonomous University of Barcelona. ALBA started the operation in 2012 with seven Beamlines and today it has another two in construction and a project for up to six more in the following years. The installation is funded on a 50-50% basis by the Spanish and the Catalan governments.
