New Horizons in Nuclear Science: GANIL and Beyond

GANIL-SPIRAL2 is the only facility in the world today which provides high intensity stable beams, beams of short lived nuclei produced both by the Isotope Separation On Line and in-flight separation technique and soon intermediate energy neutron beams. The heavy-ion accelerator complex of 5 cyclotrons delivers stable beams (C to U) from 1 to 95 MeV/A. The new LINAC will provide the most intense beams from protons to Ni up to 14 MeV/A. These facilities allow the investigation of the nucleus under a variety conditions in excitation energy, angular momentum and neutron-proton ratios. Key questions in the field can be summarized as i) understanding of how regular and simple patterns emerge in the intrinsic structure of nuclei ii) identifying the degrees of freedom, which govern the dynamics of their collisions. The status of the beam commissioning of the SPIRAL2 superconducting accelerator and the corresponding experimental facilities and upgrades for reaccelerated rare ion beams at GANIL will be presented. The talk will also highlight some recent results illustrating their impact at a variety of energy and distance scales from the study of the quantum many body systems, the nucleus.

The European Strategy for Particle Physics is regularly being reviewed and updated. The presently conducted update is planned to be completed by time of the IPAC20 in May 2020. The speaker will explain the process of the strategy update. Major conclusions are presented and the updated strategy for the future of particle physics and CERN is discussed. In particular the needs for future particle accelerator technologies and R&D In Europe but also world-wide are presented.

Synchrotron light sources and free-electron lasers are at the heart of the rapidly evolving and growing field of accelerator-based x-ray science. The latest developments in this field are presented. The use of particle accelerators is discussed and put in the context of competitive technologies: electron diffraction and microscopy and laser-based photon science. Advantages and disadvantages of various technologies are explored. Requirements for new x-ray sources that will drive accelerator research and development are discussed, focusing on the big challenges ahead.

Accelerator R&D as a Driver for Science
 


 

S.M. Cousineau

Since it’s emergence in the first half of the twentieth century, the field of accelerator science has supported an active and expanding R&D program leading to many advances in accelerator capability. This has resulted in extraordinary scientific discoveries in nuclear physics, particle physics, materials science, and related fields. Through a series of case examples, this talk will highlight the relationship between scientific accomplishment and the enabling transformative accelerator R&D, both historically and in recent years. It will provide a perspective on common trends and timescales for accelerator R&D, and will discuss accelerator R&D as a driver for both planned and unplanned scientific discovery.

Permanent Magnets for Accelerators
1


 

B.J.A. Shepherd

Several groups internationally have been designing and building adjustable permanent magnet based quad-rupoles for light sources, colliders, and plasma accelera-tors because of their very high gradients and zero power consumption. There are now examples of widely adjusta-ble PM dipoles too. The ZEPTO project, based at STFC Daresbury Laboratory, developed several highly adjusta-ble PM-based dipole and quadrupole prototypes for CLIC, and is now building a quadrupole to be installed in Diamond to gain experience ahead of the Diamond-2 upgrade. This is a review and comparison of the recent designs globally with comments on the future prospects.
