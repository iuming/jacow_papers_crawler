Double-slit interferometry using visible light has been used for measuring the transverse beam size in different accelerators. The beam size is inferred from the analysis of the spatial coherence of the synchrotron light produced by a bending magnet. At ALBA, this technique has been implemented with moderate success, mainly limited by the present imperfections in the in-vacuum mirror that is used to extract the light out of the vacuum chamber. In this paper, we report the results obtained with the current set-up, and discuss possible improvements.

The C-ADS project is a strategic plan to solve the nuclear waste problem and the resource problem for nuclear power plants in China. The first step of this project is to build two 5-MeV test CW linac. The institute of Modern physics (IMP) is in charge of designing one of them. In order to measure the beam profile in this linac, a wire scanner system was designed and tested. In this paper, the mechanical design and control system of this wire scanner system are introduced. A real-time, closed loop control system is being developed and tested for more repeatable and accurate positioning of beam sense wires. All of the electronic and computational duties are handled in one the National Instruments compact RIO real-time chassis with a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The beam test result of this system in IMP 320 KV beam line was present. The test result of this system and the measured beam profile result are discussed in this paper.

Gas targets are important for a number of accelerator-based applications, in particular as cold targets for collision experiments and beam diagnostics purposes where gas jets have been successfully used as least intrusive beam profile monitors, however, detailed information about the gas jet is important for its optimization and the quality of the beam profile that can be measured with it. A laser velocimeter shall be used for an in-detail characterization of atomic and molecular gas jets and allow investigations into the jet dynamics. Existing methods are currently not efficient enough, hard to build, and rather expensive. A laser velocimeter based on the self-mixing technique can provide unambiguous measurements from a single interferometric channel, realizable in a compact experimental setup that can be installed even in radiation-exposed environments. In this contribution, an introduction to the underlying theory of self-mixing is given, before the design and functioning principle of the velocimeter is described in detail. Finally, preliminary experimental results with different solid targets are presented and an outlook on measurements with fluid and gaseous targets is given.

Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) is emitted when a charged particle crosses the interface between two media with different dielectric properties. It has become a standard tool for beam imaging and transverse beam size measurements. At the KEK Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2), OTR is used at the beginning of the final focus system to measure a micrometre beam size using the decrease in visibility of the OTR Point Spread Function (PSF). In order to study and improve the resolution of the optical system, a novel simulation tool has been developed in order to characterize the PSF in detail. Based on the physical optic propagation mode of ZEMAX, the propagation of the OTR electric field can be simulated very precisely up to the image plane, taking into account aberrations and diffraction coming through the designed optical system. This contribution will show the results of measurements performed after a first improvement of the ATF2 OTR optical design to confirm the very high resolution of the imaging system and the performance of this simulation tool.

The laser plasma acceleration (LPA) experiments produce very intensive electromagnetic pulses (EMP) complicating operation of sensitive electronic detectors. We present our experience with new optical readout and EMP shielding for hybrid silicon pixel detector Timepix*, which enabled its operation in an extremely hostile electromagnetic LPA environment. The Timepix detector provides a matrix of 256x256 spectroscopic channels with 55 μm pitch. An optical readout, battery powering and shielding against electromagnetic pulses (EMP) have been developed as part of the ELI Beamlines/IEAP project for the detector Timepix and it significantly improved its resistance to EMP with respect to previous setup using metallic cables for both data acquisition and powering. The new optical setup was successfully tested under vacuum at Prague Asterix Laser System (PALS) during experiments with laser pulses of energies up to 700 J and duration of 350 ps bombarding thin foil solid target. Electromagnetic field was measured both outside the vacuum chamber and inside. The recorded spectrometric data were analyzed and interpreted in a context of an independent experimental campaign run in parallel.

A new linac is commissioned at DESY mainly as the electron source for femtosecond electron diffraction facility REGAE (Relativistic Electron Gun for Atomic Exploration). REGAE enables studies on structural dynamics of atomic transition states occurring in the sub-hundred femtosecond time-scale. REGAE comprises a photo-cathode gun followed by normal conducting 1.5 cell rf-cavity to provide sub pC electron-bunches of 2-5 MeV with a coherence length of 30nm. In order to produce and maintain such electron bunches, sophisticated single-shot diagnostics are desired e.g. emittance, energy, energy-spread and bunch-length measurement. REGAE rep-rate can be up to 50 Hz. This relatively high rep-rate makes it more challenging to deal with low intensity detection especially in single-shot mode. In this contribution the conceptual ideas, realization and results of transversal diagnostics will be presented.

In order to preserve the transverse beam emittance along the acceleration chain it is important that the optics of the transfer lines is perfectly matched to the optics of the rings. Special monitors capable of measuring the beam profiles with a turn by turn resolution are very helpful in this respect. A new type of matching monitor has been developed at CERN for the SPS and LHC machines. This monitor relies on imaging OTR light by mean of a fast line scan CMOS and an asymmetric optical system based on cylindrical lenses. This contribution describes the design of this monitor, presents the results obtained during the 2012-13 run and outlines the plans for further improving the design.

The LHC is equipped with two synchrotron radiation systems, one per beam, used to measure the transverse bunch distributions. The light emitted by a superconducting undulator and/or by a dipole magnet (depending on beam energy) is intercepted by an extraction mirror in vacuum and sent through a viewport to the imaging Beam Synchrotron Radiation Telescope (BSRT). The first version of the telescope, used from 2009 to mid 2012, was based on spherical focusing mirrors in order to minimize chromatic aberrations. However, this required a very complicated delay line in order to switch the focus between the two different light sources as a function of beam energy. A new system based on optical lenses was designed and installed in mid 2012 in order to simplify the optical line and thus reduce misalignment and focusing errors. The first results with LHC beam using this new system showed a significant reduction in the correction factor required to match the emittance as measured by wire scanners. This contribution discusses the performance of the new optical system, presenting the LHC results and comparing simulations with measurement performed in the laboratory using a BSRT replica.

The Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) will use a novel acceleration scheme in which energy extracted from a very intense beam of relatively low-energy electrons (the Drive Beam) is used to accelerate a lower intensity Main Beam to very high energy. The high intensity of the Drive Beam, with pulses of more than 1015 electrons, poses a challenge for conventional profile measurements such as wire scanners. Thus, new non-invasive profile measurements are being investigated. Profile monitors using gas ionisation or fluorescence have been used at a number of accelerators. Typically, extra gas must be injected at the monitor and the rise in pressure spreads some distance down the beampipe. In contrast, a gas jet can be fired across the beam into a receiving chamber, with little gas escaping into the rest of the beam pipe. In addition, a gas jet shaped into a thin plane can be used like a screen on which the beam cross-section is imaged. In this paper we present some arrangements for the generation of such a jet. In addition to jet shaping using nozzles and skimmers, we propose a new scheme to use matter-wave interference with a Fresnel Zone Plate to bring an atomic jet to a narrow focus.

The high intensity of the Drive Beam, with pulses of more than 1015 electrons, poses a challenge for conventional profile measurements such as wire scanners. Thus, new non-invasive profile measurements are being investigated. In this paper we propose the use of relatively inexpensive permanent-magnet undulators to generate off-axis visible Synchrotron Radiation from the CLIC Drive Beam. The field strength and period length of the undulator should be designed such that the on-axis undulator wavelength is in the ultra-violet. A smaller but still useable amount of visible light is then generated in a hollow cone. This light can be reflected out of the beam pipe by a ring-shaped mirror placed downstream and imaged on a camera. In this contribution, results of SRW and ZEMAX simulations using the CLIC Drive Beam parameters are shown.

The FAIR facility will provide intense primary beams of protons and heavy ions, or secondary beams of antiproton and rare isotopes. The operation includes fixed-target experiments or subsequent facilities of independent storage rings and experiment beam lines. The particle beams greatly differ in ion species, intensity, time structure, spot size and stopping power. Therefore, transverse beam profile measurements require a careful choice of detector type for each location in order to cope with the large dynamic range and operational demands. This contribution presents the actual status of FAIR detector developments for intercepting devices (SEM-Grids, Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers, Scintillating Screens) as well as non-intercepting Beam Induced Fluorescence Monitors and Ionization Profile Monitors. Recently, promising results were obtained with slow extracted heavy ion beams in measurements of optical transmission radiation emitted from thin metal foils. The boundaries for the application area are described and basic detector parameters are summarized.

For quantitative transverse ion beam profile measurement, imaging properties of scintillation screens have been investigated for the working conditions of the GSI linear accelerator. In the ion energy range between 4.8 and 11.4 MeV/u the imaging properties of the screens are compared with profiles obtained using standard techniques like SEM grids and scraper. Detailed investigations with e.g. Calcium and Argon ion beams on various radiation-hard materials show that the measured beam profiles can differ from those measured with standard methods and depend on several beam and material parameters *. For the practical usage of scintillators, it is necessary to have predictions for the response of the scintillator to a given ion beam. An existing model for the light output of scintillators for single particle irradiation has been extended to include the effect of overlapping excitation tracks. To validate the model, dedicated measurements with well-defined Carbon and Titanium ion beams at 11.4 MeV/u have been carried out. To understand the mechanisms, the beam flux and the pulse length has been varied. The measured light yield is compared to the model calculations.

Advanced uses of a Current Transformer and a Multi-Wire Profile Monitor for Online Monitoring of the Stripper Foil Degradation in the 3-GeV RCS of J-PARC

We have established advanced and sophisticated uses of a Current Transformer (CT) and a Multi-Wire Profile Monitor (MWPM) for measuring as well as online monitoring of the stripper foil degradation during user operation of the 3-GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) in Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). An incoming negative hydrogen beam from the Linac is stripped to a proton beam by using a stripper foil placed in the RCS injection area. Foil degradation such as, foil thinning and pinhole formation are believed to be signs of a foil breaking. A sudden foil breaking is not only a load on the accelerator downtime but also raises maintenance issues. In a high intensity accelerator like RCS, a proper monitoring system of the foil is thus important in order to avoid such above issues by replacing the foil with a new one in the scheduled maintenance day. The thickness of the stipper foil used for the present 181 MeV injection energy is 200 ug/cm2, where a change of foil thickness as low as 1% or even less has already been successfully monitored by utilizing the presented method. Measured data for the last 6 months operation of the RCS will be presented.

The laserwire system at the Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) is a transverse beam profile measurement system capable of measuring a micrometre-size electron beam. We present recent results demonstrating a measured vertical size of 1.16 ± 0.06 μm and a horizontal size of 110.1 ± 3.8 μm. Due to the high aspect ratio of the electron beam, the natural divergence of the tightly focussed laser beam across the electron beam width requires the use of the full overlap integral to deconvolve the scans. For this to be done accurately, the propagation of the 150 mJ, 167 ps long laser pulses was precisely measured at a scaled virtual interaction point.

We have previously reported * on transverse beam profile measurements where dynamic range (DR) was increase by a factor of 100 from typical 500 to about 5.0x104. It was shown that for non-equilibrium beam with non-Gaussian transverse distribution the RMS beam size can depend significantly on the DR used for calculations. Consequently, measured emittance and Twiss parameters depend on the DR as well. For the optical system used in * diffraction limits the DR at the level slightly above the 5.0x104 used in measurements. For further increase of the DR spatial filters needs to be used in a way similar to original solar coronagraph ** and its application to the synchrotron radiation measurements ***. To increase overall sensitivity to allow large dynamic range measurements with low duty cycle tune-up beam, our systems includes an image intensifier. On contrary to a coronagraph-like scheme, where central bright part of the distribution is not measured, our systems is intended for simultaneous, complete distribution measurements including the bright core and low amplitude halo, which is needed for proper beam size measurements. Here design considerations for the system are presented.

The Australian Synchrotron upgraded its user mode from decay mode to top-up mode in May 2012. To monitor the beam charge passing through the accelerator systems at key transfer points the transmission efficiency system has been upgraded. The original system could only measure the efficiency of the booster to storage ring injection. The new one calculates intermediate efficiencies between six points along the injection system, from the electron gun to the booster-to-storage ring transfer line. This is helpful to diagnose in real-time shot-to-shot the performance of the pulsed magnets, ramped magnets and ramped RF systems and their associated triggers. A software-based injection efficiency interlock has also been introduced, that can inhibit the gun when the machine settings are not optimal. This article details the architecture of the injection efficiency system and lists the improvements on the machine that have been carried out to obtain high quality data.

The bunch purity is very important for time-resolved experiments. It is determined by the quality of the injection system and Touschek effect. The Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPC) II was constructed for both high energy physics (HEP) and synchrotron radiation (SR) researches. It can be operated in the colliding mode and synchrotron radiation mode. It is planned to measure the beam quality in a short time of several minutes by using a timecorrelated single photon counting method. The method has a time resolution of 450 ps and a dynamic range of five orders of magnitude. In this paper, we describe our experimental set up and give a series of test results for colliding mode. We plan to set up a system which can kick out the unwanted bunches in the next stage.

The Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ) focuses on testing, characterizing and optimizing high brightness electron sources for free electron lasers. Among various diagnostic tools installed at PITZ, the tomography module is used to reconstruct the transverse phase-space distribution of the electron beam by capturing its projections while rotating in the normalized phase space. This technique can resolve the two transverse planes simultaneously with an improved signal-to-noise ratio, allowing measurements of individual bunches within a bunch train with kicker magnets. The low emittance, high charge density and moderate energy of the electron bunch at PITZ contribute to significant space-charge forces which induce mismatches to the reconstruction procedure. This study investigates how the phase-space transformations and thus the reconstruction result are affected when considering linear and non-linear self-fields along the tomography section for the design Twiss parameters. The described analysis proposes a preliminary approach for including the effect of space charge in the tomographic reconstruction at PITZ.

As a charged particle beam passes through structures, wake fields can deposit a fraction of the energy carried by the beam as characterised by the wake loss factor. Some part of the deposited energy will be emitted into the beam pipe, some part can be coupled out of signal ports and some part will be absorbed by the materials of the structures. With increasingly higher stored currents, we require a better understanding of where all the energy deposited by wake losses ends up in order to avoid damaging components. This is of particular concern for diagnostics structures as they are often designed to couple a small fraction of energy from the beam, which makes them susceptible to thermal damage due to increased localised losses. We will detail the simulation and analysis approach which we have developed to quantify power deposition within structures. As an example the analysis of a beam position monitor pickup block of the Diamond storage ring is shown.

At CERN, the circulating beam current measurement is provided by two types of transformers, the Direct Current Current Transformers (DCCT) and the Fast Beam Current Transformers (FBCT). Each type of transformer requires different magnetic characteristics regarding parameters such as permeability, coercivity and shape of the magnetization curve. Each transformer is built based on toroidal cores of a magnetic material which gives these characteristics. For example, DCCTs consist of three cores, two for the measurement of the DC component and one for the AC component. In order to study the effect of changes in these parameters on the current transformers, several interesting raw materials based on their as-cast properties were selected with the annealing process used to tune their properties for the individual needs of each transformer. First annealing tests show that the magnetization curve, and therefore the permeability, of the material can be modified, opening the possibility for building and studying a variety of transformer cores.

In the low-energy Antiproton Decelerator (AD) and the future Extra Low ENergy Antiproton (ELENA) rings at CERN, an absolute measurement of the beam intensity is essential to monitor any losses during the deceleration and cooling phases. However, existing DC current transformers can hardly reach the μA level, while at the AD and ELENA currents can be as low as 100 nA. A Cryogenic Current Comparator (CCC) based on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) is currently being designed and shall be installed in the AD and ELENA machines. It should meet the following specifications: A current resolution smaller than 10 nA, a dynamic range covering currents between 100 nA and 1 mA, as well as a bandwidth from DC to 1 kHz. Different design options are being considered, including the use of low or high temperature superconductor materials, different CCC shapes and dimensions, different SQUID characteristics, as well as electromagnetic shielding requirements. In this contribution we present first results from a comparative analysis of different monitor options, taking into consideration the external electromagnetic sources at the foreseen device locations.

Taiwan Light Source (TLS) is a 1.5 GeV synchrotron based light source and its booster synchrotron was delivered in 1992. Initial booster tune measurement which adopted extraction kicker as beam excitation and use digital oscillator to extract tune was obsolete. Recently, the beam excitation device has been modified to provide more effective excitation strength and new BPM electronics is adopted to acquire tune for routine booster tune measurement. It also provides a chance to experience for the TPS project booster prototype with the similar infrastructure. Efforts will be summarized in the report.

TRIUMF is building VECC, the first stage of a 50 MeV electron linac. Beam diagnostic devices will be inserted radially into 8-port vacuum boxes. RF shields, 6.3 cm dia. tubes perforated by pump out slots, can be inserted to reduce wakefields. They will also serve as capacitive probes picking up harmonics of the 650 MHz bunch rate. 100 mV P/P was measured for 3 mA at 100 kV. A SC cavity will accelerate the beam to 10 MeV. The dump current is limited by the shielding to 300 W. We will use a 3 mA beam at 1% duty cycle. Two RF shields will monitor the current. A newly developed circuit will give dc outputs proportional to the peak and average current. It uses a log detector with range of 70 dB for 1 dB of error and a rise and fall time of ~20 ns. Terasic development boards process the log signal. It is digitized by a 14-bit ADC at a 50 MHz rate and passed to a FPGA programmed in Verilog. Altera Megafunctions offset, scale, convert to floating point, antilog and filter the signal in a pipeline architecture. Two 14-bit DACs provide the outputs. Digital processing maintains the wide dynamic range. Beam pulses can be <250 ns and the sample rate insures accuracy at low duty cycle.

The knowledge of linear and non-linear errors in circular accelerator optics is very crucial for controlling and compensating resonances and their consequent beam losses. This is indispensable, especially for high intensity machines. Fortunately, the relationship between the recorded beam offset signals at the BPMs is a manifestation of the accelerator optics, and can therefore be exploited in the determination of the optics linear and non-linear components. We propose a novel method for estimating lattice non-linear components located in-between the positions of two BPMs by analyzing the beam offset signals of a BPMs triple containing these two BPMs. Depending on the non-linear components in-between the locations of the BPMs triple, the relationship between the beam offsets follows a multivariate polynomial. After calculating the covariance matrix of the polynomial terms, the Generalized Total Least Squares method is used to find the model parameters, and thus the non-linear components. Finally, a bootstrap technique is used to determine confidence intervals of the estimated values. Results for synthetic data are shown.

Hadron therapy allows for precise dose delivery to the tumour volume only and hence decreases the dose delivered to the nearby organs and healthy tissue. Ideally, the beam would be monitored whilst being delivered to the patient. A novel, real–time and non-interceptive beam monitor for hadron therapy beams has been developed in the QUASAR Group. It is based on the LHCb VErtex LOcator (VELO) detector and couples to the treatment beam’s transverse halo to determine the intensity, position and ultimately the dose of the treatment beam. This contribution presents the design of a stand-alone version of the VELO detector which was developed for the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre (CCC) treatment line. The mechanical and electronic design of the monitor and its data acquisition system are shown, with a focus on the detector positioning and cooling system. Monte Carlo simulations into expected signal distributions are compared against first measurements with the 60 MeV proton beam at CCC.

The phenomenon that currently prevents achieving high accelerating gradients in high energy accelerators such as the CLIC linear collider is electrical breakdown at very high electrical field. The ongoing experimental work is trying to benchmark the theoretical models focusing on the physics of vacuum breakdown which is responsible for the discharges. The CLIC collaboration has commissioned a dedicated 12 GHz test-stand to validate the feasibility of accelerating structures and observe the characteristics of the RF discharges and their eroding effects on the structure. A versatile system for detection of the dark and breakdown currents and light emission is being developed for the test-stand. It consists of a collimation system with an external magnetic spectrometer for measurement of the spatial and energy distributions of the electrons emitted from the acceleration structure during a single RF pulse. These measurements can be correlated with e.g. the location of the breakdown inside the structure using information from the incident, reflected and transmitted RF powers giving a complete picture of the vacuum breakdown phenomenon.

The installation of the Electron Lenses in RHIC will be completed this year. Its design includes a series of drift tubes through which the electron beam copropagates, with the RHIC proton beams. These drift tubes are used to create an electric field gradient to sweep out ions that become trapped within the central magnetic field where the electron beam interacts with the proton beams. These isolated drift tubes are biased by high voltage power supplies. Without a path for the proton beam image currents, high voltages will develop on the drift tubes that can be detrimental to the electron beam and increase the RHIC machine impedance. This paper presents the design of the drift tubes, axial electric field gradient, and the custom high voltage RF bias tees that were designed to provide separate paths for the high frequency image currents and the DC high voltage bias over the same cables. The design and simulation of the bias tee is discussed, as well as RF signals from the proton beam current imaged on the drift tubes, as measured through the bias tees during the commissioning of the blue RHIC beam electron lens this past spring.

Gated turn-by-turn monitor system to measure optics functions using non-colliding bunch has been developed for SuperKEKB accelerators. With the fast, glitch cancelling beam switch, beam position of the target bunch will be measured without affecting the fine COD measurement using narrow-band detectors. The gate timing and the bunch position detection are controlled by the Spartan-6 FPGA. The performance of the system, such as the gate timing jitter, data transfer speed from the system to EPICS IOC and the noise effect to the downstream narrow-band detector are reported.

ADS are considered as prospective nuclear installations for energy production and nuclear waste transmutation or recycling. The international project “Energy and Transmutation Radioactive Wastes” running in the Laboratory of High Energy Physics at JINR (Dubna, Russia) at the accelerator complex “Nuclotron” is aimed at a feasibility study of using a deeply subcritical natural or depleted uranium or thorium active core with very hard neutron spectrum inside for effective burning of the core material together with spent nuclear fuel. For any ADS experiment a necessary and a key element is beam diagnostics. In this paper a technique for precise measurement of deuteron beam parameters using SSNTD, developed within the bounds of “E&T RAW” project, is presented. The deuteron beam parameters, specifically beam shape, size and position on a target, are obtained from track density distribution on the irradiated track detectors. The presented technique has a resolution of 1 mm. The experimental results of beam parameter measurements for deuterons with energies of 2, 4 and 8 GeV at the irradiation of the uranium subcritical assembly “QUINTA”, obtained with the SSNTD technique, are presented.
