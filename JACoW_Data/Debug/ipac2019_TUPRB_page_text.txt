A pulsed system capable of delivering up to a few microampere bursts of ions with mass range M=1 - 100 amu with a duration of approximately 1 ns is described. The system consists of a negative ion source, three frequency harmonic buncher - which uses the entire tandem electrostatic accelerator as a drift path to produce bunched ion bursts at the targets or linac entry - and high energy choppers. The buncher consists of a single acceleration gap with aligned retractable grids.

The CompactLight project supported by European H2020 is to design a hard X-ray FEL facility beyond today’s state of the art. The project integrates photo injector, X-band acceleration and innovative compact short-period undulators together to make the machine more compact. RF undulator has an extraordinary advantage of working at very short undulator period. A conceptual design for a RF undulator at 36 GHz using a corrugated cylindrical waveguide operating in the HE11 mode is presented in this paper. Based on beam dynamics simulation and photon beam radiation simulations, the possibility of RF undulator to be used in CompactLight project is evaluated.

Assembly and shimming have completed for a pair of long period APPLE-II type elliptically polarized undulators, QP-EPU180 and EPU142, at the Canadian Light Source. Both devices were shimmed using a weighted cost single-objective simulated annealing algorithm, with shims generated iteratively based on Hall probe and flipping coil data. In this paper we present detailed measurements on the two EPUs, including their magnetic and spectral performance across a wide range of gap and polarization operating points, as well as measured and predicted changes in field due to the virtual shimming.

Magnetic Measurements of Insertion Devices Using the Vibrating Wire Technique
1683

The commissioning of new in-vacuum insertion devices (ID) at the Canadian Light Source has motivated the assembly and development of a vibrating wire system. The advantage of the technique is that it is a sensitive magnetic measurement instrument at relatively low cost. Moreover, most hall probe systems require transverse access, which is often not available for in-vacuum or Delta-like devices. It is comparatively simple to string a taut wire through the gap of an in-vacuum ID. We describe the experimental challenges in mapping the field of an 80 mm period in-vacuum wiggler, IVW80, using the vibrating wire technique, and compare results against simulation and data obtained from Hall probe measurements.

Photon Polarisation Modelling of APPLE-II EPUs
1687

The CLS is currently commissioning two APPLE-II in-sertion devices (IDs), see [1], and constructing two more that allow for operation in ’universal mode’, i.e. selecting arbitrary photon polarisation parameters. Two of these devices will operate in the soft x-ray range where there is expected to be a significant change to polarisation at the sample due to transmission effects of the beam line op-tics. Arbitrary polarisation selection of the ID will counter transmission effects and enable circular polarisation at the sample position. A polarisation model of the device is derived which allows for the calculation of both the Stokes parameters and photon energy for any set point of ID gap and phase. Numerical solutions of these equa-tions allow the calculation of gap and phase set points for any desired photon energy or polarisation. The results of the polarisation model are compared with numerical simulations of the synchrotron radiation calculated using measured magnetic fields at various polarisation modes.

The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe cannot be explained by the Standard Model. An explanation is a non-vanishing Electric Dipole Moment of subatomic particles. The JEDI (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) collaboration is preparing a direct EDM measurement of protons and deuterons first at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron) and later at a dedicated storage ring. To achieve this, one needs a stable polarization, i.e. around 1000 seconds for spin coherence time. One source of decoherence are the electrostatic deflectors, and this must be quantified. We developed an analytical model for cylindrical deflectors, including fringe fields, and the associated beam and spin transfer functions, integrated over the deflector. All boundaries (including ground) are considered, giving a realistic, accurate field map up to any order. We get universal formulas, the only adjustable parameter being the deflector gap/radius ratio, all other terms being numerical. This has been implemented in BMAD. We present the mathematical, physical and numerical developments, as well as results for a proton storage ring.

The proposed experiment aims to measure QED in the presence of strong fields and above the Schwinger critical field. An experiment is being considered at the European XFEL, which should be able to measure non-perturbative QED and its transition from the perturbative regime. This paper presents the current status of the LUXE (Laser und XFEL Experiment) design study. First layout considerations; accelerator beam line design, electron and laser beam parameters, radioprotection issues and first results of the start to end simulations will be presented and discussed in detail. An outlook concerning the implementation into the XFEL schedule and timeline of this experiment will be given.

After the successful commissioning of the European XFEL in pulsed mode, continuous wave (CW) mode operation of European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) is under considerations for future upgrade. DESY is push-ing R&D on CW electron sources. A fully superconducting CW gun is under experimental development at DESY in Hamburg, and a normal conducting (NC) CW gun is under physics design at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a backup option. A 217 MHz NC CW gun is developed from the LBNL 187 MHz VHF gun, with enhancement on both cathode gradient and gun voltage to further improve beam brightness. This paper presents the cavity RF design, multipacting (MP) simula-tions and beam dynamics studies.

The Radiation Source ELBE at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) is a user facility based on a 1 mA - 40 MeV CW SRF LINAC. Presently HZDR is considering upgrade options for the ELBE or its replacement with a new CW, SRF LINAC-based user facility. A part of the user requirements is the capability to generate IR and THz pulse in the frequency range from 0.1 through 30 THz, with pulse energies in the range from 100 uJ through a few mJ, at the repetition rate between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. This corresponds to the pulse energy increase, dependent on the wavelength by a factor from 100 through 1000. In this contribution, we outline key aspects of a concept, which would allow to achieve such parameters. Such key aspects are: 1 - use of a beam with longitudinal density modulation and bunching factor of about 0.5 at the fundamental frequency; 2 - achieving the density modulation through the mechanism similar to the one used in optical klystron (OK) and HGHG FEL; 3 - generating necessary for the modulation optical beam by an FEL oscillator, and 4 - using two electron injectors, where one injector provides beam for the FEL oscillator while second high charge injector provides beam for the high energy per pulse generation for user experiments. All-in-all the concept of the new radiation source is very similar to an OK, but operating with two beams simultaneously.

Echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) is a promising technique for seeded free electron lasers (FELs) not only to go down to wavelengths of 4 nm, but also to simplify the schemes that are currently used to achieve a similar wavelength range (double cascade HGHG). Thus a study optimizing the EEHG performance in the wavelength range from 60 to §I{4}{nm} has been performed. The more critical working point, at 4 nm, is here analyzed in terms of seed laser energy stability for two different seed laser frequencies: visible and UV.

The magnetic field quality has a strong impact on the performance of insertion devices (IDs) when installed in synchrotron light sources. Superconducting IDs have the advantage to produce a higher magnetic peak field for a given gap and period length than IDs assembled with permanent magnets. Before installation of a superconducting ID in a synchrotron light source it is of fundamental importance to characterize the magnetic properties by accurate field and field integral measurements. We follow this aim within our R&D program for superconducting undulators (SCUs). In this contribution, we describe the equipment and the challenges of a cryogenic, in vacuum measurement setup to perform magnetic measurements of the local field, the field integrals and the multipole components of in vacuum SCUs assembled in the final cryostat.

A free-electron laser based THz source is undergoing design studies at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ). It is considered as a prototype for pump-probe experiments at the European XFEL, benefiting from the fact that the electron beam from the PITZ facility has an identical pulse train structure as the XFEL pulses. In the proposed proof-of-principle experiment, the electron beam (up to 4 nC bunch charge and 200 A peak current) will be accelerated to 16-22 MeV/c to generate SASE radiations in an LCLS-I undulator in the THz range between 60 and 100 µm with an expected energy of up to ~1 mJ/pulse. In this paper, we report our simulations on the optimization of the photo-injector and the design of the transport and matching beamline. Experimental investigations on the generation, characterization and matching of the high charge beam in the existing 22-m-long beamline will also be presented.

Beam halo collimation is of great importance for the high repetition rate operation at the European XFEL and for the future CW machines. At the European XFEL several different types of collimators are installed at different locations of the beam line, which include the gun collimators, the bunch compressor collimators, and the main and supplementary collimators in the collimation section. Beam halo measurements have been performed using the wire scanners downstream of the main linac, which show that large part of beam halo is collimated by the gun collimator. Remaining losses in the collimation section are mainly due to misalignment. Alignment using orbit bumps in the collimation section is performed and presented in this paper.

Radiation damage of the undulators is a big concern for the light sources. At the European XFEL (EuXFEL), dosimeters based on on-line Radfets are used for the un-dulator radiation dose measurements. However, since the Radfets are not only sensitive to the electrons and neu-trons but also to the photons, it can capture the synchro-tron radiation (SR) generated in the undulators, which is not considered to be the main source for undulator radia-tion damage. Therefore, it is important to estimate the contribution of synchrotron radiation to the radiation doses measured by the Radfets. For this purpose, we have first calculated the synchrotron radiation profile using SPECTRA, and then put the profile into the tracking code BDSIM to track it through the whole undulator beam line. The radiation doses from SR have been simulated and compared with the measured values. The differences in the radiation doses measured by the Radfets before and after Pb shielding will also be presented.

Insertion devices are one of the key components of modern synchrotron radiation facilities. They allow for generation of radiation with superior properties enabling experiments in a variety of disciplines, such as chemistry, biology, crystallography and physics to name a few. For future cutting edge experiments in soft and tender x-rays users require high flux and variable Polarization over a wide photon energy range independent of other desired properties like variable pulse length, variable timing or Fourier transform limited pulses. In this paper, we propose a novel ID-structure, called Triple Period Undulator (TPU), which allow us to deliver a wide energy range from a few ten eV to a few keV at the same beamline with high flux and variable Polarization. The TPU are particularly interesting in context of BESSY III, the successor facility of BESSY II.

The European XFEL is a multi-user X-ray FEL facility based on superconducting linear accelerator. Presently, three undulators (SASE1, SASE2, SASE3) routinely deliver high-brightness soft- and hard- X-ray beams for users. There are two empty undulator tunnels that were originally designed to operate with spontaneous radiators in the range 20-90 keV. We consider, instead a possible installation of two FEL undulators. One of them (SASE4) is proposed for operation in a standard (7-25 keV) range as well as in ultrahard (25-100 keV) regime. We discuss a possible location and length of SASE4, modifications of electron beam transport, beam dynamics, choice of undulator technology, different operation modes (SASE and advanced lasing concepts) etc.

FLASH is the first soft X-ray FEL user facility, routinely providing brilliant photon beams for users since 2005. There are plans to upgrade both existing undulator lines of this facility, FLASH1 and FLASH2. FLASH1 will mainly operate in XUV range in seeding and SASE modes, while FLASH2 will use the standard SASE regime as well as new lasing concepts aiming at production of brilliant photon beams on the fundamental and harmonics down to 1nm. In this paper we present a concept for FLASH2 upgrade, and discuss different advanced options.

Harmonic lasing in XFELs is an opportunity to extend the photon energy range of existing and planned X-ray FEL user facilities. Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation, harmonic lasing can provide much more intense, stable, and narrow-band FEL beam. Another interesting application is Harmonic Lasing Self-Seeding (HLSS) that allows to improve longitudinal coherence and spectral power of a Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) FEL. This concept was successfully tested at FLASH2 in the range of 4.5 - 15 nm and at PAL XFEL at 1 nm. In this contribution we present recent results from the European XFEL where we successfully demonstrated operation of HLSS FEL at 5.9 A, thus pushing harmonic lasing for the first time into the Angstrom regime.

The proposed FLASH upgrade will rely on high quality electron beams provided to all undulator beamlines. Here we describe possible modifications to the FLASH lattice and the compression scheme that aim at improving the beam quality and the ability to control critical beam properties along the machine - simultaneously and independently for all beamlines.

The FERMI FEL-2 undulator line, normally operated in the double stage high gain harmonic generation with the fresh bunch (HGHG-FB) has been temporary modified to allow operating the FEL in the Echo Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) scheme. An increase of the dispersion in the delay-line was required together with a replacement of the second stage modulator allowing the electron beam to resonantly interact with a second seed laser. Another critical component of the EEHG setup is a new manipulator installed in the delay-line chicane and hosting additional diagnostic components. In this work we describe in some detail these new components that allowed a successful demonstration of the EEHG at harmonics as high as 101.

The H2020 CompactLight Project (www. CompactLight.eu) aims at designing the next generation of compact X-rays Free-Electron Lasers, relying on very high gradient accelerating structures (X-band, 12 GHz), the most advanced concepts for bright electron photo injectors, and innovative compact short-period undulators. Compared to existing facilities, the proposed facility will benefit from a lower electron beam energy, due to the enhanced undulators performance, and will be significantly more compact, with a smaller footprint,  as a consequence of the lower energy and the high-gradient X-band structures. In addition, the whole infrastructure will also have a lower electrical power demand as well as lower construction and running costs.

In the context of an R&D program on alternative undulator schemes, two fixed-gap, linearly polarised, adjustable-phase undulators (APUs) were built and successfully tested, the first on the FERMI free electron laser, the second on the Elettra storage ring. The latter is now in regular operation for the ALOISA surface science beam line. As a further elaboration on the fixed-gap concept, two elliptically polarised undulators (EPUs) are now being developed for FERMI and for Elettra. We have also started the construction of a double period APU providing an extended tuning range to the TwinMic soft X-Ray microscopy beam line. We present here the main design and construction aspects of the new undulators under development.

Accelerator-based terahertz (THz) radiation has been expected to realize a high-power broad-band source. Employing a low-emittance and short-bunch electron beam at a high repetition rate, a scheme to resonantly excite optical cavity modes of THz spectrum range via coherent diffraction radiation has been proposed. The confocal cavity design is the special case that resonance conditions of all the eigen modes coincide, resulting in realizing broad-band excitation. But in general cases of non-confocal cavities, the resonance condition depends on the mode, and the resonance peak becomes wide and weak. We performed an experiment with a non-confocal cavity as a follow-up experiment of that we have done with a confocal cavity. The result confirmed that the confocal design is the key for a broad-band source.

Vector beam is a light beam with spatially modulated polarization state across the beam. Particular examples of vector beam are radial and azimuthal polarization which have donut-shaped intensity and radially and azimuthally oriented linear polarization state. Vector beam has long been interest in the laser community and it is well known that vector beam can be created by superposing two optical vortex beams which have spiral wave fronts. It has been demonstrated that optical vortex beam can be generated from a helical undulator as harmonics. Therefore, we propose a scheme to generate vector beam by superposing two optical vortex beams from two helical undulators in tandem, based on the principle of the ’crossed undulator’. The experiment was carried out at UVSOR BL1U. In this paper, we describe the principle and the experimental details.

A variable polarized THz light source using a crossed-undulator configuration has been developed at Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH), Tohoku University. It consists of two planar undulators of which deflecting planes cross at right angles and a phase shifter for phase adjustment. Polarization of the crossed-undulator has observation angle dependence due to that of radiation wavelength and optical path length difference between two radiations. That limits an angular range maintaining the identical polarization state. Assuming undulator parameters for our experiment (a fundamental frequency 1.9 THz and a number of periods seven) degree of circular polarization larger than 0.9 can be obtained only in the range of 2.2 mrad, i. e. 13% of the radiation angular spread.

We have studied far-infrared coherent radiation with an S-band linac at Laboratory for Electron Beam Research and Application (LEBRA) at Nihon University. We have already developed a couple of terahertz-wave sources based on coherent synchrotron radiation and coherent transition radiation*, which have been applied to spectroscopic research**. Moreover, we developed coherent edge radiation (CER) at the downstream bending magnets in the FEL sections. Because the edge radiation has an annular shape distribution characterized by the asymmetric first-order Laguerre-Gaussian mode, the CER can be extracted from an optical cavity of the FEL system without a diffraction loss of the FEL beam***. The root-mean-squared bunch length of the electron beam was evaulated by measuring the CER spectra, which was about the same level as the FEL micropulse width. Although the infrared FELs at LEBRA had a long slippage length, the CER intensity can be a guidepost enhancing the FEL power because of the existence of their correlation. In this presentation, the characteristics of the CER including correlation between the CER and the FEL will be reported.

Development of a 125 MeV S-band electron linac for the generation of Free Electron Laser (FEL), Parametric X-ray Radiation (PXR) and coherent terahertz waves (THz waves) has been underway at LEBRA of Nihon University as a joint research with KEK and National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). The high power coherent transition radiation (CTR), coherent edge radiation (CER) and the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) wave sources development has been carried out since 2011 at LEBRA. The transport systems of the each THz wave were installed in the vacuum chamber on the downstream side of the 45 degrees bending magnet of the PXR and FEL beam-line. In particular, a CER of the generated the FEL beam line can also be guided without disturbing the FEL oscillations. Additionally, a part of the mirror of the transport optical system is constructed using Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) mirror with the optimized for the transport of the THz wave. In this report, construction of the THz transport beam lines and the property of the THz lights are discussed.

At the LEBRA facility of Nihon U., we have an IR-FEL oscillator to generate radiations in the range of wavelengths 1-6 um for various experiments. A research program has been established to explore the application of the IR-FEL to generate attosecond UV and X-ray pulses through the high harmonic generation (HHG) in noble gases, where the IR-FEL pulses must have a high-peak power and a short-pulse duration. The property of generated FEL pulse is affected by the cavity length detuning of FEL oscillator as well as the small signal gain and the cavity loss. The operation at a small- or zero-detuning length is necessary to generate a FEL pulse shorter than the bunch length, although it requires a long macro-pulse to reach the saturation. For the short FEL pulse generation within a limited macro-pulse length at the LEBRA LINAC, we apply a dynamical modulation to the electron bunch repetition, that is equivalent to a dynamical detuning of the FEL cavity length. We illustrate the potential performance of the IR-FEL with the dynamical detuning by time-dependent 3D FEL simulations. We also evaluate the enhancement of the FEL pulses by an external cavity stacking for the sake of the HHG application.

At the x-ray free-electron laser (FEL) facility, SACLA, a soft x-ray FEL beamline (SCSS+) is driven by a dedicated 800-MeV electron accelerator and being operated in parallel with two hard x-ray FEL beamlines. Responding to the demands of short laser pulses from users, a nonlinearity correction system using sextupole magnets is under consideration to obtain shorter electron bunches. Since the frequency of the SCSS+ injector is S-band, the nonlinearity correction of a bunch compression process using a harmonic correction cavity is not so efficient as the SACLA injector, whose frequency of the injector is L-band. Instead of a complex and costly correction cavity system, the sextupole magnets are simply installed in a dispersive section of the first bunch compressor chicane. In this report, we will present the basic design concept and some detail studies of the nonlinear correction.

By seeding with narrow-band Cherenkov radiation from a dielectric loaded waveguide(DLW), stimulated excitation in an optical cavity is presented. The evolution and energy loss of the field oscillating in optical cavity is analysed by the theoretical and numerical calculation. The results show that the high order TM modes of the Cherenkov radiation can be better preserved after a large number of roundtrips in the optical cavity and this scheme offers a potential method of realizing high power Terahertz radiation source in a compact facility.

High degree of transverse field coherence is one of the unique properties of an FEL compared with a 3rd gen-eration storage ring light source. As a result, the FEL advances the development of innovative research and technology that was not previously feasible. A truly coherent source should be coherent in all orders de-scribed from the intensity correlation functions. In this paper, second order intensity correlation of FEL radia-tion is investigated based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss intensity correlation method. The statistical properties of radiation produced from SASE was also investigated and compared with the statistical proper-ties of a phase-locked laser. The results show that the statistical properties of a SASE mode behave as a cha-otic source, which is significantly different from the properties of a phase-locked laser beam.

FEL self-seeding has been demonstrated a great advantage for the generation of a fully coherent and high brightness X-ray pulse experimentally. Generally, transmission monochromators with single crystal are adopted worldwide, such as LCLS, PAL-XFEL and European-XFEL. Recently, the self-seeding scheme based on a reflection monochromator with a double-crystal is proposed and demonstrated at SACLA successfully. In view of several potential advantages of the reflection type, here we give the proposal of the reflection monochromator based self-seeding and enable the application on the SHINE project. This manuscript is mainly focus on monochromator schemes at SHINE, instead of FEL simulations. We will present considerable schemes based on the specific undulator line.

A high power THz free electron laser (FEL) facility is under construction at China Academy of Engineering Physics (CTFEL). The radiation frequency of the FEL facility will be tuned in range of 1~3 THz and the average output power is about 10 W. The system mainly consists of a GaAs photoemission DC gun, superconductor accelerator, hybrid wiggler, optical cavity. The first lasing is obtained on Aug. 29, 2017, and CTFEL is operated in range of 2-4THz, but cannot lasing at the frequency below 1.8 THz. The optical resonator of CTFEL must be optimized to ensure lasing in range of 1 to 2 THz.. The lasing strongly depends on the performance of the optical resonator including output efficiency, gain and round-trip loss. The optical resonator consists of metal-coated reflect mirror, the centre-hole output mirror, waveguide. The influence of waveguide on the quality of optical cavity is evaluated by the 3D OSIFEL code. The waveguide size and output hole radius is optimized to different frequencies between 1 THz to 2 THz.

Miniaturization of X-ray free electron laser requires reduction of undulator period length. In this proceeding, a mini-period permanent magnet staggered undulator was proposed, which is free of superconducting solenoid and thus has advantages of easy-manufacture and low-cost. After optimization, it can generate periodic field of peak field 0.71 T with period length 10 mm and pole gap 2 mm, which has been verified on a prototype. Combined with X-band linac, the length of 1 nm XFEL facility using the permanent magnet staggered undulator can be confined within 44 m.

As a CW x-ray free electron laser facility, SHINE has a high requirement on the electron beam quality in the linac, as well as in the injector. SHINE injector consists of a 162.5 MHz normal conducting VHF gun, a NC 1.3 GHz RF buncher, a one cavity SC cryomodule, an eight cavity SC cryomodule and 3 solenoids along the injector layout. Some beam diagnostic element are inserted in the layout as well. In this paper, we try to introduce the injector physics design at shine.

The Shanghai soft X-ray Free-electron Laser facility (SXFEL) is now serving as an experimental platform for fundamental free-electron laser (FEL) principle tests. The machine puts very tight tolerance on the straightness of the electron beam orbit. It is hard to achieve the required trajectory due to the off-axis field of the misaligned quadrupoles and undulator segments especially for the SXFEL driven by low energy linac (840MeV). This tight requirement on electron beam straightness can only be met through the beam-based alignment (BBA) technology which achieved great success at LCLS, PAL-XFEL, European-XFEL and SCALA with high electron beam energies. But there has been no report about satisfactory BBA experiment results on soft X-ray FEL facility driven by relatively low energy linacs (on the order of 2 GeV or less) up to now. Here, we report the simulation results and preparatory experiment progress of the BBA at SXFEL with the method of dispersion-free steering (DFS). The experiment results show some improvements of the electron beam orbit and the phenomenon of the dispersion-free. The entire BBA experiment and a feedback system of electron beam trajectory may also be included.

We propose a THz-pump and UV-probe scheme based on storage ring for ultra-fast dynamics experiment. In which, two sequential laser pulses, one of which has a periodic intensity envelope, simultaneously interact with different parts of the long electron beam in a modulator; after a chicane, the part that interacts with the periodic pulse will bunch at THz domain and radiate through a bend magnet, another based on high-harmonic generation will bunch at UV domain and radiate at a radiator. The electron beam can be utilized circularly in the storage ring, which will increase its average power. The feasibility of this THz-pump and UV-probe scheme is verified in both theory and simulation.

A transverse tilt of the electron bunch is normally unwanted in free-electron laser (FEL) since only a portion of the bunch can contribute to the FEL radiation. However, the recent researches demonstrate that the tilted bunch can be used to generate FEL with some special features. In this work we investigate the generation of a large tilt of the bunch by using a corrugated structure and a dogleg separately. Based on the tilted bunch, the creation of ultra-short pulse and multi-color pulses are demonstrated in high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) FEL.

One of the key challenges in scientific researches based on free-electron lasers (FELs) is the characterization of the coherence time of the ultra-fast hard x-ray pulse, which fundamentally influences the interaction process between x-ray and materials. Conventional optical methods, based on autocorrelation, is very difficult to realize due to the lack of mirrors. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a conceptually new coherence time characterization method and a coherence time of 174.7 attoseonds has been measured for the 6.92 keV FEL pulses at Linac Coherent Light Source. In our experiment, a phase shifter is adopted to control the cross-correlation between x-ray and microbunched electrons. This approach provides critical temporal coherence diagnostics for x-ray FELs, and is decoupled from machine parameters, applicable for any photon energy, radiation brightness, repetition rate and FEL pulse duration, etc.

A Hard X-ray (HX) line in PAL-XFEL consists of an e-gun, a Laser Heater (LH), S-band accelerators, an X-band LINearizer (XLIN), three Bunch Compressors (BC), a dog-leg, and an undulator line. It generates 2.5 - 15-keV FEL with over than 1-mJ pulse energy. The XLIN before BC1 is used for linearizing the energy chirp in the longitudinal phase space and provides the flexibility for FEL optimization and operation. However, it causes the instability of FEL by large jitters and drift because of higher frequency. We study the FEL operation without XLIN. The collimator in the center of BC1 is used removing the slices to cause nonlinear compression. We optimize the FEL by short electron bunch with under 30 fs. In this paper, we present details of the optimizing sequence and performance for the FEL operation without XLIN.

We present a software tool aimed at investigating the spectra of photon sources in order to detect any instabilities in the electron beam that have a clear effect on the spectrum. The method has been developed for FERMI@Elettra but with a general approach on the particularities of FEL machines such as a high repetition frequency and significant shot to shot fluctuations. The software has two operating options: a mode, aimed at online usage, which only detects peaks and their corresponding valleys, offering no information about the peaks themselves; and a more comprehensive mode that fits peak functions (Gaussian, Lorentzian etc…) to the spectrum based on initial guesses of the fitting parameters. The algorithm can provide a collection of simple but valuable variables such as number of peaks, peak separation and ratio between peak heights, as well as more specialized variables like peak width statistics and decomposition of the raw spectrum in basic components.

As the ECHO enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) scheme draws such intense focus from the FEL community, we conduct simulations to evaluate the challenges of implementing said scheme in different FEL layouts. Nonlinear processes such as this require extensive simulations to harmonize all system specific properties like seed lasers and electron beam properties. Along with optimizing the original EEHG scheme* one can consider, for example, altering the seed laser pulse to optimize the bunching for a machine specific chirp. We study the EEHG as a possible seeding method aimed at increasing coherence of the photon beam for the prospective SXL FEL beamline at MAXIV. The particular chirp of the electron beam through the MAXIV LINAC generates some specific requirements in implementing EEHG but may also offer an opportunity for exotic operation modes of this FEL.

An overview of the design of compact elliptically polarizing undulator with small round magnetic gap to provide full polarization control of synchrotron radiation in a more cost effective manner and consuming less built in space than the state of the art devices. This type of undulator is meant as source for the potential future Soft X-ray (SXL) FEL beamline using the linear accelerator at MAX IV. In addition, it offers new capabilities for future beamlines at the 3 GeV ring to use full polarization control to photon energies using the fundamental harmonic which are not attainable with today’s technology of the out-of-vacuum insertion devices at 3 GeV beam energy.

In this paper we report the start-to-end simulation results of one of the options under consideration for the CompactLight Project (XLS). The XLS is a hard X-ray Free Electron Laser under design, using the latest concepts for bright electron photo injectors, very high-gradient X-band structures, and innovative short-period undulators. Presently there exist various tracking codes to conduct the design process. Therefore identifying the most convenient code is of notable importance. This paper compares the tracking codes, Placet and General Particle Tracer, using the XLS lattice based on a S and X-band Injector. The calculation results in terms of beam quality and tracking performance of a full 6-D simulation are presented.

It is important to verify both by simulation and experiments the wakefields in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, which can degrade the electron beam quality considerably or impose excessive heat load if left undamped. In this paper, we investigate the Higher Order Mode (HOM) spectra of the 3.9 GHz SRF cavities, which are assembled in a cryogenic module and are used to linearize the longitudinal phase space of the electron beam in the injector of the European XFEL. The HOM spectra are significantly different from the ones from a single cavity due to the coupling of the modes amongst cavities. The measurements not only provide direct input for the beam dynamics studies but also for the beam instrumentation utilizing these modes. The mode spectra are also investigated with a number of numerical simulations and the comparison with measurements shows favorable agreement.

The proposed electron-hadron collider LHeC, based on an energy recovery linac, employs an electron beam of 20 mA current at an energy of tens of GeV. This electron beam could also be used to drive a free electron laser (FEL) operating at sub-Angstrom wavelengths. Here we demonstrate that such FEL would have the potential to provide orders of magnitude higher peak power, peak brilliance and average brilliance, than any other FEL, either existing or proposed.

The Taiwan photon source (TPS) is a 3 GeV synchrotron light source now in routine operation at the NSRRC. At the beginning of beam commissioning, significant photon flux dips could be observed at injection due to a blow-up of the beam size. To eliminate this transient effect, all four kickers were rematched. The leakage field was shielded and the induced current loops at vacuum chambers in the injection area were also eliminated. These efforts reduced the horizontal betatron oscillations and orbit distortions to around one-tenth. In order to decrease the recovery time of photon dips during injection, the operational chromaticity was reduced to improve incoherent effects. After all those improvements, the photon flux dips during injection dropped to 30 % and the recovery time to less than 1 msec.

CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications) is a test facility for Free Electron Laser (FEL) research and other applications at STFC’s Daresbury Laboratory. The first exploitation period using CLARA Front End (FE) provided a range of beam parameters to 12 user experiments. Beam line to Beam Area 1 (BA1) was commissioned and optimised for these experiments, some involving TW laser integration. In addition to the user exploitation programme, significant advances were made to progress on machine development. This paper summarises these developments and presents the near future plan for CLARA.

The success of modern particle accelerators depends on good high level software. Over the past few years an integrated framework has been developed to better connect machine physicists to VELA/CLARA at the STFC’s Daresbury laboratory. This framework is comprised of a number of tools, including, a c++/Python API to interface to the EPICS control system with which all High Level Software can be developed. The API is encapsulated, extensible and designed to grow as further Phases of CLARA are installed. The API is seamlessly integrated with the VELA/CLARA virtual accelerator and other activities by the simulations group. As well as presenting the design choices and methodology we will give an overview of the first control room applications built using our tools and how they will form the basis for a new programme of machine learning and optimisation on CLARA.

The X-Ray FEL at SLAC or LCLS delivers typically one bunch at the time. Different schemes of two bunches have been developed: Two bucket, Twin bunch, split undulator, and fresh slice. Here we discuss a four bunch or even eight bunch setup, separated by 2 RF buckets or 0.7 ns. . The demand comes from MEC (Matter in Extreme Conditions) experiments, where high-power laser beams with Joule-class energies create impulsive pressure waves compressing materials on time scales of the order of ns. Eight snapshots for a single experiment will allow measuring the compression history, structural phase transitions into new high-pressure material states, and have the potential to resolve the transition kinetics time scales.

We propose to use existing LCLS copper S-band linac double bunch infrastructure to significantly improve LCLS-II hard X-ray performance. In our setup, we use the first bunch to generate a strong seeding X-ray signal, and the second bunch, initially traveling off-axis, to interact with the seed in the amplifier undulator and generate a near TW, 15 fs duration X-ray pulse in the 4 to 8 keV photon energy range. We investigate, via numerical simulations, the required transverse beam dynamics and the four crystals X-ray monochromator to be added to the existing LCLS-II beamline and discuss the final properties of the hard X-ray pulses and their potential application in high intensity, high-field physics experiments, including QED above the Schwinger critical field.

The facilities providing single electron beams are currently being commissioned at Fermilab and will be at SLAC. Recently, Fermilab’s IOTA ring routinely demonstrated circulation of a single electron at 100 MeV beam energy. Alternatively, SLAC is working on constructing LCLS-II an X-ray FEL driven by a 4 GeV SRF linac. A parasitic beamline, S30XL, is planned that will extract 4 GeV dark current from between the primary LCLS-II electron bunches. The dark current will be delivered to End Station A and can work independently of LCLS-II experiments. The dark current will be bunched at a frequency of 46 MHz while extracted current varied from single electrons to 10’s of nA. In the present paper, we estimate the feasibility of propagating single electron beams through a conventional undulator, placed in the IOTA and S30XL beamlines. We explore the possible observable effects and experimental parameters range. In addition, we focus on potential applications of such beams in systems for high fidelity quantum measurements.

The atomic inner-shell X-ray lasing, induced by the irradiation of focused XFEL SASE pulses, was demonstrated in gases, liquid jets and solids. In this proceeding, we discuss the possible use of this concept in self-seeding scheme at LCLS-II. We provide a preliminary study of different lasing media and corresponding SASE XFEL parameters. For the case of noble gas inner-shell X-ray laser, we study the requirements for gas pressure and XFEL pulse focusing. Finally, we discuss possible designs of this system and its advantages in LCLS-II operations.

In this paper, we focus on characterization of the nonlinear third harmonic radiation properties at Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). In addition, we experimentally perform third harmonic self-seeding, using diamond crystal attenuator in the hard X-ray self-seeding chicane. We discuss warm beam effects in such scheme, justifying recently proposed two bunch configuration for harmonic lasing.

We investigate the properties of Cherenkov, quasi-Cherenkov (parametric) and diffraction radiation generated in the periodic conducting wire medium by transversely modulated electron beams. Such beams were recently obtained at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility using microlens array (MLA) laser shaping technique. We consider in details the case of one dimensional periodic tungsten wire structure and transverse electron beamlets separation of mm scale. We look at possible enhancements of the radiation field due to transverse periodicity of the electron beam.

Magnetic measurements of existing superconducting undulators (SCUs) are performed under normal operating conditions after final assembly into the cryostat and before installation on the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring. The SCU cryostat for the APS upgrade has been scaled in length from the current cryostat and will contain two SCUs. While some aspects of the current measurement system are desirable to retain, such as a room temperature measurement bore, scaling the current measurement techniques to the length required for the APS upgrade cryostat is not feasible. To address these challenges a unique system has been developed at the APS to allow measurements of the two SCU magnets in the long cryostat. The measurement system developed allows the magnets to be operated under normal operating conditions while maintaining the measurement equipment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

The magnetic devices group at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) is in the process of designing and developing superconducting undulators (SCUs) for the APS upgrade. While similar in some aspects to previous SCU systems currently in operation at the existing APS, the new SCU systems will include two undulators installed in one cryostat which occupies an entire straight section of the storage ring. Straight sections containing planar undulators will either be configured as ’in-line’, where the two undulators behave as one source, or canted, where the two undulators are operated independently. Also under development is a superconducting arbitrary polarizing emitter (SCAPE) which can produce planar, elliptical, and helical undulator fields.

We discuss a proposal to test the operation of an X-ray cavity consisting of Bragg reflectors. The test will con-stitute a major step demonstrating the feasibility of either an X-ray regenerative amplifier FEL or an X-ray FEL Oscillator. These cavity-based X-ray FELs will provide the full temporal coherence lacking in the SA-SE FELs. An X-ray cavity of rectangular path will be constructed around the first seven LCLS-II undulator units. The Cu-linac will produce a pair of electron bunches separated by the cavity-round-trip distance during each linac cycle. The X-ray pulse produced by the first bunch is deflected into the cavity and returns to the undulator where it is amplified due to the presence of the second bunch. The key challenges are: the preci-sion of the cavity mechanical construction, the quality of the diamond crystals, and the electron beam stability. When the LCLS-II super-conducting linac becomes available, the cavity can then be used for high-repetition rate studies of the X-ray RAFEL and XFELO concepts.

We report recent progress on the design of a normal conducting CW electron gun, APEX-II (Advanced Photo-injector EXperiment-II) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. APEX-II is an upgrade of the successful APEX gun and the LCLS-II (Linac Coherent Light Source-II) injector, aiming at applications for Free electron laser (FEL) such as LCLS-II High Energy upgrade, UED (Ultrafast Electron Diffraction) and UEM (Ultrafast Electron Microscopy). The APEX-II adopted a two-cell cavity design with resonant frequency of 162.5 MHz. The APEX-II gun is targeting to achieve exceeding 30 MV/m of launch gradient at the cathode and output energy above 1.5 MeV with transverse emittance of 0.1 um at 100 pC. Advanced MOGA optimization technique has been used for both the RF cavity design and extensive beam dynamics studies using APEX-like and LCLS-II like injector layout. Detailed RF designs, beam dynamics studies, preliminary engineering design and FEA analysis will be presented, with cavity features that were demonstrated to be crucial in the operation of the APEX gun.

In this paper, we report the efforts in solving the problem of coupled-bunch instabilities caused by an in-vacuum undulator in the SPEAR3 storage ring. After exploring several approaches to reduce the strength of the trapped modes, we found that ferrite dampers were the most effective and simplest way for mode damping in our SPEAR3 in-vacuum undulator. The results of the first RF cold measurement on an in-vacuum undulator equipped with these ferrite dampers agree well with numerical simulations.

The Delta undulator has been operated successfully in LCLS with full control of the polarization mode and K value of the device. In LCLS II, a new Delta II undulator will be based on a similar design but with some differences. In this paper, we will present numerical simulation results that provide guidance to choose the geometric shape of the magnet poles and define the required tolerance for assembling the undulator magnets.

Since coming on-line in November 2013, the Fritz-Haber-Institut (FHI) der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG) Free-Electron Laser (FEL) has provided intense, tunable infrared radiation to FHI user groups. It has enabled experiments in diverse fields ranging from bio-molecular spectroscopy to studies of clusters and nanoparticles, nonlinear solid-state spectroscopy, and surface science, resulting in 50 peer-reviewed publications so far. The MPG has now funded a significant upgrade to the original FHI FEL. A second short Rayleigh range undulator FEL beamline is being added that will permit lasing from < 5 microns to > 160 microns. Additionally, a 500 MHz kicker cavity will permit simultaneous two-color operation of the FEL from both FEL beamlines over an optical range of 5 to 50 microns by deflecting alternate 1 GHz pulses into each of the two undulators. We will describe the upgraded FHI FEL physics and engineering design and present the plans for two-color FEL operations in November 2020.

A concept of new lattice element called "Complex Bend" is recently proposed at NSLS-­II. Replacing the regular dipoles in the Double­-Bend Achromat lattice by Complex Bends significantly reduces the beam emittance. The first attempt of lattice design for potential NSLS-­II upgrade based on Complex Bend, is described. Compared with the current NSLS­-II lattice, the new solution modifies only three of the six girders per cell. The linear optics has been matched keeping unchanged the lattice parameters at the straight sections, where the light­-generating insertion devices are located. The Complex Bend gradient is limited by 250 T/m assuming possible use of permanent magnets. The lattice provides 65 pm emittance without damping wigglers, use of which results in further decrease of the emittance

FLASH, the free electron laser user facility at DESY (Hamburg, Germany), delivers high brilliance XUV and soft x-ray FEL radiation to photon experiments with different parameters at two undulator beamlines simultaneously. FLASH’s superconducting linac can produce bunch trains of up to 800 bunches within a 0.8 ms RF flat top at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. In standard operation during 2018, FLASH supplied up to 500 bunches in two bunch trains with independent fill patterns and compression schemes to each of the two beamlines. In 2018 first successful plasma accelerating experiments could be reported by the FLASHForward plasma wakefield acceleration experiment situated in a third beamline. We report on the highlights of FLASH operation in 2018/2019.

STFC Daresbury Laboratory are developing a compact electron beam energy dechirper system, based on dielectric wakefield structure, for the on-site electron accelerator CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications). CLARA will be an experimental free electron laser (FEL) facility operating at 250MeV and will be a test bed for a variety of novel FEL schemes. The dechirper dielectric quartz plates will induce wakefields within the structure which can remove the beam chirp that is initially introduced to compress the electron bunch longitudinally. Removing or adjusting the amount of chirp enables researchers to reduce or adjust the bunch energy/momentum spread, expanding the FEL capabilities. The attachment and alignment of the quartz plates present numerous mechanical design challenges that require high precision manufacturing and quartz plate positioning via fiducialisation. This paper will review the dechirper specifications, the chosen design solutions, measured mechanical performance, and the expected effect of the dechirper on CLARA FEL operation.

The recent National Academies of Science Review concluded the science questions that could be answered by an electron-ion collider are significant to advancing our understanding of the atomic nuclei that make up all visible matter in the universe. To meet this science need, a high luminosity polarized electron-ion collider (JLEIC) was envisioned at Jefferson Lab, based on the existing CEBAF recirculated SRF electron linac. Over the past 16 years, Jefferson Lab has been actively engaged in the design study and accelerator R&D for JLEIC, a comprehensive Pre-Conceptual Design Report has been completed recently. The JLEIC baseline design has also been continuously optimized including extending the CM energy to 100 GeV. In this paper, we present a summary of the JLEIC baseline design and also briefly discuss the accelerator R&D.

Design of the Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) includes low-beta Interaction Region (IR) and spin rotator optics for high luminosity and polarization. Magnet errors, especially in the high-beta final focus quadrupoles, result in optics perturbations which need to be corrected in order to attain sufficient dynamic aperture (DA). We present design of orbit correction system for the electron ring and evaluate its performance. The DA is then studied including misalignment, magnet strength errors, non-linear field errors, and corrections.
