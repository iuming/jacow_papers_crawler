The PRAE (Platform for Research and Applications with Electrons) accelerator is being built at Orsay campus with the main objective of creating a multidisciplinary R&D platform, involving subatomic physics, instrumentation, radiobiology and clinical research around a high-performance electron accelerator with beam energies up to 70 MeV (planned 140 MeV). In this paper we will report the optics design and beam dynamics simulations for the beam line dedicated to subatomic physics, more specifically for the measurement of the proton radius. This measurement requires extremely low energy spread (5×10−4) and small beam sizes with low divergence at three beam energies: 30, 50 and 70 MeV. The beam line includes a D-type chicane coupled to a dechirping passive structure, which generates inductive wakeﬁelds in order to get the performances required for such measurement.

For heavy-ion accelerator facilities charge stripping is a key Technology: the stripping charge state, its efficiency to produce ions in the required charge state, and the beam quality after stripping substantially determine the entire accelerator performance. Modern heavy ion accelerator facilities such as the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI provide for high intensity heavy ion beams beyond 200 MeV/u. Heavy ion stripping at a lower energy enables more efficient acceleration up to the final beam energy, compared to acceleration of ions with a low charge state. Due to the high power deposited by the heavy ions in the stripping media and radiation damages if a solid target is used, self-recovering stripper media must be applied. General implementation options for different stripper target media are discussed in this paper, as well as general considerations to optimize the Linac layout through the appropriate choice of stripping medium and stripping energy. The driver Linac for the Dubna Electron-Radioactive Isotope Collider fAcility (DERICA) project, recently initiated by JINR, is foreseen to provide for 100 MeV/u Uranium beam in continuous wave mode. First layout scenarios of a one-step and a two-step DERICA-stripper approach will be also presented.

With regard to the development of new accelerator technologies for high-intensity ion beams and more efficient acceleration, the transfer of radiation ions to higher charged states is a prerequisite for many experiments. However, the recent stripping technologies such as film and gas stripper for heavy ion beams with the desired intensities required great effort or are not suitable. The contribution presents the current state of plasma strippers with fully ionized hydrogen with simultaneously high particle densities in the range of some 1017 cm-3 for FAIR. To achieve this high particle density, an inductive discharge plasma is ignited within a stripper cell parallel to the axis of the ion beam and compressed towards the beam axis. The advantage over conventional ion strippers is about 1000 times smaller recombination rate for electrons*. This significantly increases the equilibrium charge state of ions. At the same time, the relative fraction of ions on the maximum of charge state distribution increases up to 25%**. This should create good conditions for the use of plasma strippers at FAIR.

In this study, the idea 99Mo production using hybrid method based on electron accelerator has been pre-sented. Two different main production channels of 100Mo(γ,n)99Mo and 98Mo(n,γ)99Mo can be used for 99Mo production in this system. By considering high power Linac (30 MeV, 1 mA in average beam current) and one-stage approach, the calculation of 100Mo(γ,n)99Mo reactions in the optimized 100Mo target in two different designs (strip and disc) has been simu-lated. It is predicted that about 61 and 53 Ci of 99Mo activity per 24-hour irradiation on the strip target and the disc plates can be achieved, respectively. The threshold energy of photoneutron at 100Mo is about 9 MeV, so a large part of bremsstrahlung photons cannot participate in photoneutron reaction. For feasibility study, new hybrid approach has been tested by 10 MeV Rhodotron. Due to the low threshold of photo-neutron in deuteron (about 2.2 MeV) and significant low energy photons in 100Mo, photoneutron flux is available. So, Molybdenum target in heavy water Tank increases the production yield of 99Mo using neutron absorption reaction in 98Mo. The total activity of 99Mo has been predicted about 0.23 Ci per 24 hours e-beam irradiation.

The National Centre for Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO) is a synchrotron based particle therapy facility. Both protons and carbon ions can be used for treatments. The main extraction system is based on ’amplitude-momentum selection’ driven by a betatron core, but RF-KO (Radio-Frequency Knock Out) is being implemented as an alternative extraction scheme, being more suitable for a future implementation of a ’multi energy extraction’ operation of the accelerator. With a double extraction possibility, CNAO would allow an interesting theoretical and experimental evaluation of the relative merits of the two extraction schemes. The RF deflector is already installed and the RF power generation is under commissioning. Extraction simulations and first results of the system are presented.

CNAO (National Centre for Oncological Hadronthera-py) in Pavia is one of the six centres worldwide in which hadrontherapy is administered with both protons and carbon ions. The main accelerator is a 25 m diameter synchrotron designed to accelerate carbon ions up to an energy of 400 MeV/u and protons up to an energy of 250 MeV. It was designed with three treatment rooms and an ’experimental room’ where research can be carried out. The room itself was built since the beginning, but the beam line was planned to be installed in a second moment in order to give priority to treatments. The beam line of the experimental room (XPR) is designed to be "general purpose", for research activities in different fields. In October 2018 the installation phase of the line was started and it ended in January 2019. In this paper a short description of the optics layout and commissioning strategy is given.

EUV Lithography is going to HVM (high volume manufacturing) stage with 250-W-class laser-produced plasma sources and it is important to develop a new-type EUV light source to meet future demand for higher power. Energy-recovery linac based free-electron lasers (ERL-FELs) are possible candidates of a high-power EUV light source that can distribute 1 kW power to multiple scanners simultaneously. In Japan, an ERL-FEL based EUV light source has been designed using available technologies without much development to demonstrate generation of EUV power more than 10 kW and the EUV-FEL Light Source Study Group for Industrialization has been established since 2015 to realize industrialization of the light source and the related items. For industrialization, high availability is essential as well as high power and reduction of the light source size is also required. In this paper, we will report an overview of the designed ERL-FEL light source for EUV lithography and some activities for the industrialization and describe considerations and developments for obtaining high availability and size reduction of the light source.

The ultrafast electron microscope provides a useful tool for exploring fine structure and observing dynamic process at nanometer and picosecond scale, which has been extensively applied in chemistry and biological field. After emitting from the electron gun, electron beams are focused on the stage sample by the condenser system and then be projected by the imaging system on the screen. In the present study, a two-lens condenser system is simulated by Parmela and a three-lens imaging system is designed using thin-lens approximation. Besides, the shape factor of metallic spheres which have different radius for perturbation method is measured, which is conductive to measuring the Z/Q parameter and the electric field along the axis of the C-band 3MeV photocathode gun for the UEM.

High energy electron imaging, an extension of conventional transmission electron microscopy, is suitable for imaging of thicker objects and expected to be a promising tool for diagnostics of high energy density physics (HEDP). A cascade high energy electron imaging system using two-stage imaging lenses based on strong permanent magnet quadrupoles is designed, optimized and finally installed at Tsinghua university. Encouraging result of 1.6-μm space resolution is obtained in our primary experiments, along with the clear imaging of a spherical capsule as a substitute of the targets used in inertial confinement fusion. Successful implement of cascade high energy electron imaging system is necessary for reaching better resolving power of the imaging system, and well matching of design, simulation with experimental results paves the way to high energy electron microscopy to provide full capacities for diagnostics of HEDP with sub-um and picosecond spatiotemporal resolutions.

Recently, RTX has been developing a 6/4 MeV European S-band (= 2998 MHz) industrial linac by using a magnetron with a low RF power of about 3 MW for container inspection system (CIS). Its accelerating structure is designed to operate in π/2 mode by coupling 6 accelerating cells together through 5 side-coupled cells. In CIS, high dose rate X-rays from MeV-energy electron beam has been used to detect the possible presence of contrabands in cargoes or truck containers. To determine a dose rate output, the X-ray dose rate can be simulated by using FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation. The aim of this work was to study the effects of thickness of X-ray target on dose rate as well as X-ray dose map at 1.0 m away from the X-ray target. This study gives the thickness of target in which the dose rate can be highest and electron beam current can be lowest.

All spacecraft electronics should be subject to radiation hardness qualifications. For modern semiconductor technologies, individual high-energy particles of outer space are the greatest danger, causing upsets and failures in satellite equipment. For ground tests at single event effects, heavy ion-based modeling facilities are used. The report describes the test benches used for testing space-based electronics, created on the basis of the U-400, U-400M ion accelerators in the FLNR JINR (Dubna, Russia) at the request of ISDE (Moscow, Russia).

The paper concerns a mobile accelerator based on the ironless pulsed betatron. The accelerator has a possibility to obtain up to three frames in a single pulse and is aimed to radiograph dynamic objects with a large optical thickness. The block diagram of the accelerator, the temporal diagram of its separate systems operation and oscillograms of the betatron output parameters are provided. The testing powering in a single frame mode was carried out in 2018. The capacitance of the storage of the betatron electromagnet pulsed powering system that defines the electron beam energy was equal to 1800 μF. The following test results have been obtained. The thickness of the lead test object examined with X-rays reached 140 mm at 4 m from the tantalum target of the betatron. The full width of the output gamma pulse at half maximum in a single frame mode was equal to 120 ns; the dimension of the radiation source was 6 mm x 3 mm; the dimension of the tantalum target was 6 mm x 6 mm. The application of these accelerators within the radiographic complex* enables the optimization of the hydrodynamic experiments geometry resulting in the increase of the test efficiency.

The active research complexes intended for the radiography of dynamic objects with a high optical density are reviewed. The concept of a multi-beam radiographic complex for a small-angle tomography based on ironless pulsed betatrons is proposed*. It is possible to use up to 18 compact facilities in a complex; they are located in three horizontal planes. The test object is placed in the explosion-proof chamber. Each facility consists of two typical units: an accelerator unit, and a unit of the electromagnet pulsed powering system. The output parameters of the facility are the maximum translucent capacity of 200 mm of the lead at 1 m from the betatron target, the resolution of less than 1 mm, the gamma-pulse full width at half maximum of 100 ns in a single frame mode, the gamma-pulse full width at half maximum of 150 ns in a three-frame mode. The complex will be able to obtain up to 54 frames in one hydrodynamic experiment at the operation of each facility in a three-frame mode. The complex is compact. Its diameter with a service area will be 20 m.

A compact AVF cyclotron of 240 MeV is under-designed for proton therapy. In order to reduce the size, the weight and operation cost, two superconducting coils are designed to implement the 2.35T central field. And the magnet weight is about 90 tons. The constant gap between the sectors is considered without deteriorating the beam stability. A dedicated design on extraction zone is performed to make the average field to close the isochronous field. The extraction efficiency is expected higher than 80%, by regulating the 1st harmonic field and arranging the extraction elements properly. In order to avoid the large scale of volume helium explosion in the quench, the low temperature superconducting coil using NbTi/Cu wire is cooled by 4K GM Cryocooler in a helium volume limiting design. The paper will present the physical design of this cyclotron.

The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre (CCC) in the UK is a particle therapy facility providing treatment for ocular cancers using a 60 MeV passively scattered proton therapy beam. A model of the beamline using the Monte Carlo Simulation toolkit Geant4 has been developed for accurate characterisation of the beam. In order to validate the simulation, a study of the beam profiles along the delivery system is necessary. Beam profile measurements have been performed at multiple positions in the CCC beam line using both EBT3 GAFchromic film and Medipix3, a single quantum counting chip developed specifically for medical applications, typically used for x-ray detection. This is the first time its performance has been tested within a clinical, high proton flux environment. EBT3 is the current standard for conventional radiotherapy film dosimetry and was used to determine the dose and for correlation to fluence measured by Medipix3. The count rate linearity and doses recorded with Medipix3 were evaluated across the full range of available beam intensities, up to 3.12 x 1010 protons/s. The applicability of Medipix3 for proton therapy dosimetry is discussed and compared against the performance of EBT3.

Acceleration and storage of beams of relativistic partially stripped ions is more challenging than in the case of fully stripped ions because the interactions with matter, such as those with residual gas and collimators can strip electrons via ionisation. BDSIM is a code for the simulation of energy deposition and charged particle backgrounds in accelerators that uses the Geant4 physics library. Geant4 includes a broad range of ion elastic and inelastic interactions and allows the definition of partially stripped ion beams. However, no models are currently available to handle in-flight interactions involving the bound electrons. In this paper we present a semi-empirical model of beam ion stripping by material atoms that is implemented in BDSIM as an extension of Geant4’s existing physics processes and is fully integrated into a comprehensive set of matter interactions for partially stripped ions. The stripping cross-section for select cases and results from comprehensive simulations are presented.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has attracted significant attention from the general public. The science of the LHC and Higgs Boson is primarily communicated to school children and the wider public using visual methods. As a result, people with visual impairment (VI) often have difficulty accessing scientific communications and may be culturally excluded from news of scientific progress. Tactile Collider is a multi-sensory experience that aims to communicate particle accelerator science in a way that is inclusive of audiences with VI. These experiences are delivered as a 2-hour event that has been touring the UK since 2017. In this article we present the methods and training that have been used in implementing Tactile Collider as a model for engaging children and adults with science. The event has been developed alongside experts that specialise in making learning accessible to people with VI.

Fourier transform (FT) mass spectrometers achieve high resolution using relatively long transient times by trapping ions and measuring the frequency of their motion (inductively) inside an electrostatic potential. By contrast, time-of-flight (ToF) mass spectrometers measure the time of flight between an initiation pulse and contact with a destructive detector positioned on a plane of space focus after flying along a predetermined route. These devices have relatively short flight times and, generally, lower resolution. A class of hybrid analysers have been proposed and studied, utilising a quadro-logarithmic potential to reflect ions multiple times past an inductive detector, with the potential for the short transient of ToF devices - and the high resolution of FT devices. In this paper we compute the ion dynamics inside such devices, tracking bunches of ions and studying induced signals.

The idea of designing affordable equipment and developing sustainable infrastructures for delivering radiation treatment for patients with cancer in countries that lack resources and expertise stimulated a first International Cancer Expert Corps (ICEC) championed, CERN-hosted workshop in Geneva in November 2016. Which has since been followed by three additional workshops involving the sponsorship and support from UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). One of the major challenges in meeting this need to deliver radiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is to design a linear accelerator and associated instrumentation system which can be operated in locations where general infrastructures and qualified human resources are poor or lacking, power outages and water supply fluctuations can occur frequently and where climatic conditions might be harsh and challenging. In parallel it is essential to address education, training and mentoring requirements for current, as well as future novel radiation therapy treatment (RTT) systems.

There is a severe lack of radiotherapy linear accelerators (LINACs) in Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs), limiting capacity for cancer care in these regions. Anecdotally, operating high tech accelerators in environments with power fluctuations, harsh climatic conditions and geographic isolation leads to large failure rates and downtime. To guide future developments, this study presents a data-driven approach to collect statistical data on LINAC downtime and failure modes, comparing to a simple availability model.

Very High-Energy Electron (VHEE) therapy is a rapidly developing field motivated by developments in high-gradient linacs. Advantages include sufficient penetration (>30 cm) for treatment of deep-seated tumours, measured insensitivity to inhomogeneities and rapid delivery time, making VHEE viable for treatment of heterogeneous regions, e.g. lung or bowel. Researchers at the University of Manchester and CERN have routinely produced accelerating gradients of ~100 MeV/m for the CLIC project. Suitable modification can result in a high gradient medical linac producing 250 MeV electrons within a treatment room. Radiobiological research for VHEE is vital to understand its use in radiotherapy and how it compares with conventional modalities. The goal of radiotherapy is to destroy tumour cells while sparing healthy cells, primarily by damaging DNA within the cancer cell. The study aim is to understand the fundamental interactions between VHEE and biological structures through plasmid irradiation studies - both computational, using the Monte Carlo GEANT4-DNA code, and experimental. Plasmid irradiation experiments have been carried out at using Co-60 gammas at the Dalton Cumbrian Facility and using 6-15 MeV electrons at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust to determine the type and quantity of damage caused to DNA by electron irradiation. These experiments are a world first in VHEE radiobiology, with further studies planned at higher energies using the CLARA and CLEAR facilities at Daresbury and CERN. These studies will also consider the effective dose range of VHEE with energy, as well as implications of damage on DNA. Research into this area of radiotherapy can provide a valuable addition to tools currently available to physicians in the fight against cancer.

Proton beam therapy promises significant advantages over other forms of radiation therapy. However, to assure the best possible cancer care for patients further R&D into novel beam imaging and patient diagnostics, enhanced biological and physical models in Monte Carlo codes, as well as clinical facility design and optimization is required. Within the pan-European Optimization of Medical Accelerators (OMA) project collaborative research is being carried out between universities, research and clinical facilities, and industry in all of these areas. This contribution presents results from studies into low-intensity proton beam diagnostics, prompt gamma-based range verification in proton therapy, as well as prospects for a new proton irradiation facility for radiobiological measurements at an 18 MeV cyclotron within OMA. These results are then connected to the wider project aims of enhancing ion beam therapy. A summary of past and future events organised by the OMA consortium is also given.

In proton beam therapy, knowledge of the detailed beam properties is essential to ensure effective dose delivery to the patient. In clinical practice, currently used interceptive ionisation chambers require daily calibration and suffer from slow response time. This contribution presents a new non-invasive method for dose online monitoring. It is based on the silicon multi-strip sensor LHCb VELO (VErtex LOcator), developed originally for the LHCb experiment at CERN. The semi-circular detector geometry offers the possibility to measure beam intensity through halo measurements without interfering with the beam core. Results from initial tests using this monitor in the 40 MeV proton beamline at the University of Birmingham, UK are shown. Synchronised with an ionisation chamber and the RF cyclotron frequency, VELO was used as online monitor by measuring the intensity in the proton beam halo and using this information as basis for 3D beam profiles. Experimental results are discussed.

A novel method of measuring temperature of the coolant inside a reactor core is presented. The method, which is both standoff and non-invasive, is based on the interaction between an ultrasonic pulse and a delayed light pulse in the coolant. In the interaction, the light pulse, which is scattered backward by Brillouin scattering, is frequency-shifted. The frequency shift is dependent on the temperature and other parameters of the coolant. The light pulses and the ultrasound pulses are generated and detected outside of the core.

The development, testing and use of particle accelerator modeling codes is a core competency of accelerator research laboratories around the world, and likewise for synchrotron radiation and X-ray optics codes at lightsource facilities. Such codes require time and training to learn a command-line workflow involving multiple input and configuration files, execution on a high-performance server or cluster, post-processing with specialized software and finally visualization. Such workflows are error prone an difficult to reproduce. Cloud computing and UI design are core competencies of RadiaSoft LLC, where the Sirepo* framework is being developed to make state of the art codes available in the browser of any desktop, laptop or tablet. We present our initial successes as real world examples of knowledge exchange (KE) between industry and the research community. This work is leading to broader knowledge exchange throughout the community by facilitating education of students and enabling instantaneous sharing of simulation details between colleagues. Sirepo design objectives include: seamless integration with legacy codes, low barrier to entry for new users, configuration transfer to command line mode, catalog of provenance to aid reproducibility, and simplified collaboration through multimodal sharing. The Sirepo Scientific Gateway** allows users to directly test the software. The combination of intuitive browser-based GUIs and Sirepo’s server-side application container technology enables simplified computational archiving and reproducibility. If embraced by the community, this could become an important asset for the design, commissioning and future upgrade of particle accelerator and X-ray beamline facilities.

Thermionic energy converters (TEC) are a class of thermoelectric devices, which promise improvements to the efficiency and cost of both small- and large-scale electricity generation. A TEC is comprised of a narrowly-separated thermionic emitter and an anode. Simple structures are often space-charge limited as operating temperatures produce currents exceeding the Child-Langmuir limit. We present results from 3D simulations of these devices using the particle-in-cell code Warp, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. We demonstrate improvements to the Warp code permitting high fidelity simulations of complex device geometries. These improvements include modeling of non-conformal geometries using mesh refinement and cut-cells with a dielectric solver, in addition to importing geometries directly from standard CAD output. In this paper we showcase some of these new features and demonstrate their use.

Mu*STAR: A Modular Accelerator-Driven Subcritical Reactor Design

Mu*STAR is an accelerator-driven molten-salt sub-critical reactor based on recent superconducting RF technological breakthroughs that allow a highly efficient and powerful proton accelerator to drive a spallation target inside a graphite-moderated, thermal-spectrum reactor. The additional spallation neutrons can be used to overcome the absorption of neutrons by fission products to allow a deeper burn than is possible with critical reactor designs. Simulations have shown that as much as seven times the energy that was extracted from used fuel from light water reactors can be produced by this method before the accelerator demands significant power from the reactor. Once the fuel rods have been converted from oxide ceramics to fluoride salts, in a process that is proliferation resistant (not chemical reprocessing), the fuel can be burned for centuries without increasing its volume while reducing its radio-toxicity. Our 2017 GAIN voucher grant supported studies by ORNL, SRNL, and INL to design and cost a Fuel Processing Plant to convert used nuclear fuel into the molten-salt fuel for Mu*STAR. Based on those studies, it seems possible to build Mu*STAR systems on existing sites where used fuel is stored, convert it to fluoride salts, and use it to provide affordable carbon-free electricity for centuries.

Resonant laser excitation of the electron in a hydrogen atom is essential to achieve high-efficiency laser stripping of hydrogen ion (H−) beam. In the laser stripping experiments recently carried out at SNS, an ultra-violet (UV) laser was used to excite the electrons in 1-GeV hydrogen atoms from the n=1 state to the n=3 state. In this talk, we propose a sequential resonant excitation scheme by using two laser beams to excite electrons in a sequence of two steps: from the n=1 state to the n=2 state and from the n=2 state to any higher state. The advantages of the sequential resonant excitation scheme include (1) lower laser power requirement due to higher transition probability in the first excitation step and (2) possibility of shifting the stripping laser wavelength from UV regime to longer wavelengths. An application of the sequential resonant excitation scheme in combination with the double-resonance optical cavity technology to the laser stripping of 1.3-GeV H− beam (envisioned in the SNS proton power upgrade project) will be described.

The Brookhaven National Laboratory continues to provide technical support and guidance to Best Medical International to build and test a 60 degree magnetic arc of a rapid-cycling ion synchrotron for cancer treatment. The 60 degree magnetic sector on its guirder has undergone field measurements, including the production of partial 3D field maps. Concurrently, OPERA field map computations as well as lattice and beam dynamics simulations have been performed, aimed at both preparing and analyzing the field measurements. Contingency responses aimed at adapting to non-ideal orbit and optics have been devised. These works and their outcomes are summarized here.

There is a great deal of interest in the medical community in the use of the alpha-emitter 211-At as a therapeutic isotope. Among other things, its 7.2 hour half life is long enough to allow for recovery and labeling, but short enough to avoid long term activity in patients. Unfortunately, the only practical technique for its production is to bombard a 209-Bi target with a ~29 MeV alpha beam, so it is not accessible to commercial isotope production facilities, which all use fixed energy proton beams. The US Department of Energy is therefore supporting the development of a "University Isotope Network" (UIN) to satisfy this need. Our prposoal is to retrofit the variable-energy, multi-species cyclotron at the Crocker Nuclear Laboratory at the University of California Davis with an internal Bi-209 target, such that we can put at least 100 uA of 29 MeV alpha particles on target without concerns about extraction efficiency. Using very conservative assumptions, we are confident we will be able to produce 60 mCi of 211-At in solution in an eight hour shift, which includes setup, exposure, and chemical recovery. This poster will cover the design of the target, as well as the required chemical processing and reliability upgrades.

The Ion-12SC is a sub-compact, 12.5 MeV proton su-perconducting isochronous cyclotron for commercial medical isotope production recently developed at Ionetix Corporation [1]. The machine features a patented cold steel and cryogen-free conduction cooling magnet, a low power internal cold-cathode PIG ion source, and an inter-nal liquid target [2]. It was initially designed to produce N-13 ammonia for dose on-demand cardiology applica-tions but can also be used to produce F-18, Ga-68 and other medical isotopes widely used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The 1st engineering prototype was completed and commissioned in September 2015, and four additional units have been completed since [3]. The first two units have been installed and operated at the University of Michigan and MIT. R&D efforts in physics and engineering have continued to improve machine performance, stability and reliability. These improve-ments include: 1) Water cooling added to the dummy dee to limit the operating temperature of the ion source to improve lifetime and performance, 2) Magnetic field maps, obtained with a Hall probe based mapper, were used to accurately measure the isochronism and provide information needed to compensate for any unwanted 1st harmonics and 3) Feedback based control methods ap-plied to regulate the beam intensity on target by adjusting the ion source cathode current. The C1 unit installed at the University of Michigan Medical School early this year treated ~100 patients/month with N-13 ammonia. The machines are now capable of routinely producing > 21 doses/day with > 99% availability. The Ionetix manu-facturing facility is capable of producing up to 30 ma-chines per year.

We report our proof-of-principle design and experi-mental commissioning of broadly tunable and low-cost transverse focusing lens system for MeV-energy electron beams at the ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) beam-line of the Accelerator Test Facility II of BNL. We exper-imentally demonstrate the independent control over the size and divergence of the electron beam at the sample via tunable quadrupoles. By applying online optimiza-tion, we achieve minimum beam sizes 75 µm from 1 to 13 pC, two orders of magnitude higher charge density than previously achieved using conventional solenoid tech-nique. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate Bragg-diffraction image (BDI) with significant improvement up to 3 times brighter and 2 times sharper BDI peaks via the optimized quadrupoles, improvement larger with higher charge. The result could be crucial for the future single-shot ultra-fast electron microscope development.

Proton computed tomography aims to increase the accuracy of proton treatment planning by directly measuring proton stopping power. This imaging technique requires a proton beam of 330 MeV incident kinetic energy for adult patients. Employing superconducting technology in the beam delivery system allows it to be of comparable size to a conventional proton therapy gantry. A superconducting bending magnet design for a proton computed tomography gantry is proposed in this paper. The 30 deg, 3.9 T canted-cosine-theta dipole wound with NbTi wires is used to steer 330 MeV protons in an isocentric beam delivery system which rotates around the patient. Two methods of magnetic field shielding are compared in the context of proton therapy facility requirements; traditional passive shielding with an iron yoke placed around the magnet and an active shielding option utilising extra layers of the superconducting coil.
