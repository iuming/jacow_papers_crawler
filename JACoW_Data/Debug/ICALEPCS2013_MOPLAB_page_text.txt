Measurement and instrumentation are prime movers in nearly every scientific discipline. To a large extent, new measurement capabilities such as higher speed, better sensitivity, and higher density, have enabled new scientific advancements. The concept of heterogeneous computing with FPGAs, multi-core processors, and GPUs, has further impacted instrumentation and control. As these different systems come together, tools and platform vendors have to work together to reduce the barrier to entry to these latest technologies. Abstraction at the appropriate level, combined with a platform-based system approach, enables domain experts such as particle physicists and fusion scientists to focus on innovation and discovery while leveraging the latest available technologies. This plenary talk will focus on industry trends and advances that improve instrumentation and control and offer insights on what lies ahead.
