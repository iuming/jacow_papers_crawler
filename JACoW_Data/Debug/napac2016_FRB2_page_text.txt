Application of Superconducting Technology for Proton Therapy

ProNova is developing SC cyclotrons and gantries for application in cancer therapy with proton beams. Superconducting magnets have multiple benefits; not only are they dramatically smaller in size, weight and power consumption, they also have a magnetic field 2x higher than those used in today's cyclotrons and gantries, in addition to a 0.5x bend radius. Taking advantage of this technology, the SC360 system maintains 360° rotation similar to radiation therapy, while the dramatically smaller size and weight allows for ample room for full ring imaging at isocenter and simplified shipping and installation, reducing cost and time to market.

Developments in low-frequency superconducting RF accelerating structures have created a commercial niche for 4 K superconducting electron accelerator systems at high powers. This presentation will discuss niobium accelerating structures, the liquid helium refrigerator, high power microwave source, radiation shielding and licensing for high-average-power commercial electron accelerators. Applications to be briefly reviewed include radioisotope production, high-power x-ray generation (for cargo scanning, industrial sterilization, etc.), high-flux neutron sources, high intensity positron sources, and high-power free-electron lasers.

Operation of high-power SRF particle accelerators at two US national laboratories allows us to consider a less-expensive nuclear reactor that operates without the need for a critical core, fuel enrichment, or reprocessing. A multipurpose reactor design that takes advantage of this new accelerator capability includes an internal spallation neutron target and high-temperature molten-salt fuel with continuous purging of volatile radioactive fission products. The reactor contains less than a critical mass and almost a million times fewer volatile radioactive fission products than conventional reactors like those at Fukushima. We describe GEMSTAR , a reactor that without redesign will burn spent nuclear fuel, natural uranium, thorium, or surplus weapons material. A first application is to burn 34 tonnes of excess weapons grade plutonium as an important step in nuclear disarmament under the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement **. The process heat generated by this W-Pu can be used for the Fischer-Tropsch conversion of natural gas and renewable carbon into 42 billion gallons of low-CO2-footprint, drop-in, synthetic diesel fuel for the DOD.
