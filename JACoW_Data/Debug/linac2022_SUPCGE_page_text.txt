The regenerative Beam Break Up (BBU) excited by the dipole Higher Order Modes (HOMs) in superconducting RF (SRF) cavities is a crucial issue for continuous-wave high-current energy recovery linacs. Beam-induced monopole HOMs can increase the cryogenic losses of the linac also. One of the ways to limit these effects is to use HOM couplers on the beam tubes of cavities to absorb and untrap cavity eigenmodes. These couplers feature antennas designed to damp dangerous HOMs and adequately reject the fundamental mode. This study illustrates an investigation of the HOMs of a 5-cell 801.58 MHz elliptical SRF cavity designed for PERLE (Powerful Energy Recovery Linac for Experiments), a multi-turn energy recovery linac (ERL) currently under study and later to be hosted at IJCLab in Orsay. Time-domain wakefield and frequency-domain eigenmode simulations have been used to calculate the cavity broadband HOM impedance spectra and identify the dangerous BBU HOMs. The transmission characteristics of several coaxial HOM couplers have been studied. The efficiencies of several HOM-damping schemes have been compared to propose a HOM endgroup to be fabricated and added to the existing bare SRF cavity.

The 800 MHz RFQ (radio-frequency quadrupole), developed and built at KAHVElab (Kandilli Detector, Accelerator and Instrumentation Laboratory) at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey, has been designed to provide protons that have an energy of 2 MeV within only 1 m length. The RFQ consists of two modules and the test module of RFQ was constructed. The algorithm developed by CERN, based on the measurements generated by the tuner settings estimated through the response matrix [1,2,3], has been optimized for a single module and 16 tuners. The desired field consistent with the simulation was obtained by bead pull measurements. In this study, we present low-power rf measurements and field tuning of the test module.

To treat industrial effluents including contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), Irradiation treatment by electron beam accelerator has shown promising results. Our aim is to design and develop a superconducting linear electron accelerator. A 1.3 GHz, three cell conduction cooled, TM class superconducting cavity has been proposed to accelerate a 100 mA electron beam from 100 keV to 4.5 MeV. The main aim of the design is to optimize the cavity for low heat loss and high accelerating gradient. The optimized ratio of peak surface electric and magnetic field to accelerating field for cavity are Epk/Eacc= 2.72 and Hpk/Eacc= 4.11 mT/(MV/m). The optimized Geometry factor (G) and R/Q values for this cavity are 246.7 and 306.4 ohms respectively. Here we also addressed other multiphysics issues such as Lorentz force detuning (LFD), Higher order modes (HOMs) and Multipacting. The multiphysics analysis helps to estimate the degree of these challenges. The final Lorentz detuning factor of the cavity has been reduced to 0.12 Hz/(MV/m)2, HOMs of 2.18 and 2.9 GHz modes are dominating except the main mode and Multipacting phenomena is not found at 15 MV/m of accelerating gradient.

The design and optimization of the proposed 1.3 GHz gridded thermionic electron gun aims to drive a conduction cooled superconducting electron accelerator that will be used to treat contaminants of emerging concern in water bodies. The gun geometry is Pierce-type and optimized for beam current of 1A with LaB6 as cathode material at cathode potential of -100 kV. The final optimized cathode radius and angle of inclination of the focusing electrode are found to be 1.5 mm, and 77 degree respectively. For an emittance compensation electrode, the optimized values for thickness and potential are 2 mm and -50 kV respectively, and separation between cathode and compensator is 8 mm. Beam dynamics calculations have been performed with self-developed particle tracking code that assumes space charge interactions and imported fields. The beam dynamics simulations show that with an initial bunch length of 50 ps having a bunch charge of 5 pC, the bunch length of the bunch reduces to 33 ps. The diameter, transverse and longitudinal emittance obtained are 2.8 mm, 1 mm-mrad and 5 mm-mrad respectively.

High-energy electron accelerators have been used in water purification for several years. They are very effective for the removal of complex impurities. This study aims to design a superconducting electron beam accelerator with an output energy of 1 MeV and beam power of 40 kW for wastewater treatment. A 1.3 GHz single cell elliptic cavity with β = 1 was designed and optimized for TM010 mode and an accelerating gradient of 15 MV/m. For the optimized cavity, the RF parameters, namely, R/Q, transit time factor and geometry factor (G) were found to be 174.93 ohm, 0.67 and 276 ohm, respectively. Multiphysics studies showed that the value of R/Q for fundamental accelerating mode was 174.93 ohm. It was much higher than that of other modes, thus, HOM coupler is not required for the system. The Lorentz force detuning coefficient after stiffening the cavity iris, and the temperature rise due to the RF surface losses were found to be 0.20 Hz/(MV/m)2 and 0.085 K, respectively. It is also observed that there is no occurrence of multipacting for the designed accelerating gradient.

Proton Test Beam at KahveLAB (Kandilli Detector, Accelerator and Instrumentation Laboratory) project aims to design and produce a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) operating at 800 MHz in Istanbul, Turkey using the local resources. The beamline consists of a proton source, a low energy beam transport (LEBT) line including the beam diagnostic section, and the RFQ cavity itself. This RFQ is a 4-vane, 1-meter-long cavity to accelerate the 20 keV beam extracted from the plasma ion source to 2 MeV. Its engineering prototype is already produced and subjected to mechanical, low-power RF, and vacuum tests. In this poster, the results of the first test production, especially the bead-pull test setup will be discussed.

High order modes (HOMs) in multi-cell superconducting cavities are of particular concern in beam dynamics of linear accelerators, mainly those operating in CW mode with high current and high repetition rate. These undesired modes may invoke beam instabilities, beam breakup and increase the energy spread if not correctly pulled out and damped. The study reported in this paper is applied for damping the HOMs in the main Linac of BriXSinO, an ongoing project of an Energy Recovery Linac at LASA INFN laboratory. We developed a numerical model to study the interaction of monopole HOMs with the beam in long timescale. The presented model, named HOMEN (High Order Modes Evolution based on eNergy budget), allows the evaluation of the loss factor Kloss, crucial for evaluating the perturbing modes. At the same time, electromagnetic simulations of the standing wave multicell cavity, highlighted the dangerous modes and revealed a tolerable beam energy spread induced by HOMs. This method allows us to distinguish all dangerous modes of our interest for implementing the necessary damping mechanisms.
