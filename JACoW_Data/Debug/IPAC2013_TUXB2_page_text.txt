Short-pulse operation of synchrotron light source storage rings can be useful for both the production of IR and THz-band radiation and high repetition rate pump-probe science in the X-ray regime. Different approaches to short-pulse generation include low-alpha optics configurations, two-frequency RF potential manipulation, laser-induced femtoslicing, longitudinal crab-cavity deflection and pseudo-bunch operation with a fast kicker to isolate a single bunch. This talk should review each of these techniques and discuss implications for machine operation in terms of pulse length, beam intensity, beam stability, pulse repetition rate, output radiation beam quality and potential applications.
