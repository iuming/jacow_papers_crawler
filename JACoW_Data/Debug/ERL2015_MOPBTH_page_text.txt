A proposal for a scientific and technical R&D facility based on a recirculating energy recovery linac (ERL) is under active development at CERN. It promises exciting technology developments of principal importance since the ERL technique is a unique way of economising the power consumption which possibly is the biggest common challenge of the next generation of energy frontier accelerators. Aside from various other technical and physics goals and applications considered, this ERL facility, in particular, aims at investigating the ERL principle, including its specific beam dynamics, operational and reliability issues, and at providing a test stand for SC RF cavity modules. The talk presents the high energy ERL configuration, and it outlines the concept and purpose of a 1 GeV electron beam 3-pass ERL facility.

Cornell University has prototyped technology essential for any high-brightness electron ERL. This includes a DC gun and an SRF injector Linac, a high-current CW cryomodule, a high-power beam stop, and several diagnostics tools for high-current and high-brightness beams. All these are now available to equip a one-cryomodule ERL, and laboratory space has been cleared out and is radiation shielded to install this ERL at Cornell. BNL has designed a multi-turn ERL for eRHIC where beam is transported 22 times around the RHIC tunnel. The number of transport lines is minimized by using two non-scaling FFAG arcs. A collaboration between BNL and Cornell has been formed to investigate the new NS-FFAG optics of this design, built with permanent magnets, and to commission the unprecedented multi-turn ERL operation. This collaboration plans to install a NS-FFAG return loop and the associated optics-matching sections at Cornell’s one-cryomodule ERL. This FFAG-ERL will be installed in several stages, each of which investigates crutial parts of this new design.

The Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin is constructing the Energy Recovery Linac Project BERLinPro. The project is designed to explore the accelerator physics and develop the technology necessary for the design, construction and operation of large scale facilities such as a future synchrotron light source. The project goal is the generation of a 50-MeV high current (100 mA) electron beam with an emittance (normalized) below 1 mm mrad and a pulse length of 2 ps rms or less. The planning phase of the project is completed and the design phase of most of the components is finished with procurement under way. The construction of the building started in February 2015. The status of the various subprojects and planned activities will be given.
This talk is being given on behalf of the BERLinPro Project Team
