The European Spallation Source (ESS) are currently developing a suite of fifteen neutron instruments, the first eight of which will be available for routine scientific use by 2023. The instrument control system will be distributed through three layers: local controllers for individual instrument components; Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) software to implement higher level logic and act as a hardware abstraction layer; and an Experiment Control Program (ECP) which has an executive role, interacting with instrument components via the EPICS layer. ESS are now actively designing and prototyping the EPICS controls architecture for the neutron instruments, including systems which interface to core instrument components such as motion control systems, sample environment equipment, neutron choppers, instrument Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) systems, and the interfaces to the ECP. Prototyping activities have been executed in an integrated and coordinated manner to demonstrate the EPICS controls architecture in an environment representative of the neutron instruments to which the architecture will ultimately be applied.

A series of versatile on-axis X-ray microscopes with large working distances, high resolution and large magnification have been developed for in-situ sample alignment and X-ray beam visualization at beam-lines at NSLS-II [1]. The microscopes use reflective optics, which minimizes dispersion, and allows imaging from Ultraviolet (UV) to Infrared (IR) with specifically chosen objective components (coatings, etc.) [2]. Currently over seven reflective microscopes have been procured with several installed at NSLS2 beam-lines. Additional customizations can be implemented providing for example dual-view with high/low magnification, 3-D imaging, long working range, as well as ruby pressure system measurement. The microscope camera control frequently utilizes EPICS areaDetector. In specialized applications python programs integrate EPICS camera control, with computer vision, and EPICS motion control for goniostat centering or object detection applications.

Beamlines for macromolecular crystallography (MX) are among the most automated beamlines at synchrotron radiation facilities around the globe. GM/CA@APS operates three EPICS-controlled MX beamlines. All aspects of controls including data acquisition software, computing, networking, data storage and remote access are managed locally, which enables fast development and efficient integration of all parts of the process. The core of the GM/CA control system is the open-source JBluIce* distributed data acquisition software, which integrates automated sample screening with robotic sample mounters, automated searches for small crystals, multiple modes of data collection, and automated strategy and data processing calculations. This presentation gives an overview of JBluIce and reports recent developments to support up to 100 fps shutterless data collection with fast Dectris Eiger and Pilatus detectors. The integration involved new approaches to detector-goniometer synchronization and data visualization, redesign of the computing and storage environment, and implementation of automated distributed data processing on clusters.

Software Architecture for Beamline Automation - VMXi  Use-Case

Versatile Macromolecular in-situ (VMXi) is the first beamline at Diamond Light Source (DLS) to be entirely automated with no direct user interaction to set up and control experiments. This marks a radical departure from other beamlines at the facility and it has presented a significant design challenge to General Data Acquisition (GDA), the in-house software that manages beamline data collection. GDA has become a reactive controller for continual, uninterrupted processing of all user experiments. A major achievement has been to demonstrate that it is possible to successfully deliver a suitable architectural implementation for automation developed within a standard integrate development environment (IDE). There is no need for specialised software or a domain specific language for automation. The objective is to: review VMXi project with the emphasis on hardware configuration and experiment processing; describe the software and control architecture for automation; and provide a general set of guidelines for developing software for automation at a scientific facility.

BLISS is the new ESRF control system for running experiments, with full deployment aimed for the end of the EBS upgrade program in 2020. BLISS provides a global approach to run synchrotron experiments, thanks to hardware integration, Python sequences and an advanced scanning engine. As a Python package, BLISS can be easily embedded into any Python application and data management features enable online data analysis. In addition, BLISS ships with tools to enhance scientists user experience and can easily be integrated into TANGO based environments, with generic TANGO servers on top of BLISS controllers. BLISS configuration facility can be used as an alternative TANGO database. Delineating all aspects of the BLISS project from beamline device configuration up to the integrated user interface, this talk will present the technical choices that drove BLISS design and will describe the BLISS software architecture and technology stack in depth.

A significant part of the experiments run at Alba Synchrotron* involve scans. The continuous scans were developed first ad hoc and latter the controls group dedicated important efforts to standardize them across the Alba instruments, enhancing the overall performance and allowing the users to better exploit the beamtime**. Sardana***, the experiment control software used at Alba, among other features, aims to provide a generic way of programming and executing continuous scans. This development just achieved a major milestone - an official version with a stable API. Recently the Alba instruments were successfully upgraded to profit from this release. In this paper we describe the evolution of these setups as well as the new continuous scan applications run at Alba. On the one hand, the most relevant hardware solutions are presented and assessed. On the other hand the Sardana software is evaluated in terms of its utility in building the continuous scans setups. Finally we discuss the future improvements plan designed to satisfy the ever-increasing requirements of the scientists.

Optimised Multi-Dimensional Image Scanning With Rascan

On-the-fly scanning has significantly improved one dimensional scans by removing motion overheads between pixels. However, realisation of multi-dimensional techniques such as tomography and XANES imaging is presently stymied by overheads that occur on a line-by-line basis. At the Australian Synchrotron's XFM beamline, inevitable "overheads" can add up to a significant wasted beam time. Therefore, there is a clear need for further optimisation of scan motion to formulate and minimise higher dimensional overheads. Here we outline our approach to realise trajectory scans that are optimised for trajectory tracking accuracy with minimised overhead times. The scan motion is seen as fly-scan lines, and overhead moves between the lines which form a two dimensional raster scan in a transformed geometry. This separation of 'required' and 'overhead' motions has provided an efficient platform for formulating an optimisation problem which is solved to obtain the optimised scan trajectory. The solution known as Rascan, is in operation at the XFM beamline of the Australian Synchrotron since May 2016, resulting in significant gains in throughput, performance and efficiency.
