The 59th ICFA Advance Beam Dynamics Workshop on Energy Recovery Linacs, hosted by the CERN was held on CERN campus. The working group (WG) 1 ERL injectors focused on high-brightness, high-power CW electron gun and high QE long lifetime semiconductor photocathode. The working group 1 was separated into two sessions: One is electron gun session, which has eight invited talks; another is photocathode session, which has six invited talks and one contributed talk. This report summarizes the state of the art of electron guns and photocathodes discussed in the ERL workshop WG1.

During the workshop a number of interesting projects were discussed: ERL at KEK, ALICE, PERLE, LHeC, eRHIC, CBETA, ERL for MESA and BERLinPro; a nice mixture of future, existing and past facilities. A rather vigorous development of new ERLs is aggressively pushing the limits: maximizing number of passes, maximizing virtual beam power, opening longitudinal acceptance, mitigation of limiting factors: BBU, CSR/microbunching, diagnostics and Instrumentation for multiple beams, multiparticle tracking studies of dark current and halo formation. A bright future can be expected for the field.

For the ERL17 Applications Working Group (WG5), a focus was identified for Photon science and Particle and Nuclear Physics application areas. For the Photon applications; THz, FEL and Compton drivers were most relevant and for the Particle and Nuclear Physics field, Compton, Polarised and Cooled beams were most prominent. The following then highlights the key performance needs, challenges and anticipated future demands for each of these application areas as reviewed and discussed at the workshop.
