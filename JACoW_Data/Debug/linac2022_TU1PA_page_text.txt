The production of high brightness electron beams has been key to the success of the X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) as the new frontier in X-ray sources. The past two decades have seen the commissioning of numerous XFEL facilities, which quickly surpassed Synchrotron light sources to become the most brilliant X-ray sources. Such facilities have, so far, heavily relied on room temperature S-band RF photoguns to produce the high brightness electron bunches required for lasing, however such photoguns are reaching their peak performance limit and new methods must be investigated to continue to increase the brightness of these facilities. This talk will begin with a review of the design and performance of several electron guns currently operational in XFELs. Following will be a discussion of current efforts in continuing to increase this peak brightness including moving to cold cathode schemes and the use of very high gradients on the cathode. Finally we will describe ongoing activities at PSI to develop the next generation of high gradient RF photoguns for increased peak brightness.

Low Intrinsic Emittance in Space-Charge Dominated Photoinjectors

Reducing the intrinsic emittance of photocathodes is in principle one of the most promising routes to improving the brightness of photoinjectors, but it is often unclear to what extent these reductions actually improve the final emittance of practical space charge-dominated injectors. This talk will first discuss simulation optimizations that show that intrinsic emittance reductions of at least an order of magnitude beyond the state of the art can still yield dramatic emittance improvements in multiple applications including free-electron laser injectors and ultrafast electron diffraction. Finally, this talk will discuss the status of the generation of low intrinsic emittance in modern semiconductor photocathodes, and will present new results on the minimum achievable intrinsic emittances from CsTe photocathodes.

The Physics of Transverse Emittance Manipulations
 


 

B.E. Carlsten
                       ARDAP, Washington, USA

 


 

This talk will review the physics of the phase-space manipulations in general, and emittance compensation specifically. All the key elements of the several schemes will be discussed to overview the broad topic of transverse phase-space manipulations, focusing on the underlying beam physics. The special schemes of non-symplectic manipulations will be discussed and the impact of the techniques for developed for electrons will be discussed for broader application as for ion beams.
