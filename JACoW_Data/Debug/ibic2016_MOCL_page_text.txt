The Faraday Cup (FCUP) Award was born in 1989 during the first Beam Instrumentation Workshop (BIW) held at Brookhaven National Lab (USA). Since the merging of the American BIW and the European DIPAC conferences into the, now, International Beam Instrumentation Conference, IBIC, this prize is sponsored by the conference itself and it is the first time the Faraday Cup is awarded in this new model. During this presentation, the FCUP winner will be announced and he/she will present his/her novel work. More information can be found at: https://www.faraday-cup.com/

RF cavities have been designed and constructed that simultaneously and exclusively resonate many harmonic TMono modes. These modes are axially symmetric and have their electric field maximum along the cavities bore. A periodic beam passing through a harmonic cavities bore excites these modes whose superposition can be measured at the cavities antenna with a sampling oscilloscope. Processing the detected waveform with the harmonic cavities transfer function yields the Fourier series of the beam, and a near real-time, non-invasive measurement of the beams longitudinal bunch shape and duration. Experiments have been performed on the 130 kV injector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facilities Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility. The harmonic cavities sensitivity was near 1 mV/μA and measured beam bunches ranging in width from 45 to 150 picoseconds (FWHM). These measurements were in close agreement with measurements made using an invasive bunch measurement system as well as predictions by a particle tracking simulations.

Traditionally the IBIC accepts only contributions about beam instrumentation or beam diagnostics, which describe existing installations with beam measurements or other well settled subjects. In order to make room for new ideas or a description of unsolved problems the program committee has launched a small initiative called "speaker's corner", during which people will be invited to present shortly any sort of strange idea they have or report on unsolved problems, for which they need help in understanding. All contributions to this event will not be published in the proceedings.
