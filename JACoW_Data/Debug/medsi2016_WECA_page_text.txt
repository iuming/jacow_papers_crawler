Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps are widely used for maintaining a clean ultra-high vacuum (UHV) of ≤10-8 Pa because of their high pumping speeds for hydrogen and active gases in the UHV region. In addition, they are oil free, evaporation free, sputtering free, sublimation free, magnetic field free, vibration free, economical, compact, lightweight, and energy saving. In the present paper, we report a new NEG pump which is composed of commercial 60 NEG pills (Dia.10 mm × t3 mm; 70 wt% Zr, 24.6 wt% V, and 5.4 wt% Fe), titanium parts, a DN 40 conflat flange, and a tantalum heater. The NEG pills are vertically and radially aligned around the heater to maximize the effective area for pumping. After activation at 400 °C for 30 min, the pumping speeds of the NEG pump were measured with the orifice method. Pumping speeds of 140-130, 200-140, 190-130, and 35-17 L/s were estimated for H2, CO, CO2, and N2 gasses, respectively, in a pumped-quantity range of 0.01-0.1 Pa·L. Since the NEG pump is composed of a heating unit and a NEG module, the pumping speeds can be improved by increasing the number of NEG modules. These NEG pumps are favourable alternatives to sputtering ion pumps.

The ESRF - EBS new lattice implies a high level of requirement for all components. This talk will focus on the mechanical design solutions adopted for the chambers to fulfil the geometrical, thermal, vacuum and RF requirements. The main challenges are the small distance between the poles of the magnets, the small distance between the magnets and the impedance budget. In that respect the novel design of the vacuum chambers and the RF fingers will be presented.

The development of the U15 undulator was presented at the MEDSI Conference 2012 in Shanghai. Meanwhile the undulator line is finished. The presentation will explain the experience with the production, the assembling and the commissioning of the undulators. We succeeded to implement a robotic system, that did the final adjustment of all the magnets automatically. Therefore, we were able to reduce the time for the adjustment of the magnets dramatically. A whole loop with measuring, adjustment of the columns and final adjustment with the robotic system for the magnets takes 3 days. The presentation will explain these steps. For the next beam-line, we will profit from the experience of the U15 undulator development, but there are new requirements, because it will be a polarized undulator with a period of 38mm. We are developing a new arrangement of the drives, a further development of the magnet keepers and a vacuum-pipe with only 0.2mm of wall thickness.

Horizontal-Gap Vertically-Polarizing Undulator (HGVPU) Design Challenges and Resolutions
288

The Horizontal-Gap Vertically-Polarizing Undulator (HGVPU) is a compact, innovative, variable-gap insertion device developed by Argonne National Laboratory for the LCLS-II HXR beamline at SLAC. A full sized 3.4-meter-long prototype has been built and fully tested meeting all LCLS-II undulator specifications. An array of conical springs compensates the attractive magnetic forces of the undulator jaws. These springs are designed to exhibit non-linear spring characteristics that can be closely tuned to match the force curve exerted by the magnetic field, thereby minimizing the overall deflection of the strongbacks. The HGVPU also utilizes the existing LCLS-I support and motion system along with other existing equipment and infrastructure, thus lowering overall cost and installation downtime.

Canadian Light Source (CLS) in Saskatoon, Canada has several cryogenic systems. One of the most critical is a 4.4 K liquid helium system for a superconducting RF cavity. This system consists of a Linde TCF-50 liquid helium plant coupled to a Cornell-designed CESR-B 500 MHz cavity and cryomodule via a 52 metre multi-channel transfer line. Over the years CLS has evaluated failures on the system as well as risks for downtime, and has come up with plans for a major upgrade to the superconducting RF system to improve reliability. An overview of performance and issues to date is presented. Some of the specifics of the risk analysis and upgrade plan will be examined, and details of the process flow discussed.

Funding: European Research Council (ERC) advance grant
COXINEL (COherent Xray source INferred from Electrons accelerated by Laser) is a European Research Council (ERC) advance grant aims at demonstrating Free Electron Laser amplification at 200 nm with 180 MeV electrons generated by laser plasma acceleration. A special electron beam transfer line with adequate diagnostics has been designed for this project. Strong-focusing variable-field permanent magnet quadrupoles, energy de-mixing chicane and a set of conventional quadrupoles condition the electron beam before its entrance to an In-Vacuum U20 undulator. This presentation describes some of the features incorporated into the design of the magnets, girders, vacuum vessels and diagnostic equipment for this experimental machine. Progress on the equipment preparation and installation is presented as well.

The in-situ versatile macromolecular X-tallography (VMXi) beamline delivers a high flux density, taking data directly from crystallisation experiments within the plate, using a fully automated endstation. A double multilayer monochromator (DMM) was designed in-house to deliver a 60 fold increase in flux. Two robots and an automated load-lock pass the plates from the crystallisation storage units to the goniometer. A compact endstation was designed to accept the high flux and take data with acquisition times down to a millisecond. This paper gives an overview of the beamline layout and the interesting pieces of engineering design. The beamline is planned to take first user at the end of 2016.
