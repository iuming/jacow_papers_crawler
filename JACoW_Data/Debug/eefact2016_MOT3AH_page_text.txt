Designs for future high-energy circular electron-positron colliders are based on both established and novel concepts. An appropriate design will allow these facilities to serve not only as ‘‘Higgs factories'', but also as Z, W and top factories, and, in addition, to become a possible first step to a higher-energy hadron collider.

VEPP-2000 e+e− collider at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics was commissioned in 2009 and collected data during three runs in whole designed energy range of 160-1000 MeV per beam. The Round Colliding Beams concept was implemented at VEPP-2000 to get a significant enhancement in beam-beam limit. The beam-beam parameter value as high as 0.12 per IP was achieved at intermediate energy. To obtain more intensive beams and achieve target luminosity at top energies the injection chain upgrade was done during 2013-2016. Presently VEPP-2000 is recommissioned and ready to start data taking.

We present preliminary description of compact e+e− collider with maximum beam energy of 300 MeV. At the beam energy of 100 MeV the physics program includes first production, observation and study of true muonium (bound state of mu+mu-). The width of true muonium is very narrow; therefore, we implemented monochromatization scheme proposed by A. Reniere. At higher energy, goals are to measure pion form factor and cross sections of rare decays. The small size and energy of the collider simplify design of the magnets, vacuum chamber, RF system and radiation protection decreasing construction time and cost of the whole facility. The accelerator is interesting from accelerator point of view because of monochromatization, beam-beam effects with dispersion, intra-beam scattering study and suppression.
