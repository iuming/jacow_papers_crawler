The electrostatic induction type beam position monitors (BPMs) for circular accelerators such as proton synchrotrons and electron accumulation rings will be discussed. Discussions on the beam induced charge on the BPM pick-up electrodes, signal detection systems, and techniques of beam based alignment and beam based calibration will be given. For high beam current machines, the evaluation of the beam coupling impedance of BPM is an important issue to avoid the beam current limit by beam instabilities caused by BPM impedances. Another serious problem is the movement of BPMs by the thermal distortion of the beam pipe by high power synchrotron radiation. These problems will be also mentioned briefly.
