Efficient acceleration and manipulation of high-brightness electron beams using terahertz waves in a compact setup has been recently a hot research topic in acceleration community. Previous works have achieved multi-MV/m acceleration gradient and dozens of keV energy gain while leaving room for further improvements in the high-energy regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate whole-bunch acceleration and cascaded terahertz-driven acceleration of a relativistic beam with a record energy gain of 204 keV. A terahertz-driven all-optical electron source is now under development, which hold great potential for terahertz-driven ultrafast electron diffraction and related scientific discoveries.

Plasma-wakefield accelerators driven by intense particle beams promise to significantly reduce the size of future high-energy facilities. These applications require an energy-efficient acceleration process with a well-controlled energy spectrum, both of which can be achieved simultaneously by tailoring the plasma wakefield. A prerequisite for such control of the wakefield is its precise measurement. Here we discuss a new measurement technique that enables femtosecond-level sampling of the longitudinal electric fields and that is particularly powerful due to its operational simplicity*. Using this method, we experimentally demonstrated optimal beam loading in a nonlinear electron-driven plasma accelerator by wakefield flattening at the few-percent level**. Bunches were accelerated at a gradient of 1.3 GV/m and with an energy-transfer efficiency of (42±4)% while preserving per-mille energy spreads with full charge coupling. These results open the door to the high-quality operation of future plasma accelerators through precise control of the acceleration process.

Next-generation plasma-based accelerators can push electron bunches to gigaelectronvolt energies within centimeter distances. So far, several experiments have demonstrated high gradient and succesfull beam acceleration but the resulting beam quality, in terms of energy spread and emittance, is still lower than the state-of-the-art conventional accelerators. Several proof-of-principle experiments have recently demonstrated very promising results thanks to contribution from different scientific communities with different expertise (lasers, rf-accelerators, plasma). These findings will significantly impact the optimization of the acceleration module and its implementation in forthcoming compact machines for user-oriented applications. An overview of these recent achievements and of the recent results obtained in the framework of the EuPRAXIA collaboration will be presented and discussed in this talk.

We have developed a THz-driven field emission electron gun and beam characterization assembly. The two cell standing-wave gun operates in the pi mode at 110.08 GHz. It is designed to produce 360 keV electrons with 500 kW of input power supplied by a 110 GHz gyrotron. Multiple gun structures were electroformed in copper using a high precision diamond-turned mandrel. The field emission cathode is a rounded copper tip located in the first cell. The cavity resonances were mechanically tuned using azimuthal compression. This work will discuss details of the fabrication and tuning and present the results of low power measurements.

There is a strong need for intense positron sources for future colliders. A crystal-based hybrid positron source could be an alternative to conventional sources based on the e- conversion into e+ in a thick target. The basic idea of the hybrid source is to split the e+ converter into a gamma-quanta radiator plus a gamma-to-positron converter*. In such a scheme an e- beam crosses a thin axially oriented crystal with emission of "channeling radiation", characterized by a considerably larger amount of photons w.r.t. standard bremsstrahlung**. The net result is an increase in the number of e+ produced at the converter target. In the hybrid scheme, only photons reach the converter, thereby reducing the Peak Energy Deposition Density (PEDD) in the target. Here we present the results of a test conducted at the DESY TB with 5.6 GeV e- interacting with a W crystal. A huge enhancement in the radiated energy and in the photon emission has been recorded and reproduced with Monte Carlo simulations***. This study is relevant for the design of the FCC-ee positron source. Indeed, through Monte Carlo, we also investigated the best parameters of the crystal radiator suited for the FCC-ee e+ source.

To overcome limits on total acceleration achievable in plasma wakefield accelerators, specially shaped drive beams can be used to increase the transformer ratio, implying that the drive beam deceleration is minimized in comparison with acceleration obtained in the wake. We report the results of a nonlinear PWFA, high transformer ratio experiment using high-charge, longitudinally asymmetric drive beams in a plasma cell. An emittance exchange process is used to generate variable drive current profiles, in conjunction with a long (multiple plasma wavelength) witness beam. The witness beam is energy-modulated by the wakefield, yielding a response that contains detailed spectral information in a single-shot measurement. Using these methods, we generate a variety of beam profiles and characterize the wakefields, directly observing beam-loaded transformer ratios up to 7.8. Further, a spectrally-based current reconstruction technique, validated by 3D particle-in-cell simulations, is introduced to obtain the drive beam profile from the decelerating wakefield data.

For the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, we have developed a compact and cost-effective cyclotron-based driver to produce high current beams (cw proton beam currents of >10 mA at 60 MeV). This is a factor of 4 higher than the current state-of-the-art for cyclotrons and a factor of 10 compared to what is commercially available. All areas of physics that call for high cw currents can greatly benefit from this result; e.g. particle physics, medical isotope production, and energy research. This increase in beam current is possible in part because the cyclotron is designed to include and use vortex-motion, allowing clean extraction. Such a design process is only possible with the help of high-fidelity codes, like OPAL. Another novelty is the use of an RFQ embedded in the cyclotron yoke to bunch the beam during axial injection. Finally, using H2+ relieves some of the space charge constraints during injection. In this paper, we will give an overview of the project and then focus on the design and simulations of the cyclotron itself. We will describe the physics, computational tools, and simulation results. At the end, we will describe how we are including machine learning in the simulations.
