Our Institute CEA Saclay Irfu was in charge of the EPICS based control system platform for the accelerator projects Spiral2 at Ganil in Normandy and IFMIF/LIPAc at JAEA/Rokkasho (Japan). Our 3-year collaboration with ESS[*] has given us the opportunity to use new COTS hardware. We have made our CEA Irfu control platform evolve by retaining relevant and evolutive ESS solutions. Currently, CEA Irfu is in charge of the design, construction and commissioning at SNRC of the project SARAF-LINAC[**] (MEBT and Super Conducting Linac) including its control. This paper will present our proposition of architecture for the SARAF Linac using the new CEA Irfu hardware and software platforms.

LCLS-II is a superconducting upgrade to the existing Linear Coherent Light Source at SLAC with a continuous wave beam rate of up to 1 MHz. Construction is underway with first light planned for 2020. The LCLS-II Injector section that comprises low energy from the gun up to the location of the first cryomodule is based on the LBNL Advanced Photo-Injector Experiment (APEX), and is being provided by LBNL. In 2015, responsibility for controls design and fabrication was transferred to SLAC from LBNL to promote commonality with the rest of the LCLS-II control subsystems. Collaboration between the LBNL APEX controls community and SLAC LCSL-II controls team proved vital in advancing the controls architecture toward standardized implementations integrated with the rest of LCLS-II. An added challenge was a decision to commission the injector ~1.5 years ahead of the rest of the machine, in FY 2018. This early injector commissioning (EIC) is embraced as an opportunity to gain valuable experience with the majority of the LCLS-II controls, especially the 1MHz high performance subsystems (HPS), prior to first light.

This article describes in detail the steps of hardware installation and commissioning of components for undulator systems at European XFEL. In general, the work can be divided into 3 different steps: installation, alignment, and commissioning. During installation step, the following main components were rolled into the tunnel: - undulators with the control cabinets, intersection control cabinets, phase shifters, quadrupole movers, correction coils. They have been mounted according to the designed positions. Then all mentioned components have been aligned according to the specifications. Finally, the cabling has been done and basic tests were performed. As part of the commissioning, the calibration of the temperature sensors, as well as the measurements of the quadrupole mover travel distance has been done in the tunnel. Afterwards, the undulator limit switches and hard stops were adjusted to secure the vacuum chamber by closing the undulator gap up to 10mm. Eventually, the system was handed over to the global control system in order to perform all functional tests. The main focus is given to the components which are controlled or monitored by the undulator local control system [1].

Industrial power supplies deliver high and low voltage to a wide range of CERN's detector and accelerator components. These power supplies, sourced from external companies, are integrated into control systems via industry standard OPC servers. The servers are now being modernized. A key lesson learnt from running the previous generation of OPC servers is that vendor specific, black-box implementations can be costly in terms of support effort, particularly in diagnosing problems in large production-site deployments. This paper presents the projects producing the next generation of OPC servers; following an open, collaborative approach and a high degree of homogenization across the independent partners. The goal is to streamline development and support costs via code re-use and a template architecture. The collaborations aim to optimally combine CERN's OPC and production operations knowledge with each company's experience in integrating their hardware. This paper describes the considerations and constraints taken into account, including legal aspects, product commercialization and technical requirements to define a common collaborative approach across three hardware manufacturers.

At Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex (KO-MAC), we have been operating a proton linac since 2013 [1]. It consists of a 100 MeV accelerator and 5 operational target rooms. Beam operation at KOMAC is carried out by a home-grown control system with a machine protection system which affects the accelerator the least when the machine suddenly fails. Our work is mainly concentrated on interlock sequence of vacuum related equipments based on a programmable logic controller (PCL). PCLs monitor vacuum status and control vacuum pumps and gate valves. By applying interlock sequence to PCLs connected to the vacuum equipments, we close gate valves to isolate a failed part so the the rest of the accelerator remains under vacuum, and safely shut down the vacuum pumps. Then the MPS receives a signal to safely stop the beam operation to protect the accelerator. We describe in this paper architecture of our PLC on interlock sequence of vacuum related equipment and its implementation.

Data logging and archiving is an important task to identify and investigate malfunctions during storage ring operation. In order to enable a high-performance fault analysis, large amounts of data must be processed effectively. For this purpose a fundamental redesign of the present SQL database was necessary. The VME/VxWorks-driven CAN bus has been used for many years as the main field bus of the DELTA control system. Unfortunately, the corresponding CAN bus I/O modules were discontinued by the manufacturer. Thus, the CAN field bus is currently being replaced by a more up to date Modbus/TCP-IP communication (WAGO), which largely supersedes the VME/VxWorks layer. After hard- and software integration into the EPICS environment, several projects have been realized using this powerful field bus communication. The server migration to a 64-bit architecture was already carried out in the past. By now, all client programs and software tools have also been converted to 64-bit versions. In addition, the fast orbit feedback system project, using an in-house developed FPGA-based hardware, has been resumed. This report provides an overview of the developments and results of each project.

DISCOS [*] is a control system developed by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) and currently in use at three radio telescope facilities of Medicina, Noto and the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) [**]. DISCOS development is based on the adoption of the ALMA Common Software (ACS) framework. During the last two years, besides assisting the astronomical commissioning of the newly-built SRT and enabling its early science program, the control system has undergone some major upgrades. The long-awaited transition to a recent ACS version was performed, migrating the whole code base to 64 bit operative system and compilers, addressing the obsolescence problem that was causing a major technical debt to the project. This opportunity allowed us to perform some refactoring, in order to implement improved logging and resource management. During this transition the code management platform was migrated to a git-based versioning system and the continuous integration platform was modified to accommodate these changes. Further upgrades included the system completion at Noto and the expansion to handle new digital backends.

The vacuum control of the Large Hadron Collider and its injectors is based on PLC and SCADA off-the-shelf components. Since late '90s, CERN's vacuum group has developed a dedicated control framework to drive, monitor and log the more than 10 000 vacuum instruments. Also, in 1998, CERN's industrial controls group developed the UNICOS framework (UNified Industrial Control System), becoming a de facto standard of industrial control systems and gradually deployed in different domains at CERN (e.g. Cryogenics, HVAC…). After an initial prototype applying the UNICOS-CPC (Continuous Process Control) framework to the controls of some vacuum installations, both teams have been working on the development of vacuum-specific objects and their integration, together with new features, into the UNICOS framework. Such convergence will allow this generic framework to better fit the vacuum systems, while offering the advantages of using a widespread and well-supported framework. This paper reports on the experience acquired in the development and deployment of vacuum specific objects in running installations, as a prototype for the vacuum controls convergence with UNICOS.

The ISIS spallation neutron source has been a production facility for over 30 years, with a second target station commissioned in 2008. Over that time, the control system has had to incorporate several generations of computer and embedded systems, and interface with an increasingly diverse range of equipment. We discuss some of the challenges involved in maintaining and developing such a long lifetime facility.

At the heart of the LCLS-II are two undulator lines: the hard x-ray (HXR) line and the soft x-ray line (SXR). The SXR line is comprised of 21 variable gap undulator segments separated by an interspace stands with a cam positioning system capable of positioning in 5 degrees of freedom (DOF). The undulator segment motion control utilizes the Aerotech Ensemble motion controller through an EPICS Soft IOC (input-output controller). Its drive system consists of a Harmonic Drive servo system with feedback from two absolute full-gap encoders. Additional Aerotech motion controllers are used to control the cam-positioning system and phase shifters of the interspace stand. The HXR line is comprised of 32 undulator segments each including an integrated interspace assembly. The segment girder is placed on two stands with a similar cam-positioning system as in the SXR line allowing for movement in 5 DOF. As one of the design goals of the HXR line was to reuse the original LCLS girder positioning system, the motion control system is an upgraded version of that original system, using RTEMS on VME with Animatics SmartMotors.

The paper describes planning and execution of large-scale maintenance campaigns of SCADA systems for CERN accelerator and technical infrastructure. These activities, required to keep up with the pace of development of the controlled systems and rapid evolution of software, are constrained by many factors, such as availability for operation and planned interventions on equipment. Experience gathered throughout the past ten years of maintenance campaigns for the SCADA Applications Service at CERN, covering over 230 systems distributed across almost 120 servers, is presented. Further improvements for the procedures and tools are proposed to adapt to the increasing number of applications in the service and reduce maintenance effort and required downtime.

With the advent of LCLS-II, SLAC must effectively and collectively plan for operation of its premiere scientific production facility. LCLS-II presents unique new challenges for SLAC, with its electron beam rate of up to 1MHz, complex bunch patterns, and multiple beam destinations. These machine advancements, along with long-term goals for automated tuning, model dependent and independent analysis, and machine learning provide strong motivation to enhance the SLAC software toolkit based on augmenting EPICS V3 to take full advantage of EPICS V4 - which supports structured data and facilitates a language-agnostic middle-ware service layer. The software platform upgrade path in support of controls, online physics and experimental facilities software for the LCLS-I/II complex is described.

The Klystron Bake Station at SLAC is a facility for baking out klystrons (high power RF amplifiers) among other equipment in preparation for installation in the linac. The scope of this project was to upgrade the 30 year old controls (based on VMS and CAMAC) to utilize PLC automation and an EPICS user interface. The new system allows for flexible configuration of the bake out schedule which can be saved to files or edited real time both through an EPICS soft IOC as well as a local touch panel HMI. Other improvements include active long term archiving of all data, COTS hardware (replacing custom-built CAMAC cards), email notification of fault states, and graphical user interfaces (old system was command line only). The first station upgraded came online in November 2016 and two more stations are planned to follow this year. Year poster discusses the improvements made and problems encountered in performing the upgrade.

The Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLSII) is a new Free Electron Laser (FEL) facility being built as an upgrade to the existing LCLS-I and is planned for early commissioning this year (2017) and full operation in 2020. The injector laser which hits the cathode to produce the electrons for this FEL source is conceptually similar to LCLS-I, but will utilize an upgraded controls architecture in order to be compatible with the faster repetition rate (1 MHz) of the beam. This includes moving to industrial PCs from VME and utilizing SLAC designed PCIe timing cards and camera framegrabbers. This poster discusses the overall architecture planned for this installation and discusses the reasoning behind the choices of hardware and control scheme.

The ELBE Center for High-Power Radiation Sources is driven by a 35 MeV C.W. electron linear accelerator, driving diverse secondary beams, both electromagnetic radiation and particles. Its control system is based on PLCs, fast data acquisition systems and the industrial SCADA system WinCC. In the past five years, require-ments for availability and reliability increased, while at the same time many changes of the machine configuration and instrumentation needed to be handled. Improvements of the control system infrastructure concerning power supply, IT and systems monitoring have been realized and are still under way. Along with the latest WinCC upgrade, we implemented a more redundant SCADA infrastructure and continuously improved our standards for software development.

Changes in the accelerator beamline of the Heidelberg Ionbeam Therapy-Center necessitated a relevant change in the accelerator control system. Specifically the addition of a third ion source to the LEBT beamline dictated an expansion of the Virtual Accelerator structure both in the database and the DCU software. The decision to go to a virtual server infrastructure to meet the demands for better redundancy and performance prompted an overhaul of the ACS software and hardware base. Two new redundant virtualization servers and doubled storage systems helped to increase safety and system performance. To take advantage of the newer hardware and 64-bit operating systems, all software was converted to a 64 bit base. Additionally, as a quality of life and security improvement, the download and flash functionality of the ACS were updated to enhance performance and security checks for quality assurance measures. The new virtualization host server and infrastructure hardware in conjunction with the 64 bit update and ensuing efficiency increases have resulted in a safer and significantly faster ACS with higher redundancy in case of hardware failure.

The cryogenic system is one of the most critical component of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its associated experiments ATLAS and CMS. In the past years, the cryogenic team has improved the maintenance plans, the operation procedures and achieved a very high reliability. However, as the recovery time after failure remains the major issue for the cryogenic availability new developments must take place. A new online diagnostic tool is developed to identify and anticipate failures of cryogenics field equipment, based on the acquired knowledge on dynamic simulation for the cryogenic equipment and on previous data analytic studies. After having identified the most critical components, we will develop their associated models together with the signature of their failure modes. The proposed tools will detect deviation between the actual systems and their model or identify preliminary failure signatures. This information will allow the operation team to take early mitigating actions before the failure occurrence.

SKA scale distributed control and monitoring systems present challenges in hardware sensor monitoring, archiving, hardware fault detection and fault prediction. The size and scale of hardware involved and telescope high availability requirements suggest the machine learning and other automated methods will be required for fault finding and fault prediction of hardware components. Modern tools are needed leveraging open source time series database & data analytic platforms. We describe DiaMoniCA for The Australian SKA Pathfinder Radio Telescope which integrates EPICS, our own monitoring archiver MoniCA, with an open source time series database and web based data visualisation and analytic platform.

In recent neutron scattering experiments, a large quantity and various kinds of experimental data are generated. In J-PARC MLF, it is possible to conduct many experiments under various conditions in a short time with high-intensity neutron beam and high-performance neutron instruments with a wealth of sample environmental equipment. Therefore, it is required to make an efficient and effective data analysis. Additionally, since it has been almost nine years from the beginning of operation in MLF, there are many equipment and system being up for renewal resulting in failure due to aging degradation. Since such kind of failure can lose precious beam time, failure or its sign should be early detected. MLF status analysis system based on the Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) Stack, which is one of the web-based framework rapidly growing for big data analysis, ingests various data from neutron instruments in real time. It realizes to gain insight for decision-making such as data analysis and experiment as well as instrument maintenance by flexible user-based analysis and visualization. In this paper, we will report the overview and development status of our status analysis system.

In today's world, there is plenty of data being generated from various sources in different areas across economics, engineering and science. For instance, accelerators are able to generate 3 PB data just in one experiment. Synchrotrons industry is an example of the volume and velocity of data which data is too big to be analyzed at once. While some light sources can deal with 11 PB, they confront with data problems. The explosion of data become an important and serious issue in today's synchrotrons world. Totally, these data problems pose in different fields like storage, analytics, visualisation, monitoring and controlling. To override these problems, they prefer HDF5, grid computing, cloud computing and Hadoop/Hbase and NoSQL. Recently, big data takes a lot of attention from academic and industry places. We are looking for an appropriate and feasible solution for data issues in ILSF basically. Contemplating on Hadoop and other up-to-date tools and components is not out of mind as a stable solution. In this paper, we are evaluating big data tools and tested techniques in various light source around the world for data in beamlines studying the storage and analytics aspects.

Several degree of freedom have been introduced in the design of the proton source (named PS-ESS) and in the Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT) developed at INFN-LNS for the European Spallation Source (ESS) project. The beam commissioning was focused on the most important working parameters in order to optimize the beam production performance taking into account the ESS accelerator requirements. The development of a MATLAB custom code able to interact with the EPICS control system framework was needed to optimize the short time available for the beam commissioning. The code was used as an additional high level control system layer able to change all source parameters and read all beam diagnostics output data. More than four hundred of thousand configurations have been explored in a wide range of working parameters. The capability to connect Matlab to EPICS enabled also the developing of a genetic algorithm optimization code able to automatic tune the source towards a precise current value and stability. A dedicated graphical tool was developed for the data analysis. Unexpected benefit come out from this approach that will be shown in this paper.

Since the introduction of the map-reduce paradigm, relational databases are being increasingly replaced by more efficient and scalable architectures, in particular in environments where a query will process TBytes or even PBytes of data in a single execution. The same tendency is observed at CERN, where data archiving systems for operational accelerator data are already working well beyond their initially provisioned capacity. Most of the modern data analysis frameworks are not optimized for heterogeneous workloads such as they arise in the dynamic environment of one of the world's largest accelerator complex. This contribution presents a Mixed Partitioning Scheme Replication (MPSR) as a solution that will outperform conventional distributed processing environment configurations for almost the entire phase-space of data analysis use cases and performance optimization challenges as they arise during the commissioning and operational phases of an accelerator. We will present results of a statistical analysis as well as the benchmarking of the implemented prototype, which allow defining the characteristics of the proposed approach and to confirm the expected performance gains.

The paper presents the concept of a modular and scalable archiver (historian) for SCADA systems at CERN. By separating concerns of archiving from specifics of data-storage systems at a high abstraction level, using a clean and open interface, it will be possible to integrate various data handling technologies without a big effort. The frontend part, responsible for business logic, will communicate with one or multiple backends, which in turn would implement data store and query functionality employing traditional relational databases as well as modern NOSQL and big data solutions, opening doors to advanced data analytics and matching the growing performance requirements for data storage.

AMQP was originally developed for the finance community as an open way to communicate the vastly increasing over-the-counter trace, risk and clearing market data, without the need for a proprietary protocol and expensive license. In this paper, we explore the possibility to use AMQP with MQTT extensions in a cross platform, cross language environment, where the communication bus becomes an extendible framework in which simple/thin software clients can leverage the many expert libraries at CERN.

The main goal of this paper is the presentation of Dcs ARchive MAnager for ALICE Experiment detector conditions data (DARMA), which is the updated version of the AMANDA 3 software currently used within ALICE experiment at CERN. The typical user of this system is either a physicist who performs further analysis on data acquired during the operation of the ALICE detector or an engineer, who analyzes the detector status between iterations of experiments. Based on the experience with the current system, the updated version aims to simplify the overall complexity of the previous version, which leads to simpler implementation, administration and portability of the system without sacrificing the functionality. DARMA is realized as an ASP. NET web page based on Model-View-Controller architecture and this paper provides a closer look at the design phase of the new backend structure in comparison to previous solution as well as the description of individual modules of the system.

The volume and quality of scientific data produced at the Australian Synchrotron continues to grow rapidly due to advancements in detectors, motion control and automation. This makes it critical that researchers have access to computing infrastructure that enables them to efficiently process and extract insight from their data. To facilitate this, we have developed a compute platform to enable researchers to analyse their data in real time while at the beamline as well as post-experiment by logging in remotely. This system, named ASCI, provides a convenient web-based interface to launch Linux desktops running inside Docker containers on high-performance compute hardware. Each session has the user's data mounted and is preconfigured with the software required for their experiment. This poster will present the architecture of the system and explain the design decisions in building this platform.

The Australian Synchrotron, located in Clayton, Melbourne, is one of Australia's most important pieces of research infrastructure. After more than 10 years of operation, the beamlines at the Australian Synchrotron are well established and the demand for automation of research tasks is growing. Such tasks routinely involve the reduction of TB-scale data, online (realtime) analysis of the recorded data to guide experiments, and fully automated data management workflows. In order to meet these demands, a generic, distributed workflow system was developed. It is based on well-established Python libraries and tools. The individual tasks of a workflow are arranged in a directed acyclic graph and one or more directed acyclic graphs form a workflow. Workers consume the tasks, allowing the processing of a workflow to scale horizontally. Data can flow between tasks and a variety of specialised tasks is available. Lightflow has been released as open source on the Australian Synchrotron GitHub page

During the optimization phase of the FERMI Free Electron Laser (FEL) to deliver the best FEL pulses to users, many machine parameters have to be carefully tuned, like e.g. the seed laser intensity, the dispersion strength, etc. For that purpose, a new python-based acquisition tool, called REALTA (Real Time Acquisition program), has been developed to acquire various machine parameters, electron beam properties and FEL signals on a shot-by-shot basis thanks to the real time capabilities of the TANGO control system. The data are saved continuously during the acquisition in a HDF5 file. The pyDART (Python Data Analysis Real Time) program is the post-processing tool that enables a fast analysis of the data acquired with REALTA. It allows to study the correlations and dependences between the FEL and electron beam properties and the machine parameters. In this work, we present the REALTA and pyDART toolkit developed for the FERMI FEL.

The ALMA Common Software (ACS) is a distributed framework used for control of astronomical observatories, which is built and deployed using roughly the same tools available at its design stage. Due to a shallow and rigid dependency management, the strong modularity principle of the framework cannot be exploited for packaging, installation and deployment. Moreover, life-cycle control of its components does not comply with standardized system-based mechanisms. These problems are shared by other instrument-based distributed systems. The new high-availability requirements of modern projects, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, tend to be implemented as new software features due to these problems, rather than using off-the-shelf and well-tested platform-based technologies. We present a general solution for high availability strongly-based on system services and proper packaging. We use RPM Packaging, oVirt and Docker as the infrastructure managers, Pacemaker as the software resource orchestrator and life-cycle process control through Systemd. A prototype for ACS was developed to handle its services and containers.

In 2017 the Injection Complex at Budker Institute, Novosibirsk, Russia began to operate for its consumers - colliders VEPP-4 and VEPP-2000. For successful functioning of these installations is very important to ensure a stable operation of their control systems and IT-infrastructure. The given article is about new IT-infrastructures of three accelerators: Injection Complex, VEPP-2000 and VEPP-4. IT-infrastructure for accelerators consists of servers, network equipment and system software with 10-20 years life-cycle and timely support. The reasons to create IT-infrastructure with the same principles are costs minimization and simplification of support. The following points that underlie during designing are high availability, flexibility and low cost. First is achieved through redundancy of hardware - doubling of servers, disks and network interconnections. Flexibility is caused by extensive use of virtualization that allows easy migration from one hardware to another in case of fault and gives users an ability to use custom system environment. Low cost - from equipment unification and minimizing proprietary solutions

During the 2017 Year-end Technical Stop of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the CMS experiment has successfully installed a new pixel detector in the frame of Phase I upgrade. This new detector will operate using evaporative CO2 technology as its cooling system. Carbon Dioxide, as state of the art technology for current and future tracking detectors, allows for significant material budget saving that is critical for the tracking performance. The road towards operation of the final CO2 cooling system in the experiment passed through intensive prototype phase at the CMS Tracker Integration Facility (TIF) for both cooling process hardware and its control system. This paper briefly describes the general design of both the CMS and TIF CO2 detector cooling systems, and focuses on control system architecture, operation and safety philosophy, commissioning results and operation experience. Additionally, experience in using the Ethernet IP industrial fieldbus as distributed IO is presented. Various pros and cons of using this technology are discussed, based on the solutions developed for Schneider Premium PLCs, WAGO and FESTO IOs using the UNICOS CPC 6 framework of CERN.

Linac4 is 160 MeV H− linear accelerator replacing Linac2 as the first injector to the CERN accelerator complex, that culminates with the Large Hadron Collider. This new linac will increase the beam brightness by a factor of two. The vacuum installation consists of 235 remotely controlled pumps, valves and gauges. These instruments are either controlled individually or driven by pumping stations and gas injection processes. Valves and pumps are interlocked according to gauge pressure levels and pump statuses. The vacuum control system communicates with the beam interlock system, the ion source electronics and the Radio Frequency control system, through cabled digital and analog signals. The vacuum control system is based on commercial Programmable Logical Controllers (Siemens PLCs) and a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition application (Siemens SCADA: WINCC OA). This paper describes the control architecture and process, and reports on the control requirements and the implemented solutions.

Intelligent robotic systems are becoming essential for inspection and measurements in harsh environments, such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) accelerators complex. Aiming at increasing safety and machine availability, robots can help to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks, reducing the risk for the personnel as the exposure to radiation. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) tunnel at CERN has been equipped with fail-safe trains on monorail able to perform autonomously different missions as radiation survey, civil infrastructures monitoring through photogrammetry, fire detection as well as survey measurements of accelerator devices. In this paper, the entire control architecture and the design of the lowlevel control to fulfil the requirements and the challenges of the LHC tunnel are described. The train low-level control is based on a PLC controller that communicates with the surface via 4G through VPN, where a user-friendly graphical user interface allows the operation of the robot. The low-level controller includes a PLC fail-safe program to ensure the safety of the system. The results of the commissioning in the LHC are presented.

With the successful commissioning of CRYRING, the first accelerator being operated using the new control system for FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research), also the new settings management system is now used in a production environment for the first time. Development efforts are ongoing to realize requirements necessary to support accelerator operations at FAIR. At CRYRING, new concepts for scheduling parallel beams are being evaluated. After these successful tests and the first production use, the focus now is to include major parts of the existing facility (synchrotron SIS18, storage ring ESR and transfer lines) into the system in the context of the Controls Retrofit project. First dry runs are planned for Q4 this year. The settings management system is based on the LSA framework, that was introduced at CERN in 2001 and is being developed and enhanced together in a collaboration with GSI. Notwithstanding all successes of LSA at both institutes, a review study was set up with the goal to make the LSA framework fit for the future. Outcomes of this study and impacts on the settings management system for FAIR are being presented.

STFC Daresbury Laboratory has recently commissioned Phase 1 of CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications) [1], a novel FEL (Free Electron Laser) test facility focussed on the generation of ultra-short photon pulses of coherent light with high levels of stability and synchronisation. The main motivation for CLARA is to test new FEL schemes that can later be implemented on existing and future short wavelength FELs. Particular focus will be on ultra-short pulse generation, pulse stability, and synchronisation with external sources. Knowledge gained from the development and operation of CLARA will inform the aims and design of a future UK-XFEL. The control system for CLARA is a distributed control system based upon the EPICS software framework. The control system builds on experience gained from previous EPICS based facilities at Daresbury including ALICE (formerly ERLP) [2] and VELA [3]. This paper presents the current status of the CLARA control system and discusses the systems deployed for Phase 1 and future plans for later phases.

The Phase I beam commissioning of SuperKEKB has been conducted from February to June in the last year. The injector linac has successfully delivered the electron and positron beams to the SuperKEKB main ring. The linac beam studies and subsystem developments are also intensively going on together with the daily normal beam injection to both rings of the SuperKEKB and two light sources. Towards Phase II and III beam commissioning of SuperKEKB, one of key issues is a fine beam control with the new beam position monitor readout system, a positron capture system based on the flux concentrator, a pulsed quadrupole and steering magnets, and a low emittance photo-cathode rf electron source. In this paper, we report the control system status of SuperKEKB injector linac together with the commissioning result of Phase I. In addition, the improvement plant of injector control system is also mentioned.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a multi-disciplinary research facility based on what will be the world's most powerful-pulsed neutron source. The Integrated Control System Division (ICS) is responsible of defining and providing control systems for the ESS facility. This control system will be based on the EPICS and it must be high performance, cost-efficient, safe, reliable and easily maintainable. At the same time there is a strong need for standardization. To fulfill these requirements ICS has chosen different hardware platforms, like MicroTCA, PLC, EtherCAT, etc. EtherCAT, a Ethernet-based real-time fieldbus will be analyzed, and different questions will be answered: -Why has EtherCAT been chosen? -In which cases is it deployed? -How is it integrated into EPICS? -What is the installation process? Along with data acquisition purposes, the ESS Motion Control and Automation Group decided to use EtherCAT hardware to develop an Open Source EtherCAT Master Motion Controller, for the control of all the actuators of the accelerator within the ESS project. Hence, an overview of the open Source Motion Controller and its integration in EPICS will be also presented.

PandABlocks is the open source firmware and software stack that powers PandABox, a Zynq SoC based "Position and Acquisition" platform for delivering triggers during multi-technique scanning. PandABlocks consists of a number of FPGA functional blocks that can be wired together at run-time according to application specific requirements. Status reporting and high speed data acquisition is handled by the onboard ARM processor and exposed via a TCP server with a protocol suitable for integration into control systems like "EPICS" or "TANGO". Also included in the framework is a webserver and web GUI to visualize and change the wiring of the blocks. The whole system adapts to the functional blocks present in the current FPGA build, allowing different FPGA firmware be created to support new FMC cards without rebuilding the TCP server and webserver. This paper details how the different layers of PandABlocks work together and how the system can be used to implement novel triggering applications.

One of the proposed solutions for upgrading the high voltage (HV) system of Tilecal, the ATLAS hadron calorimeter, consists in removing the HV regulation boards from the detector and deploying them in a low-radiation room where there is permanent access for maintenance. This option requires many ~100m long HV cables but removes the requirement of radiation hard boards. That solution simplifies the control system of the HV regulation cards (called HVRemote). It consists of a Detector Control System (DCS) node linked to 256 HVRemote boards through a tree of Ethernet connections. Each HVRemote includes a smart Ethernet transceiver for converting data and commands from the DCS into serial peripheral interface (SPI) signals routed to SPI-capable devices in the HVRemote. The DCS connection to the transceiver and the control of some SPI-capable devices via Ethernet has been tested successfully. It was fabricated a test board (HVRemote-ctrl) with the interfacing sub-system of the HVRemote. It is being tested through SPI-interfaces and several devices were already validated. A next version adds a few more ADC/DAC devices for checking their suitability for the final design.

Small currents need to be measured from a number of devices at a synchrotron and its beamlines. To meet this demand, MAX IV have joined a collaboration with ALBA to develop an electrometer that will ensure low current measurement capabilities and seamless integration into our Tango control system.   The electrometers 4 independent channels can measure accurately in the fA range. Many devices produce larger currents and only need low sample rate. To make the electrometer more flexible, MAX IV have therefore developed a multiplexer with 8 independent channels. The multiplexer is both powered and controlled by the electrometer through its multipurpose IO interface. At most, an electrometer can control 4 multiplexers simultaneously giving a system with 32 channels, but the number of multiplexers can be chosen freely. The offset current introduced by the multiplexer is 45 pA and the noise is 3 pA. The offset is eliminated by settings in the electrometer. Current sweeps shows that currents steps as small as 10 pA can easily be measured and that switching time between channels before a steady signal is achieved is limited by the filter needed by the electrometer and not the multiplexer.

Controls and data acquisition in accelerators often involve some kind of computing platform (VME, PICMG 1.3, MTCA.4…) connected to Distributed I/O Tier electronics using a fieldbus or another kind of serial link. At CERN, we have started a project to rationalize this tier, providing a modular centrally-supported platform which allows equipment groups to focus on solving their particular problems while benefiting from a set of well-debugged building blocks. The paper describes the strategy, based on 3U Euro crates with a generic FPGA-based board featuring space for FMC mezzanines. Different mezzanines allow communication using different protocols. There are two variants of the electronics, to deploy in environments with and without radiation tolerance requirements. The plans we present are the result of extensive discussion at CERN among all stakeholders. We present them here with the aim of gathering further feedback and potential interest for inter-lab collaborations.

Typical motion controllers rely on a feedback position encoder to detect the actuator output and correct for external factors. Recent advancements in positioning systems increased the demand for the ability to process a variety of sensors and use the result to feedback the motion controller. In addition, data acquisition tools are becoming essential for metrology purposes to diagnose and analyse the behaviour of the system. A multi-sensor, multi-protocol unit with processing and data acquisition capabilities has been developed to address these requirements. Here we describe the main features of this unit, its internal architecture, and few examples of application.

The LCLS-II facility currently under construction at SLAC will be capable of delivering an electron beam at a rate of up to almost 1MHz. The BPM system (and other diagnostics) are required to acquire time-stamped readings for each individual bunch. The high rate mandates that the processing algorithms as well as data exchange with other high-performance systems such as MPS (machine-protection system) or bunch-length monitors are implemented with FPGA technology. Our BPM-processing firmware builds on top of the SLAC "common-platform" [*] and integrates tightly with core services provided by the platform such as timing, data-buffering and communication channels.

A new general purpose data acquisition and control board (Board51) is presented in this paper. Board51 has primarily been developed for use in the ALICE experiment at CERN, but its open design allows for a wide use in any application requiring flexible and affordable data acquisition system. It provides analog I/O functionalities and is equipped with software bundle, allowing for easy integration into the SCADA. Based on the Silicon Labs C8051F350 MCU, the board features a fully-differential 24-bit ADC that provides an ability to perform very precise DAQ at sampling rate up to 1kHz. For analog outputs two 8-bit current-mode DACs can be used. Board51 is equipped with UART to USB interface that allows communication with any computer platform. As a result the board can be controlled through the DIM system. This is provided by a program running on a computer publishing services that include measured analog values of each ADC channel and accepts commands for setting ADC readout rate and DACs voltage. Digital inputs/outputs are also accessible using the DIM communication system. These services enable any computer on a common network to read measured values and control the board.

This paper describes the requirements, architecture, and measurements results of the local oscillator (LO) board prototype. The design will provide low phase noise clock and heterodyne signals for the 704.42 MHz Cavity Simulator for the European Spallation Source. A field detection has critical influence on the simulation's performance and its quality depends on the quality of the two aforementioned signals. The clock frequency is a subharmonic of the reference frequency and choice of the frequency divider generating the clock signals is discussed. The performance of selected dividers was compared. The LO frequency must be synthesized and frequency synthesis schemes are investigated. Critical components used in the direct analog scheme are identified and their selection criteria were given.

The timing and synchronization system at the ALBA synchrotron facility is based on the well-established event-based model broadly used in the particle accelerator facilities built in the last decade. In previous systems, based on signal model architecture, the master frequency was distributed using a direct analog signal and delayed at each target where the triggers were required. However, such strategy has proven to be extremely expensive and non-scalable. In the event-based model, the data stream is generated at a continuous rate, synchronously with the master clock oscillator of the accelerator. This strategy improves the flexibility for tuning the trigger parameters remotely and reduces the costs related to maintenance tasks. On the other hand, the absence of the pure RF signal distributed in the experimental stations implies much more complexity in the performance of time-resolved experiments. Abstract here explain how these difficulties have been overcome in the ALBA timing system in order to allow the signal reconstruction of the RF master frequency at the CIRCE beamline.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project aims to build a large radio telescope consisting of multiple dishes and dipoles, in South Africa (SKA1-Mid) and Australia (SKA1-Low) respectively. The Synchronization and Timing (SAT) system of SKA provides frequency and clock signals from a central clock ensemble to all elements of the radio telescope, critical to the functionality of SKA acting as a unified large telescope using interferometry. The local monitor and control system for SAT (SAT. LMC) will monitor and control the working of the SAT system consisting of the timescale generation system, the frequency distribution system and the timing distribution system. SAT. LMC will also enable Telescope Manager (TM) to perform any SAT maintenance and operations. As part of Critical Design Review, SAT. LMC is getting close to submitting its final architecture and design. This paper discusses the architecture, technology, and the outcomes of prototyping activities.

Sub-nsec precision time synchronization is requested for data-acquisition components distributed over up to tens of km2 in modern astroparticle experiments, like upcoming Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray detector arrays, to ensure optimal triggering, pattern recognition and background rejection. The White-Rabbit (WR) standard for precision time and frequency transfer is well suited for this purpose. We present two multi-channel general-purpose TDC units, which are firmware-implemented on two widely used WR-nodes: the SPEC (Spartan 6) and ZEN (Zynq) boards. Their main features: TDCs with 1 nsec resolution (default), running deadtime-free and capable of local buffering and centralized level-2 trigger architectures. The TDC stamps pulses are in absolute TAI. With off-the-shelve mezzanine boards (5ChDIO-FMC-boards), up to 5 TDC channels are available per WR-node. Higher density, customized simple I/O boards allow to turn this into 8 to 32-channel units, with an excellent price to performance ratio. The TDC units have shown excellent long-term performance in a harsh environment application at TAIGA-HiSCORE/Siberia, for the Front-End DAQ and the central GPSDO clock facility.

The phase reference signal reliability is of utmost importance for continuous operation of the European XFEL machine. Since even very short interruption or glitch in the reference signal might break the precise synchronisation between subsystems, it is desirable to minimize probability of such events. While master oscillators often have a hot-spare to speed-up recovery after a failure, whether switched manually or electronically, it does not save from time-consuming resynchronisation. Our experience from testing and commissioning E-XFEL 1.3 GHz Master Oscillator (MO) shows that a struggle to achieve demanding phase-noise requirements might negatively impact reliability of the system. In this paper we present an approach which allows for quick switching between independent reference generation channels while maintaining continuity of the output signal. This is a first step towards autonomous redundancy solution for the E-XFEL MO which will maintain continuous reference signal even in case of a failure of one of the generation channels.

The Master Oscillator system of the European XFEL was built using frequency synthesis techniques that were found to have the best phase noise performance. This includes low noise frequency multipliers and nonÂ­multiplying phase lock loops, incorporated in the system to shape its output phase noise spectrum. Jitter of the output signal strongly depends on phase noise transmittance of the PLL and suboptimal design can worsen it by orders of magnitude. Taking into consideration that the PLL open loop transmittance usually can be shaped in multiple ways, and that the accurate phase noise measurements can easily take more than 30 minutes, designing an automated tool becomes a necessity. For this purpose an approach to the tuning system construction was chosen in order to make the phase noise optimisation process simpler. This paper describes the optimisation of PLL synthesizer phase noise, done to improve the performance of the European XFEL MO. We present the phase noise optimisation process and achieved results.

ALBA is the name of Barcelona's 3GeV Synchrotron Lightsource. In operation since 2012, it currently hosts experiments 24/7 in its 8 beamlines with 3 more in development. The aim of ALBA Equipment Protection System is to avoid damage of hardware by managing sets of permits and interlock signals. The EPS scope covers not only ALBA accelerators and its beamlines but also the accessory laboratories like RF, Optics, Vacuum, etc. It is built on B&R PLCs with CPUs installed in cabinets in ALBA service and experimental areas and a network of remote I/O modules installed in shielded boxes inside the tunnel and other irradiated zones. CPU's and Remote models are interconnected by the X2X field-bus. Signals managed by PLC's include interlocks, temperature readouts, flow-meters, flow-switches, thermo-switches, shutters, pneumatic actuators, fluorescence screens, etc. This paper describes the design and the architecture of the Equipment Protection System, the current status, the tools used by the EPS team and the recent improvements in terms of reaction time and interaction with other systems via Powerlink and fast interlock systems.

At the Centre for Proton Therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute a cyclotron, two gantries and a fixed beamline are being used to treat tumours. In order to prevent non-optimal beam delivery, an interlock patient safety system (PaSS) was implemented that interrupts the treatment if any sub-system reports an error. To ensure correct treatment, the PaSS needs to be thoroughly tested as part of the regular quality assurance as well as after each change. This typically required weeks of work, extensive beam-time and may not comprehensively detect all possible failure modes. With the opportunity of the installation of a new gantry, an automated PaSS test stand was developed that can emulate the rest of the facility. It consists of a NI PXI chassis with virtually unlimited IOs synchronously stimulated or sampled at 1MHz, a set of adapters to connect each type of interfaced signal and a runtime environment. We have also developed a VHDL based formal language to describe stimuli, assertions and specific measurements. We present the use of our test stand in the verification and validation of the PaSS, showing how its full quality assurance, including report generation was reduced to minutes.

The accelerator facilities at CERN span large areas and the personnel protection systems consist of hundreds of interlocked doors delimiting the accelerator zones. Entrance into the interlocked zones from the outside is allowed only via a small number of access points. These are no longer made of doors which have left their place to turnstiles and then to mantraps or Personnel Access Devices (PAD). Originally meant for high security zones, the commercially available PADs have a number of CERN-specific additions. This paper presents in detail the purpose and characteristics of each piece of equipment constituting the access devices and its integration within the personnel protection system. Key concepts related to personnel safety (e.g. interlocked safety tokens, patrols) and to access control (e.g. access authorisation, biometric identity verification, equipment checks) are introduced and solutions discussed. Three generations of access devices are presented, starting from the LHC model put in service in 2008, continuing with the PS devices operational since 2014 and finally introducing the latest model under development for the refurbishment of the SPS Personnel Protection System.

Access to the interlocked zones of the CERN accelerator complex is allowed only for personnel wearing standard personal protective equipment. This equipment is complemented by specialised personal protective devices in case of specific hazards related to the remnant radiation or the presence of cryogenic fluids. These complex devices monitor the environment in the vicinity of the user and warn the user of the presence of hazards such as radiation or oxygen deficiency. The use of the devices is obligatory, but currently only enforced by procedures. In order to improve the safety of the personnel it has been proposed to verify that users are carrying their devices switched on when entering. This paper describes the development of a specialised multi-protocol terminal, based on Texas Instruments digital signal processor and integrated in the personnel protection system. The device performs local checks of the presence and status of operational dosimeter prior to allowing access to the interlocked zones. The results of the first tests in the Proton Synchrotron accelerator complex will be presented.

Diamond Light Source is celebrating 10 years of "users" at its facility in Oxfordshire, England. Its safety systems have been designed to the standard EN61508, with the facility constructed in 3 phases, which are just concluding. The final "phase 3" beamline Personnel Safety System has been signed-off; hence it is timely to review our experience of the journey with these systems.

The purpose of the Target Safety System (TSS) is to protect the public from exposure to unsafe levels of radiation, prevent the release of radioactive material beyond permissible limits, and bring the neutron spallation function into a safe state. In order to fulfill the necessary safety functions, the TSS continually monitors critical parameters within target station systems. If any parameter exceeds an acceptable level, the TSS actuates contactors to cut power to components at the front end of the accelerator and prevent the beam from reaching the target. The TSS is classified as a safety structure, system and component, relevant for the safety of the public and the environment. As such, it requires the highest level of rigor in design and quality for interlock systems at the ESS. Standards are applied to provide a guideline for building the TSS architecture and designing in resistance to single failures and common cause failures. This paper describes the system architecture and design of the TSS, including interfaces with target station and accelerator systems, and explains how the design complies with authority conditions and requirements imposed by development standards.

Recently a new radiation protection interlock system has been established at the Darmstadt superconducting linear electron accelerator S-DALINAC [*]. It prevents the staff from entering radiation protection areas during operation and allows a systematic scanning of these areas for workers before running the accelerator. As an extension of the new interlock, a new dose rate monitoring system has been developed using PIN diodes and self-made ion chambers. These detectors will be used to perfom online dose rate measurements in order to switch automtically the status of illuminated radiation protection panels, which show the current level of protection area. Furthermore, they will be used to characterize systematically the radiation fluxes inside the accelerator facility and to support the beam diagnostics. The readout electronics consists ofμcontrollers with ethernet interfaces using TCP/IP based serial communication. The data acquisition is integrated into the EPICS based control system. First results of the commissioning will be presented.

The phase 1 of the SPIRAL2 facility, extension project of the GANIL laboratory, is under construction and the commissioning had started. During the run phases, radioactive gas, mainly composed of hydrogen, will be extracted from the vacuum chambers. The radioactive gas storage system function is to prevent any uncontrolled release of activated gas by storing it in gas tank during the radioactive decay, while monitoring the hydrogen rate in the tanks under a threshold. This confinement of radioactive materials is a safety function. The filling and the discharge of the tanks are processed with monostable valves, making the storage a passive safety system. Two separate redundant control subsystems, based on electrical hardware technologies, allow the opening of the redundant safety valves, according to redundant pressure captors, redundant di-hydrogen rate analyzers and limit switches of the valves. The redundancy of the design of the control system meets the single failure criterion. The monitoring of the consistency of the two redundant safety subsystems, and the non-safety control functions of the storage process, are then managed by a Programmable Logic Controller.

In addition to the large LHC experiments, CERN hosts a number of other experimental areas with a rich research program ranging from fundamental physics to medical applications. The risk assessments have shown a large palette of potential hazards (radiological, electrical, chemical, laser, etc.) that need to be properly mitigated in order to ensure the safety of personnel working inside these areas. A Personnel Protection System, typically, accomplishes this goal by implementing a certain number of heterogeneous functionalities as interlocks of critical elements, management of a local HMI, data monitoring and interfacing with RFID badge readers. Given those requirements, reducing system complexity and costs are key parameters to be optimized in the solution. This paper is aimed at summarizing the findings, in terms of costs, complexity and maintenance reduction, offered by a technology from National Instruments® based on cRIO controllers and a new series of SIL-2 certified safety I/O modules. A use case based on a service for the protection of Class 4 laser laboratories will be described in detail.

The CMS ECAL Detector Control System (DCS) features several monitoring mechanisms able to react and perform automatic actions based on pre-defined action matrices. The DCS is capable of early detection of anomalies inside the ECAL and on its off-detector support systems, triggering automatic actions to mitigate the impact of these events and preventing them from escalating to the safety system. The treatment of such events by the DCS allows for a faster recovery process, better understanding of the development of issues, and in most cases, actions with higher granularity than the safety system. This paper presents the details of the DCS automatic action mechanisms, as well as their evolution based on several years of CMS ECAL operations.

PIP-II is a high intensity proton linac being design to support a world-leading physics program at Fermilab. Initially it will provide high intensity beams for Fermilab's neutrino program with a future extension to other applications requiring an upgrade to CW linac operation (e.g. muon experiments). The machine is conceived to be 2 mA CW, 800 MeV H− linac capable of working initially in a pulse (0.55 ms, 20 Hz) mode for injection into the existing Booster. The planned upgrade to CW operation implies that the total beam current and damage potential will be greater than in any present HEP hadron linac. To mitigate the primary technical risk and challenges associated PIP-II an integrated system test for the PIP-II front-end technology is being developed. As part of the R&D a robust machine protection system (MPS) is being designed. This paper describes the progress and challenges associated with the MPS.

STFC Daresbury Laboratory is currently commissioning Phase I of CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications), a novel FEL (Free Electron Laser) test facility focused on the generation of ultra-short photon pulses of coherent light with high levels of stability and synchronization. In order to maintain phase stability the CLARA gun requires a precision water temperature control system to maintain a gun cavity temperature within 0.028°C. This is achieved by mixing two water circuits with temperatures close to the desired set point. Two temperature measurement systems were evaluated for precision and reliability, the resultant system uses a single Omron PLC which provides all the precision read back and control loops. High resolution input modules and averaging achieve precision temperature monitoring while two PID loops control the coarse and fine temperature control. EPICS control is achieved using the FINS protocol communicating with a Linux IOC. This paper gives details of the system requirements and implementation and also describes initial results.

Electron beam quality described by the emittance or phase space moments are important for the operation of FEL facilities like the European XFEL. For the operation these parameters need to be routinely measured. Based on such measurements machine setup can be optimized to match beam requirements. The beam parameters depend on parameters like quadrupole magnet strength or RF settings. While manual tuning is possible, we aim for highly automatized procedures to obtain such optimizations. In this paper we will present and discuss an overview of the different subsystems which are involved. These include image acquisition, analysis, and optics calculations as well as machine control user interfaces.

At the Canadian Light Source (CLS) synchrotron, the addition of the Quantum Materials Spectroscopy Centre (QMSC) beamline requires the addition of an Elliptically Polarizing Undulator (EPU) insertion device to produce photons from the stored electron beam. Unlike the majority of such insertion devices, this EPU is capable of producing photons of simultaneous arbitrary elliptical and linear phases, in addition to a range of energies. This EPU is also capable of creating perturbations of the stored electron beam sufficient to cause an interruption of an injection. In order to prevent this, compensation controls have been developed. These controls are accomplished with a combination of Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS), mathematical models, and algorithms written in C and MATLAB.

The heavy ion beam from Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) CSR Main Ring (CSRm) is slowly extracted by using a third-order resonance driven by sextupole magnets and delivered to various experimental facilities. The slow extraction is driven by the transverse radio frequency knockout (RF-KO) exciter. Many physics and radiation medicine experiments require high-quality spill-structure. In other words, the extracted spill should have flat structure and low ripple noise [1]. Therefore, a novel RF-KO exciter and spill feedback control system has been implemented and tested in CSRm.

At the European Spallation Source it is foreseen to use around 120 superconducting cavities operating at 704.42 MHz. Each cavity will require an individual LLRF control system, that needs to be tested before the installation inside the accelerator. Testing of all systems using the real superconducting cavities would be very expensive and in case of a failure can lead to serious damages. To lower the testing cost and avoid potential risks it is planned to design and build a device that simulates the behavior of a superconducting cavity. The cavity simulator will utilize fast data converters equipped with an RF front-end and a digital signal processing unit based on a high performance FPGA. In this paper conceptual design of hardware and firmware will be presented.

Traditionally, designers of transformer-based beam current monitor diagnostic systems are constrained by fundamental trade-offs when reducing distortion in time-domain beam-pulse facsimile waveforms while also attempting to preserve information in the frequency-domain. When modelling the sensor system with a net-work of linear time-invariant passive components, and a state-based representation based on first-order differential equations, we identify two internal dynamical states isolated from each other by the parasitic resistance in the transformer windings. They are the parasitic capacitance voltage across the transformer's windings, and the transformer inductor current. These states are typically imperfectly observed due to noise, component value variance, and sensor component network topology. We will discuss how feedback-based Kalman State Estimation implemented within digital signal-processing might be employed to reduce negative impacts of noise along with component variance, and how Kalman Estimation might also optimize the conflicting goals of beam-pulse facsimile waveform fidelity together with preservation of fre-quency domain information.

The hard x-ray split and delay (HXRSnD) system at the Linear Coherent Light Source (LCLS) was designed to allow for experiments requiring two-pulse based x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. The system consists of eight silicon crystals split between two optical branches, with over 30 degrees of freedom. To maintain system stability and safety while easing system operation, we expand the LCLS Skywalker software suite to provide a python-based automation scheme that handles alignment, operations and engineer notification. Core safety systems such as collision avoidance are processed at the controller and Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) layer. Higher level functionality is implemented using a stack of open-source python packages (ophyd, bluesky, transitions) which provide a comprehensive and robust operational environment consisting of virtual motors, plans and finite state machines (FSM).

LIGHT (Linac Image Guided Hadron Technology) is a particle therapy system* developed by Advanced Oncotherapy plc. Accelerator, control and interlock systems are developed by its subsidiary A.D.A.M.SA, a CERN spin-off. The system is being designed to accelerate protons up to 230 MeV using a modular and compact 25-meter-long linear accelerator. It is being designed to operate in pulsed mode where beam properties (energy, pulse charge and spot size) can be changed at 200 Hz. A proof-of-concept accelerator is being assembled and tested at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland). Control and interlock systems are developed using an exploratory prototyping approach and COTS hardware. Requirements for the final LIGHT control and interlock systems are iteratively clarified through creation and refinement of these prototypes. We will continue to support the proof-of-concept accelerator activities while starting to design the final LIGHT control and interlock systems in parallel, building upon the knowledge acquired with the proof-of-concept accelerator. The matured final LIGHT control and interlock systems will gradually replace the prototypes to automate procedures and test the system before deployment
* The LIGHT Proton Therapy System is still subject to conformity assessment by AVO's Notified Body as well as clearance by the USA-FDA

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a collaboration of 17 European countries that is building a leading neutron research center in Lund, Sweden. The ESS facility will have the most powerful neutron source in the world, providing 5 MW of beam power. The Integrated Control Systems Division (ICS) is responsible for all the control systems for the whole facility. For the accelerator control system, ICS will provide different hardware platforms according to the requirements of each specific system. For high performance systems, demanding high data throughput, the hardware platform is the MicroTCA.4 standard. This work presents the software stack that makes the integration of a high-end MicroTCA.4 hardware into the ESS Control System, with the implementation details of the FPGA firmware framework, kernel and userspace drivers, EPICS device support and finally the EPICS IOC that controls the MicroTCA.4 boards.

The civil engineering activities in the framework of the High Luminosity LHC project, the Geneva GEothermie 2020 and the continuous monitoring of the LHC civil infrastructures triggered the need for the installation of a seismic network at CERN. A 24 bits data acquisition system has been deployed in 3 places at CERN: ATLAS, CMS and the Prévessin site. The system is sending all the raw data to the Swiss Seismological Service and performs FFT on the fly to be stored in the LHC database. The system has shown a good sensitivity of 10-16 (m/s)2/Hz at 1 Hz.

The new data acquisition system for the PS ring wall current monitors installed in the PS is able to perform higher frequency measurements of a beam bunch up to a frequency of 2.7 GHz. This is an important improvement, since the oscillating signal within the bandwidth 500-700 MHz, is related to losses of a beam bunch. The losses can be reduced by measuring the frequency and classifying the cause of the oscillations. The PXI-5661 is used to carry out spectral analysis of this signal. The acquisition is performed on a PXI running LabVIEW Real-Time and synchronized using a trigger from the accelerator timing system.

The MeerKAT radio telescope control system generates monitoring and scheduling data that internal and external systems require to operate. Distributing this data in near real-time, requires a scalable messaging strategy to ensure optimal performance regardless of the number of systems connected. Internal systems include the MeerKAT Graphical User Interfaces, the MeerKAT Science Data Processing subsystem and the MeerKAT Correlator Beamformer subsystem. External systems include Pulsar Timing User Supplied Equipment, MeerLICHT and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Many more external systems are expected to join MeerKAT in the future. This paper describes the strategy adopted by the Control and Monitoring team to distribute near real-time monitoring and scheduling data at scale. This strategy is implemented using standard web technologies and the publish/subscribe design pattern.

The Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) is a major upgrade of the LCLS facility at SLAC, scheduled to start operations in 2020. The High Performance Systems (HPS) defines a set of LCLS-II controls sub-systems which are directly impacted by its 1 MHz operation. It is formed around a few key concepts: ATCA based packaging, digital and analog application boards, and 10G Ethernet based interconnections for controls. The Common Platform provides the common parts of the HPS in term of hardware, firmware, and software. The Common Platform Software (CPSW) provides a standardized interface to the common platform's FPGA for all high-level software. YAML is used to define the hardware topology and all necessary parameters. YCPSWASYN is an asynPortDriver based EPICS module for FPGA register access and asynchronous messaging using CPSW. YCPSWSYN has two operation modes: an automatic mode where PVs are automatically created for all registers and the record's fields are populated with information found in YAML; and a manual mode where the engineer can choose which register to expose via PVs and freely choose the record's filed information.

The foreseen upgrades of the LHC accelerator and the experiments will drastically increase the data and trigger rates. To cope with the vast and low latency data flow, the ATLAS small wheel muon detector will be replaced with a New Small Wheel. Among the upgrades needed, is a radiation tolerant Slow Control Adapter (GBT-SCA) ASIC dedicated for the on-detector control and monitoring. The ASIC employs various interfaces, making it flexible to match the needs of the different operations. On the backend, the Front-End Link eXchange system will be the interface between the data handling system and the detector front-end and trigger electronics. A dedicated slow control data component was developed as the middleware from FELIX to the end users. It is based on the OPC Unified Architecture protocol and it is comprised of an OPC-UA server, that will handle the slow control traffic from the control room to the GBT-SCA and vice versa. Ultimately, various scope-oriented OPC-UA clients, connected to the OPC-UA server, will be employed to configure and calibrate the ASICs, program the FPGAs, oversee the well-functioning of the boards and monitor the environmental parameters of the detector.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project is responsible for developing the SKA Observatory, the world's largest radio telescope ever built: eventually two arrays of radio antennas - SKA1-Mid and SKA1-Low - will be installed in the South Africa's Karoo region and Western Australia's Murchison Shire respectively, each covering a different range of radio frequencies. In particular, the SKA1-Mid array will comprise of 133 15m diameter dish antennas observing in the 350 MHz-14 GHz range, each locally managed by a Local Monitoring and Control (LMC) system and remotely orchestrated by the SKA Telescope Manager (TM) system. All control system functionality run on the Tango Controls platform. The Dish Single Pixel Feed (SPF) work element will design the combination of feed elements, orthomode transducers (OMTs), and low noise amplifiers (LNAs) that receive the astronomical radio signals. Some SPFs have cryogenically cooled chambers to obtain the sensitivity requirements. This paper gives a status update of the SKA Dish SPF and LMC interaction design, focusing on SPF, LMC simulators and engineering/operational user interfaces, prototypes being developed and technological choices.

Control systems of neutron instruments are responsible for the movement of a variety of mechanical axes. In the TANGO based control systems developed by Forschungszentrum Jülich for neutron instruments, Siemens S7-300 PLCs with single axis stepper motor controllers from Siemens or Phytron have been used for this purpose in the past. Synchronous coordinated movement of several axes has been implemented with dedicated 4-axes NC modules (FM357) for the S7-300. In future, the recent S7-1500 PLC family shall be used for motion tasks. With the S7-1500, stepper motor control is possible with low-cost fast digital outputs, so called PTOs (pulse trade outputs). The integrated motion functions of the S7-1500 directly support synchronous movement. The function block interface defined by PLCopen serves as a homogeneous programming interface which is independent of a specific motion controller. For the single crystal diffractometer HEiDi at the research reactor FRM-II a replacement for a S7-300 with FM357 has been implemented based on a S7-1500 PLCs and a PTO module.

A large number of movable devices are present in the field of accelerators and must often be integrated in a control system. Typical examples of these systems are phase shifters and magnetic dipoles among others. The standard industrial control system UNICOS-CPC (UNified Industrial COntrol System for Continuous Process Control) provides a set of generic device types which matches the majority of the industrial equipment employed in process control. This new development extends it with additional device types for precise positioning equipment based on stepping motors. The paper focuses on how the integration on UNICOS was fulfilled, the potential use of the solution and the automatic integration with the CERN real-time FESA (FrontEnd Software Architecture) framework. Finally, it illustrates a couple of use cases that already incorporate the solution: the CTF3 facility, the two-beam acceleration scheme envisioned for CLIC (Compact Linear Collider) and the EuroCirCol project for the measurements of the beam screen prototype for the FCC-hh (Future Circular Collider proton-proton).

Engineers are often challenged with the need to integrate several technologies to find optimal solutions when designing new control architectures. Generally, the technical solutions chosen require the combination of various industrial products such as PXI systems for applications requiring fast acquisition, analysis and reaction times, while PLCs are commonly used for their reliability and their ability to withstand industrial environments. The needs to exchange information between these different technologies can today be solved by using industrial fieldbuses such as Profibus DP or Profinet IO. This paper describes the technical aspects of the two options, focussing on their advantages and constraints. The experience gained with integrating PXI and PLC systems as part of the 2016 consolidation project of the control of the kicker systems of the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) at CERN will be presented.

LCLS-II is a superconducting upgrade to the existing Linear Coherent Light Source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Construction is underway with a planned continuous wave beam rate of up to 1 MHz. Two cryogenic plants provide helium to a distribution system, and 37 cryomodules with superconducting cavities will operate with Liquid helium at 2.2K. The cryomodules and distribution system is controlled with networked PLC's and EPICS as an integrated system that work in concert for controlling valves, pressure, flow, and temperature. Interlocks and critical process information is communicated with the Low Level Radio Frequency, vacuum, and magnet systems. Engaging the controls community proved vital in advancing the controls architecture from a conventional design to a centralized, reliable, and cost-effective distributed platform.

The Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) is in the final stages of developing an open-source BPM system for Sirius, a 4th-generation synchrotron light source under construction in Brazil. The system is based on the MicroTCA.4 standard comprising AMC FPGA boards carrying FMC digitizers and a CPU module. The software is built with the HALCS framework [1] and employs a service- oriented architecture (SOA) to export a flexible interface between the gateware modules and its clients, providing a set of loosely-coupled components favoring reusability, extensibility and maintainability. In this paper, the BPM system will be discussed in detail focusing on how specific functionalities of the system are integrated and developed in the framework to provide SOA services. In particular, two domains will be covered: (i) gateware modules, such as the ADC interface, acquisition engine and digital signal processing; (ii) software services counterparts, showing how these modules can interact with each other in a uniform way, easing integration with control systems.

The CERN UNified Industrial COntrol System framework (UNICOS) with its Continuous Control Package (UNICOS-CPC) is the CERN standard solution for the design and implementation of continuous industrial process control applications. The need of adapting the framework capabilities to the different processes at CERN has brought new challenges. Reacting as fast as possible to an interlock situation to protect equipment is a new requirement which has been introduced in UNICOS-CPC. This paper present the challenges, design and test results of the seamless integration of fast interlocks capabilities in the current UNICOS-CPC package based on conventional PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), with a heightened level of flexibility and maturity. The first implementation is employing SIEMENS PLCs but the underlying technique is extensible to the other UNICOS-CPC compliant platforms.

Industrial control systems for the CERN technical infrastructure and accelerator complex consist of a myriad of devices and components geographically distributed around the CERN facilities. In the event of an intervention in such systems, the on-call engineer or the system expert needs detailed information about the nature of the problem, e.g. what device, what problem, intervention procedures, and contextual data like the location of the device, current access conditions to this place, the list of access rights required and whether he/she is granted with these rights. This is of special relevance when the person responsible for the intervention has only limited knowledge of the control system as it is the case for some on-call services. At CERN, this information is scattered over a number of data sources. This paper presents MARS, a web-based tool designed to federate data from heterogeneous sources with the aim of providing support for interventions and maintenance activities. The information can be displayed in a single web page or be accessed through a REST API.

Inspired by the recent developments of reactive programming and the ubiquity of the concept of streams in modern software industry, we assess the relevance of a reactive streams solution in the context of accelerator controls. The promise of reactive streams, to govern the exchange of data across asynchronous boundaries at a rate sustainable for both the sender and the receiver, is alluring to most data-centric processes of CERN's accelerators. Taking advantage of the renovation of one key software piece of our supervision layer, the Beam Interlock System GUI, we look at the architecture, design and implementation of a reactive streams based solution. Additionally, we see how this model allows us to re-use components and contributes naturally to the extension of our tool set. Lastly, we detail what hindered our progression and how our solution can be taken further.

Today's front-end controllers, which are widely used in CERNs controls environment, feature CPUs with high clock frequencies and extensive memory storage. Their specifications are comparable to low-end servers, or even smartphones. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has been running on similar configurations for years now and it seems natural to evaluate the behaviour of JVMs on this environment to characterize if Firm or Soft real-time constraints can be addressed efficiently. Using Java at this low-level offers the opportunity to refactor CERNs current implementation of the device/property model and to move away from a monolithic architecture to a promising and scalable separation of the area of concerns, where the front-end may publish raw data that other layers would decode and re-publish. This paper presents first the evaluation of Machine Protection control system requirements in terms of real-time constraints and a comparison of the performance of different JVMs regarding these constraints. In a second part, it will detail the efforts towards a first prototype of a minimal RT Java supervision layer to provide access to the hardware layer.

At the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society a new very high speed scanning tunneling microscope (VHS-STM) is being set up to resolve glass dynamics (Cryvisil). We have been successfully using EPICS (v3) for many of our most important and larger experiments. However, for the new project, the data throughput to be achieved with EPICS (v3) is not sufficient. For this reason, we have completely aligned the experiment control for the STM to the new EPICS7 by using the new protocol pvAccess. The development versions of EPICS 3.16 and bundleCPP of the EPICSv4-suite are in use. Both of them will be the base components of the new EPICS7 Framework. The expected data rate is 300 MByte/s for up to 5 hrs to address the transition from a vitreous state to a crystal-line in real space over a wide range of temperatures ranging from cryogenic temperatures to 1500 K (*). In the poster we will show the control system setup (VMEbus, RTEMS-SMP, MVME6100, MVME2500, V375, SIS3316) and the used environment like ArchiverAppliance and pva2pva gateway.

In the IFMIF EVEDA project*, INFN-LNL Laboratory has been involved in the design and construction of a normal conducting Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) used to bunch and accelerate a 130 mA steady beam to 5 MeV. The EPICS based control system** has been entirely developed in house using different hardware solutions: PLC for tasks where security is the most critical feature, VME system where the acquisition speed rate is crucial, common hardware when only integration is required without any particular feature in terms of security. Integration of PLCs into EPICS environment was originally accomplished through OPC DA server*** hosted by a Windows embedded industrial PC. Due to the issues analyzed in injector LCS, LNL proposed to migrate to the usage of EPICS Direct Driver solution based on s7plc****. The driver itself is suitable for direct communication between EPICS and PLCs, but it doesn't take care of data update and synchronization in case of communication failure. As consequence LNL team designed a dedicated method based on state machine to manage and verify data integrity between the two environments, also in case of connection lost or failure.

This approach let RFQ's engineers and scientists have a degree of freedom during power tests in Legnaro and during the RFQ integration in IFMIF EVEDA facility in Rokkasho. In this paper we will describe the different aspects observed when the LCS was converted from the standalone configuration to the final integrated one.

Over the past years, SOLEIL* uses SIEMENS PLCs** as a standard for signal monitoring and security. SOLEIL is today thinking about a major upgrade of the facilities, and has to adapt its organization to face efficient operation and R&D. In this context, automation experts are now merged in a single group. In a middle term, migration from the existing 3XX series PLCs to the new 15XX series will be necessary. As the new 15XX series PLCs do not support Fetch/Write protocol anymore, a first step is the upgrade of TANGO*** PLCServer. This software device ensures data exchange with supervisory applications using TANGO infrastructure. It opens multiple TCP/IP connections to the PLC hardware, manages asynchronous communication to read/write PLC Datablocks and acts as a server for other clients. The upgrade of PLCServer is based on Snap7**** open source Ethernet communication suite for interfacing with Siemens PLCs using the S7 native protocol. This paper details the evolutions, performances and limitations of this new version of the PLCServer.

Model checking is a formal verification technique to check given properties of models, designs or programs with mathematical precision. Due to its high knowledge and resource demand, the use of model checking is restricted mainly to core parts of highly critical systems. However, we and many other authors have argued that automated model checking of PLC programs is feasible and beneficial in practice. In this paper we aim to explain why model checking is applicable to PLC programs even though its use for software in general is too difficult. We present an overview of the particularities of PLC programs which influence the feasibility and complexity of their model checking. Furthermore, we list the main challenges in this domain and the solutions proposed in previous works.

The large number of industrial control systems based on PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) available at CERN implies a huge number of programs and lines of code. The software quality assurance becomes a key point to ensure the reliability of the control systems. Static code analysis is a relatively easy-to-use, simple way to find potential faults or error-prone parts in the source code. While static code analysis is widely used for general purpose programming languages (e.g. Java, C), this is not the case for PLC programs. We have analyzed the possibilities and the gains to be expected from applying static analysis to the PLC code used at CERN, based on the UNICOS framework. This paper reports on our experience with the method and the available tools and sketches an outline for future work to make this analysis method practically applicable.

The development of critical systems requires the application of verification techniques in order to guarantee that the requirements are met in the system. Standards like IEC 61508 provide guidelines and recommend the use of formal methods for that purpose. The ITER Interlock Control System has been designed to protect the tokamak and its auxiliary systems from failures of the components or incorrect machine operation. ITER has developed a method to assure that some critical operator commands have been correctly received and executed in the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The implementation of the method in a PLC program is a critical part of the interlock system. A methodology designed at CERN has been applied to verify this PLC program. The methodology is the result of 5 years of research in the applicability of model checking to PLC programs. A proof-of-concept tool called PLCverif implements this methodology. This paper presents the challenges and results of the ongoing collaboration between CERN and ITER on formal verification of critical PLC programs.

CERN's Data Interchange Protocol (DIP)* is a publish-subscribe middleware infrastructure developed at CERN to allow lightweight communications between distinct industrial control systems (such as detector control systems or gas control systems). DIP is a rudimentary data exchange protocol with a very flat and short learning curve and a stable specification. It also lacks support for access control, smoothing or data archiving. This paper presents a mechanism which has been implemented to keep track of every single publisher or subscriber node active in the DIP infrastructure, along with the DIP name servers supporting it. Since DIP supports more than 55,000 publications, regrouping hundreds of industrial control processes, keeping track of the system activity requires advanced visualization mechanisms (e.g. connectivity maps, live historical charts) and a scalable web-based interface** to render this information is essential.

A total of 33 gas control applications are currently in production in the LHC Experiments and the CERN accelerator complex. Each application contains around fifty synoptic views and hundreds of plots. In this paper, the entirely model-driven approach followed to generate all these HMIs is presented. The procedure implemented simplifies the creation of these graphical interfaces; allowing the propagation of changes to all visualizations at once in a coherent manner, thus reducing the long-term maintenance effort. The generation tool enables the creation of files of similar content based on templates, specific logic (rules) and variables written in simple user-defined XML files. This paper also presents the software design and the major evolution challenges currently faced, how the functions performed by the tool, as well as the technologies used in its implementation, have evolved while ensuring compatibility with the existing models.

The 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope, under construction in South Africa, will become the largest and most sensitive radio telescope in the Southern Hemisphere until integrated with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Software testing is an integral part of software development that is aimed at evaluating software quality; verifying and validating that the given requirements are met. This poster will present the approach, techniques and tools used to automate the testing of the software that controls and monitors the telescope. Jenkins continuous integration system is the server used to run the automated tests together with Git and Docker as the supporting tools to the process. In addition to the aforementioned tools we also use an Automated Qualification Framework (AQF) which is an in-house developed software that automates as much as possible of the functional testing of the Control and Monitoring (CAM) software. The AQF is invoked from Jenkins by launching a fully simulated CAM system and executing the Integrated CAM Tests against this simulated system as CAM Regression Testing. The advantages and limitations of the automated testing will be elaborated in the paper in detail.

The superconducting linear electron accelerator ELBE at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf is a versatile light source. It operates in continuous wave (CW) mode to provide a high average beam current. To fulfil the requirements for future high resolution experiments the analogue low level radio frequency control (LLRF) is currently replaced by a digital μTCA.4 based LLRF developed at DESY, Hamburg. Operation and parametrization is realized by a server application implemented by DESY using the ChimeraTK software framework. To interface the WinCC 7.3 based ELBE control system an OPC UA Adapter for ChimeraTK has been developed in cooperation with DESY and Technische Universität Dresden (TUD). The poster gives an overview of the collaborating parties, the variable mapping scheme used to represent LLRF data in the OPC UA server address space and integration experiences with different industrial OPC UA Clients like WinCC 7.3 and LabVIEW.

As a contribution to the European Spallation Source as part of BrightnESS, the Paul Scherrer Institut is involved in the streaming of EPICS data and the writing of NeXus compliant HDF5 files. We combine this development with the transition of the AMOR instrument at the Paul Scherrer Institut to EPICS and a streaming based data architecture. To guide our development before ESS has operational equipment, we use a detailed simulation of the instrument AMOR at SINQ to test and integrate our data streaming components. We convert EPICS data sources to Google FlatBuffers as our message format and distribute them using Apache Kafka. On the file writing side, we combine the messages from EPICS data sources as well as from neutron events to write HDF5 files at rates up to 4.8 GiB/s using Parallel HDF. This platform will also be used for testing the experiment control software on top of EPICS.

Sardana and Taurus form a python software suite for Supervision, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) optimized for scientific installations. Sardana and Taurus are open source and deliver a substantial reduction in both time and cost associated to the design, development and support of control and data acquisition systems. The project was initially developed at ALBA and later evolved to an international collaboration driven by a community of users and developers from ALBA, DESY, MAXIV and Solaris as well as other institutes and private companies. The advantages of Sardana for its adoption by other institutes are: free and open source code, comprehensive workflow for enhancement proposals, a powerful environment for building and executing macros, optimized access to the hardware and a generic Graphical User Interface (Taurus) that can be customized for every application. Sardana and Taurus are currently based on the Tango Control System framework but also capable to inter-operate to some extend with other control systems like EPICS. The software suite scales from small laboratories to large scientific institutions, allowing users to use only some parts or employ it as a whole.

The web continues to grow as an application platform, with accessibility and platform independence as major benefits. It also makes it possible to tie services together in new ways through simple APIs. At MAX IV we are using web services for various purposes related to the control system, for example, monitoring servers and services, accessing alarm history, viewing control system status, managing system and users logs and running recurring jobs. Furthermore, all user management is also accessed via web applications, and even data analysis and experiment control can now be performed via web based interfaces. We make an effort to use existing tools whenever possible (e.g. Kibana, Prometheus), and otherwise develop systems in-house, based on current well established libraries and standards, such as JavaScript, Python, Apache, etc. This paper presents an overview of our activities in the field and describes different architectural decisions taken.

When writing software, we develop algorithms that tell the computer what to do at run-time. Our solutions are easier to understand and debug when they are properly modeled using class hierarchies, enumerations, and a well-factored API. Unfortunately, even with these design tools, we end up having to debug our programs at run-time. Worse still, debugging an embedded system changes its dynamics, making it tough to find and fix concurrency issues. This paper describes techniques using C++ to detect run-time bugs *at compile time*. A concurrency library, developed at Fermilab, is used for examples in illustrating these techniques.

A common use case in accelerator control systems is subscribing to many properties and multiple devices and combine data from this. A new technology which got standardized during recent years in software industry are so-called reactive streams. Libraries implementing this standard provide a rich set of operators to manipulate, combine and subscribe to streams of data. However, the usual focus of such streaming libraries are applications in which those streams complete within a limited amount of time or collapse due to errors. On the other hand, in the case of a control systems we want to have those streams live for a very long time (ideally infinitely) and handle errors gracefully. In this paper we describe an approach which allows two reactive stream styles: ephemeral and long-living. This allows the developers to profit from both, the extensive features of reactive stream libraries and keeping the streams alive continuously. Further plans and ideas are also discussed.

Accelerator control software often has to handle multi-dimensional data of physical quantities when aggregating readings from multiple devices (e.g. the reading of an orbit in the LHC). When storing such data as nested hashtables or lists, the ability to do structural operations or calculations along an arbitrary dimensions is hampered. Tensorics is a Java library to provide a solution for these problems. A Tensor is a n-dimensional data structure, and both structural (e.g. extraction) and mathematical operations are possible along any dimension. Any Java class or interface can serve as a dimension, with coordinates being instances of a dimension class. This contribution will elaborate on the design and the functionality of the Tensorics library and highlight existing use cases in operational LHC control software, e.g. the LHC luminosity server or the LHC chromaticity correction application.

Among other functionalities, the tensorics library provides a framework to declaratively describe expressions of arbitrary values and resolve these expressions in different contexts. The Streaming Pool framework provides a comfortable way to transform arbitrary signals from devices into long-living reactive streams. The combination of these two concepts provides a powerful tool to describe modules for online analysis. In this paper we describe this approach, elaborate on the general concepts and give an overview of actual and potential use cases as well as ideas and plans for future evolution.

The Front-End Software Architecture (FESA) framework is the basis for most real-time software development for accelerator control at CERN. FESA designs are defined in an XML document which is validated against a schema to enforce framework constraints, and are used to automatically generate C++ boilerplate code in which the developer can then implement specific code. Design files can rapidly grow in complexity making the overview of the resulting system almost impossible to understand. One way to overcome this is to benefit from a graph-based representation of the design, with XML fragments summarized into logical blocks and association between the blocks depicted by arrows. As the intricacy of the graph is analogous to a potential complex design, it is also essential to provide an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for parameterising and editing the graph generation in order to fine-tune a simpler and cleaner illustration of a FESA design. This paper describes such a GUI (FESA Graph Editor) and outlines how it benefits the design and documentation process of the FESA-design-document.

Common EPICS visualization tools include standalone Graphical User Interface [*] or archiving applications [**] that are not suitable to create custom web dashboards from IOC published PVs. The solution proposed in this work is a data publishing architecture based on three open-source components: - Collectd: a very popular data collection daemon with a specialized plugin developed to fetch EPICS PVs; - InfluxDB: a Time Series DataBase (TSDB) that provides an high performance datastore written specifically for time series data; - Grafana: a web application for time series analytics and visualization able to query data from different datasources. A live demo will be provided showing flexibility and user friendliness of such developed solution. As a case study, we show the environment developed and deployed in the Belle2 experiment at KEK Laboratory (Tsukuba, Japan) to monitor data from the endcap calorimeter during the installation phase.

Until recently, Java GUI development in the CERN Beam Instrumentation Group has followed an ad-hoc approach despite several attempts to provide frameworks and coding standards. Triggered by the deprecation of Java's Swing toolkit, the JavaFX toolkit has been adopted for the creation of new GUIs, and is foreseen for future migration of Swing-based GUIs. To increase homogenisation and encourage modular coding of JavaFX GUIs, libraries have been developed to standardise accelerator context selection, provide inter-component GUI communication and optimise data streaming between the control system and modules that make up an expert GUI. This paper describes how this has allowed the use of model-view-controller techniques and naming conventions via Maven archetypes. It also details the modernisation of the software delivery process and subsequent renovation of the software portal. Finally, the paper outlines a vision to extend the principles applied to this Java GUI development for future Python-based developments.

A browser-based graphical user interface has been developed at Diamond. It is known as known as MalcolmJS as it communicates using Diamond's Malcolm Middleware protocol. The original goal was to communicate, via websockets with a PandABox in order to allow a user to examine and set attributes of numerous functional blocks within the instrument. With the continuing maturity of the JavaScript language, in particular the release of ES6, along with the availability of off-the-shelf reactive open-source JavaScript libraries, such as Facebook's React and Node.js, a rich set of tools and frameworks have entered the arena of user interface development suitable for control systems. This paper describes the design decisions based on these tools, experiences and lessons learned during and after the development process and the possibilities for future development as a generic, adaptable framework for instrument and control system user interfaces.

In the ever-growing control system at CERN, there is a need for having an easy to use, yet fast and flexible tool that interfaces with all the different middleware in the accelerator, experiments and technical infrastructures. With RADAR 2.0 we wanted to address this issue, making a LabVIEW based, drag and drop visual tool that hides much of the system complexity from the user and within seconds gives the operator a ready to use, fully functional control system GUI. RADAR 2.0 interfaces with the CERN Middleware (CMW), the CERN Accelerator and Logging system (CALS), OPC-UA and DIM. With its class based implementation it can easily be extended to other data sources (Files, Databases, middleware) on demand.

The Parallel Execution of Sequential Data Analysis (ParSeq) software has been developed to work on large data sets of thousands spectra of a thousand points each. The main goal of this tool is to perform spectroscopy analysis without delays on the large amount of data that will be generated on Balder beamline at Max IV *. ParSeq was developed using Python and PyQt and can be operated via scripts or graphical user interface (GUI). The pipeline is consisted of nodes and transforms. Each node generally has a common group of components: data manager (also serves as legend), data combiner, metadata viewer, transform dialog, help panel and a plot window (from silx library **) as main element. The transforms connect nodes, applying the respective parameters in the active data. It is also possible to create cross-data linear combinations (e.g. averaging, RMS or PCA) and propagate them downstream. Calculations will be done with parallel execution on GPU. The GUI is very flexible and user-friendly, containing splitters, dock widgets, colormaps and undo/redo options. The features mentioned are missing in other analysis platforms what justifies the creation of ParSeq.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project is responsible for developing the SKA Observatory, the world's largest radiotelescope ever built: eventually two arrays of radio antennas - SKA1-Mid and SKA1-Low - will be installed in the South Africa's Karoo region and Western Australia's Murchison Shire, each covering a different range of radio frequencies. In particular SKA1-Mid array will comprise 133 15m diameter dish antennas observing in the 350 MHz-14 GHz range, each locally managed by a Local Monitoring and Control (LMC) system and remotely orchestrated by the SKA Telescope Manager (TM) system. Dish LMC will provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to be used for monitoring and Dish control in standalone mode for testing, TM simulation, integration, commissioning and maintenance. This paper gives a status update of the LMC GUI design involving users and tasks analysis, system prototyping, interface evaluation and provides details on the GUI prototypes being developed and technological choices.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a free electron laser (FEL) facility operating at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC). The LCLS Machine Protection System (MPS) contains thousands of inputs and hundreds of protection interlocks. The inputs and logic configuration are defined in SQLite database files. Real-time state information is hosted by EPICS signals. Control room operators use a Graphical User Interface (MPSGUI) to view and manage faults. The MPSGUI provides a wealth of useful information, from hardware input details to high-level logic flow, but it was difficult for operators to take advantage of this. The workflow required cross-referencing between several screens. This poster presents the greatly improved workflow and usability of the MPSGUI. The requested improvements were defined in meetings between the MPS controls team and the control room operators. The improved GUI allow operators to more quickly respond to MPS faults and diagnose problems reducing troubleshooting time by 20 percent.

ReA3 is the rare isotope beam (RIB) reaccelerator at the Michigan State University's National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). ReA3 is unique in its specialty and is being used to reaccelerate RIBs presently produced by the Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF) and in the future, by the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) which is currently under construction. A transition to CS-Studio as the graphical user interface tool is underway to align ReA3 Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) with the FRIB style, providing operators with a consistent and integrated environment. This contribution will describe the challenges and strategies for implementing the new HMIs at an operating facility. It will demonstrate the use of mock-ups and a simulated environment for interface design and testing.

A new 60kW thermosiphon fluorocarbon cooling plant has been commissioned to cool the silicon tracker of the ATLAS experiment at the CERN LHC. The thermosiphon operates over a height of 90 metres and is integrated into the CERN UNICOS system and the ATLAS detector control system (DCS). The cooling system uses custom ultrasonic instrumentaton to measure very high coolant vapour flow (up to 1.2 kg/second), to analyse binary gas mixtures and detect leaks. In these instruments ultrasound pulses are transmitted in opposite directions in flowing gas streams. Pulse transit time measurements are used to calculate the flow rate and the sound velocity, which - at a given temperature and pressure - is a function of the molar concentration of the two gases. Gas composition is computed from comparisons of real-time sound velocity measurements with a database of predictions, using algorithms running in the Siemens SIMATIC WinCC SCADA environment. A highly-distributed network of five instruments is currently integrated into the ATLAS DCS. Details of the thermosiphon, its recent operation and the performance of the key ultrasonic instrumentation will be presented.

nTOF is a pulsed neutron facility at CERN which studies neutron interactions as function of the energy. Neutrons are produced by a pulsed proton beam from the PS directed to a lead target. In a typical experiment, a sample is placed in the neutron beam and the reaction products are recorded. The typical output signals from the nTOF detectors are characterized by a train of pulses, each one corresponding to a different neutron energy interacting with the sample. The Data Acquisition System (DAQ) has been upgraded in 2014 and is characterized by challenging requirements as more than hundreds of 12 or 14-bit channels at a sampling frequency of 1 GS/s and 1.8 GS/s acquired simultaneously every 1.2 s for up to 100 ms. The amount of data to be managed can reach a peak of several GB/s. This paper describes the hardware's solutions as well as the software's architecture developed to ensure the proper synchronization between all the DAQ machines, the data's integrity, retrieval and analysis.

Due to the massive parallel operation modes at the GSI accelerators, a lot of accelerator setup and re-adjustment has to be made during a beam time. This is typically done manually and is very time-consuming. With the FAIR project the complexity of the facility increases furthermore and for efficiency reasons it is recommended to establish a high level of automation. Modern Accelerator Control Systems allow a fast access to both, accelerator settings and beam diagnostics data. This provides the opportunity together with the fast-switching magnets in GSI-beamlines to implement evolutionary algorithms for automated adjustment. A lightweight python interface to CERN Front-End Software Architecture (FESA) gave the opportunity to try this novel idea, fast and easy at the CRYRING@ESR injector. Furthermore, the python interface facilitates the work flow significantly as the evolutionary algorithms python package DEAP could be used. DEAP has been applied already in external optimization studies with particle tracking codes*. The first results and gained experience of an automatized optimization at the CRYRING@ESR injector are presented here.

Three-dimensional image reconstruction in X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) is a mathematical process that entirely depends on the alignment of the object of study. Small variations in pitch and roll angles and translational shift between center of rotation and center of detector can cause large deviations in the captured sinogram, resulting in a degraded 3D image. Most of the popular reconstruction algorithms are based on previous adjustments of the sinogram ray offset before the reconstruction process. This work presents an automatic method for shift and angle adjust of the center of rotation (COR) before the beginning of the experiment removing the need of setting geometrical parameters to achieve a reliable reconstruction. This method correlates different projections using Scale Invariant Feature Transform algorithm (SIFT) to align the experimental setup with sub-pixel precision and fast convergence.

The integration of the Data Acquisition, Offline Processing and Hardware Controls using MQTT has been proposed for the STAR Experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Since the majority of the Control System for the STAR Experiment uses EPICS, this created the need to develop a way to bridge MQTT and Channel Access bidirectionally. Using CAFE C++ Channel Access library from PSI/SLS, we were able to develop such a MQTT-Channel Access bridge fairly easily. The prototype development for MQTT-Channel Access bridge is discussed here.

Automation plays a key role in the macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines at Diamond Light Source (DLS). This is particularly evident with sample exchange; where fast, reliable, and accurate handling is required to ensure high quality and high throughput data collection. This paper looks at the design, build, and integration of an in-house robot control system. The system was designed to improve reliability and exchange times, provide high sample storage capacity, and accommodate easy upgrade paths, whilst gaining and maintaining in-house robotics knowledge. The paper also highlights how peripheral components were brought under the control of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based integration unit, including a vision system.

After studying some alternatives for macromolecular crystallography beamlines experiment control and had considered the effort to create an in-house made solution, LNLS decided to adopt MXCuBE*. Such decision was made considering main technologies used to develop it, based on Python, which is being largely used in our laboratory, its basic support to EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System), the control system adopted for the LNLS beamlines, and because of its stability. Then, existing MXCuBE implementation has been adapted to meet LNLS requirements, considering that previously it was mainly ready to control systems other than EPICS. Using basic MXCuBE engines, new classes were created on devices abstraction layer, which communicates to EPICS IOCs (Input/Output Controllers), like AreaDetectors, MotorRecords among others. Py4Syn** was employed at this abstraction layer, as well. New GUI components were developed and some enhancements were implemented. Now, MXCuBE has been used on LNLS MX2 beamline since the end of 2016 with positive feedback from researchers. The adoption of MXCube proved to be right, given its flexibility, performance and the obtained results.

STFC Daresbury Laboratory is developing CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications), a novel FEL (Free Electron Laser) test facility focussed on the generation of ultra-short photon pulses of coherent light with high levels of stability and synchronisation. The main motivation for CLARA is to test new FEL schemes that can later be implemented on existing and future short wavelength FELs. Particular focus will be on ultra-short pulse generation, pulse stability, and synchronisation with external sources. Knowledge gained from the development and operation of CLARA will inform the aims and design of a future UK-XFEL. To aid in the development of high level physics software, EPICS, a distributed controls framework, and ASTRA, a particle tracking code have been combined to simulate the facility as a virtual accelerator.

This paper presents the proposed communication architecture of the Detector Control System (DCS) for the Inner Tracking System (ITS). The purpose of the DCS is to acquire and control the states of the ITS. Since the ITS is not yet fully implemented, an emulator of the communication architecture is being developed. The proposed architecture comprises five levels. At the bottom, the detector is emulated by sensors connected to microcontrollers. Each microcontroller is then connected to a Raspberry Pi which represents the ALICE low-level front-end (ALF) electronics at the second level of communication architecture. The third level is represented by Front-End Device (FRED), a Linux server where more than one ALF device can be connected. FRED is then connected to the fourth level, implemented by the SCADA interface - WinCC OA. Above all these levels is an archiving and configuration database setup. Configuration bypasses the SCADA interface and is managed directly through FRED. The purpose of the emulator is to verify the proposed architecture in terms of data throughput and cooperation of the mentioned modules.

Magnet measurements at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) are performed with the use of a process control tool (PCT), which is fully integrated into the PSI control system. The tool is implemented as a set of user friendly graphical user interface applications dealing with particular magnet measurement techniques supported at PSI, which include Hall probe, vibrating wire, and moving wire methods. The core of each application is the state machine software developed by magnet measurement and control system experts. Applications act as very efficient assistants to the magnet measurement personnel by monitoring the whole measurement process on-line and helping to react in a timely manner to any possible operational errors. The paper concentrates on the PCT structure and its performance.

After more than 15 years of stable operation it was time to develop a new standard experiment control and data acquisition system for HZB beamlines. The aim is to create a modular system based on commercial hardware components. Because of the convincing hardware interfacing and good experience with PXI devices we choose this as hardware platform and LabVIEW as software development system. Starting in late 2015, we developed a framework with modules for configuration, (scan) processing, device communication, logging etc. The user interface is bisected as (i) graphical and (ii) scripting version. Where the 'included' script engine is python. The system serves both, standard commissioning tools as well as specialised instrument setups. It is integrated into the metadata catalogue system (ICAT) of the HZB in terms of collecting log and meta data and storing those according to the data policy of the institute. We will present an overview of the system features in general and a specific instrument view of a rather complex beamline at HZB.

The monochromator is known to be one of the most critical optical elements of a synchrotron beamline. It directly affects the beam quality with respect to energy and position, demanding high stability performance and fine position control. The new high-dynamic double-crystal monochromator (HD-DCM) [1], prototyped at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), was designed for the future X-ray undulator and superbend beamlines of Sirius, the new Brazilian 4th generation synchrotron [2]. At this kind of machine, the demand for stability is even higher and conflicts with factors such as high-power loads, power load variation, and vibration sources. To identify and ensure sufficient control of the dynamic behaviour of all subcomponents in the proto-type, an implementation in MATLAB/Simulink Real-Time environment in a Speedgoat Real-Time Perfor-mance Machine was developed. This approach enables rapid prototyping, by allowing a shared environment for system modeling and testing. The tool was developed in a modular architecture aiming at practical model itera-tion and platform migration to standard beamline con-trollers, which can prove portability and scalability fea-tures.

With the increased performance provided by 4th generation synchrotron light sources, precise motion control and event synchronization are essential factors to ensure experiment resolution and performance. Many advanced beamline systems, such as a new high-dynamic double crystal monochromator (HD-DCM), are under development for Sirius, the new machine under construction in Brazil. Among the expected performance challenges in such applications, complex coordinated movements during flyscans/continuous scans, hardware synchronization for pumpÂ­-and-Â­probe experiments and active noise suppression are goals to be met. Two architectures are proposed to cover general-purpose and advanced applications. The HD-DCM controller was implemented in a MATLAB/Simulink environment, which is optimized for RCP. Hence, its software must be adapted to a more cost-effective platform. One candidate controller is the NI cRIO. The portability of both MATLAB and NI PXI, the present standard control platform at LNLS, codes to cRIO is evaluated in this paper. Control resolution, acquisition rates and other factors that might limit the performance of these advanced applications are also discussed.
