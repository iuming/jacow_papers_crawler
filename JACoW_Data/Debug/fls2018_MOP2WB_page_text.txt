The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is the next ring-based light source with an emittance of tens of picometers, and a circumference of about 1.3 km to be built in China soon in a few years. After 10 years' evolution, the design for the High Energy Photon Source is recently bascially determined. We will report the lattice design and physics studies on HEPS, covering issues of storage lattice design and optimization, booster design, injection design, collective effects, error study, insertion device effects, longitudinal dynamics, etc.

Status of Construction for ESRF EBS

The ESRF ' the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ' is a user facility in Grenoble, France, and the source of the most intense high-energy (6 GeV) X-rays in the world. In 2019, the existing storage ring will be removed and a first-of-a-kind new lattice, based on an innovative arrangement of magnets, will be installed in its place, dramatically reducing the horizontal equilibrium emittance. This ‘fourth-generation' synchrotron will produce an X-ray beam 100 times more brilliant and coherent than the ESRF source today. Coupled with upgraded beamlines and beamline support it will provid previously unimaginable opportunities for applications as varied as nanoscopy, science at extreme conditions and structural biology. The ESRF — Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS) project was launched in 2015 and its current status will be presented, alongside the expected performance of the accelerator, the technical challenges confronted and its future potential fields of applications. A special attention will be put in this paper to the beam dynamics issues (lattice, injection efficiency, lifetime, beam losses,…).

Previous MBA studies converged to a lattice composed of 7BA-6BA with a natural emittance value of 200-250 pm·rad range. Due to the difficulties of non-linear optimization in targeting lower emittance values, a decision was made to symmetrize totally the ring with 20 identical cells having long free straight sections longer than 4 m. A 7BA solution elaborated by adopting the sextupole paring scheme with dispersion bumps originally developed at the ESRF-EBS, including reverse-bends, enabling an emittance of 72 pm·rad has been defined as the baseline lattice. The sufficient on-momentum dynamic aperture obtained allows to consider off-axis injection. The linear and nonlinear dynamic properties of the lattice along with the expected performance in terms of brilliance and transverse coherence are presented. In particular, the beta functions tuned down to 1 m in both transverse planes at the center of straight sections allow matching diffraction limited photons up to 3 keV. In addition, a 9BA solution reaching 32 pm·rad and a novel longitudinal on-axis injection scheme involving rapidly decaying RF kicks developed at SOLEIL shall also be presented.

Study of Multi-bend Achromat Lattices for the HALS Diffraction-limited Storage Ring

In this paper, two multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice concepts, the locally symmetric MBA and MBA with interleaved dispersion bumps, are described, which have been used to design the Hefei Advanced Light Source (HALS), a soft X-ray diffraction-limited storage ring proposed at NSRL. In these two MBA concepts, most of the nonlinear effects caused by sextupoles can be cancelled out within one lattice cell as in the hybrid MBA proposed by ESRF EBS, but the available family number of sextupoles in one cell can be more than that in the hybrid MBA so that, for example, the tune shift with momentum can be better controlled to increase the dynamic momentum aperture (MA). Using the two MBA concepts, three kinds of lattices, 8BA, 6BA and 7BA, have been studied for the HALS, showing large on- and off-momentum dynamic apertures and large enough dynamic MA.
