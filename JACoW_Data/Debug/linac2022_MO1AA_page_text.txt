The ISIS Spallation Neutron Source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK has a 70 MeV H− linac operating at 202.5 MHz. The linac consists of a 665 keV RFQ and a 4-tank Drift Tube Linac (DTL). In order to ensure continued reliability, increase performance and lay the groundwork for possible facility upgrades in the future a programme of R&D has been taking place in recent years. This paper will discuss three components of that programme: the complete replacement of DTL Tank 4; the design of a Medium Energy beam Transport (MEBT) between the RFQ and DTL; and the Front End Test Stand (FETS), a demonstrator for the front end of a future high current, high energy linac.

In April 2021, FRIB became the highest energy heavy-ion linac in the world with the acceleration of Kr-86 to 212 MeV/u using all 46 cryomodules containing 324 SC cavities. Also, three-charge state Xe-124 was accelerated to the same energy with the intensity increase by the factor of 2.5 compared to the single charge state. Many High-Level Physics Applications were developed and used during the commissioning, allowing quick beam commissioning progress. For the first time, the stripping with liquid Li film was tested with Ar, Xe, and U beams in the energy range 17 MeV/u to 20 MeV/u.
