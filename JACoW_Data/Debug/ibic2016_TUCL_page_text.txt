NSLS-II light source has state of the art RF BPM receivers that were designed and built in-house incorporating the latest technology available in the RF, digital, and software domains. The recently added capability to resolve the orbits of multiple bunches within a turn as well as further improvement in transverse positional resolution for single- and few-bunch fills [*] allowed us to perform a number of novel beam dynamics measurements. These include measuring small impedances of vacuum chamber components, and of extremely small (~10-5) current-dependent tune shifts (transverse and synchrotron), as well as obtaining an amplitude-dependent tune shift curve from a single kicker pulse. We are also effectively utilizing our BPMs to decipher the lifetimes of individual bunches and to visualize single bunch instability dynamics. In this paper we review the unique capabilities of NSLS-II BPMs and present examples of beam physics measurements that greatly benefit from them.

We have modified the vertical bunch-by-bunch feedback to also provide a longitudinal kick on a separate input. Using our existing drive/damp system and a modulator/amplifier to the required 1.5 GHz we are thus able to characterise the damping rates of all coupled bunch instabilities, while not able to provide feedback. At the same time, we have started the development of a completely new longitudinal feedback system based on commercially available components, providing 500MS/s, 14 bit conversion in and out, powerful Virtex 7 field programmable gate array for digital signal processing and 32GB of on board buffer for recording data. We report on the status of the development and our plans to bring the new system into use.
