Modern project of 4th generation synchrotron light source USSR (Ultimate Source of Synchrotron Radiation) is under consideration now in Russia. A FEL is considered as a part of USSR complex. For this reason top-up linac is discussed as the main injector. Nevertheless, other injection schemes should be studied too and two variants of the booster ring are proposed. On the one hand the booster ring can be placed together with the main storage ring in common tunnel similarly to Sirius, TPS and SLS. In this case its circumference will be close to 1300 m. Alternately, compact (~ 300 m) booster ring is also under investigation. Current status of the development of two booster variants and preliminarily results of the electron dynamics simulation are presented.

The highest possible, close to 100%, rate of electron capture into acceleration mode has been achieved in an electron linear accelerator based on a parallel-coupled accelerating structure (PCS). High capture rate has been achieved by using an electron gun with high-frequency beam current control, entrance PCS resonators focusing the beam, and in-built into the PCS magnetic periodic focusing system of the solenoidal type based on permanent magnets (MPFS). This study investigates beam dynamics in the developed gun and PCS. The electron gun forms a cylindrical weakly-converging beam in the first resonator of the PCS as a sequence of short pulses with the accelerating frequency, the first and following resonators of the PCS focus, group and accelerate the beam and MPFS focuses and transports electrons to the PCS exit.

R&D on new Dubna Electron Radioactive Ion Collider fAcility (DERICA) implies the development of two heavy ion linear accelerators LINAC-100 and LINAC-30 each capable of accelerating ions within the wide range of mass/charge ratios A/Z. LINAC-100 will accelerate intensive CW primary stable isotope beams (from B11 to U238 with A/Z ~6) with beam currents up to 10 puA for radioactive isotope production using fragmentation method. As a concept for LINAC-100 modular system of independently phased SC cavities with NC CW RFQ section in injector part is proposed. In order to obtain maximum range of secondary ions acceleration up to 50 AMeV for U238 and 100 AMeV for "light" ions should be provided. Moreover, to enlarge flexibility in radioactive ion production conditions and expand using of LINAC-100 on applied physics purposes it is desirable to have three modes of accelerator operation: with maximum light ion energies of 50, 75 and 100 AMeV. In this paper the results of A/Z ~6 beam dynamics studies for modular part of LINAC-100 for CW operation mode will be presented.

Design and construction of CW high intensity linacs are important issues of worldwide accelerator technology development. RFQ linacs are useful for large scale research facilities such as SNS, ADS and FRIB. RFQ are necessary to use for low-energy nuclear and radioactive ion physics (e.g., DERICA - Dubna Electron - Radioactive Ion Collider fAcility project, Dubna, Russia). Some solutions are applied for RFQ to oper-ate in CW mode. The decrease of accelerating field and of RF field overvoltage is one of that solutions. Maximal field for CW RFQ is traditionally limited by 1.3-1.5 of the Kilpatrick criterion value comparatively of 1.8-2.0 for the pulse mode. But the thermostabilization of the RFQ cavity is very important problem. Accelerating structure undergoes high thermal loads for operating a CW mode, therefore water cooling system is needed. In this report a selection of an optimal resonator shape and water cooling system con-figuration was done and thermodynamics simulation results will presented.

The new project of 4th generation synchrotron light source USSR (Ultimate Source of Synchrotron Radiation) is under development today. It was proposed that USSR will include both storage ring and soft FEL and one linac will used for injection in synchrotron and as a driver for FEL. The general concept of the top-up linac is proposed and the beam dynamics was simulated. It is suggested to use two RF-guns in this linac similar to Super-KEKB, MAX-IV and CERN FCC. One of the RF-guns should be classical with thermionic cathode and will be used for injection. The second one having photogun will use to generate a bunch train (for FEL. Current results of the top-up linac general scheme development and first results of the beam dynamics simulation will present.

High power resonance electron accelerator is designed at RFNC-VNIIEF and is aimed at producing electron beams with the energy range from 1.5 to 7.5 MeV and average beam power up to 300 kW. Accelerator is based on coaxial half-wave RF cavity. Electrons gain required energy by several passing of accelerating cavity. The paper presents the results of electron dynamics computer simulation with space charge influence. Injection parameters to accelerating cavity are determined. These parameters provide sufficient conditions to achieve required electron energy and minimal beam current losses. According to calculations to achieve 1.5 MeV electron energy gain RF power no less than 165 kW is required. First tests of the facility were performed with RF power up to 180 kW. The measured electron beam energy after one pass is 1.5 MeV. Then the electron beam is returned to the accelerating cavity by the recycling beam system. The measured electron beam energy after the second pass is 3 MeV. The electron energy spectrum and the average beam current were determined on each acceleration stage. The estimation of the transverse beam dimensions was additionally performed.

Resonance accelerator presented in this paper was designed to generate electron beams with the energy up to 7.5 MeV and with average power up to 300 kW. Such a high designed power of the beam requires permanent monitoring of its dynamic characteristics. The output beam parameters are diagnosed; however, the section of electron injection is still problematic because of the lack of diagnostic equipment at this stage. Current injection channel and variant of its supplementary equipping are considered in this paper. Supplementary equipping intends the installation of diagnostic equipment and additional focusing magnetic components. The presented variant of modernization is based on the results of beam dynamics calculations. The test bench with the ability of electron beam diagnostics was developed to verify performed calculations. Composition and geometry of the updated injection channel were completely reproduced on the test bench. It involves RF injector (100 keV, 40 mA), beam magnetic transport system and diagnostic equipment. Diagnostic devices make it possible to measure electron energy, average current, electron bunches length and to control the position of transporting electron beam. Basing on the calculations and experimental researches the optimal variant of injection system was suggested. This injection system is expected to be integrated into the accelerator complex in future.

A resonance accelerator LU-10-20 aimed at carrying out radiation processing of materials and researching radiation processes has been functioning in VNIIEF since 1994. The energy of accelerated electrons is up to 10 MeV, the average beam power - up to 12 kW. This accelerator has demonstrated that it is highly useful for performing radiation researches and tests. Currently the major part of accelerator systems such as RF power supply system and accelerating structure have lost in the course of continuous service their initial features and their hardware-component base is obsolete. That is why the production of an up-to-date accelerator complex with the similar output parameters of electron beam is highly promising. In future such accelerator should replace LU-10-20. A review of existing Russian and foreign systems of RF power supply is given. The perspective structure of the accelerating system is presented. There are reported the results of preliminary electrodynamic calculations of the accelerating section with power supply from the selected RF generator.

With the development of the new CDS section-based cavity for the first four-section cavity of the main part of INR RAS linac replacement application of the bridge devices, similar to existing rectangular waveguide segments-based devices is supposed. Numerical simulation of a complete cavity coupled with bridge devices requires unattainable computing resources. In this regard, the analytical representation for the coupled non-uniform system based on multimode approximation is considered. The analytical model for a system consisting of a short CDS section coupled with a rectangular waveguide segment is presented. The model is calibrated by direct numerical simulation. A generalization allowing parameters selection for the new CDS cavity sections and bridge devices coupling based on the presented model is proposed.

The prospective opportunity for high-temperature plasma generation by opposing collision of accelerated to 10-20 keV/amu cluster ion beams of hydrogen isotopes within the rectilinear section of magnetic trap was considered earlier in ITEP. It showed the aggregate deuteron (or tritium) atom per charge unit in accelerated cluster ions may consider a possibility to create the thermonuclear fuel mass up to values when the mutual retardation of all the nucleons in colliding beams. In the present work some examples of earlier created RF accelerating systems for heavy ion linac may be considered as prototypes for study of features and some off-beatings of heavy cluster ions of hydrogen isotopes for plasma generation are discussed. Some features of basic possibility for creation such kind of accelerator systems for cluster ion with mass-to-charge ratio of 103-104 are considered.

There are considered acceleration of few types multicharged ions with different A/Z ratio in single accelerating RFQ channel without outer focusing magnetic field. RFQ may be independent accelerator or as part of injection system into DTL of high energy. There are considered compact RFQ with high operating frequency (for example frequencis of P-diapason). So magnetic focusing is absent mathematical methods of control theory are used for optimization of RFQ vane geometry to obtain exit beam parameters suitable for further acceleration. It is possible separate acceleration a few type of ions in single RFQ channel or simultaneous acceleration if (case of heavy ions) ion currents are very small.

Recently the first section of a standalone superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) heavy ion Linac as a demonstration of the capability of 217 MHz multi gap Crossbar H-mode structures (CH) has been commissioned and extensively tested with beam at GSI. The demonstrator set up reached acceleration of heavy ions up to the design beam energy and beyond. The required acceleration gain of 0.5 MeV/u was achieved with heavy ion beams even above the design mass to charge ratio at maximum available beam intensity and full beam transmission. This contribution presents further development and optimization of the HIM/GSI cw-Linac.

In radiation technologies, an electron beam is distributed in space by the deflecting magnets of the beam scanning system. The deflecting magnets always contain a ferromagnetic yoke, which is under the influence of alternating magnetic fields. A characteristic feature of ferromagnets in alternating fields is the existence of a hysteresis loop that affects the dependence of the effective magnetic field on time, and accordingly on the beam distribution in space and on the uniformity of irradiation dose. Depending on the process conditions, the hysteresis can have both a useful effect, which increases the uniformity of the distribution of dose fields and detrimental, which decreases the dose uniformity and erodes the units of the installation. The effect of the influence of hysteresis in the yoke of the scanning system deflecting magnet of the accelerator UELV-10-10-S-70 at IPCE RAS was studied. The negative influence of hysteresis was manifested in local overheating of the output foil and a decrease of beam utilization efficiency. Computer simulation of the scanning process with hysteresis was carried out using the computer code "Beam Scanning". Methods for eliminating the negative influence of hysteresis and optimizing the scanning system by selecting the steel grade of the magnetic yoke and changing the shape of the magnet current curve are proposed. These methods are implemented on an accelerator at IPCE RAS.

The family of four weak quadrupoles was replaced at VEPP-2000 electron-positron collider with new one. New quads with increased bore diameter made with higher field quality and equipped with fiducial points are excited by water-cooled coils fed with new 300 A power supplies. That allowed to double integrated gradient and to implement so called "warm" operation mode (with switched-off final focus solenoids) above 500 MeV energy level. Presented in the paper "warm" modes are used for beam scrubbing and for resonance depolarization technique of Compton backscattering beam energy measurement system cross-calibration.

The known statistics data amassed for power thyratrons in accelerators show remarkable potential of the plasma switches in terms of lifetime covering the range from several thousand up to 120 thousand hours total*,**. The gap in the lifetime can be reduced both by measures of improvements in technology and implementation of thyratron parameters monitoring systems. It is known that the thyratron lifetime mainly depends on continuity of gas pressure and cathode emission. In this paper the initial research on some effective means of gas pressure monitoring automation is described. The pressure monitoring in thyratrons TGI-, TPI- and TDI-types is possible in absence of anode voltage either by registration of triggering parameters in a new igniter design or by a special built-in high-temperature pressure gauge.

At the present stage of development of accelerating technology, it is important to create beam injection and extraction systems for newly created and modernized circular accelerators. Herewith, the high requirements associated with high energy of particles beams and a significant length of the channels are imposed both on the magnetic system of the transport channels and on power supplies. As part of development the NIKA (JINR) accelerator complex, the transport channel Buster-Nuclotron beam is creating in BINP. A powerful precision source with an output current up to 10 kA and an energy in the pulse up to 23 kJ is designed to power impulse dipole magnets and channel septum magnets. The presented article describes a pulsed source for magnetic lenses with a maximum output voltage up to 2 kV and a maximum output current up to 10 kA. The current amplitude instability from pulse to pulse is ensured at a level better than 10-3. The stability of the amplitude of the magnetic field in the lenses can be improved to a value of 100 ppm by introducing additional feedback over the field of the magnet using the integrating ADC VsDC produced by BINP. The developed source meets both the requirements for stability of output parameters and automation requirements for integration into modern accelerator systems.

In process of development of accelerating technique, there is a question of automation of scientific complexes and the production accelerators more and more sharply. To increase in energy of a bunch there is body height of necessary accuracy of maintaining of parameters of the accelerator. All this imposes new requirements of the system of automation of an accelerating complex. In addition, for high energy power supplies, the question of safe operation was always particularly acute. It is necessary not only control loading parameters, for its maintaining in working order, but also to ensure safety at the current operation and service works. The submitted article contains the description of the controller for pulse power supplies. Distinctive feature of the controller, this combination in one device, several, the logically bound among themselves. Realization in the controller of the device of fast protection, allowed to realize a qualitative analysis of behavior of a power supply system on change of tension and a load current that is very important for definition of future possible problems and not nominal situations. Control is exercised on Ethernet network, also, perhaps and manual. As a core the digital alarm processor allowing to realize implementation of local scenarios of work maintaining of a part of independent functions is used. The developed controller meets the requirements for automation, for integration into the modern accelerating complexes.

An Injection Complex (IC) was designed in Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk in frame of a program of super high luminosity electron-positron facility VEPP-5. The stability of its operation is determined, among other things, by an injection-extraction system and, consequently, by generators of inflectors. For stable operation of the Injection Complex, these generators must produce pulses with maximum amplitudes of the output voltage of 50 kV and current in the load of the inflector 2 kA, the instability of the flat top less than 5% and its duration in the range from 20 to 92 ns; temporary stability of the generator should be ±2 ns and the output pulse's front ' less than 50 ns. In addition, it must be able to adjust the output voltage amplitude in the range of 10-100%. This paper presents the results of the design sample of a generator of high-voltage nanosecond square pulses based on SOS-diode and the high-current cold cathode thyratrons (pseudospark switches).

The U-70 NRC "KI" - IHEP ring magnet made-up of combined functions, this magnet used to steer and focus a beam simultaneously. The existing commercial power supply with pulse-width modulation (PWM) voltage was not suitable because of electromagnetic incompatibility. The problem of suppressing 100% output voltage ripples by about minus 60 dB, was solved. It is planned to use the upgraded source to deaccelerate the beam of light ions in the U-70 synchrotron. The goal is to increase the energy range of the ejection beams to physical, medical, etc. researches.

The development of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) materials, namely the appearance of second-generation HTS tapes, opens up new opportunities for the use of superconductivity in high-energy physics devices and, in particular, in charged particle accelerators. In this paper, we study the effect of an unclosed magnetic shield from a second-generation HTS tape on the dynamics of a beam of charged particles moving along its axis. Within the framework of the simplest model of interaction of the magnetic field of a charged particle beam with a superconducting shield, such an effect is estimated. The superconducting shield shifts the beam of charged particles to its axis. In particular, a beam of particles with energy of 100 KEV and a current of 300mA passing at a distance of 15 mm from the axis of the superconducting shield with a radius of 20 mm and a length of 1 meter is shifted to the axis of the shield at a speed of about 50 mm/sec. The possibilities of using an open superconducting shield for the compression of a charged particle beam, as well as the possibility of controlling the shield, are discussed.

Em Fields in a Metal in an External Magnetic Field at Low Temperatures

Radio waves do not penetrate deep into the metal due to the high density of charge carriers in the metal. In the shorter-wave part of the spectrum, metals can be "transparent" only starting from ultraviolet, since the plasma frequencies in metals lie in the ultraviolet range. However, for a metal cooled to a low temperature and placed in an external magnetic field, the situation may change. Under these conditions, cyclotron orbits can be formed, and the relaxation time can significantly exceed the period of cyclotron motion of the charge carriers. For an electromagnetic wave with polarization normal to the induction vector of an external magnetic field, the exchange of energy with charge carriers in the metal turns out to be suppressed. Such a wave can propagate in the metal for relatively large distances (in comparison with the skin layer). In this connection, in electron storage rings at the azimuths, for example, of superconducting strong-field wigglers, with the magnetic field rise, the effect in the surface impedance change of the wiggler vacuum chamber metal can be manifested. This report is a brief review of some of results known in solid state physics applicable to these conditions and of interest to accelerator technology.

A system for harmonic coil "warm" and "cold" magnetic measurements, magnet energy loss measurements of various superconducting (SC) magnets is presented. The hardware includes a power supply (PS) with a PS controller and a Quench Protection Unit (QPU), a step motor, rotating shaft with a harmonic coil array with a motor controller, a multichannel data acquisition with a timer and a controller. The PS and the step motor controllers are linked to a personal computer (PC) via the CAN bus, the data acquisition/timer controllers are linked to the PC by the USB bus. The system operation is based on a synchronization of a multichannel delta-σ ADC with the PS and the step motor controllers. Such a mode provides a synchronization of a PS current and ADC during magnet energy loss measurements. During "cold" harmonic coil measurements such a mode provides integral number of samplings per one step allows storing the row measurement data to a local disk for an off-line analysis and permits to change an interval of integration. Inspection of linearity of dependence between the positions of the shaft and a number of steps of the step motor was done. All subsystems are programmed using the LabView software.

High temperature superconductor (HTS) cables can be promising for high field future accelerator magnets, solenoids of SMESs (Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storages) for accelerator magnets power systems, and fast cycling accelerator magnets with a warm magnetic yoke. The HTS cables should combine high endurance to cyclic mechanical loads, thermal stability, transport currents and engineering current density with low AC (alternating current) losses and convenient circulating cooling. NRC "Kurchatov Institute" has been developing HTS cables similar to the well-known CORC (Conductors on Round Core) concept over the past several years. This background allows the development of AC Conductor on Round Duct (AC CORD) cables for prospective fast cycling HTS accelerator magnets and HTS solenoids for SMESs. AC CORD cables (in a metal conduit, or impregnated) consist of many layers of 2nd generation HTS tapes wound helically onto round coolant ducts. AC CORD cables can combine satisfying values for all the required parameters simultaneously. The paper gives a draft concept of HTS SMES solenoid for the NICA (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility) accelerator - collider power system, the cables preliminary designs for this solenoid and for an HTS fast cycling "warm yoke" accelerator magnets. State of the art of our 1st generation HTS current leads development and production for the test facility of the NICA magnets, for booster synchrotron and collider is presented in the paper.

15T dipoles should be used in future colliders. A design a novel option of such a W&R niobium tin dipole is described. Main features of this dipole: 1. A gradated winding consists of four shells, wound with transposed conductors of equal height, but of different widths. The number of existing bronze Nb3Sn rectangular (1 x 2 mm2) wires in the conductors (31, 23,15 and 13) allows each of them to provide a operating current of 34 kA in the maximum local field of each shell. 2. Every shell cross section looks like ellipse, semi-major axes being normal to the median plane. This shape of the shells ensures homogeneity of the magnetic field in the 50 mm aperture. The ratio of the maximum field to the total linear current density is 13% greater than in the case of a dipole with circular cross section. 3. An inner banding is used in contrast with traditional collars. 4. The whole structure is bonded by a film adhesive VK-36, which rigidly fixes every turn at the plate and assures the absence of degradation and training of the winding. 5. The external dimensions of such a compact dipole are 170 x 260 mm, which makes it possible to place a pair of dipoles in a steel yoke with a diameter of 650-700 mm with a distance between the axes of dipoles of about 200 mm. 6. The option should be less expensive than traditional ones due to utilization of the existing bronze wires and grading the conductors. The latter saves 42% of niobium-tin wires.

The complex of measuring devices has been created in IHEP to study the characteristics of low-temperature superconductors for currents up to 20 kA. The current-voltage characteristics of short superconducting (SC) cable samples based on multifilament NB-Ti alloy superconductors, were measured. Critical currents were measured, depending on a temperature and a magnetic field up to 8 T. The equipment was designed for measuring the minimum quenching energy (MQE) of SC sample in the normal state. That allowed studying the stability of the material to a short-term heat production on a separate piece of wire that is part of the cable. The parameters of different designs of SC transformers for obtaining currents above 10 kA in the samples of partially stabilized SC cable coils of dipole and quadrupole magnets of accelerator storage complexes are given. The capabilities and limitations of different equipment options are compared.

With the development of RF superconducting accelerator field, research on thin film coated copper cavity becomes increasingly attentive. High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) is a kind of promising emerging PVD technique in comparison with dc magnetron sputtering already used on thin film coated copper cavities. In this post, the physical properties of niobium films condensed by traditional DC magnetron sputtering (DCMS) and by high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) are evaluated and compared. The DC superconductivity of films with these two techniques is similar and all transition temperature is 9.5 K. Further more, the microstructure of niobium films deposited by HiPIMS at 150 C belong to zone T in contrast to that by DCMS in zone I. From AFM results, the surface roughness by HiPIMS and DCMS is 3.92(±)0.14nm and 6.67(±)0.39nm individually. Adhesion strength is obtained by scratch tests and the films critical load Lc by HiPIMS is 5.53(±)0.93N and that by DCMS is 1.99(±)0.13N.

The possibility of production of the coils based on high-temperature superconductors (HTS) for accelerator applications is now under preliminary study in many accelerator centres and laboratories. The alternating magnetic field in these magnets causes an energy dissipation (AC losses). The accurate measurement of AC losses is important for a comparison choice among different HTS conductors and for estimations of the total level of losses into final magnet too. This article presents the measurement of transport AC losses (i.e. the losses in magnetic field which is generated by the alternating transport current) in HTS coils. Two model HTS coils with the racetrack geometry have been fabricated from 2nd generation HTS conductor supplied by two vendors. The measurement was performed by electrical method at the sinusoidal current with the amplitude up to 32 A and at the frequencies lain into interval from 5 up to 100 Hz. The measurement scheme and results are presented.

Magnetic poles of superconducting wigglers (SCWs) are passed through "training" phase during fabrication of SCWs at Budker INP. In "training" procedure magnetic field is increased until superconducting coils enter the resistive state. Quench Recording System (QRS) is used for registration of waveforms in each coils to determine fault initiator coil. The total number monitored coils reach 312. Outdated QRS is based on modules in CAMAC standard and requires modernization. The basis of the new system is VME64-BINP crate with multichannel digitizer ADCx32 and RIO-module for safe signal receiving in high-voltage common-mode environment. The structure and details of the new system, as well as the experience of using the old one are given in the report.

A superconducting or partially superconducting linac is discussed as new injector for Nuclotron-NICA complex. New linac will accelerate protons up to 25 MeV (and up to 50 MeV at the second stage of the project) and light ions to ~7.5 MeV/u. The progress in R&D of QWR and HWR superconducting cavities is discussed in this report. The design of QWR and its normal conducting copper model is finished and PTI NANB is ready to manufacture of the prototype. Two designs of HWR were discussed: one with a cylindrical central conductor and another with the conical one. The electrodynamics design of HWR had been finished before now but it should be corrected taking into account some manufacture problems. Current results of the development of the RF coupler and the test cryostat will also present .

The same accelerator will also be capable of accelerating light ions with proton currents and final energy of 0.66 mA and 600 MeV. TRIUMF designed the superconducting single spoke resonator for the linac SSR1 at 325 MHz for β=0.3. According to specifications the cavity will require the RF coupler to be capable for operation in CW regime close to full reflection with a forward power of 5 kW. This paper reports about the RF coupler specifications, simulations and design.

The first results of the powerful INR DTL RF channel testing with new modulator vacuum tube were discussed at RUPAC2016*. Unlike the former RF channel operation, the powerful 200 MHz pulse triode GI-71A was applied as modulator vacuum tube instead of GMI-44A, specially designed for INR DTL RF system in the 70s-80s of the last century. The main problem after modulator vacuum tube changing is that modulator vacuum tube GI-71A can't be closed by the series crowbar system in case of RF power amplifier breakdowns. At that a full discharge of the artificial forming line at the modulator vacuum tube plate takes place. It should be noted that the series crowbar system successfully operated for nearly ten years with vacuum tube GMI-44A, Over the past two years the tests were continued at the most powerful RF channels #2 and #3. At that, the work was developed in two directions - improvement of GI-71A vacuum by means of magnetic discharge pump installation and by inputting of nonlinear elements and corrective circuits, limiting overvoltage at the grid of GI-71A modulator vacuum tube.

In this study the model of a thin diaphragm in a rectangular waveguide is used to derive equations linking together the diaphragm's amplitude-phase characteristics. Additionally, an expression is obtained for the location of the closest to the diaphragm main reference plane on which the reflection coefficient is a real negative number, allowing us to determine amplitude-phase characteristics of the diaphragm. The model is confirmed experimentally. The study also shows that the main reference plane is located to the right of the diaphragm. Through adjustment of the location of the main reference plane characteristics of a thing diaphragm in a rectangular waveguide can be fully described.

A Radioisotope Centre of Nuclear Medicine for commercial production of radioisotopes is under construction now in Protvino. It is based on IBA (Belgium) Cyclone 70 proton cyclotron with proton energy up to 70 MeV and beam current up to 750 uA. The proton beam is split into two halves to provide simultaneous operation of two target stations. NRC KI - IHEP develops the design of the target station to produce nuclides Sr82 and Ge68 by the 70 MeV proton beam with current up to 375uA (2.3x1015 proton/s). The present work is devoted to selection of target station materials to minimize the induced radioactivity of equipment during isotopes production. The main source of this radioactivity is a flux of secondary neutrons cre-ated from proton-nuclear interactions with target materials. The nucleon-nucleus interactions and the transport of particles in substances were simulated by package of Monte Carlo codes HADR99 and FAN15 specially adapted for this task. Time dependence of the activity of nuclides accumulated in surrounding equipment and the effective dose rate after the end of bombardment (EOB) were calculated. Several alloys were considered and aluminum alloy AMg2 was chosen as most promising base material.

Global induced radioactivity levels on the main ring of proton 70 GeV accelerator (U-70) were estimated. Modeling results of induced radioactivity accumulation on the typical particle canal downstream internal target by Monte Carlo method are given. The wide set of various material specimens was espoused during one U-70 run in vicinity of internal target and specific radioactivity of identified long-lived nuclides was measured. Decay curves of ambient dose and specific radioactivity were calculated and analyzed for all activated specimens. Some fragments of U-70 equipment from radioactive waste storage also were investigated and specific radioactivity of their long-lived nuclides were measured. Unexpectedly 44Ti with 60 years half-life was identified in some cooper and stainless steel fragments. Production cross sections of 44Ti (and other nuclides) on copper were evaluated after irradiation by 50 GeV protons. These data can be used to provide radiation safety when working with radioactive elements of accelerator equipment, as well as storing and disposing of radioactive waste.

Methodical issues of the use of detectors (such as thermoluminescent detectors (TLD) and radiochromic films (EBT3)) for dosimetric support of radiobiological experiments in a beam of carbon nuclei at the radiobiological facility (RBS) of the U-70 accelerator are considered. Details of such characteristics of detectors as: dependence of sensitivity on dose value, loss of sensitivity and loss of information, dependence of sensitivity on the magnitude of LET radiation are studied in detail. The possibility of taking these factors into account to reduce the measurement error of dose is discussed, the possibility of using these detectors for dosimetry in radiotherapy procedures from the point of view of meeting the accuracy requirements to the therapeutic dose from the carbon nuclei is estimated

Recently started studies on the application of volume reflection of particles in crystals for the steering beams (for extraction and collimation of a circulating beam in accelerators). Volume reflection is more efficient than channeling, but requires amplification of the deflection angle by applying multicrystals. The report discusses two new applications of multicrystals made like multistripe structures: 1. The property of effective deflection of particle beam was used to protect the septum-magnets of the U-70 in the process of extraction of the proton beam with energy of 50 GeV. 2. The possibility of generation of gamma radiation was studied in the secondary electron beam with energy of 7 GeV. In both cases, promising preliminary data were obtained.

Over the past decade, there has been a significant update of the world's evaluated nuclear data libraries. The paper presents selected results of testing the current versions of these evaluated nuclear data libraries such as ENDF/B VII.1, ENDF/B VIII.0, ROSFOND, BROND 3.1, JENDL4.0u +, JENDL-4.0/HE, JENDL/HE 2007, CENDL 4.0, TENDL 2015, FENDL 3.0, JEFF 3.2 based on the integral experiments included in the Shielding Integral Benchmark Archive and Database (SINBAD) using the RTS&T* reference accuracy class code system. The RTS&T code uses continuous-energy nuclear and atomic evaluated data files to simulate of trajectories and discrete interactions of the particles in the energy range from thermal energy up to 20/150/3000 MeV. In current model development all data types provided by ENDF-6 format are takes account in the coupled multy-particle transport modeling. Universal data reading and preparation procedure allows to use various data file written in the ENDF-6 format. The ENDF data pre-processing (linearization, restoration of the resolved resonances, temperature dependent Doppler broadening of the cross sections and checking and correcting of angular distributions and Legendre coefficients for negative values are produced automatically with the PREPRO2017, NJOY2016, and GRUCON2017 code systems.
