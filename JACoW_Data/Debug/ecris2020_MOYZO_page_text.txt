Plasma instabilities limit the ECR Ion Sources performances in terms of flux of the extracted highly charged ions by causing beam ripple and unstable operation conditions. In a 14 GHz ECRIS (Atomki, Debrecen), the effect on the plasma instabilities in an Argon plasma at Two Close Frequencies heating scheme (the frequency gap is smaller than 1 GHz) has been explored. A special multi-diagnostic setup [1, 2] has been designed and implemented consisting of detectors for the simultaneous collection of plasma radio-self-emission and of high spatial resolution X-ray images in the 500 eV - 20 keV energy domain (using an X-ray pin-hole camera setup). We present the comparison of plasma structural changes as observed from X-ray images in single and double-frequency operations. The latter has been particularly correlated to the confinement and velocity anisotropy, also by considering results coming from numerical simulations.

High resolution spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy, by means of a X-ray pin-hole camera setup* ** operating in the 0.5-20 keV energy domain, is a very powerful method for ECRIS plasma structure evaluation. We present the setup installed at a 14 GHz ECRIS (ATOMKI, Debrecen), including a multi-layered collimator enabling measurements up to several hundreds of watts of RF pumping power and the achieved spatial and energy resolution (0.5 mm and 300 eV). Results coming by a new algorithm for analyzing Integrated (multi-events detection) and Photon-Counted images (single-event detection) to perform energy-resolved investigation will be described. The analysis permits to investigate High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) and spectrally resolved images, to study the effect of the axial and radial confinement (even separately), the plasma radius, the fluxes of deconfined electrons distinguishing fluorescence lines of the materials of the plasma chamber (Ti, Ta) from plasma (Ar) fluorescence lines. This method allows a detailed characterization of warm electrons, important for ionization, and to quantitatively estimate local plasma density and spectral temperature pixel-by-pixel.

Plasma instabilities complicate the operation of electron cyclotron resonance ion sources. In particular, quasi-periodic losses of electrons from confinement due to kinetic cyclotron instabilities hinder ion source performance. Empirical scaling laws help guide the development of sources away from the most unstable operating points but are poorly understood. Further advancement of ECR ion source technologies requires a deeper understanding of instabilities, scaling laws, and internal processes of the ion source plasma itself. We present here results of an experimental study into these instabilities and scaling laws, and measurements of hot electron diffusion (E > 10 keV) from the 18 GHz SUSI ECRIS at the NSCL. Measurements of the average argon current and the standard deviation of their variations across multiple unstable operating points are shown. These measurements are compared to measurements of electrons that diffuse axially from the plasma chamber. In doing so it will be shown how controlling the diffusion of electrons control the stability of the plasma and optimize the ion source’s performance.
