A new type of electron-ion beam overlap monitor has been developed for the RHIC electron lenses. Low energy electrons acquire high energies in small impact parameter Coulomb scattering collisions with relativistic ions. Such electrons can traverse thin vacuum windows and be conveniently detected in air. Counting rates are maximized to optimize beam overlap. Operational experience with the electron backscattering detectors during the 2015 p-p RHIC run will be presented. Other possible real-time non-invasive beam-diagnostic applications of high energy Coulomb-scattered electrons will be briefly discussed.

The technique presented in this paper enables the regulation of both radio frequency amplitude and phase in narrow band devices such as a Superconducting RF (SRF) cavity driven by constant power output devices i.e. magnetrons. The ability to use low cost high efficiency magnetrons for accelerator RF power systems, with tight vector regulation, presents a substantial cost savings in both construction and operating costs compared to current RF power system technology. An operating CW system at 2.45 GHz has been experimentally developed. Vector control of an injection locked magnetron has been extensively tested and characterized with a SRF cavity as the load. Amplitude dynamic range of 30 dB, amplitude stability of 0.3% r.m.s, and phase stability of 0.26 degrees r.m.s. has been demonstrated.

Two Bunch Shape Monitors (BSM) [1] have been developed, fabricated and assembled for the first direct longitudinal beam measurements at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) linear accelerator (linac). The BSM detectors use different radio frequencies for the deflecting field: first harmonic (201.25 MHz) and second harmonic (402.5 MHz) of fundamental accelerator radio frequency. The first BSM is designed to record the proton beam longitudinal phase distribution after the new RFQ accelerator at a beam energy of 750 keV with phase resolution of 1.0 degree and covering phase range of 180 degree at 201.25 MHz. The second BSM is installed between DTL tanks 3 and 4 of the LANSCE linac in order to scan both H+ and H− beams at a beam energy of 73 MeV with a phase resolution up to 0.5 degree in the phase range of 90 degree at 201.25 MHz. Preliminary results of bunch shape measurements for both beams under different beam gates (pulse length of 150 us, 1 Hz repetition rate, etc.) will be presented and compared high performance simulation results (HPSIM) [2].

Fast fiber-optic (FFO) beam loss monitors (BLMs) installed with the first two superconducting undulators (SCUs) in the Advanced Photon Source storage ring have proven to be a useful diagnostic for measuring deposited charge (energy) during rapid beam loss events. The first set of FFOBLMs were installed outside the cryostat of the short SCU, a 0.33-m long device, above and below the beam centerline. The second set are mounted with the first 1.1-m-long SCU within the cryostat, on the outboard and inboard sides of the vacuum chamber. The next 1.1-m-long SCU is scheduled to replace the short SCU later in 2016 and will be fitted with FFOBLMs in a manner similar to original 1.1-m device. The FFOBLMs were employed to set timing and voltage for the abort kicker (AK) system. The AK helps to prevent quenching of the SCUs during beam dumps* by directing the beam away from the SC magnet windings. The AK is triggered by the Machine Protection System (MPS). In cases when the AK fails to prevent quenching, the FFOBLMs show that losses often begin before detection by the MPS.
