Overview of High Energy e+e− Factories

Designs of e+e− colliders from the Z-pole and above are introduced. Two projects, CEPC and FCC-ee, are discussed. If we compare their schemes, a partial double ring (CEPC) and a full double ring (FCC-ee), find several important differences that affect the performance. On the other hand, there are a number of similarities in both designs, such as the crab-waist scheme, crossing angle, optimization of the dynamic aperture, etc.

After 5 years of upgrade work from KEKB, the Phase 1 beam commissioning of SuperKEKB started on Feb. 1st this year and finished at the end of June. In Phase 1, Belle-II detector and the final focus doublet (QCS) were not installed and no beam collision was performed. Missions of the commissioning in Phase 1 were startup of each hardware component, establishment of beam operation software tools, preparation of Belle-II detector, an optics study and tuning without QCS and the detector solenoid magnet and other machine studies. In this talk, achievements in the Phase 1 commissioning are summarized. Also a plan for the Phase 2 commissioning will be given.

Overview on Low Energy Collider

Electron positron colliders cover from low energy machine like Phi factory to very high energy one, Higgs factory, which is still in the way on developing. In this talk, several low energy colliders, DAΦNE as a Phi factory, BEPCII and VEPP-4M as tau-charm factories, and the proposed super charm-tau factories, will be reviewed. The performance and future plans are discussed.

The first synchrotron radiation was used in a so called parasitic mode from high energy machines (1st generation). At the end of the 1970s and the beginning of 1980s accelerators dedicated to the production of synchrotron radiation were built (2nd generations). With the investigation and developments of insertion devices in the middle of 1980, the 3rd generation synchrotron radiation sources were built and emittances down to some nmrad could be reached. At present around 50 Synchrotron Radiation sources are existing around the world. All of these sources reached there the specification (energy, current, emittance, beam stability, etc.) very soon after the commissioning. With the 4th generation, emittances of down to around 100 pmrad should be reached. This is still a factor of 10 away from the requirement of a diffraction limited light source. According to the expertise in designing and operating of synchrotron radiation sources this should be reachable in the future, but only with circumferences of some kilometers like Petra III or PEP-X. Overall the performances and perspective of synchrotron light source are remarkable.
