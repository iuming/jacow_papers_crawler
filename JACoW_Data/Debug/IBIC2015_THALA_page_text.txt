For newcomers, but also with interesting details for oldies, all components of a modern beam position measurement system are reviewed and explained. From specifications, sensor types, analogue and digital electronics over calibration methods the whole field will be covered. At the end some measurement examples will be shown and well as an outlook to upcoming research and developments.

Similar to other advanced third generation light sources, NSLS2 storage ring has stringent requirements on beam orbit stability. NSLS2 BPMs can be synchronously triggered to record turn by turn or fast acquisition 10kHz data. Spectrum of these data reveals various beam motion frequencies and it has been characterized at various machine conditions. Compared to the ground motion and utility system vibration spectra, beam motion introduced by the vibrations can be identified. An algorithm to locate possible noise sources from the measured spectrum has been developed. Preliminary results of locating orbit sources will be discussed in this paper as well.
