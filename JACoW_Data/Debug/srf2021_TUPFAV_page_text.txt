To overcome the nuclear waste problem, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been developing an accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS) since the late 1980s. In the JAEA-ADS proposal, an 800 MWth subcritical reactor is driven by a 30 MW cw proton linear accelerator (linac). The biggest challenges for the ADS machines are the high reliability and availability required for their operations. To this end, the present JAEA-ADS linac was redesigned by adopting the current developments in Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) technology. Additionally, we developed a robust lattice to control the beam loss and implemented a fault-tolerance scheme for the fast recovery of SRF cavity failures. This work presents the latest results of the R&D of the JAEA-ADS superconducting linac.

Eight SRF cavity modules, which have been operated in KEKB for more than ten years, are stably operating also in SuperKEKB. As for calibration of the cavity voltage Vc, non-negligible discrepancy was observed between the results obtained from two different methods: one is using external Q value (Qext) of pickup ports, and the other is using loaded Q value (QL) of the cavities. The discrepancy comes from inaccuracy of power measurement in high power RF system and uncertainty of the Qext or QL values. In order to solve the discrepancy by improving the accuracy of the calibration for each individual cavity, we investigated a method by measuring synchrotron frequency fs of stored beam. With this method, Vc calibration can be performed without affected by inaccuracy of high-power measurement or uncertainty of the Qext or QL values. The fs measurement studies were carried out in SuperKEKB. With these studies, Vc calibration was obtained with a high accuracy of about 1%. The results are applied to the SuperKEKB operation.

In STF at KEK, as the operational demonstration of the SRF accelerator for ILC, the STF-2 cryomodules (CM1+CM2a: one and half size CM with 12 cavities) have achieved 33 MV/m as average accelerating gradient with 7 cavities in Mar/2019. After that, one cavity with the lowest performance installed in CM2a was replaced with one N-infused cavity developed for High-Q/High-G R&D between Japan and US. From this April, the beam operation started again and those CMs achieved 33 MV/m as average accelerating gradient with 9 cavities including one N-infused cavity again. This is the very important milestone for ILC. In this report, the detailed results will be presented.

A new SRF cavity polishing facility which covers the needs for present projects like the HL-LHC and its CRAB cavities as well as ongoing and future activities in the frame of the FCC study was commissioned at CERN in 2019. This facility can handle chemical and electrochemical polishing baths, can process both niobium and copper-based cavities on a wide range of geometries, starting at 400 MHz up to 1.3 GHz for elliptical type of cavities and more complex shapes as defined by the DQW and RFD CRAB design. The main subassemblies of this facility are presented. Some important design details and materials choices of the facility will be briefly discussed together with the range of operational parameters. First results on different substrates and geometries are discussed in terms of surface finishing and polishing rate uniformity.

Shenzhen industrial synchrotron radiation source is a 3 GeV synchrotron radiation diffraction-limited source. It consists of three parts, linear accelerator, booster, and storage ring. As a basic part of the storage ring, the superconducting radio frequency system provides energy for the beam to supplement the beam power loss caused by synchrotron radiation and higher-order modes, and provide the longitudinal bunch for the electron beam. The superconducting radio frequency cavity of the storage ring consists of two 500 MHz single-cell cavities and a third harmonic 1500 MHz double-cell cavity. This paper will introduce the superconducting cavity, radio frequency amplifier, and low-level radio frequency system in the Shenzhen industrial synchrotron radiation source facility.
