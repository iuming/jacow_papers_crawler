THS2H1
Summary of Impedance Issues and Beam Instabilities
210


 

F. Zimmermann
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

Funding: This work was supported in part by the European Commission under the FP7 Capacities project EuCARD-2, grant agreement 312453.
This paper summarizes the session on impedance issues and beam instabilities at the ICFA workshop on future circular electron-positron factories "eeFACT2016" held at the Cockcroft Institute, Daresbury, from 24 to 27 October 2016. This session also covered active beam stabilization by feedback systems. Beam-beam effects and coherent beam-beam instabilities were addressed separately and, therefore, are not included here.

THS2H4
SRF Working Group Summary
223


 

R.A. Rimmer
                       JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA

 


 

Summary of Superconducting RF: This working group focused on the status and challenges of superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities and systems for present and future high luminosity lepton colliders, the so-called 'factories'. Submissions covered the state of the art of SRF cavity designs, HOM damping, high power couplers, operational experiences and the needs of future colliders. Active work on similar SRF systems for the electron complex of a future electron ion collider (EIC) was presented. Much of this technology is also useful for next generation high brightness light sources and other applications.
