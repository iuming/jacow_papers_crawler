Ion Beam Accelerators (IBA) centres have provided researchers with powerful techniques to analyse objects of cultural significance in a non-destructive and non-invasive manner. However, in some cases it is not feasible to remove an object from the field or museum and transport it to the laboratory. In this contributed talk, we present as a manner of a short review, examples of the benefits provided from these techniques in the study of material culture and discuss the initial steps to consider when investigating the feasibility of a compact accelerator that can be taken to sites of cultural significance for PIXE analysis. In particular, we consider the application of a compact, robust 2 MeV proton accelerator that can be taken into the field to perform PIXE measurements on rock art. We detail the main challenges and considerations for such a device.

Recent years have seen an increased interest in the use of helium for radiation therapy of cancer. Helium ions can be more precisely delivered to the tumour than protons or carbon ions, presently the only beams licensed for treatment, with a biological effectiveness between the two. The accelerator required for helium is considerably smaller than a standard carbon ion synchrotron. To exploit the potential of helium therapy and of other emerging particle therapy techniques, in the framework of the Next Ion Medical Machine Study (NIMMS) at CERN the design of a compact synchrotron optimised for acceleration of proton and helium beams has been investigated. The synchrotron is based on a new magnet design, profits from a novel injector linac, and can provide both slow and fast extraction for conventional and FLASH therapy. Production of mini-beams, and operation with multiple ions for imaging and treatment are also considered. This accelerator is intended to become the main element of a facility devoted to a programme of cancer research and treatment with proton and helium beams, to both cure patients and contribute to the assessment of helium beams as a new tool to fight cancer.

We report on the development of a 2.856 GHz accelerator system to provide energy modulation and RF-based steering for rapid 3-D beam scanning for proton therapy. Designs for the accelerator and deflector cavities have been modeled in ANSYS-HFSS and used to produce prototype structures. We present high power test results for a single cell energy modulator prototype and a three cell deflector prototype. Using General Particle Tracer, we simulate proton beam transport through the fully rendered accelerator and deflector beamline. System performance is optimized for the case of sub-relativistic protons with 230 MeV kinetic energy and covers an energy modulation range of ±30 MeV. We present simulated beam profile data after energy modulation and lateral steering, achieved using a combination of dynamic RF deflector cavities and static permanent magnet quadrupoles.
