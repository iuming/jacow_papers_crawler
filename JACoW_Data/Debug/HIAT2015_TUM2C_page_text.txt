The medical carbon synchrotron at maximal ion energy of 400 MeV/n was developed in JINR. The project goal is accumulation of the superconducting technology at construction of the carbon synchrotron with a circumference of 69.6 m on basis of the Nuclotron type magnet elements. For injection of the carbon ions it is proposed to use IH linac of C4+ at energy 4 MeV/n. The superconducting gantry is developed for patient treatment. The gantry consists of two 67.5° and one 90° bending sections, each including two similar dipole magnets of a low aperture (about 120 mm). Such gantries are intended for multiple raster scanning with a wide carbon beam and the technique of layer wise irradiation with a spread out Bragg peak of several mm.

We present first space charge simulation results of heavy-ion (HI) acceleration in the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) of J-PARC. RCS is a MW-class proton beam source for the Material and Life Science Facility and also an injector for the Main Ring (MR). RCS operates at 25 Hz where, injection and extraction energies of protons are 0.4 and 3 GeV, respectively. The importance of HI physics program in the J-PARC has been intensively discussed recently for studying so-called QCD phase structures at high baryon density by using slowly extracted HI beam of 1-20 AGeV in the MR. Although detail accelerator scheme has not yet been fixed, one possible way is to use RCS as an injector for the MR. However, a new HI injection system has to be constructed in the RCS. At this stage single turn injection of 238U85+ at around 60 MeV/u is considered. In this case, a smaller size ring accelerator in the upstream of RCS has to be constructed. The simulation results show that a more than 1011 ions per pulse can be accelerated in the RCS without any significant beam losses. That gives a total of around 4·1011 ions for each MR cycle and it sufficiently meets present experimental requirements.

As part of the Kanagawa "Challenge-10-year strategy to cancer" it was decided in March 2005 to establish a carbon-ion therapy system at the Kanagawa Cancer Center (KCC). From around 2009, the basic design and the foundational planning of the facility were considered and in January 2012 a contract was made with the Toshiba Corp. In December of the same year, construction of the main building for the acceleration and treatment devices has been started and completed in October 2014. Currently, the KCC is in a commissioning phase with the aim to start treatment in December this year. Various treatments for cancer, which include four present photon LINAC for the radiation therapy, will be provided to patients in cooperation with our cancer center hospital. In addition, we will combine a compact dissemination treatment system of carbon-ion therapy to the pencil beam 3D scanning technique designed by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS). The treatment experience with the carbon-ion scanning technique is expected to be the second in the country following NIRS. In this presentation, we will report on the progress of the beam commissioning of the scanning system.
