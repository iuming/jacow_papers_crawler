Scientific Opportunities for 4th Generation Storage Ring Light Sources

Funding: The Sirius project is funded by the Brazilian Federal Government via a contract with the Ministry of Science, Technology & Innovation
The new generation of storage ring light sources based on Multi-Bend Achromat (MBA) magnet lattice provides electron beams with size and divergence that match the phase space of the x-ray photons, approximating their so-called diffraction limit. The dramatic increase in brightness and transversely coherent photon flux from such improvement, combined with advances in mechatronics, optics, detectors, and computing, open new avenues of research within spatiotemporal scales previously inaccessible. This talk will present exciting scientific opportunities to explore the characteristics of biological, hierarchical, and condensed matter systems on these new light sources and particularly on Sirius, the new Brazilian 4th generation storage ring.

Once every decade or two, the Office of Nuclear Physics in the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science has embarked on building a new accelerator-based user facility to enable nuclear scientists to make discoveries. Following construction starts for CEBAF in the 1980’s and for RHIC in the 1990’s, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) project started in 2009 with the goal to build the most powerful superconducting heavy-ion linear accelerator. FRIB construction at Michigan State University is now 96% complete, the superconducing linac has been commissioned. FRIB is being managed to early completion in 2021 with user operation starting in early 2022. I will give an overview of the FRIB science and construction progress accomplished by a committed team delivering FRIB for a community of 1,400 scientists.

Women in Science: The Inconvenient Truth

Women are underrepresented in the areas of physics, mathematics, engineering and technology at all levels and the percentage of women decreases as advances and the career ladder. In the talk we present evidences of this phenomena, indicate the importance of the presence of women in all fields and we show some actions that help in construct the equity.
