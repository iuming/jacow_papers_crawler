The production in an efficient way of radioisotopes for medical use is crucial. With the closing in the next ten years of nuclear reactors the problem of the production of some of them is being critical. New approaches of producing these radioisotopes via accelerators are being developed. In the other hand a big effort is being made for making the accelerators for the production of radioisotopes more compact, efficient and with an optimized cost. This paper describes the recent advances in this kind of accelerator techniques.
