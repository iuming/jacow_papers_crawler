In AWAKE, long proton bunches propagate through a plasma, generating wakefields through the self-modulation instability (SMI). The phase velocity of these wakefields changes during the first 4 m of propagation and growth of the SMI, after which it stabilizes at the proton bunch velocity. This means that the ideal injection point for electrons to be accelerated is after 4 m into the plasma. Using the PIC code OSIRIS, we study how small changes in the initial proton bunch parameters (such as charge, radial and longitudinal bunch length, etc) to be expected in the experiment affect the phase velocity of the wakefields, primarily by looking at the difference in the phase of the wakefields at the point of injection (along the bunch and along the plasma) when changing these parameters by a small amount (±5%). We also look for the region of optimal acceleration/focusing for electron injection. Ultimately, it is found that small changes in the initial proton bunch parameters are not expected to significantly impact electron injection experiments in the future.

Progress Toward an Experiment at AWAKE*

The AWAKE experimental program is scheduled to start at the end of 2016. The aim of the first experiments is to detect and study the self-modulation instability (SMI) of the long proton bunch ~12cm in a plasma with wakefields of period of ~1.2mm. The occurrence of SMI results in the formation of a charge core surrounded by a halo in the time-integrated images of the proton bunch transverse profile. Transverse profiles are obtained from scintillator screens and from optical transition radiation (OTR). The OTR is time resolved using a ps-resolution streak camera to determine the start of the wakefields along the bunch on a slow time scale (~ns), i.e., the location of the seeding of the SMI generated by the ionizing laser pulse. The modulation period is measured using the faster time scale (~ps). Coherent transition radiation (CTR) is analyzed by a heterodyne system to also yield the modulation frequency. Later experiments will sample the wakefields generated by externally injecting low-energy (~15MeV) electrons expected to be accelerated to the GeV energy level over the 10m-long plasma. Progress toward the completion of the experimental set-up will be presented.

The Hamiltonian, which was composed of coasting, synchrotron and betatron motions, clarified the synchro-betatron resonant coupling mechanism in a storage ring*. The equation for the synchrotron motion was also obtained from the Hamiltonian. It shows that the so-called synchrotron oscillation is an oscillation around the revolution frequency as well as of the kinetic energy of the on-momentum particle. The detectable synchrotron oscillation is a horizontal oscillation on the laboratory frame.

New large scale accelerator facility called RAON is under design in Institute for Basic Science (IBS, Daejeon, Korea). Both technics of rare isotope production Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) and In-Flight Fragmentation (IF) will be combined within one facility for the first time to provide wide variety of rare isotope ion beams for nuclear physics experiments and applied research. Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) charge breeder will be used to prepare rare isotope ion beams produced by ISOL method for efficient acceleration. Beams of different rare isotopes will be charge-bred by an EBIS charge breeder to a charge-to-mass ratio (q/A) ≥ 1/4 and accelerated by linac post-accelerator to energies of 18.5 MeV/u. RAON EBIS charge breeder will provide the next step in the development of breeder technology by implementation of electron beam with current up to 3 A and utilization of wide (8') warm bore of 6 T superconducting solenoid. The design of RAON EBIS charge breeder and results of dumping of high power DC and pulsed electron beam into collector will be presented and discussed.

The last section of the normal conducting front end of the ESS accelerator is composed by a train of 5 DTL tanks. They accelerate the proton beam from 3.6 until 90 MeV. The evaluation of the radiation field around these beam elements gives a valuable piece of information to define the layout of the electronic devices to be installed in the surrounding tunnel area. Indeed the risk of SEE and long term damage has to be considered in order to max-imize the performance of the ESS accelerator and to avoid possible long down time. A conservative loss distribution is assumed and FLUKA results in term of neutrons and photon fluence are presented.

The AWAKE experiment will use a 400 GeV/c proton beam with a longitudinal bunch length of sigmqz = 12 cm to create and sustain GV/m plasma wakefields over 10 meters. A 12 cm long bunch can only drive strong wakefields in a plasma with npe = 7 x 1014 electrons/cm3 after the self-modulation instability (SMI) developed and microbunches formed, spaced at the plasma wavelength. The fields present during SMI focus and defocus the protons in the transverse plane. We show that by inserting two imaging screens downstream the plasma, we can measure the maximum defocusing angle of the defocused protons for plasma densities above npe = 5 x1014 electrons/cm3. Measuring maximum defocusing angles around 1 mrad indirectly proves that SMI developed successfully and that GV/m plasma wakefields were created. In this paper we present numerical studies on how and when the wakefields defocus protons in plasma, the expected measurement results of the two screen diagnostics and the physics we can deduce from it.

Plasma wakefields driven inside a hollow-channel plasma are significantly different from those driven in a homogeneous plasma. We investigate the scaling laws of the accelerating and focusing fields in the novel ''crunch-in'' regime [1] [2]. This regime is excited due to the collapse of the electron-rings from the channel walls onto the propagation axis of the energy-source in its wake. This regime is thus the non-linearly driven hollow channel, since the electron-ring displacement is of the order of the channel radius [3]. We present the properties of the coherent structures in the ''crunch-in'' regime where the channel radius is matched to the beam properties such that channel-edge to on-axis collapse time has a direct correspondence to the energy source intensity. We also investigate the physical mechanisms that underlie the ''crunch-in'' wakefields by tuning the channel radius. Using a theoretical framework and results from PIC simulations the possible applications of the ''crunch-in'' regime for acceleration of positron beams with collider-scale parameters is presented.

Argonne National Laboratory is developing a super-conducting resonator cryomodule for the acceleration of 2 mA H− beams from 2.1 to 10.3 MeV for Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory's Proton Improvement Plan II. The cryomodule contains 8 superconducting half-wave resonators operating at 162.500 MHz with a 120 kHz tuning window. This paper reviews the half-wave resonator fabrication techniques used to manipulate the resonant frequency to the design goal of 162.500 MHz at 2.0 K. This also determines the target frequency at select stages of resonator construction, which will be discussed and supported by measurements.
This research used resources of ANL's ATLAS facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility.

In order to realize and test advanced accelerator concepts and hardware, the existing beamline with both old and new components are being reconfigured in Linac Extension Area (LEA) of APS linac. Photo injector, which had been installed in the beginning of APS linac, will provide low emittance electron beam into the LEA. The thermionic RF gun beam for storage ring and photo-cathode RF gun beam for LEA will be operated though the LINAC in an interleaved fashion. In this presentation, technical issues as well as beam dynamics on the design for interleaving operation will be described.

Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structures (metallic and or dielectric) have been proposed for accelerators. These structures act like a filter, allowing RF field at some frequencies to be transmitted through, while rejecting RF fields in some (unwanted) frequency range. Additionally PBG structures are used to support selective field patterns (modes) in a resonator or waveguide. In this paper, we will report on the RF design and simulation results of an X-band PBG structure, including lattice optimization, to improve RF performance.

Impedance could represent a limitation of running high intensity beams in the Fermilab recycler. With high intensity upgrades foreseen, it is important to quantify the impedance. To do this, studies have been performed measuring the growth rate of presumably the resistive wall instability. The growth rates at varying intensities and chromaticities are shown. The measured growth rates are compared to ones calculated with the resistive wall impedance.

A CW-compatible, pulsed H− superconducting linac 'PIP-II' is being planned to upgrade Fermilab's injection complex. To validate the concept of the front-end of such a machine, a test accelerator (The PIP-II Injector Test, formerly known as "PXIE") is under construction. The warm part of this accelerator comprises a 10 mA DC 30 keV H− ion source, a 2m-long LEBT, a 2.1 MeV CW RFQ, and a 10-m long MEBT that is capable of creating a large variety of bunch structures. The paper will report on the installation of the RFQ and the first sections of the MEBT and related mechanical design considerations.

To provide 700 kW proton beams for neutrino production in the NuMI facility, we employ slip stacking in the Recycler with transfer to the Main Injector for recapture and acceleration. Slip stacking with 12 Booster batches per 1.33 sec cycle of the Main Injector has been implemented and extensive operation with 8 batches and 10 batches per MI cycle has been demonstrated. Operation in this mode since 2013 shows that loss localization is an essential component for long term operation. Beam loss in the Recycler will be localized in a collimation region with design capability for absorbing up to 2 kW of lost protons in a pair of 20-Ton collimators (absorbers). This system will employ a two stage collimation with a thin Mo scattering foil to define the bottom edge of both the injected and decelerated-for-slipping beams. Optimization and engineering design of the collimator components and radiation shielding are based on comprehensive MARS15 simulations predicting high collimation efficiency as well as tolerable levels of prompt and residual radiation. The system installation during the Fermilab 2016 facility shutdown will permit commissioning in the subsequent operating period.

Direct space-charge force shifts the incoherent tunes down from the coherent ones switching off Landau damping of coherent oscillations at high beam intensity. To restore it the nonlinear elements can be employed which move back tunes of large amplitude particles. In the present report we consider the possibility of creating a "nonlinear integrable optics" insertion in the Fermilab Recycler to host either octupoles or hollow electron lens for this purpose. For comparison we also consider the classic scheme with distributed octupole families. It is shown that for the Proton Improvement Plan II parameters the required nonlinear tuneshift can be created without destroying the dynamic aperture.

A two-stage collimation (2SC) system was installed in Fermilab Booster around 2004 and consists of 2 primary collimators (PrC), one for each of the horizontal and vertical planes and 3 secondary collimators (SC) each capable of acting in both planes. Presently, only SC are used as the single-stage collimation (1SC). Part of the Fermilab Proton Improvement Plan (PIP) includes a task to test 2SC for Booster operations. In this paper we describe preparatory steps to fix SC motion issues and installation of a 380μm thick aluminum foil PrC and post-processing software for beam orbit and beam loss measurements. The initial experimental results for 2SC in the vertical plane are also presented. The tuning of 2SC system was performed using fast loss monitors allowing much higher time-resolution than existing BLMs. Analysis of losses and beam transmission efficiency allow for the comparison of 1SC and 2SC schemes.

A two-stage beam collimation (2SC) system has been installed in the Fermilab Booster more than 10 years ago. It consists of two primary collimators (horizontal and vertical) and three 1.2m-long secondary collimators. The two-stage collimation has never been used in Booster operations due to uncontrolled beam orbit variations produced by radial cogging (it is required for beam accumulation in Recycler). Instead, only secondary collimators were used in the single-stage collimation (1SC). Recently introduced magnetic cogging resulted in orbit stabilization in the course of almost entire accelerating cycle and created a possibility for the 2SC. In this paper, the 2SC performance is evaluated and compared the 1SC. Several parameters characterizing collimation efficiency are calculated in order to compare both schemes. A combination of the MADX and MARS15 codes is used for proton tracking in the Booster with their scattering in collimators being accounted. The dependence of efficiency on the primary collimators foil thickness is presented. The efficiency dependence on the proton energy is also obtained for the optimal foil. The feasibility of the 2SC scheme for the Booster is discussed.

The Fermilab Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) was proposed to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and demonstrate leptonic CP violation. The current design of the facility that produces the neutrino beam (LBNF) uses magnetic horns to collect pions and a decay pipe to allow them to decay. In this paper, a design of a possible alternative for the conventional neutrino beam in LBNF is presented. In this design, an FFAG magnet beam line is used to collect the pions from the downstream face of a horn, bend them by  ∼ 5.8 degrees and then transport them in either a LBNF-like decay pipe, or a straight FODO beam line where they decay to produce neutrinos. Using neutrinos from this PIon beam Line (nuPIL) provides flavor-pure neutrino beams that can be well understood by implementing standard beam measurement technology. The neutrino flux and the resulting δCP sensitivity from the current version of nuPIL design are also presented in the paper.

The Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is presently carrying out an upgrade, ATF-II, which will provide significantly expanded experimental space and capabilities for its users. One of the new capabilities being integrated into the ATF-II program is an Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) beam line, which was originally deployed in the BNL Source Development Laboratory. Inclusion of the UED in the ATF-II research portfolio will enable ongoing development and extension of the UED capabilities for use in materials research. We discuss the design, installation and commissioning of the UED beam line at ATF-II as well as plans for future upgrades.

In the next decade the Fermilab Muon Campus will host two world class experiments dedicated to the search for signals of new physics. The Muon g-2 experiment will determine with unprecedented precision the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The Mu2e experiment will improve by four orders of magnitude the sensitivity on the search for the as-yet unobserved Charged Lepton Flavor Violation process of a neutrinoless conversion of a muon to an electron. In this paper, we will discuss the possibility for extending the Muon Campus capabilities for neutrino research. With the aid of numerical simulations, we estimate the number of produced neutrinos at various locations along the beamlines as well along the Small Baseline Neutrino Detector which faces one of the straight sections of the delivery ring. Finally, we discuss diagnostics required for realistic implementation of the experiment.

The acceleration efficiency of the recirculating RF linac was demonstrated by operating electron machines. The acceleration concept of recirculating proton beam was recently proposed and is currently under study. In this paper, we present a 6D lattice design and beam dynamics tracking for a two-pass recirculating proton linac from 150 MeV to 500 MeV, which is the first section of the three acceleration steps proposed earlier. Issues covered are optimization of simultaneous focusing of two beams passing the same structure and achromatic condition under space-charge potential.

We present an overview of the performance of the Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment-II (NDCX-II) accelerator at Berkeley Lab, and summarize recent studies of material properties created with nanosecond and millimeter-scale ion beam pulses. The scientific topics being explored include the dynamics of ion induced damage in materials, materials synthesis far from equilibrium, warm dense matter and intense beam-plasma physics. We summarize the improved accelerator performance, diagnostics and results of beam-induced irradiation of thin samples of, e.g., tin and silicon. Bunches with over 3x1010 ions, 1-mm radius, and 2-30 ns FWHM duration have been created. To achieve these short pulse durations and mm-scale focal spot radii, the 1.2 MeV He+ ion beam is neutralized in a drift compression section which removes the space charge defocusing effect during final compression and focusing. Quantitative comparison of detailed particle-in-cell simulations with the experiment play an important role in optimizing accelerator performance; these keep pace with the accelerator repetition rate of ~1/minute.

Large-scale numerical simulations are essential to the design of plasma-based accelerators and laser-plasma interations for ultra-high intensity (UHI) physics. The electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach is the method of choice for self-consistent simulations, as it is based on first principles, and captures all kinetic effects, and also scales easily (for uniform plasmas) to many cores on supercomputers. The standard PIC algorithm relies on second-order finite-difference discretizations of the Maxwell and Newton-Lorentz equations. We present here novel PIC formulations, based on the use of very high-order pseudo-spectral Maxwell solvers, which enable near-total elimination of the numerical Cherenkov instability and increased accuracy over the standard PIC method. We also discuss the latest implementations in the PIC modules Warp-PICSAR and FBPIC on the Intel Xeon Phi and GPU architectures. Examples of applications are summarized on the simulation of laser-plasma accelerators and high-harmonic generation with plasma mirrors.

Three novel ideas for wakefield acceleration (WFA) of electrons with metallic periodic subwavelength structures will be presented. The first idea is a deep corrugation structure for collinear WFA. A design for the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator is shown. An analytical model is developed and it agrees with the CST wakefield solver. A scaling study has been performed, and ways to increase the gradient will be discussed. The deep corrugation structure can generate a higher gradient than a dielectric tube with the same beam aperture when excited by the same bunch. The second idea is an elliptical structure for two-beam acceleration (TBA). The unit cell is an elliptical cavity, and the drive beam hole and the witness beam hole are located around the two focal points. The TBA process has been calculated and will be presented. The third idea is a metamaterial ‘wagon wheel' structure for a power extractor design. The fundamental mode is a TM mode with a negative group velocity. A power extractor at 11.7 GHz based on the structure can reach a GW power level when a train of 40 nC bunches with 1.3 GHz rep rate are sent in.

New computational tools are essential for accurate modeling and simulation of the next generation of muon-based accelerators. One of the crucial physics processes specific to muon accelerators that has not yet been simulated in detail is beam-induced plasma effect in liquid, solid, and gaseous absorbers. We report here on the progress of developing the required simulation tools and applying them to study the properties of plasma and its effects on the beam in muon ionization cooling channels.

Emittance exchange mediated by wedge absorbers is required for longitudinal ionization cooling and for final transverse emittance minimization for a muon collider. A wedge absorber within the MICE beam line could serve as a demonstration of the type of emittance exchange needed for 6-D cooling, including the configurations needed for muon colliders. Parameters for this test are explored in simulation and possible experimental configurations with simulated results are presented.

Cooled muon beams are essential to enable future Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider facilities. The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) aims to demonstrate muon beam cooling through ionization energy loss in material. A figure of merit for muon beam cooling in MICE is the transverse root-mean-square (RMS) emittance reduction and to measure this, the individual muon positions and momenta are reconstructed using two scintillating-fiber tracking detectors housed in spectrometer solenoid modules. The reconstructed positions and momenta before and after a low-Z absorbing material are then used for constructing the covariance matrix and measuring normalized transverse RMS emittance of MICE muon beam. However, RMS emittance is sensitive to nonlinear effects in beam optics. In this study, the direct measurement of phase-space density as an alternative approach to measuring the muon beam cooling using the novel Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method, is described.

COSY Infinity is an arbitrary-order beam dynamics simulation and analysis code. It uses high-order transfer maps of combinations of particle optical elements of arbitrary field configurations. New features have been developed and implemented in COSY to follow charged particles through matter. To study in detail the properties of muons passing through a material, the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map–Monte Carlo approach in which transfer map methods describe the average behavior of the particles including energy loss, and Monte Carlo methods are used to provide small corrections to the predictions of the transfer map, accounting for the stochastic nature of scattering and straggling of particles. This way the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects. The gains in speed simplify the optimization of muon cooling channels which are usually very computationally demanding. Progress on the development of the required algorithms is reported.

An Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) experiment with electrons is planned in the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) ring currently in construction at Fermilab. OSC requires timing the arrival of an electron and its radiation generated from the upstream pickup undulator into the downstream kicker undulator to a precision on the order of less than a fs. The interference of the pickup and kicker radiation suggests a way to diagnose the arrival time to the required precision.

A plasmon-assisted channeling acceleration can be realized with a large channel possibly in a nanometer scale. Carbon nanotubes are the most typical example of nano-channels that can confine a large amount of channeled particles and confined plasmon in a coupling condition. This paper presents theoretical and numerical study on the concept of the laser-driven surface-plasmon (SP) acceleration in a carbon nanotube (CNT) channel. Analytic description of the SP-assisted laser acceleration is detailed with practical acceleration parameters, in particular with specifications of a typical tabletop femto-second laser system. The maximally achievable acceleration gradients and energy gains within dephasing lengths and CNT lengths are discussed with respect to laser-incident angles and CNT-filling ratios.

We have been constructing a S-band RF-injector system for field-emission tests of a CNT-tip cathode. A pulsed S­band klystron is installed and fully commissioned with 5.5 MW peak power in a 2.5 micro­second pulse length and 1 Hz repetition rate. A single-cell RF­gun is designed to produce with 0.5 - ­ 1 pC electron bunches in a photo-emission mode within a 50 fs­ - 3 ps at 0.5-­ 1 MeV. The measured RF system jitters are within 1 % in magnitude and 0.2° in phase, which would induce 3.4 keV and 0.25 keV of energy jitters, corresponding to 80 fs and 5 fs of temporal jitters, respectively. Our PIC simulations indicate that the designed bunch compressor reduces the TOA­jitter by about an order of magnitude. Emission current and beam brightness of the field-emitted beam are improved by implanting CNT tips on the cathode surface, since they reduce the emission area, while providing high current emission. Once the system is completely commissioned in field-emission mode, the CNT-tip cathode will be tested in terms of klystron-power levels to map out its I-V characteristics under pulse emission condition.

There is a significant interest in developing high-average power electron sources, particularly those integrated with Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) accelerator systems. Even though there are examples of high-average-power electron sources, they are not compact, highly efficient, or available at a reasonable cost. Adapting the recent advances in SRF cavities, RF power sources, and innovative solutions for an SRF gun and cathode system, we have developed a design concept for a compact SRF high-average power electron linac. This design will produce electron beams with energies up to 10 MeV. In this paper, we present the design results of our cathode structure integrated with modified 9-cell accelerating structure.

Both the NuMI (Neutrinos and the Main Injector) beam line, that has been providing intense neutrino beams for several Fermilab experiments (MINOS, MINERVA, NOVA), and the newly proposed LBNF (Long Baseline Neutrino Facility) beam line, which plans to produce the highest power neutrino beam in the world for DUNE (the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment), need pulsed magnetic horns to focus the mesons that decay to produce the neutrinos. The high-current horn and stripline design has been evolving as NuMI reconfigures for higher beam power and to meet the needs of the future LBNF program. We evaluated the two existing high-current striplines for NuMI and NOvA at Fermilab by producing Electromagnetic simulations of the magnetic horns and the required high-current striplines. In this paper, we present the comparison of these two designs using the ANSYS Electric and ANSYS Maxwell 3D codes with special attention on the critical stress points. These results are being used to support the development of evolving horn stripline designs to handle increased electrical current and higher beam power for NuMI upgrades and for the LBNF experiment.

The brightness and intensity of a circulating proton beam now can be increased up to space charge limit by means of charge exchange injection or by an electron cooling but cannot be increased above this limit. Significantly higher brightness can be produced by means of the charge exchange injection with the space charge compensation [1]. The brightness of the space charge compensated beam is limited at low level by development of the electron-proton (e-p) instability [2]. Fortunately, e-p instability can be self-stabilized at a high beam density. A beam brightness booster (BBB) for significant increase of accumulated beam brightness is discussed. Accelerating system with a space charge compensation is proposed and described. The superintense beam production can be simplified by developing of nonlinear nearly integrable focusing system with broad spread of betatron tune and the broadband feedback system for e-p instability suppression .

The new experiment, under construction at Fermilab, to measure the muon magnetic moment anomaly, aims to reduce measurement uncertainty by a factor of four to 140 ppb. The required statistics depend on efficient production and delivery of the highly polarized muon beams from production target into the g-2 storage ring at the design "magic"-momentum of 3.094 GeV/c, with minimal pion and proton contamination. We have developed the simulation tools for the muon transport based on G4Beamline and BMAD, from the target station, through the pion decay line and delivery ring and into the storage ring, ending with detection of decay positrons. These simulation tools are being used for the optimization of the various beam line guide field parameters related to the muon capture efficiency, and the evaluation of systematic measurement uncertainties. We describe the details of the model and some key findings of the study.

Photonic band gap (PBG) structures have great potential in filtering higher order modes (HOMs) without perturbing the fundamental mode and in suppressing the wakefields. An efficient PBG structure would help a lot in terms of beam quality for high beam current future free-electron lasers (FEL). An improved design of X-band normal conducting PBG accelerating structure with elliptical rods will be presented. A comparison of cavity parameters between cylindrical and elliptical shape rod PBG structures will be shown. This new optimized PBG structure would be fabricated and tested at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) test facility. The status of the test will be reported.

Performance of radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) is sensitive to the errors in internal dimensions which shift resonance frequency and distort field distribution on the beam axis along the structure. The SNS RFQ has been retuned three times to compensate the deviations in frequency and field flatness with suspected dimensional changes since the start of the project for continuous operation with H− ion beams. SNS now has a new RFQ as a spare that is installed in beam test facility (BTF), a low energy test accelerator. In order to understand and predict the performance deviation, full 3D modeling and simulation were performed for the SNS RFQs. Field and frequency errors from hypothetical transverse vane perturbations, and vane erosion (and metal deposition such as Cesium introduced by the ion source operation) at the low energy ends are discussed.

Skew Parametric-resonance Ionization Cooling (Skew-PIC) is designed for the final 6D cooling of a high-luminosity muon collider. Tracking of muons in such a channel has been modeled in MAD-X in previous studies. However, the ionization cooling process has to be simulated with a code that can handle matter dominated beam lines. In this paper we present the simulation of a Skew-PIC channel using G4beamline. We implemented the required magnetic field components into G4beamline and compare the tracking of muons by the two different codes. We optimize the cooling channel and present the muon cooling effect in the Skew-PIC channel for the first time.

Highly resolved numerical simulations of the modulator, the first section of the proposed coherent electron cooling (CEC) device, have been performed using the code SPACE. The beam parameters for simulations are relevant to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Numerical convergence has been studied using various numbers of macro-particles and mesh refinements of computational domain. A good agreement of theory and simulations has been obtained for the case of stationary and moving ions in uniform electron clouds with realistic distribution of thermal velocities. The main result of the paper is the prediction of modulation processes for ions with reference and off-reference coordinates in realistic Gaussian electron bunches with quadrupole field.

Accelerator-driven compact neutron sources have been developed to conduct nondestructive inspection more conveniently and/or on the spot with lower cost than other neutron sources, such as spallation sources and nuclear reactors. In typical compact source, proton or deuteron are injected into Li or Be. To develop a higher flax source than conventional ones, we propose a source with 7Li beam generated by laser ion source using direct injection scheme (DPIS) into RFQ linac. Because of the higher velocity of center of mass than that in the case of proton beam injection, generated neutrons are more collimated. In addition, laser ion source with DPIS is expected to accelerate mA class fully ionized 7Li beam stably with simple setup, while it is difficult for conventional ion sources. The high collimation and high current are expected to lead to higher neutron flax. In this presentation, we present a design of RFQ linac optimized to accelerate such a high current beam with shorter distance.

A laser ion source (LIS) provides several types of singly charged ions into an electron beam ion source (EBIS) followed by linear accelerator injectors for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In the present set-up of the LIS, beam current shape varies with time drastically. It is expected that the present current shape is not optimal for the ion trap of the EBIS. However, there are no knobs to modify the shape flexibly. Therefore, as an upgrade of the LIS, we install a coil and a pulsed circuit* that generates a fast-rising pulsed magnetic field to tailor the beam current shape. In this presentation, the effect of the magnetic field on the beam profile from the LIS and the performance of the injectors, such as the transmission and the charge injected into an accelerator downstream, are described.

Proton Improvement Plan (PIP)-II is a proposed upgrade of existing proton accelerator complex at Fermilab. It is primarily based on construction of a superconducting (SC) linear accelerator (linac) that would be capable to operate in the continuous wave and pulsed modes. It will accelerate 2 mA H− ion beam up to 800 MeV. Among the various technical and beam optics issues associated with high beam power ion linacs, beam mismatch, uncontrolled beam losses, halo formation and potential element's failures are the most critical elements that largely affect performance and reliability of the linac. This paper reviews these issues in the framework of PIP-II SC linac and discusses experience accumulated in the course of this work.

The Center for Bright Beams (CBB) is a new National Science Foundation-supported Science and Technology Center. CBB's research goal is to increase the brightness of electron beams while reducing the cost and size of key technologies. To achieve this, it will augment the capabilities of accelerator physicists with those of physical chemists, materials scientists, condensed matter physicists, plasma physicists, and mathematicians. This approach has the potential to increase the brightness of electron sources through better photocathodes, the efficiency and gradient of SRF cavities through deeper understanding of superconducting compounds and their surfaces, and better understanding of beam storage and transport and the associated optics by using new mathematical techniques.
