The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility is currently engaged in the 12 GeV Upgrade Project. The goal of the 12 GeV Upgrade is a doubling of the available beam energy of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) from 6 GeV to 12 GeV. The increase in beam energy will largely be due to the addition of ten C100 cryomodules and the associated RF in the CEBAF linacs. These cryomodules are designed to deliver 100 MeV per cryomodule. Each C100 cryomodule contains a string of eight seven-cell, electro-polished, superconducting RF cavities. While an average performance of 100 MV is needed to achieve the overall 12 GeV beam energy goal, the actual performance goal for the cryomodules is an average energy gain of 108 MV to provide operational headroom. All ten of the C100 cryomodules are installed in the linac tunnels and are on schedule to be commissioned by September 2013. Commissioned performance has ranged from 104 MV to 118 MV. In May, 2012, a test of an early C100 achieved 108 MV with full beam loading. This paper will discuss the performance of the C100 cryomodules along with operational challenges and lessons learned for future designs.

While SRF research for linear colliders was focused on achieving high gradients, Cornell’s proposal for an energy recovery linac (ERL) demanded for low cw losses. Starting several years ago, a high-Q R&D phase was launched that led to remarkable results recently: A fully dressed cavity (7 cells, 1.3 GHz) with side-mounted input coupler and beamline HOM absorbers achieved a Q of 3.5·1010 ((16 MV/m, 1.8 K). This talk will review the staged approach we have chosen in testing a single cavity in a horizontal short cryomodule (HTC), report results on each step and conclude on our findings about preserving high Q from vertical testing. We also discuss the production of six additional cavities as we progress toward constructing a full 6-cavity cryomodule as a prototype for Cornell’s main linac module
