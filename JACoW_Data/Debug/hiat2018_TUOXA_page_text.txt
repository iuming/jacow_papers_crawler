Super-heavy-element factory is under construction at the Flerov Laboratory for Nuclear Reactions, JINR, Dubna. The factory will include DC-280 cyclotron, which will be equipped with two 100 kV high voltage platforms. A high charge state all-permanent magnet 14 GHz ECRIS ’ DECRIS-PM has been designed and fabricated to provide intense multiple charge state ion beams. The request for the source is a production of medium mass ions with A/q=4/7.5 such as 48Ca8+. The conceptual design of DECRIS-PM is presented. During the first tests at the ECR test bench, the source shows a good enough performance for the production of medium charge state ions (such as 900 eµA Ar8+, 550 eµA Ar9+, 200 eµA Ar11+, 160 eµA Kr15+, etc.).
