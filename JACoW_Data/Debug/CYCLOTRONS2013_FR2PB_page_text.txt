Construction of the Rare-RI Ring has been started in 2012 at RIKEN RI Beam Factory. This ring is an isochronous storage ring aiming at 1-ppm precision mass measurements for short-lived rare nuclei extremely far from stability line. The beam optics in the ring is defined by simply 24 bending magnets, and half of them are accompanied by ten trim coils to precisely optimize the isochronism of circulating beams. The momentum acceptance, in which the isochronous condition is satisfied within 1-ppm accuracy, is designed to be 1%. Of particular note is the development of the exceptionally-fast response kicker system, which is triggered by the produced RI beam itself to make effective use of extremely rare events. In this paper, we present details of the Rare-RI Ring, the status of the construction, and prospects of the project.

Concern over past and impending shortages of Tc-99m have led to renewed interest in the cyclotron production of Tc-99m - the most used radionuclide in Nuclear Medicine. TRIUMF has led a collaboration to implement the irradiation of Mo-100 solid targets on cyclotrons previously only used for the production of PET radionuclides. The technology and irradiation conditions that are critical parameters affecting the purity of the Tc-99m will be presented.
