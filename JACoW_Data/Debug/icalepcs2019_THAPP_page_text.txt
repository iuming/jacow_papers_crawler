In an environment of rapidly expanding and changing control systems, a solution geared towards the automation of application dependent Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) projects becomes an increasing need at the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser (EuXFEL). Through the standardization of components in the PLC Framework, it becomes feasible to develop tools in order to automate the generation of over 100 Beckhoff PLC Projects. The focus will be on the PLC Management System (PLCMS) tool developed to achieve this. Provided with an electrical diagram markup (EPLAN XML export), the PLCMS queries the database model populated from the PLC Framework. It captures integration parameters and compatible EtherCAT fieldbus hardware. Additionally, inter-device communication and interlocking processes are integrated into the PLC from a defined user template by the PLCMS. The solution provides a flexible and scalable means for automatic and expedited deployment for the PLC control systems. The PLCMS can be further enhanced by interfacing into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for complete asset management of both PLC software and connected hardware across the facility.

CEA IRFU Saclay* is taking part of ESS (European Spallation Source)** construction through several packages and, especially in the last three years on the Elliptical Cavity and Cryomodule Test stand Demonstrator (ECCTD)***. The project consists of RF test, conditioning, cryogenic cool-down and regulations of eight cryomodules with theirs four cavities each. For now, two medium beta cavities cryomodules have been successfully tested. This paper describes the context and the realization of the control system for cryogenic and RF processes, added to cavities tuning motorization relying on COTS solutions: Siemens PLC, EtherCAT Beckhoff modules, IOxOS fast acquisition cards and MRF timing cards.

In a part of the SPring-8 upgrade project, the SACLA linac will be used as the injector for the SPring-8 storage ring. We will upgrade the beam monitor system for beam transport, which consists of screen monitor (SCM), beam position monitor (BPM) and current monitor (CT). For the SCM, we adopted GigE Vision standard for the CCD camera and EtherCAT as a field bus for the stepper motor control of focusing system. We have developed camera control software using open source libraries to integrate various vendors’ GigE Vision cameras with the SPring-8 control framework. A grabbed image is stored into the file server and property, such as camera settings for image and event number, is stored into the database. The BPM is a key device for precise and stable injection. We adopted the commercially available MTCA.4 fast ADC/DAC module with modified firmware developed for readout of the BPM and the CT. We are developing acquisition software for MTCA.4 modules to synchronize with a beam trigger. The acquired data are stored into the database with time stamp and event number. We present the preparation of beam monitor control system for the beam transport to injection from SACLA to SPring-8.

IRFU* software control team is involved from feasibility studies to equipment deployment into many different experiments by their size and running time. For many years, IRFU is using PLC solution for controlling part of the experiment, and two different SCADA: - MUSCADE, in-house SCADA dedicated to small experiments. - EPICS** for big facilities. With MUSCADE, IRFU has developed a set of tools that gives an easy and a fast way for PLC developers to configure the SCADA. As EPICS projects are growing in our department, we are working now on adapting those tools to EPICS: - PLCParser, which generates an EPICS database for PLC communication (S7PLC, Modbus). - CAFEJava (Channel Access For EPICS Java) API, which runs a simulated EPICS IOC to test EPICS synoptic, and provides EPICS process variables access for any Java application. - Dxf2Opi, which converts Autocad DXF files into OPI files for CSS*** software. - MOONARCH (Memory Optimizer ON ARCHiver Appliance), which reduces EPICS Archiver Appliance**** data files storage.

FPGA based fast electronics to acquire and pre-process signals of detectors and diagnostics and PLC based hardware and software for motion, vacuum and other control and monitoring applications are key elements of the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser. In order to bring the newly developed scientific user facility up and running, the underlying electrical and electronic components require a diverse array of tools and processes to be developed in order to meet the continually adapting requirements and make use of technological advances. Many challenges were faced, including high availability and up-time, adaptability to a dynamic environment, rapid lead-time for integration of complex components, numerous instrumentation installations and commissioning, high time resolution and subsequently, high demands on data and sampling rates, synchronization and real-time processing. In this contribution we will provide an overview of the selected technologies, developed concepts and solutions along with generically designed frameworks and tools, which aim to provide a high degree of standardization on the control systems and even automatic generation from requirements to final install.

A multi modal set-up provides synchrotron radiation with a broad energy range of 80 eV - 10 keV and variable polarization to the EMIL lab at BESSY II. Two canted undulators, five end stations, three monochromators, more than twenty optical elements, sample to source distances of more than 60 m are challenges by its own. The Double Crystal Monochromator (DCM) feeding the U17 hard X-ray beamlines was designed and optimized for stability and resolution. The mechanical concept of the U17/DCM puts high demands on the software. For on-the-fly synchronization of crystal pitch, crystal translation and the cryogenic cooling system rotation, a closed loop feedback is needed to fulfill the control system requirements. Motion programs are used for compensation of the non-linearities of the pitch rotation. Target positions are approached on a well defined path improving reproducibility and positioning time. A non-linear closed loop control provides fine positioning. A setup of the motion controller based on the tpmac module provides the abstraction interface to the complex DCM motion control software. This paper discusses the DCM hardware, the software model and experimental verification.
