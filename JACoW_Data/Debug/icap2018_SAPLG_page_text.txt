High brightness/high intensity beams play an important role in accelerator based applications by driving x-ray free electron laser (FEL) radiation, producing spallation neutrons and neutrinos, and generating new particles in high energy colliders. In this paper, we report on recent advances in modeling the high brightness electron beam with application to the next generation FEL light sources and in modeling space-charge effects in high intensity proton accelerators.

Funding: Fermilab is operated by Fermi Research Alliance, LLC under Contract No. De-AC02-07CH11359 with the United States Department of Energy.
The Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility is being developed as a fully-equipped accelerator chain intended to support research and development of accelerator technology for the next generation of particle accelerators. The primary focus of this effort is the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) ring, which will be able to circulate either electrons with the energy of up to 150MeV, or 2.5MeV protons. The FAST electron injector is a state of the art superconducting RF linac capable of full ILC beam parameters and beam energy of up to 300MeV. The FAST accelerator science program focuses on high-intensity and high-brightness issues in the future machines for high-energy physics research. This talk will describe the facility design and status, review key beam physics experiments, and discuss the computational needs associated with the IOTA/FASt research.
