Automated tuning is an online optimization process. It can be faster and more efficient than manual tuning and can lead to better performance. Automated tuning is an online optimization process. It is more efficient than manual tuning and can lead to better performance. It may also substitute or improve upon model based methods. Noise tolerance is a fundamental challenge to online optimization algorithms. We discuss our experience in developing a high efficiency, noise-tolerant optimization algorithm, the RCDS method, and the successful application of the algorithm to various real-life accelerator problems. Experience with a few other online optimization algorithms are also discussed. A performance stabilizer and an interactive optimization GUI are presented.

The LCLS-II is a CW superconducting linac under construction to drive an X-ray FEL. The energy and timing stability requirements of the FEL drive the need for very high precision RF control. This paper summarize the design considerations and early demonstration of the performance of the components and system we developed.

To achieve the luminosity goals in a next generation linear collider, acceleration and preservation of ultra-low emittance particle beams is mission critical and requires a precise alignment between the main accelerator components. PACMAN is an innovative doctoral training program, hosted by CERN, with the goal of developing high accuracy metrology and alignment methods and tools to integrate those components in a standalone, automatic test bench. The method will be validated on CLIC components, a proposed Compact Linear Collider currently studied at CERN. The alignment between the electrical center of the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) and the magnetic center of the associated Main Beam Quadrupole (MBQ) is of particular importance to minimize the emittance blow-up, and therefore in the focus of the PACMAN project. The two components have been independently characterized on separated test benches by stretched and vibrating wire techniques. Preliminary conclusions are presented in this paper, with emphasis on the characterization of the electrical center of the BPM.
The PACMAN project is funded by the European Union' s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no. 606839

There are several new machines under construction or development at this moment. Some machines, (LCLS II and PIP II ) will operate with the relatively low beam currents and high cavity quality factors. SRF cavities for these projects will be operated with small RF bandwidths, meaning that they will be highly sensitive to microphonics and Lorentz force detuning. Other future projects such as ESS will be operate with SRF cavities tuned for larger RF bandwidth but will still have significant Lorentz Force Detuning. Work is ongoing at FNAL to develop active resonance stabilization techniques using fast piezoelectric tuners in support of PIP-II and LCLS II. These techniques as well as testing and development results using a prototype, dressed low-beta single-spoke cavity and 9-cell elliptical cavities will be presented along with an outlook for future efforts.
