Researchers concentrated on resistive random access memories (RRAMs) due to excellent scalability, high integration density, quick switching, etc*,**. Intrinsic physical phenomenon of RRAMs is resistive switching. In this work, ion beam irradiation was used as a tool to modify resistive switching of pulsed laser deposited (PLD) Y0.95Ca0.05MnO3/Si films. Ion irradiation induced optimal resistive switching with spectroscopic correlations has been attributed to oxygen vacancy gradient. Resistive switching ratio is estimated to be increased for the film irradiated with fluence 1×1011 ions/cm2 due to irradiation induced strain and oxygen vacancies verified by X’ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, atomic force microscopy (AFM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements. Strain relaxation and oxygen vacancy annihilation have been realized for higher fluence (1×1012 and 1×1013 ions/cm2) owing to local annealing effect. Present study suggests that the films understudy can be considered as emerging candidates for RRAMs.

We present a conceptual design for a new modular, accelerator-driven subcritical reactor based on a molten salt. Mu*STAR is a reactor, that without re-design, can burn a variety of nuclear fuels, with the beam tuned to that fuel. We will discuss the elements of this system: the accelerator, the reactor, the spallation target, and the fractional distillation to separate volatile fission products. Our GAIN project with ORNL is successfully completed, with a design of the Fuel Processing Plant that will convert spent nuclear fuel into the molten-salt fuel for Mu*STAR.

Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is a powerful tool for probing atomic dynamics with a femtosecond resolution. Such a spatiotemporal resolution requires error tolerance for the UED system which includes the RF system, the laser system, the beamline elements, etc. To characterize the error tolerance of the required spatiotemporal resolution for the 1.4-cell MeV UED we are developing, we use ASTRA to simulate the UED model with errors including initial transverse beam centroid offset, RF amplitude jitter and injection phase jitter, etc. By performing simulations with different errors omitted, we can characterize the contribution of each error and thus set the tolerance for each error to obtain the required performance of UED experiment. In the end, we present the error tolerance for 10% emittance growth and 100 fs time of flight variation to maintain the required spatiotemporal resolution.

The Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) produces several radioisotopes using a variable energy and current proton beam. The targets irradiated at BLIP are cooled by water and required to be isolated in a target capsule. During the design stage, thermal analysis of the target and cladding is carried out to determine the maximum beam power a target can handle during irradiation without destruction. In this work we designed a capsule for Gallium-Nickel (Ga 80%, Ni 20%) alloy target material and irradiated the target at the BLIP to produce the radioisotope Ge-68. Since no literature data is available on Ga4Ni’s thermal conductivity (K) and specific heat (C), measurements were carried out using thermal testing in conjunction with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Steady-state one dimensional heat conduction method was used to determine the thermal conductivity. Transient method was used to calculate the specific heat. The test setup with same methodologies can be used to assess other targets in the future. Here, we will detail these studies and discuss the improved design and fabrication of this target.
