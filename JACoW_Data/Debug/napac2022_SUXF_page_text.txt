Accelerator laboratories belong to the largest research investments to be found regardless laboratory, research institute or country funding the initiatives. This impose a great responsibility on the researchers and engineers developing, building and updating research facilities. Accelerator development are important research projects and will affect many stakeholders regardless if it is a smaller upgrade of an RF system or development of a large scale FEL. Wet developing new systems project management is a core competence for every laboratory. Yet this is a knowledge area often ignored in favor skill development in areas closer to physics and technology. This can be a very expensive mistake as the value of proper project management cannot be underestimated. This half day training will give you insight in the basics of projects. What is a project and what does project management mean. And how can this be adopted in accelerator development.
