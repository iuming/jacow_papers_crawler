Particles that are far from the core of a bunch are often lost in an uncontrolled way within an accelerator, and in high-current machines beam loss can quickly damage accelerator components or cause significant residual activation. We give a brief overview of the common sources of unwanted beam, including halo generated by nonlinear dynamics, dark current from field emission in the cavities, out-of-time scattered laser light on the cathode, and incompletely blocked laser pulses. The results of tracking simulations to model these effects in BERLinPro are discussed.
