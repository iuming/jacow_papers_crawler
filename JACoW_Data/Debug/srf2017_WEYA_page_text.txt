Superconducting cavities are attractive for light source storage rings both as main rf cavities and as harmonic cavities due to their compact size and relatively straightforward handling of higher order modes which are a serious technical issue in nearly all new ampere-class machines. A 1.4 GHz superconducting bunch lengthening cavity for the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade project and ancillary systems including a high-power cw variable coupler and beamline higher order mode damper have all been prototyped and tested.

This paper describes the development of a superconduct- ing quarter-wave resonator for use in an intense low-β-ion linear accelerator. The prototype cavity was fabricated from bulk Nb, inner cavity surface processing was per- formed, and vertical testing was carried out. In the vertical test, a Q-value of 8.7·108 was obtained with an operating field gradient of 4.5 MV/m at a frequency of 75.5 MHz. Here, we describe the results of the performance tests and various phenomena we experienced during the tests. After the vertical tests, the helium vessel was assembled and the prototype resonator was integrated into a cryomodule. Initial cooldown testing results are described. Performance testing of the cryomodule is continuing. The situation of upgrade of the RIKEN heavy-ion RIKEN Linac (RILAC) is also reported.

The superconducting linac booster for the HIE ISOLDE project, in operation at CERN, is based on NB/Cu coated Quarter Wave Resonators. The performance of the series cavities has been limited by defects in the copper substrates close to the EB weld. A novel cavity design has been developed and prototyped, in order to make it possible manufacturing of the resonators by machining them from the bulk, without any weld. The RF design was optimized for the customary figures of merit, and fully integrated in the HIE ISOLDE cryomodule. Mechanical tolerances were assessed in relation to the available range of pre tuning, and demonstrated on a dummy prototype. Beam dynamics simulations were carried out to check the effects on the beams when the new cavities will be installed in the high energy end of the linac. The presentation will cover the design and the first experimental results of the first Nb/Cu seamless QWR for HIE ISOLDE.

The recent SRF R&D efforts on TEM-type cavities at IHEP have been strongly linked to two large projects: high current proton linac for ADS and High Energy Photon Source (HEPS). A CW 10 MeV proton injector and part of the 25 MeV main linac for the CADS project are developed at IHEP. 14 SRF spoke012 cavities for the injector have been commissioned with 10.6mA proton beam at 10.67MeV; while 6 SRF spoke021 cavities for the main linac have been assembled into cryomodule in Lanzhou. 166.6 MHz quarter-wave β=1 cavities were proposed for HEPS storage ring, required by the planned on-axis beam accumulation injection scheme. Each 166.6 MHz cavity will be operated at 4 K providing 1.2 MV accelerating voltage and 145 kW of power to the electron beam. A proof-of-principle cavity has been manufactured and vertical tested recently with a success. HOM damping is currently being designed. The development progress of the 6 types of spoke, HWR, QWR cavities, and their ancillaries, as well as the spoke cavity performance during beam operation, will be addressed.

Argonne National Laboratory is implementing a novel 2.0 K superconducting cavity cryomodule operating at 162.5 MHz. This cryomodule is designed for the acceleration of 2 mA H-/proton beams from 2.1 to 10.3 MeV as part of the Fermilab Proton Improvement Project-II (PIP-II). The 2.0 K cryomodule is comprised of 8 half-wave cavities operated in the continuous wave mode with 8 superconducting magnets, one in front of each cavity. In this paper we will review recent cavity results which demonstrate continuous-wave operated cavities with low-field residual resistances of 2.5 nΩ which achieve peak surface fields up to 134 MV/m and 144 mT, electric and magnetic respectively, with field emission onset fields greater than 70 MV/m in the production cavities following the prototyping effort.

The elliptical twin-axis cavity is a new kind of superconducting cavity that consists of two parallel beam pipes, which can accelerate or decelerate two beams in two separate beam pipes. The new cavity geometry is intended to create a uniform accelerating or decelerating fields for both beams. The twin-axis cavity can offer advantages in low-energy ERL applications by allowing increased bunch charge while preserving emittance. A 1.5 GHz superconducting twin-axis cavity has been designed, developed, fabricated, and tested. Experimental results will be presented.
