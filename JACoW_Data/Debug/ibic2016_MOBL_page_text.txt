In 2011, an X-ray Free-Electron-Laser project was started in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL-XFEL). The construction of the PAL-XFEL was finished at the end of 2015, and the commissioning was started from April 2016. The electron beam energy of 10 GeV was achieved at the end of April and the bunch compression was tried in May. The undulator commissioning was started from June. During the commissioning process, various kinds of instruments were used for the beam parameter monitoring including beam position monitors, beam profile monitors, beam charge monitors, beam arrival-time monitors, and beam loss monitors. This work will introduce the PAL-XFEL diagnostic system which was used in the commissioning process.

The injector of the European XFEL is in operation since December 2015. It includes, beside the gun and the accelerating section, containing 1.3 and a 3.9 GHz accelerating module, a variety of standard diagnostics systems specially designed for this facility. With very few exceptions, all types of diagnostics systems are installed in the injector. Therefore the operation of the injector is served to validate and prove the diagnostics characteristics for the complete European XFEL. Most of the standard diagnostics has been available for the start of beam operation and showed the evidence of first beam along the beam line. In the following months the diagnostics has been optimized and used for improvements of beam quality. First operational experiences and results from the standard beam diagnostics in the injector of the European XFEL will be reported in this contribution.

This talk discusses the performance of the devices for higher than two dimensional emittance measurements, allowing studies of coupling between all transverse phase space planes, and in a more advanced set up, coupling to the longitudinal plane as well. The results of the actual phase space distribution (and not only RMS values) are very important for modeling the beam dynamics for high current operation of LINACs. Furthermore an outlook of related methods for electron beams is given.

Hardware and infrastructural requirements to measure chromaticity in the LHC were available since the beginning. However, the calculation of the chromaticity was mostly made offline. This gap was closed in 2015 by the development of a dedicated application for the LHC control room, which takes the measured data and produces estimates for the chromaticity values immediately online and allows to correct chroma and tune accordingly. This tool proved to be essential during commissioning as well as during every injection-phase of the LHC. It became particularly important during the intensity ramp-up with 25ns where good control of the chromaticity became crucial at injection. This paper describes the concepts and algorithms behind this tool, the experience gained as well as further plans for improvements.
