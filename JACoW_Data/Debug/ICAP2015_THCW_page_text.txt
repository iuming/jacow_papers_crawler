The photoemission based electron source allows producing electron beams with controlled temporal and spatial profiles, high current and high brightness. Its development is critical to future short-wavelength light sources. To accurately characterize electron beams generated by the source, the full EM emission modeling is carried out in a self-consistent manner. It takes into accounts the Schottky-like modulation of the cathode quantum efficiency (QE) as well as the relativistic effects during emission*,**. Specifically, a more realistic emission model is proposed to consider the QE dependence on cathode fields. In pulsed operation fast time transients characterize these fields. This leads to a time-dependent QE. Thus, the bunch temporal profile is not the same as the shape of the cathode laser pulse and should be corrected according to this model. As an application, the PITZ injector***,****offers an opportunity to validate the modeling scenario and simulations with measurement data. The emission is modeled as the QE-limited and SC-limited regimes by considering the total bunch charge as a function of laser energy. Simulation results are in good agreements with measurement data.

The roughness of a photocathode could lead to an additional uncorrelated divergence of the emitted electrons and therefore to an increased thermal emittance. The randomness of the real-life photocathode surface makes it unrealistic to perform typical beam dynamics simulation to study the roughness emittance growth. We develop a numerical simulation code based on the point spread function (PSF) and an estimated form of electric field distribution on an arbitrary gently undulating surface to deal with the problem. We also employ several tricks on initial samples generation and electric field generation to save cpu time and memory. The result of the numerical simulation seems reasonable and agrees well with the theoretical prediction based on a simplified model.

Paradigm complementary to conventional betatron matching is explored, with matching distributed across the entire line. This can have varying degrees of advantage depending on acuteness of issues in a conventional scheme: -Limited flexibility for matching section -Limit on envelope/magnet everywhere -Excessive envelope/magnet strength caused by matching -Harmful local blowup -Slow algorithm -Unpredictable solution -Lack of options/insight/control on implementation. Driven by above need, a betatron matching algorithm was developed suitable for any beamline configuration, including coupled 4D, providing deterministic, rigorous optimal solutions spanning complete tradeoff between mismatch and quad strength, thus allowing insight and control before implementation. It also shows promise of global optimum. Combined with distributed matching this algorithm promises additional advantages of speed, determinism and user flexibility in terms of degree of implementation, matching objective, and geographical profile of mismatch. Preliminary results, computational demands/challenges and possibilities for its extension into more complicated problems will be discussed.

A software platform for global optimization was developed to study the TRIUMF Energy Recovery Linac. The platform is parallel capable and allows for combinations of accelerator modeling tools such as MADX and Genesis. Many parameters are coupled, including RF parameters which are shared for all linac passes. The platform can study dynamic relationships between different processes, a practice not easily performed with standalone optimization. Tradeoffs are presented to give insights on how objectives are related and the repercussions of design decisions.
