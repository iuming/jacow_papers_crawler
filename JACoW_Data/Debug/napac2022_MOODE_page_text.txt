Applications of particle accelerators amid global policies of carbon neutrality and economic security. are reviewed. Downsizing of high energy large scaled accelerators by advanced technologies enables a variety of medical and industrial uses. One of the highlights is upgrade of sustainable supply chain of medical radioisotopes by the best mix of research reactors and accelerators. 99Mo/99mTc for diagnosis are going to be produced by low enriched U reactor and proton-cyclotron, electron rhodotron and electron linac. Moreover, the theranostics by 177Lu (beta) and 211At/225Ac (alpha) are going to be realized. Proton-cyclotron and electron linac are expected to produce them soon. This new affordable radiation therapy should play an important role in the IAEA project of Rays of Hopes. Next, proof-of-principle trails of on-site bridge inspection of the portable X-band (9.3 GHz) electron linac X-ray/neutron sources are under way. The technical guideline for the practical inspection is to be formed in a couple of years. Ultimate micro-accelerator for microbeam applications is dielectric laser accelerator, such as ACHIP project. Updated projects and results are also introduced.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is currently in the midst of several major upgrades: LCLS-II, LCLS-II-HE, and MEC-U. These upgrades will augment the facility with a 4 GeV continuous-wave superconducting electron accelerator (LCLS-II) that is subsequently extended to 8 GeV (LCLS-II-HE), and a PW-class laser system coupled to the X-ray laser (MEC-U). The science motivation, expected performance, technological drivers, and status will be presented. Future capabilities, beyond those enabled with the ongoing upgrades, will also be discussed.

The 13th International Particular Accelerator Conference 2022 (IPAC22) was held this June as an in-person event in Bangkok, Thailand. What happened, and what’s next? Great emphasis was given to its industrial session. Particle accelerators are at a crucial moment: innovation, ideas and know-how have to be shared between individuals both in lab-based- and university-based-STE (Science Technology and Engineering) and industry. Bridges have to be built to improve high technology products and to identify new products and markets. The Industrial Session discussed about novel ideas and concrete actions on how best to implement and apply impactful strategies that would help with integration and co-innovation between industry, laboratories and universities, with the clear and shared aim: building a global, collaborative accelerator economy.

In this presentation, we will review the current experiments done by various research group over the world on Laser assisted particle acceleration (BELLA, DESY, Weizmann…). We will spend a bit of time on the description of the laser technologies used for this. What are the specifications required for such laser, their footprint and their future development.
