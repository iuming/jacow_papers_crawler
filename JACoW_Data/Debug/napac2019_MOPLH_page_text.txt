In high current DC gun, GaAs photocathode lifetime is limited by the ion back-bombardment. While gun operation ions are generated and accelerate back towards the cathode thus remove the activation layer’s material Cesium from the photocathode surface. We have developed an object-oriented code to simulate the ion generation due to dynamic gas pressure and ion trace in the electromagnetic field. The pressure profile varies from cathode position towards the transfer line behind the anode, which signifies the importance of dynamic simulation for ion back-bombardment study. In our surface damage study, we traced the energy and position of the ions on the photocathode surface and performed the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter(SRIM) simulation to count the number of Cesium atoms removed from the surface due to single bunch impact. Cesium atom removal is directly related to the photocathode Quantum Efficiency(QE) decay. Our new dynamic simulation code can be used in any DC gun to study ion back-bombardment. We have used this new code to better understand the ion generation in prototype BNL 350 KV DC gun, and we have also estimated the normalized QE decay due to ion back-bombardment.

A new ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) instrument is being developed by UCLA-Colorado University collaboration for the STROBE NSF Center with the goal of using electron and EUV photon beams to reveal the structural dynamics of materials in non-equilibrium states at fundamental atomic and temporal scales. This paper describes the design of the electron beamline of this instrument. In order to minimize the initial emittance, a nanotip photocathode, 25 nm in radius, will be used. This requires a redesign of the cathode and anode components of the electron gun to allow for the tip to be properly aligned. Solenoidal lenses are used to focus the beam transversely to a sub-micron spot at the sample and a radiofrequency (RF) cavity, driven by a continuous wave S-band RF source, longitudinally compresses the beam to below 100 fs, required for atomic resolution.

Nitrogen incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond ((N)UNCD) is promising for photocathode applications due to its high quantum efficiency (QE). The mean transverse energy (MTE) which, along with QE, defines the brightness of the emitted electron beam must be thoroughly characterized and understood for (N)UNCD. Our previous work* further corroborated the important role of graphitic grain boundaries (GB’s). UNCD consists of diamond (sp3-hybrized) grains and graphitic (sp2-hybrized) GB’s: GB’s are behind the high emissivity of (N)UNCD and therefore play a crucial role in defining and controlling the MTE. In this work, the MTE of two different (N)UNCD samples having different ratios of sp3/sp2 were measured versus the primary photon energies. As a reference, MTE of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG, canonical sp2-hybrized graphite) was also measured.

Tests were performed at SNS in collaboration with visiting colleagues from ISIS, UK to evaluate the uncesiated beam performance of the SNS RF H− ion sources. Two spare experimental sources, one with internal antenna and one with external antenna were used for the tests. The beam currents achieved with Cs-free operations accounted for about 1/3 to 1/2 of the beam currents produced with cesiated operations. ~17 mA uncesiated H− current was demonstrated within the tested RF power range up to 65 kW with the internal antenna source and ~15 mA with up to 40 kW RF with the external antenna source. In Cs-free operations, the power supply for the electron dumping electrode was loaded down below its set voltage but was not too drastic to tamper the operation.

Alkali-antimonide photocathodes have a very high quantum efficiency and a low intrinsic emittance, making them excellent electron sources for Energy Recovery Linacs, X-ray Free Electron Lasers, Electron Cooling, and Ultrafast Electron Diffraction applications. Despite numerous studies of their photoemission spectra, there has been nearly no conclusive experimental investigation of their basic electronic and optical properties (e.g. band gap, electron affinity, optical constants, etc.), which determine the nature of photoemission. Therefore, the systematic study and deep understanding of fundamental characteristics of alkali-antimonide photocathodes are required in order to develop next-generation electron sources with improved crystal and electronic structures to fit specific application. Here we report on the development of an experimental setup to measure photoluminescence (PL) spectra from alkali-antimonide photocathodes, enabling estimation of a material band gap and defect state energies, and provide preliminary results for Cs3Sb films.

We present simulations and experimental progress toward the development of a high-current electron source with the potential to deliver high charge electron bunches at GHz-level repetition rates. To achieve these goals electrons are generated through field-emission and the cathode is immersed in a conduction-cooled superconducting 650-MHz RF cavity. The field-emitters consist of microscopic silicon pyramids and have a typical enhancement factor of about 500. To trigger field-emission, the peak field inside the RF cavity of about 6 MV/m is further enhanced by placing the field-emitters on the top of a superconducting Nb rod inserted in the RF cavity. So far, we cannot control the duration of the electron bunches which is of the order of RF period. Also, the present cryo-cooler power of about 2 W limits the beam current to microamp level.

We present progress on incorporation of nanopillar arrays into spin-polarized gallium arsenide photocathodes in pursuit of record high tolerance to ion back-bombardment. Our goal is to exceed the 400 Coulomb record for a high polarization milliampere-class electron source set at Jefferson Laboratory in 2017, while maintaining high quantum efficiency (QE) and spin polarization with a superlattice. Because the Mie effect is resonant, uniformity and careful control over nanostructure geometry is key. We report excellent uniformity and straight sidewall geometry with improved optical absorption using a painstakingly optimized inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etch. We also report the application of Kerker theory to spin-polarized photocathode nanopillar arrays, setting new requirements on nanostructure dimensions to avoid spoiling spin polarization. Finally, we also report initial steps toward re-establishing U.S. production of strained superlattice photocathodes towards integration with nanopillar arrays.

This work presents the development of the STARRE Lab, a facility at MIT for testing breakdown in high gradient accelerator structures at 110 GHz. The system utilizes a Laser-Driven Semiconductor Switch (LDSS) to modulate the output of a megawatt gyrotron, which generates 3 μs pulses at up to 6 Hz. The LDSS employs silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafers to produce nanosecond-scale pulses at the megawatt level from the gyrotron output. Photoconductivity is induced in the wafers using a 532 nm Nd:YAG laser, which produces 6 ns, 230 mJ pulses. A single Si wafer produces 110 GHz RF pulses with 9 ns width, while under the same conditions, a single GaAs wafer produces 24 ns 110 GHz RF pulses. In dual-wafer operation, which uses two active wafers, pulses of variable length down to 3 ns duration can be created at power levels greater than 300 kW. The switch has been successfully tested at incident 110 GHz RF power levels up to 720 kW.* The facility has been used to successfully test an advanced 110 GHz accelerator structure built by SLAC to gradients in excess of 220 MV/m.

Alkali antimonides photocathodes are a popular choice of electron source for high average brightness beams, due to their high quantum efficiency (QE) and low mean transverse energy (MTE). This paper describes the first measurements of their nonlinear photoemission properties under sub-ps laser illumination. These measurements include wavelength-resolved power dependence, pulse length dependence, and temporal response. The transition between linear and nonlinear photoemission is observed through the wavelength-resolved scan, and implications of nonlinear photoemission are discussed.

Femtosecond laser microfabrication allows for precise dimension control and reduced thermal stress of the machined materials. It can be applied to a wide range of materials from copper to diamond. Combined with secondary operations like polishing laser microfabrication can be utilized in various state of the art components required for AAC community. In this paper we will review several applications of laser microfabrication for Advanced Accelerator research and development. These will include wakefield structures (corrugated metal and dielectric loaded), plasma capillaries, x-ray refractive optics, high power laser optical components: mirrors, phase plates.

Operational lifetime of GaAs photocathodes is the primary limit for applications as high current spin polarized electron sources in future nuclear physics facilities, such as Electron Ion Collider. Recently, ultrathin Cs2Te on GaAs has shown a successful negative electron affinity (NEA) activation with an improved lifetime by a factor of 5 *. In this work, we report activation of GaAs with Cs, Sb and oxygen. Four different methods of introducing oxygen during the growth was investigated. Cs-Sb-O activated GaAs has shown up to a factor of 40 and 13 improvement in charge extraction lifetime and dark lifetime, respectively.

The development of robust and portable high-average power electron sources is key to many societal applications. An approach toward such sources is the use of cryogen-free superconducting radiofrequency cavities. This paper presents beam-dynamics simulations for a proof-of-principle experiment on a cryogen-free SRF electron source being prototyped at Fermilab. The proposed design implement a geometry that enhances the electric field at the cathode surface to simultaneously extract and accelerate electrons. In this paper, we explore the beam dynamics considering both the case of field and photoemission mechanism.

We present experimental studies of metamaterial (MTM) structures for wakefield acceleration. The MTM structure is an all-metal periodic structure with its period much smaller than the wavelength at X-band. The fundamental TM mode has a negative group velocity, so an electron beam traveling through the structure radiates by reversed Cherenkov radiation. Two experiments have been completed at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA), namely the Stage-I and Stage-II experiments. Differences between the two experiments include: (1) Structure length (Stage-I 8 cm, Stage-II 20 cm); (2) Bunch number used to excite the structure (Stage-I up to 2 bunches, Stage-II up to 8 bunches). In the Stage-I experiment, two bunches with a total charge of 85 nC generated 80 MW of RF power in a 2 ns long pulse. In the Stage-II experiment, the highest peak power reached 380 MW in a 10 ns long pulse from a train of 8 bunches with a total charge of 224 nC. Acceleration of a witness bunch has not been demonstrated yet, but the extracted power can be transferred to a separate accelerator for two-beam acceleration or directly applied to a trailing witness bunch in the same structure for collinear acceleration.

Low effective mass semiconductor photocathodes have historically failed to exhibit the sub-thermal mean transverse energies (MTEs) expected of them based on their band structure. However, conservation of transverse momentum across the vacuum interface, and therefore a low MTE in these materials, has been observed in time resolved ARPES*. To help bridge this gap, we measured the MTE of the pump probe photoemitted electrons seen in the ARPES experiment using methods typical of accelerator physics. We compare the results of these measurements with those of both communities and discuss them in the context of photoemission physics.

We present the simulations and test results for focusing studies performed on diamond field emitter array cathodes. This design utilized a simple variable-focus solenoidal lens in conjunction with a scanning wire technique in order to measure the beam spot size. The spot size was measured by scanning a thin copper wire across the beam in 1 µm increments, with voltage being measured and averaged at each location in order to map the location and intensity of the beam. Scans were taken at different distances away from the magnetic center of the lens, and show good agreement with our simulations of the beam. Ultimately this has allowed us to focus the beam to a spot size of 5.72 µm with an average current of 15.78 µA.

For positron studies in plasma wakefield accelerators such as AWAKE, the development of new, cheaper, and compact positron beam sources is necessary. Using an electrostatic trap with parameters similar to other experiments, this paper explores converting that trapped positron plasma into a usable beam. Bunching is initially accomplished by an electrostatic buncher and the beam is accelerated to 148 keV by pulsed electrostatic accelerators. This is necessary for injection into the beta-matched rf cavities operating at 600 MHz, which bring the positron beam to a transverse emittance of 1.3 pi mrad mm, a longitudinal emittance of 93.3 pi keV mm, stdz of 1.85 mm and an energy of 22 MeV. The beamline used here is far simpler and less expensive than those at many facilities, such as SLAC, allowing for a cheap source of positron beams, potentially opening up positron beam studies to many facilities that could not previously afford such a source.

A better understanding of the properties of photocathode materials can be achieved by integrating advanced growth and surface science techniques in their synthesis and analysis. This is a main research theme of the Center for Bright Beams, whose goal is increasing the brightness of linear electron accelerators. Alkali antimonides are efficient photocathode materials and have very low intrinsic emittance at cryogenic temperatures.* A limiting factors is the surface roughness and chemical inhomogeneity of the films.** We studied the influence of growth parameters on the morphology and composition of Cs3Sb thin films. The films are codeposited using pure element sources and transferred via UHV suitcase to a STM/XPS analysis chamber, to study in particular the influence of substrate temperature and material. This platform can be expanded to more analysis and growth systems thanks to a specially designed sample holder and suitcase. An example is a new cryogenic instrument for intrinsic emittance measurements.

Nanocrystalline diamond is a promising material for electron emission applications, as it combines robustness of diamond and ability to easily conform to a pre-defined shape, even at nano-scale. However, its electron emission properties are yet to be fully understood. Recently, we started to investigate femtosecond-laser-induced strong-field photoemission from nanocrystalline diamond field emitters with very sharp (~10 nm apex) tips. Initial results show that the mechanism of electron emission at ~1010 W/cm2 light intensities in the near UV to near IR range is more complex than in metals. We present our latest experimental results obtained at Stanford University, while LANL’s strong-field photoemission test stand is being commissioned. We show that strong-field photoemission occurs not only at the nano-tip’s apex, but also on flat diamond surfaces (e.g., pyramid sides), that is why extra care needs to be taken to differentiate between emission spots on the chip. Qualitatively, we discuss the models that explain the observed dependences of electron emission on the optical power, polarization of the light, etc.

A compact wakefield accelerator is being developed at the Argonne National Laboratory for a future multiuser x-ray free electron laser facility. A cylindrical structure with a 2 mm internal diameter and fine corrugations on the wall will be used to create Čerenkov radiation. A "drive" bunch producing radiation at 180 GHz will create accelerating gradients on the order of 100 MV/m for the "witness" bunch. The corrugated structure will be approximately half meter long with the entire accelerator spanning a few tens of meters. An ultra-compact transition region between each corrugated structure has been designed to accommodate an output coupler, a notch filter, an integrated offset monitor, bellows, pumping and water cooling ports. The output coupler will extract on the order of a kilowatt of power from the Čerenkov radiation unused by the witness bunch. The integrated offset monitor is a novel diagnostic which will measure the cumulative offset of the electron beam in the corrugated structure upstream of the monitor. The specific details of the rf design will be presented here.

Short-pulse two-beam acceleration (SP-TBA) is an advanced acceleration concept that can potentially meet the luminosity and cost requirements in future linear colliders and XFELs. In this concept, a high charge drive beam travelling through a structure excites short wakefield field (<20 ns) which is used to accelerate a low charge main beam in a parallel structure. A SP-TBA program is under development at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility where 300 MW generated power, 150 MeV/m acceleration gradient, and simplified staging have been successfully achieved. Based on the ongoing effort of novel dielectric disk structure, fast kicker/septum, and improved beam quality, a fully-functional demonstrator that can fit into AWA’s current bunker is proposed to demonstrate key technologies required by SP-TBA based machines: GW power generation, >250 MV/m acceleration, drive beam distribution/transportation, successive main beam acceleration, etc. The 70 MeV drive beam will be decelerated by four power extractors in two stages so as to boost the main beam energy from 15 MeV to 500 MeV by the four corresponding accelerators. The conceptual design will be presented in detail.
