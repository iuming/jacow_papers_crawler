The DAΦNE Legacy to Future Colliders

25 years ago the first beam was stored in the DAΦNE electron-positron collider working at the energy of Phi resonance (1.02 GeV c.m.). Since then much efforts have been dedicated to obtain the luminosity substantially higher than that ever achieved at the colliders operated in this energy range and to provide data for several experimental detectors aimed at studying the high energy and nuclear physics. Careful beam optics modeling and nonlinear dynamics studies, design of the low impedance vacuum chamber, suppression of a variety of beam instabilities and investigation of beam-beam interaction have helped to reach the impressive result. Several novel ideas in the accelerator physics have been proposed and/or tested at DAΦNE for the first time. In particular, the Crab waist concept originally proposed and then tested at Frascati has been already successfully applied in SuperKEKB and now it is considered for implementation in the future electron-positron factories. In this paper we discuss the relevant advanced accelerator studies performed at DAΦNE which can be also of some interest to other circular colliders.

SuperKEKB Luminosity Quest

The SuperKEKB accelerator is a positron-electron collider with a nano-beam scheme and continues to achieve the world’s highest luminosity for the production of B meson pairs. The luminosity performance has been improved by the full-scale adoption of the crab-waist scheme. The nano-beam scheme allows the vertical beta function at the interaction point to be much smaller than the bunch length. The vertical beta function and the beam size at the collision point are the smallest in the world among colliders. As the result, the peak luminosity of 4.65 x 1034 cm-2 s-1 has been achieved with the Belle II detector in 2022. Recent progress will be presented, and then the problems and issues to be overcome from the beam physics point of view will be discussed for further improvement of luminosity performance in the future.

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) ’’integrated programme’’ consists of a proposed high-luminosity e+e− collider, FCC-ee, serving as Higgs and electroweak factory, which would, in a second stage, be succeeded by a 100 TeV hadron collider, FCC-hh. FCC-ee and FCC-hh share the same 91 km tunnel and technical infrastructure. In summer 2021 a detailed FCC Feasibility Study (FCC FC), focused on siting, tunnel construction, environmental impact, financing, operational organisation, etc., was launched by the CERN Council. This FCC Feasibility Study (FCC FS) should provide the necessary input to the next European Strategy Update expected in 2026/27. In this paper we briefly review the FCC key design features, status and plans. This paper is an updated, slightly modified version of an article submitted to the proceedings of NA-PAC’22 (published under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license). Sections on two planned accelerator mock-ups and on regional activities were taken from an article in the ECFA Newsletter.

The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) was proposed in the year of 2012, shortly after the observation of Higgs boson. After years of pre-studies, the CEPC study group has completed the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) in 2018. Since then a series of key technology R&D was carried out, and the accelerator design has been kept optimizing as well. The accelerator design can meet the scientific objectives by allowing the operation in dif-ferent energies for W/Z, Higgs and ttbar with high lumi-nosities. Key technologies required for the mass produc-tion have been developed, such as the superconducting accelerating cavities, high efficiency RF power source, magnets and vacuum systems etc. The accelerator Tech-nical Design Report (TDR) is scheduled to be finished in the cross period of 2022-2023. All of the key technology R&D accomplishments will presented and the optimized accelerator parameters will be updated in it.

The main findings of the Implementation Task Force on the required R&D duration and construction cost will be discussed. We also take a look into the possible limits of ultimate colliders in terms of energy, luminosity, size, cost, power, and timeline.

Based on the key scientific questions in the frontier of particle physics field, the current status and future development trend globally and domestically of accelerator-based particle physics experiments, Tau-Charm projects are proposed respectively by taking into account the advantages in the relevant fields in China and Russia. A future tau-charm factory will be a new-generation electron-positron collider facility that has a center-of-mass energy of covering 2 to 7 GeV and a peaking luminosity of 1e35 cm-2s−1 at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV. Tau-charm factory accelerators consist of two main storage rings and a linear injector. In this presentation, we reported the main parameters of these future colliders and the main efforts on conceptual and technical design progress in China and Russia.

The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) collaboration has presented a project implementation plan for a 380 GeV e+e− linear collider, upgradable in stages to 3 TeV. The CLIC concept is based on high-gradient normal-conducting accelerating structures operating at X-band (12 GHz) frequency. We present the latest developments of the project design, studies and performance goals. Updated studies of the luminosity performance has allowed increased luminosity for the 380 GeV stage. We report on recent technical development of key components of the accelerator, as X-band components and accelerator components important for nano beam performances. We also present developments for application of the X-band technology to more compact accelerators for numerous applications. A rapidly increasing number of installations provide important design, testing and verification opportunities, and motivate industrial developments. The on-ongoing work towards sustainability and power/energy reductions will be covered. Design optimisation, RF power efficiency improvements and low power component development will provide a 380 GeV installation operating at around 50% of CERN’s energy consumption today.
