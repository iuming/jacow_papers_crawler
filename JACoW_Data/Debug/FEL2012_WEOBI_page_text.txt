We describe a technique for the reconstruction of the transverse spatial distribution of microbunching in a relativistic electron beam, and report on its experimental demonstration at the NLCTA test accelerator at SLAC. This technique relies on an oversampling phase retrieval method on a far field coherent optical transition radiation image. This method has a number of applications as an diagnostic for the FEL amplification process and in the imaging of compressed beams. We report on the experimental demonstration of this method in the case of microbunching generated by the interaction of an external laser pulse with an electron beam traversing an undulator.
