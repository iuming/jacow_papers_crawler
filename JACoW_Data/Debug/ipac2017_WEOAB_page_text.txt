A Hénon-Heiles system is a simple, classical nonlinear Hamiltonian system offering a wide range of particle dynamics from regular orbits to resonant behavior to chaotic trajectories. Initially proposed to describe the motion of stars around a galactic center, it remains a vivid topic in Dynamics and Mathematical Physics since its discovery in 1964. Although the system and its modifications have been extensively studied numerically, its dynamics has never been observed in a controlled experiment. In this report we show that it is possible to create the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian using sextupoles in a realistic accelerator lattice. We propose a special sextupole channel to create the desired potential at the IOTA ring and study the 3D single particle dynamics by frequency map analysis and Poincare cross-sections. The proposed experiment would allow real world testing of regular and chaotic motion with a controlled strength of the nonlinearity.

Minimization of the beta-beating at the two main interaction points of the LHC arising from the head-on and long-range beam-beam interactions can be performed by adjusting the strength of quadrupole or sextupole correctors. This compensation scheme is applied to the current LHC optics where the results show a significant reduction of the peak and RMS beta-beating; and the impact on the dynamic aperture is computed. A proposal for a similar strategy to be adopted in the High Luminosity LHC is also discussed.

The beams required for the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and other potential future circular colliders (FCC) call for efficient mechanisms to suppress transverse collective instabilities. In addition to octupole magnets installed for the purpose of Landau damping in the transverse planes, we propose to use radio frequency (rf) quadrupole structures to considerably enhance the aforementioned stabilising effect. By means of the PyHEADTAIL macroparticle tracking code as well as analytical studies, the stabilising mechanism introduced by an rf quadrupole is studied and explained. It is, furthermore, compared to the influence of the second order chromaticity on transverse beam stability.
