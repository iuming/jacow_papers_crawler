The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) at Fermilab is a program of upgrades to the injection complex. At its core is the design and construction of a CW-compatible, pulsed H− superconducting RF linac. To validate the concept of the front-end of such machine, a test accelerator known as PXIE is under construction. It includes a 10 mA DC, 30 keV H− ion source, a 2 m-long Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a 2.1 MeV CW RFQ, followed by a Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) that feeds the first of 2 cryomodules increasing the beam energy to about 25 MeV, and a High Energy Beam Transport section (HEBT) that takes the beam to a dump. The ion source, LEBT, RFQ, and initial version of the MEBT have been built, installed, and commissioned. This report presents the overall status of the PXIE warm front end, including results of the beam commissioning through the installed components, and progress with SRF cryomodules and other systems.

The industrialized string and module assembly of 103 European XFEL cryomodules has been performed at CEA-Saclay between September 2012 and the spring of 2016. The general features and achievements of this construction project will be reviewed, including lessons learned regarding organization, industrial transfer, quality control and assembly procedures. An overview of the cryomodule performance and RF test results will be presented.

The European Spallation Source requires a pulsed Linac with an average beam power on the target of 5MW which is about five times higher than the most powerful spallation source in operation today. Over 97% of the acceleration occurs in superconducting cavities. ESS will be the first accelerator to employ double spoke cavities to accelerate beam. Accelerating gradients of 9MV/meter is required in the spoke section. The spoke section will be followed by 36 elliptical 704 MHz cavities with a geometrical beta of 0.67 and elliptical 704 MHz cavities with a geometrical beta of 0.86. Accelerating gradients of 20MV/m is required in the elliptical section. Initial gradient test results will be presented in which results exceed expected requirements.

More than 800 resonators have been fabricated, vertically qualified and operated in module tests before the accelerating module installation in the linac, which will be completed before the conference. An analysis of this experience, with correlation of the final cavity performances with production, preparation and assembly stages, is underway and at the time of the conference a summary of the activities will be available.

The HIE-ISOLDE project (High Intensity and Energy ISOLDE) reached an important milestone in October 2015 when the first physics run was carried out with radioactive Zn beams at 4 MV/m. This is a first stage in the upgrade of the REX post-accelerator, whereby the energy of the radioactive ion beams was increased from 3 to 4.3 MeV per nucleon. The facility will ultimately be equipped with four high-beta cryomodules that will accelerate the beams up to 10 MeV per nucleon for the heaviest isotopes available at ISOLDE. The first cryomodule of the new linac, hosting five superconducting cavities and one solenoid, was commissioned in summer 2015, while the second one was being assembled in clean room. The new high-energy beam transfer lines were installed and commissioned in the same lapse of time. Commissioning with two cryomodules is planned for Summer 2016 to prepare for a physics run at 5.5 MeV/u in the second half of the year. This contribution will focus on the results of the commissioning and operation of the SC linac in 2015. Plans for the second phase of the HIE-ISOLDE project will be highlighted.

The SPIRAL2 project beam commissioning is started and the superconducting linac installation is being finalized. In parallel with the installations, the first proton beam was extracted in 2014 and the expected beam performances were achieved from both light and heavy ion sources. The conditioning of the RFQ started in October 2015, and the beam commissioning soon after that. After having briefly recalled the project scope and parameters, the present situation of the RFQ beam commissioning is presented.
