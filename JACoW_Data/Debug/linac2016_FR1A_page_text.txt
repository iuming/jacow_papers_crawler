High brightness injectors are increasingly pushing against space charge effects. Usually, particle tracking codes such as ASTRA, GPT, or PARMELA are used to model these systems however these can be slow to use for detailed optimization. It becomes increasingly challenging in future projects such as LCLS-II where space charge effects are still significant after BC1 and BC2 at 250 and 1600 MeV respectively. This talk will describe an envelope tracking approach that compares well against the particle tracking codes and could facilitate much faster optimization.

An Electron Beam Ion Source Charge Breeder (EBIS-CB) has been developed at Argonne to breed radioactive beams from the CAlifornium Rare Ion Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility at ATLAS. The CARIBU EBIS-CB has been successfully commissioned offline with an external singly-charged cesium ion source. The EBIS performance meets the breeding requirements to deliver CARIBU beams to ATLAS. EBIS can provide charge-to-mass ratios >=1/7 for all CARIBU beams with breeding times in the range of 6 ms to 30 ms. A record high breeding efficiency of up to 28% into a single charge state of Cs28+ has been demonstrated. Following the offline testing EBIS was moved to the front end of ATLAS where the alignment of EBIS was substantially improved and additional beam diagnostic tools both for electron and ion beams were installed. This paper will discuss EBIS improvements and present the results of on-line commissioning.

Superconducting ECR ion source (SC-ECRIS) represents the state of the art technologies of ECR ion sources. Existing SC-ECRISs developed in different labs have contributed significantly for ECRIS technology advancement in the last 15 years. Recently the superconducting ECR ion source SECRAL operated at 24 GHz at IMP has produced many new world recorded beam intensities of highly charged ions due to new technologies applied, such as a new microwave coupling scheme. At the meantime, the world first 4th generation ECR ion source operated at 45 GHz is being developed at IMP. All these developments on intense beam production of highly charged ions with superconducting ECR ion source may play significant roles for the next generation heavy ion linacs such as FRIB and Linac of HIAF project. This paper will report the recent developments of intense highly charged heavy ion beams at IMP and the discussion on perspectives of next generation ECRIS for the future heavy ion liancs.

Electron beams ionize rest gas particles which then accumulate around them, disturbing beam dynamics and causing background radiation. While this effect has been predicted in the past, linacs have hitherto not suffered from it because of their rather small beam current. The effect of ions increases with larger currents and smaller cross sections of the beam, and it has clearly been observed in Cornell's high-brightness ERL injector for the first time. This presentation will show experimental evidence for ions, demonstrate strategies for their elimination, and will compare the experimental data to theories of beam-ion interactions.

Precision measurements of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) and electric dipole moment (EDM) are one of the effective ways to test the standard model. An ultra-cold muon beam is generated from a surface muon beam by a thermal muonium production and accelerated to 300 MeV/c by a linac. The muon linac consists of an RFQ, an inter-digital IH, a Disk And Washer structure, and a disk loaded structure. The ultra-cold muons will have an extremely small momentum spread of 0.3 % with a normalized transverse emittance of around 1.5 pi mm-mrad. The design and status of the muon linac at J-PARC will be presented.

We present results of an experiment where two Laser-Plasma-Accelerator stages are coupled at a short distance, as is needed to increase energy while preserving average gradient. Stable electron beams produced by the first stage were focused by a discharge capillary-based active plasma lens, through a plasma mirror which coupled a second independent laser, into the second stage. The electron beam interacted with a dark-current-free, quasi-linear wakefield excited by the second stage laser. Changing the arrival time of the electron beam allowed localized reconstruction of the temporal field structure excited by the wake and determination of the on-axis plasma density. Staged acceleration in the wakefield of the second stage was verified by a momentum gain of the electron beam. The results indicate that limits to plasma accelerator energy gain can be overcome using staged acceleration, which provides a path to collider-relevant energies. Such compact staging is also important to photon sources where it can be used to decelerate electrons after photon production to mitigate shielding needs.
