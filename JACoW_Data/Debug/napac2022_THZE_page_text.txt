The author would report on the application of machine learning (ML) methods for predicting the longitudinal phase space (LPS) distribution of particle accelerators. The approach consists of training a ML-based virtual diagnostic to predict the LPS using only nondestructive linac and e-beam measurements as inputs.

An Accelerator Research facility is a unique science and engineering challenge in that the requirements for developing a robust, optimized science facility are limited by engineering and cost limitations. Each facility is planned to achieve some science goal within a given schedule and budget and is then expected to operate for three decades. In three decades, the mechanical systems and the industrial IO to control them is not likely to change. In that same time, electronics will go through some 4 generations of change. The software that integrates the systems and provides tools for operations, automation, data analysis and machine studies will have many new standards. To help understand the process of designing and planning such a facility, we explain the specifications and requirements for the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) from both a physics and engineering perspective.

Being a wide-band semiconductor, diamond can be used to measure the flux of passing particles based on a particle-induced conductivity effect. We recently demonstrated a diamond electrodeless electron beam halo monitor. That monitor was based on a thin piece of diamond (blade) placed in an open high-quality microwave resonator. The blade partially intercepted the beam. By measuring the change in RF properties of the resonator, one could infer the beam parameters. At Argonne Wakefield Accelerator we have tested 1D and 2D monitors. To enhance the sensitivity of our diamond sensor, we proposed applying a bias voltage to the diamond which can sustain the avalanche of free carriers. In experiment carried out with 120 kV, ~1 µA beam we showed that the response signal for the avalanche monitor biased with up to 5 kV voltage can be up to 100 times larger in comparison with the signal of the same non-biased device.

Transverse profile diagnostics for high-intensity beams require solutions that are non-intercepting and single-shot. In this paper, we describe a gas-sheet ionization diagnostic that employs a precision-shaped, neutral gas jet. As the high-intensity beam passes through the gas sheet, neutral particles are ionized. The ionization products are transported and imaged on a detector. A neural-network based reconstruction algorithm, trained on simulation data, then outputs the initial transverse conditions of the beam prior to ionization. The diagnostic is also adaptable to image the photons from recombination. Preliminary tests at low energy are presented to characterize the working principle of the instrument, including comparisons to existing diagnostics. The results are parametrized as a function of beam charge, spot size, and bunch length.

A novel soft X-ray BPM (sXBPM) for high-power white beams of undulator radiation is being developed through a joint effort of BNL/NSLS-II and Stony Brook University. In our approach, custom-made multi-pixel GaAs detector arrays are placed into the outer portions of the x-ray beam, and the beam position is inferred from the pixel photocurrents. In this paper, we present a brief overview and the most recent developments in our project. To date, the mechanical design of the system is completed and most of the vacuum and mechanical components have been installed into the 23-ID canted undulator beamline first optical enclosure. The remainder of the system, including the detector arrays, are being installed during the upcoming NSLS-II machine shutdown. The GaAs detectors have been designed, fabricated, and tested in the visible range with a high-power Ar-ion laser as well as in the soft and hard x-ray regions at two NSLS-II beamlines.

We will describe the development and prospects for the Time-Resolved Beam Halo Monitor (TR-BHM) along with results from initial beam tests. The TR-BHM is a detector system for measuring and characterizing the spatial and temporal structure of particle halos accompanying accelerated particle bunches utilizing diamond strip detectors read out by system-on-chip (SoC) high-speed waveform digitizers developed by Nalu Scientific LLC (NSL). It will provide a powerful non-destructive in-situ beam diagnostic detector for real-time measurements and control of beam parameters for the next generation of light sources. The theory, detection methodology, and instrumentation will be discussed, as well as measurement results from full-system x-ray beam calibration tests and preparations for an upcoming prototype installation at FACET.
