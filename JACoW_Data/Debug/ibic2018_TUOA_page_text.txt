Machine learning techniques are used in various scientific and industry fields as a powerful tool for data analysis and automatization. The presentation is devoted to exploration of relevant machine learning methods for beam diagnostics. The target is to provide an insight into modern machine learning techniques, which can be applied to improve current beam diagnostics and general applications in accelerators. Possible concepts for future applications are also presented.
