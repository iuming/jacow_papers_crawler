Free-space quantum communication with satellites opens a promising avenue for global secure quantum network and large-scale test of quantum foundations. Here we report a serial of experimental progresses on free-space quantum communication over long distance. In the meantime, Chinese Quantum Science Satellite has been launched on August 16th 2016. Through nearly one year of efforts, we have achieved the three major scientific goals’satellite-based entanglement distribution over 1200km, ground-to-satellite quantum teleportation and satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution. Intercontinental quantum communication between China and Europe at locations separated by 7600 km has also been demonstrated, using the satellite as a relay. In this report, we will first introduce the latest experimental progress through Micius, such as the first realization of entanglement-based QKD over 1,120 kilometres without the need for trusted relays, integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network over 4,600 kilometres, and satellite-based quantum-secure time transfer.
