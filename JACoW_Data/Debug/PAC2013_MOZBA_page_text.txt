Linac4 is a normal-conducting 160 MeV H− linear accelerator presently under construction at CERN. It will replace the present 50 MeV Linac2 as injector of the proton accelerator complex as part of a project to increase the LHC luminosity. The Linac front-end, composed of a 45 keV ion source, a Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a 352.2 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and a Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) housing a beam chopper, have been commissioned at the 3 MeV test stand during the first half of 2013. The status of the installation and the results of the first commissioning stage are presented in this paper.

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) and the Chinese Accelerator Driven Systems (C-ADS) projects are both underway in China. The CSNS includes a 100 kW RCS accelerator and first beam on target is planned for 2017. The C-ADS project includes a high power superconducting linac with a low energy (25-50 MeV) initial stage by 2015 and higher power deployment later. In addition to these intense-beam proton accelerators, some other proton accelerators for various applications are also under construction or planned. IN this paper, the plans, R&D and construction activities of these projects will be discussed.
