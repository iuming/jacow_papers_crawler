The Kurchatov synchrotron radiation source goes on to operate in the range of synchrotron radiation from VUV up to hard X-ray. An electron current achieved 200 mA at 2.5 GeV, up to 12 experimental stations may function simultaneously. An improvement of an injection process allowed to minimize injection time and to increase injection efficiency. A production of two new superconducting wigglers is now in progress in BINP (Novosibirsk). They will be installed on the main ring in next year. Great modernization of the whole facility is planned for 2020. The present status and future plans of the Kurchatov synchrotron radiation source is presented in the report.

The inauguration of the only dedicated synchrotron radiation source in Russia was held at NRC "Kurchatov Institute" in 1999. At present according to its main parameters it is a "2+" generation synchrotron light facility. In this article we consider the possibility of the Kurchatov synchrotron radiation source upgrade up to compact 3rd generation facility with keeping of all experimental stations at the same places. Also we present the conceptual design of the new diffraction limited synchrotron radiation source (4th generation facility) for NRC "Kurchatov Institute".
