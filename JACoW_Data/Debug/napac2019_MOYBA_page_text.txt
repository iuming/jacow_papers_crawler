Commissioning of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 SuperKEKB / B-Factory

The next generation of B-Factory, the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider at KEK (Japan) has started after two years shutdown from the Phase 1 commissioning in 2016. The first phase for the vacuum scrubbing in 2016 and the second phase focused on the verification of the novel "nano-beam" collision scheme were successfully completed in 2018. The modifications between Phase 1 and Phase 2 follows Phase 3 are installations of the final focus system and the Belle II detector. In order to accomplish the higher luminosity more than the predecessor KEKB , the nano-beam scheme is studied with higher bunch currents to reduce the beam-beam blowup which degrade the luminosity. The new collision scheme is reviewed and the luminosity performance and overall status in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 commissioning are presented.

The recent National Academies of Science Review concluded the science questions that could be answered by an electron-ion collider are significant to advancing our understanding of the atomic nuclei that make up all visible matter in the universe. To meet this science need, a high luminosity polarized electron-ion collider (JLEIC) was envisioned at Jefferson Lab, based on the existing CEBAF recirculated SRF electron linac. Over the past 16 years, Jefferson Lab has been actively engaged in the design study and accelerator R&D for JLEIC, a comprehensive Pre-Conceptual Design Report has been completed recently. The JLEIC baseline design has also been continuously optimized for achieving better performance and for reduction of technical risks. In this paper, we present a summary of the JLEIC baseline design and also briefly discuss the accelerator R&D.

The future electron-ion collider (EIC) aims at an electron-proton luminosity of 1033 to 1034 cm-2 sec-1 and a center-of-mass energy range from 20 to 140 GeV. The eRHIC design has been continuously evolving over a couple of years and has reached a considerable level of maturity. The concept is generally conservative with very few risk items which are mitigated in various ways.

A Super Proton-Proton Collider (SPPC) that aims to explore new physics beyond the standard model is planned in China. Here we focus on the impact of beam-beam interactions in the SPPC. Simulations show that with the current optics and nominal tunes, the dynamic aperture (DA) with all the beam-beam interactions is less than 6σ, the dominant cause being the long-range interactions. First, we show the results of a tune scan done to maximize the DA. Next, we discuss the compensation of the long-range interactions by increasing the crossing angle and also by using current carrying wires.

RHIC provided Au-Au collisions at beam energies of 9.8, 7.3, 4.59 and 3.85 GeV/nucleon during the first year of the Beam Energy Scan II in 2019. The physics goals at the first two higher beam energies were achieved. At the two lower beam energies, bunched electron beam cooling has been demonstrated successfully. The accelerator performance was improved compared to when RHIC was operated at these energies in earlier years. This article will introduce the challenges to operate RHIC at low energies and the corresponding countermeasures, and review the improvement of accelerator performance during the operation in 2019.
