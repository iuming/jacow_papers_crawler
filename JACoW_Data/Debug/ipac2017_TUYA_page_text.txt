This talk reviews the design, construction, and commissioning effort of CERN's new proton linear accelerator, Linac4, which has recently been commissioned and which is presently undergoing a reliability run. Linac4 will be connected to the LHC proton injector chain during the next long LHC shut down (LS2) and will then replace the ageing Linac2.
