Shanghai HIgh repetition rate XFEL aNd Extreme light facility (SHINE) is under construction. SHINE requires precise distribution and synchronization of the 1.003086 MHz timing signals over a long distance of about 3.1 km. Two prototype systems were developed, both containing three functions: beam-synchronous trigger signal distribution, random-event trigger signal distribution and data exchange between nodes. The frequency of the beam-synchronous trigger signal can be divided according to the accelerator operation mode. Each output pulse can be configured for different fill modes. A prototype system was designed based on a customized clock frequency point (64.197530 MHz). Another prototype system was designed based on the standard White Rabbit protocol. The DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) and D flip-flops (DFFs) are adopted for RF signal transfer and pulse configuration. The details of the timing system design, laboratory test results will be reported in this paper.
