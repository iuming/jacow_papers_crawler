The European Spallation Source (ESS) will use a 2.5GeV superconducting proton linac with a 5MW average beam power to produce the worlds most powerful neutron source. The project, sited in the south of Sweden, is approaching the end of the pre-construction phase, and is expected to enter the construction phase in 2013. This paper gives an overview of the ESS accelerator and the planned beam diagnostics systems, as well as the associated challenges.

Beam loss measurement systems are often used for the protection of equipment against the damage caused by impacting particles creating secondary showers and their energy dissipation in the matter. Depending on the acceptable consequences and the frequency of particle impact events on equipment reliability requirements are scaling accordingly. Increasing reliability often leads to more complex systems. The downside of complexity is a reduction of availability, therefore an optimum has to be found for these conflicting requirements. A detailed review of selected concepts and solutions from real-life examples will be given to show approaches used in various parts of the system from the sensors, signal processing, and software implementations up to the requirements for operation and documentation.
