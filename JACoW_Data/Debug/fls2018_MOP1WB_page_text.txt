Machine design for the PETRA III storage ring upgrade – PETRA IV – aiming at a 10-30 pm emittance range has been ongoing at DESY. We present the design challenges and approaches for this machine, the baseline lattice and the alternative lattice concepts currently under consideration.

KEK has two storage-ring light sources. One is Photon Factory (PF). This is the first storage-ring light source in X-ray region in Japan, and the user-run started in 1983. The ring energy is 2.5 GeV, and the emittance has been reduced to 36 nm·rad from 460 nm·rad through some improvements. Another is Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR). The ring energy is 6.5 GeV, and the single-bunch operation and hard X-ray are featured. The user-run started in 1987, and the emittance is 293 nm·rad. The magnetic lattice is almost the same as the original one. Now we consider the future plans of KEK light sources. One is the fully new facility applying DQBA lattice, named KEK-LS. The circumstance is 571 m, and the emittance is 315 pm·rad @ 3 GeV and 500 mA. In parallel with that, two plans of the only replacements of the lattices reusing existing tunnels of PF and PF-AR are considered. For the PF upgrade, only the arc lattice will be replaced with a new lattice employing combined bends, and the emittance will be improved to 8 nm·rad from 35 nm·rad. For the PF-AR update, fully replacement will be carried out with a new HMBA lattice, and the expected emittance is 520 pm·rad @ 3 GeV and 500 mA.
