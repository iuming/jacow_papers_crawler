The microbunching instability (MBI) is a well-known problem for high brightness electron beams and has been observed at accelerator facilities around the world. Free-electron lasers (FELs) are particularly susceptible to MBI, which can distort the longitudinal phase space and increase the beam's slice energy spread (SES). Past studies of MBI at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) relied on optical transition radiation to infer the existence of microbunching. With the development of the x-band transverse deflecting cavity (XTCAV), we can for the first time directly image the longitudinal phase space at the end of the accelerator and complete a comprehensive study of MBI, revealing both detailed MBI behavior as well as insights into mitigation schemes [1]. The fine time resolution of the XTCAV also provides the first LCLS measurements of the final SES, a critical parameter for many advanced FEL schemes. Detailed MBI and SES measurements can aid in understanding MBI mechanisms, benchmarking simulation codes, and designing future high-brightness accelerators.

Science needs in the last decade have been pushing the accelerator community to the development of high repetition rates (MHz/GHz-class) linac-based schemes capable of generating high brightness electron beams. Examples include X-ray FELs; ERLs for light source, electron cooling and IR to EUV FEL applications; inverse Compton scattering X-ray or gamma sources; and ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. The high repetition rate requirement has profound implications on the technology choice for most of the accelerator parts, and in particular for the electron gun. The successful performance of the GHz room-temperature RF photo-injectors running at rates <~ 100 Hz, cannot be scaled up to higher rates because of the excessive heat load that those regimes would impose on the gun cavity. In response to this gun need, we have developed at Berkeley the VHF-Gun, a lower-frequency room-temperature RF photo-gun capable of CW operation and optimized for the performance required by MHz-class X-ray FELs. The Advanced Photo-injector EXperiment (APEX) was funded and built for demonstrating the VHF gun performance, and the results of its last phase of commissioning are presented.

The European XFEL Injector consists of an L-Band RF photoinjector, a TESLA type 1.3 GHz module, a 3rd harmonic RF section, a laser heater and an extensive diagnostic section to determine projected and slice properties of the beam. The commissioning of the complete system has been started in December 2015 after several years of construction. We will report on commissioning results and persepctives for the later XFEL operation.
