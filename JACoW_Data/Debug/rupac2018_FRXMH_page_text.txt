The report overviews present status of the proton therapy complex Prometheus. The PTC Prometheus was developed and successfully implemented in the PhTC LPI RAS in conjunction with Protom Ltd. The complex is a Russian development and is fully produced within the territory of the Russian Federation. At the moment, there are two such complexes - in the city hospital of Protvino and in the A. Tsyb Medical Radiological Research Centre (MRRC). PTC LPI RAS and Protom ltd. along with MRRC have accumulated almost three years of experience in the usage of the complex under clinical conditions. PTC Prometheus has proved to be efficient and reliable in two years of clinical use in the treatment of head and neck cancer. If there is a developed infrastructure, the capacity of the facility will able go up to more than 1000 people a year. The low weight, low power consumption and compact dimensions of the complex allow it to be placed in ordinary hospitals, without constructing separate buildings. In addition to that, PTC Prometheus was licensed to irradiate the entire human body in March 2017. The phase of preparation of a modified immobilization system for irradiating a recumbent patient was completed by summer 2018.
