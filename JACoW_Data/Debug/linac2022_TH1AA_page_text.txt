Nitrogen Gas-Jet Curtain for Windowless Helium Gas Cell Equipped With Differential Pumping Systems

Windowless helium gas cells are used for heavy ion beam charge strippers, high intensity beam targets, and GARIS (GAs-filled Recoil Ion Separator) for nuclear physics experiments. They are usually accompanied by a differential pumping system, but due to the high diffusion rate of helium gas, helium gas diffuses into the region where a high vacuum is required, and as a result, it is difficult to increase the helium gas pressure. To solve this problem, we invented the "nitrogen gas curtain". This not only prevents helium gas from leaking out to the high vacuum side, but also allows nitrogen to leak out instead of helium, making it easier to increase the vacuum level. This system has been incorporated into the gas stripper and the GARIS-3 apparatus at the RIKEN RIBF and continues to operate stably. In this talk, the concept, design method, utility, and performance of the nitrogen gas curtain will be explained in detail*.

High-Q0 medium-velocity (beta opt = 0.6) 5-cell elliptical cavities for superconducting linacs are critical technology for advancing current and future projects such as the Proton Improvement Plan II linac and the proposed energy upgrade of Michigan State University’s Facility For Rare Isotope Beams linac, FRIB400. Previous work established the validity of the novel geometry of the FRIB400 prototype 644 MHz 5-cell elliptical β = 0.65 cavities for future high Q0 development. In collaboration with FNAL, two leading-edge high-Q0 recipes, N-doping and Mid-T baking, were tested in the 5-cell format. 2/0 N-doping + cold electropolishing was successful at achieving FRIB400 and PIP-II Q0 requirements, achieving an unprecedented 3.8 x 1010 at 17.5 MV/m, satisfying the FRIB400 Q0 requirements by 1.75 times in a low-gauss environment. Mid-T baking exceeded FRIB400 Q0 requirements by 1.4 times, and benefitted from decreased residual resistance compared to the N-doped cavity test. Systematic ultrasonic thickness measurements in single-cell revealed bulk (150 microns) EP with the modified EP tool is consistent across the inner surfaces of the cavity walls.

Optically generated terahertz radiation, with gigavolt per meter (GV/m) electric fields accessible in tabletop experiments, provides a promising source of accelerating gradients for future particle accelerator applications. Manipulation and characterization of radiation is essential for efficiently producing high fields and effectively delivering them to an accelerating structure or interaction region. The talk will cover a method of generating and characterizing high quality and structured terahertz pulsed laser beams for compact particle acceleration.

The CERN Linac4 Low Level RF (LLRF) uses a Linear Gaussian Regulator and an Adaptive Feed Forward to regulate the accelerating field in the cavities in the presence of strong beam loading. A Klystron Polar Loop is also implemented to compensate the RF perturbations caused by the ripples and droop in the klystron High Voltage supply. The talk presents the important parts of the regulation, shows results as the system has evolved from first prototype (2013) to operational beams (2020), and mentions some important issues encountered during the commissioning and the first years of operation, with their mitigations.
