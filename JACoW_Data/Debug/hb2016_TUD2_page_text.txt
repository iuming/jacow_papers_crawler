Beam commissioning of the proton linac of the European Spallation Source (ESS) is planned to be conducted in 2018 and 2019. At this stage, the last 21 cryomodules are not yet installed and the maximum beam energy and power are 570 MeV and 1.4 MW, with respect to the nominal 2 GeV and 5 MW. The linac will be operated in this condition until the remaining cyromodules are installed in two stages in 2021 and 2022. On top of the common challenges of beam dynamics and machine protection, commissioning of a large scale machine, such as the ESS linac within a relatively short integrated time of less than 40 weeks imposes an additional challenge to the scheduling and planning. This paper lays out the current plans of the ESS linac for its beam commissioning as well as the initial operation.

As a test facility, the design goal of C-ADS Injector I is a 10mA, 10MeV CW proton linac, which uses a 3.2MeV normal conducting RFQ and superconducting single-spoke cavities for accelerating. The RF frequency of C-ADS Injector I accelerator is 325 MHz. In accordance to the progress of construction and considering the technical difficulties, the beam commissioning of C-ADS Injector I is carried out in 3 phases: Phase 1, with ECRIS + LEBT + RFQ + MEBT + TCM (two superconducting cavities), to reach 3.6 MeV; Phase 2, with ECRIS + LEBT + RFQ + MEBT + CM1 (seven superconducting cavities), to reach 5 MeV; Phase 3, with ECRIS + LEBT + RFQ + MEBT + CM1+ CM2 (same as CM1), to finally achieve the design goal of C-ADS Injector I. This paper summarizes the beam commissioning in 3 phases and focusing on the third phase.

The first phase of the SPIRAL 2 project dealing with the high-power superconducting linac and the two experimental areas called Neutron for Science (NfS) and Super Separator Spectrometer (S3) is well advanced. The project has entered in a phase during which the linac components are successively installed and commissioned (the first beam was produced in December 2014). After having briefly recalled the project scope and parameters, the way the accelerator installation and commissioning are done is presented.

An electron scanner has been installed in the accumulator ring of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). The non-destructive device permits turn-by-turn measurements of the horizontal and vertical profiles of the proton beam during accumulation with fine longitudinal resolution. In this study the device is used to identify the source of transverse coupling in the SNS ring and to understand the impact of space charge on the evolution of the coupled beam. We present experimental observations of coupling dependent on tune, injected intensity, and accumulated intensity for a simplified accumulation scenario with no RF and no injection painting. We also investigate the effects of varying the skew quadrupoles and tune for beams with the SNS production-style ring injection and ring RF patterns.
