Accurate predictions of the future are inherently difficult, nevertheless in this talk I will consider some of the developments in control systems at large research facilities and from these try to predict where they are heading. In doing so, the talk will consider software, hardware, people and the management of work. While this will largely be based on developments within our community, it will also look outward to consider what potential external influences there may be.
