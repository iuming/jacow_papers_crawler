MOTC01
Optics and Mechanics of Mirror Benders

We will explain the basic concepts of optics regarding focusing with grazing incidence reflective surfaces. The concept of aberration and figure error, and the aberrations associated to the typical geometric surfaces found in mirrors will be described with some detail. We will describe how mirror benders can approximate these geometrical figures, how to compute the required mechanical characteristics, and the optical effect of the residual errors. Finally, we will describe, and illustrate with examples, the main aspects that have to be considered in the mechanical implementation, their characterization and their operation in the beam-line.

MOTC02
Accelerator Physics: An Introduction

This tutorial aims professionals working at accelerators facilities but have not been introduced to the motivations and details behind such complex machines. The underlying physical phenomena are explained and linked to typical devices in synchrotron light facilities like dipoles, quadrupoles or RF cavities. The content covers a friendly overview of the core of accelerator physics and its technologies.
