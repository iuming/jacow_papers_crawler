The 2 MeV electron cooler is operated in the COSY ring since 2013. So far electron beam energy up to 1.5 MeV was demonstrated. Dedicated electron cooling studies with proton beams up to 1.66 GeV kinetic energy and electron beam current up to 0.9 A were carried out. A reduction of proton beam emittance by one order of magnitude within a few hundred seconds was observed. Overview of HV and electron beam commissioning activities is presented. Electron cooling results are discussed.

The 2 MeV electron cooling system for COSY-Julich started operation in 2013 years. The cooling process was observed in the wide energy range of the electron beam from 100 keV to 908 keV. Vertical, horizontal and longitudinal cooling was tested at bunched and continuous beams. The cooler was operated with electron current up to 0.9 A. This report deals with the description of the experimental observation of longitudinal electron cooling of DC and bunched proton beam at 2425 MeV/c at COSY.

An electron cooler is presently under construction to improve the luminosity of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for heavy ion beam energies below 10 GeV/nucleon. Required electron beam and its acceleration (up to 2 MeV in Phase-I and up to 5 MeV in Phase-II) are provided by the photoemission electron gun and the RF linear accelerator. As a result, cooling will be accomplished by using bunched electron beams produced by high-brightness high-current electron linear accelerator. In addition, this will be the first electron cooling applied directly in a collider. In this presentation we describe accelerator physics requirements, design considerations and parameters, as well as associated challenges of such a low-energy RHIC electron cooler (LEReC).

The ELENA project (Extra Low ENergy Antiprtons) at CERN is nearing completion. One of the crucial components of the this new decelerator ring will be the associated electron cooler. With a final antiproton energy in ELENA of 100 keV the electron cooler will be working at a very low electron energy of just 55 eV. We will present the design consideratiosn andproduction status of the cooler.
