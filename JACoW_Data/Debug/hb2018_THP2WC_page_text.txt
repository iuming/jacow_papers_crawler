A second harmonic RF cavity which uses perpendicularly biased garnet for frequency tuning is currently being constructed for use in the Fermilab Booster. The cavity will operate at twice the fundamental RF frequency, from ~76 - 106 MHz, and will be turned on only during injection, and transition or extraction. Its main purpose is to reduce beam loss as required by Fermilab's Proton Improvement Plan (PIP). After three years of optimization and study, the cavity design has been finalized and all constituent parts have been received. We discuss the design aspects of the cavity and its associated systems, component testing, and status of the cavity construction.

The HL-LHC upgrade includes sixteen Crab Cavities (CC) to be installed on both sides of the high luminosity experiments, ATLAS and CMS. Two issues have been highlighted for the Low Level RF: transverse emittance growth (and associated luminosity drop) caused by CC RF noise, and large collimator losses following a CC trip. A prototype cryomodule with two CCs has been installed in the SPS, and tests have started in May 2018 with beam. This paper briefly reports on preliminary results from the SPS tests. It then presents emittance growth calculations from cavity field phase and amplitude noise, deduces the maximum RF noise compatible with the specifications and presents a possible cure consisting of a feedback on CC phase and amplitude. To reduce the losses following a CC trip we propose to implement transverse tail cleaning via the injection of CC noise with an optimized spectrum, which selectively excites the particles of large transverse oscillation amplitudes.

At the present time, the activities on creation of the new multipurpose isochronous cyclotron DC130 are carried out at the FLNR, JINR. The cyclotron DC130 is intended for microchip testing, production of track pore membranes and for applied physics. The cyclotron will accelerate the heavy ions with mass-to-charge ratio A/Z from 5 to 8 up to the fixed energies 2 and 4.5 MeV per nucleon. The main magnet and acceleration system of DC130 is based on the U200 cyclotron that now is under reconstruction. At the present paper the method of choosing of main magnet parameters of cyclotron is described.
