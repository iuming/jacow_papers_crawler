The current fixed target (FT) experiments at CERN are a complementary approach to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and play a crucial role in the investigation of fundamental questions in particle physics. Within the scope of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU), aiming to improve the LHC beam production, the injector complex will be significantly upgraded during the second Long Shutdown (LS2). All non-LHC beams are expected to benefit from these upgrades. In this paper, we focus on the studies of the transverse instability in the Proton Synchrotron (PS), currently limiting the intensity of Time-Of-Flight (ToF) type beams, as well as the prediction of the impact of envisaged hardware modifications. A first discussion on the effect of space charge on the observed instability is also being presented.

The Microbunched Electron Cooling (MBEC) is a promising cooling technique that can find applications in future hadron and electron-ion colliders. In this paper we give a qualitative derivation of the cooling rate for MBEC and estimate the cooling time for the eRHIC electron-ion collider. We then argue that MBEC with two plasma amplification stages should be sufficient to overcome the emittance growth due to the intra-beam scattering in eRHIC.

To date our understanding of fundamental intensity limitations and studies of instabilities and resonances has been based on time-consuming accelerator-based experiments or on simulations, limited by computational power and noise artifacts that can obscure real beam physics effects. As beam intensities increase and new concepts emerge for high intensity machines, accelerator physicists require new methods, tools and modeling techniques to understand the complex dynamics of the intense beams involved. In this talk I will introduce a scaled experimental system known as a Paul ion trap, and discuss how this multi-disciplinary technique is being used to address some of the most challenging questions in the field of intense particle beam dynamics.

Beam loss due to space charge is a major problem at current and future high intensity particle accelerators. The space charge force can be compensated for proton or ion beams by creating a column of electrons with a charge distribution matched to that of the beam, maintaining electron-proton stability. The column is created by the beam ionizing short sections of high pressure gas. The ionization electrons are then shaped appropriately using electric and magnetic fields. The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at Fermilab is a test bed for beam loss and instability mitigation techniques. Simulations using the particle-in-cell code, Warp, have been made to track the evolution of both the electron column and the beam over multiple passes. A 2.5 MeV proton beamline is under construction at IOTA, to be used to study the effect of the electron column on a space charge dominated beam.
