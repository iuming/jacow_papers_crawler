Since the discovery of the Higgs particle at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012, feasibility studies for a very large future circular collider are ongoing for two designs in particular: the FCC in Europe and the CEPC-SppC in China. Both designs aim for initial operation as a Higgs factory. This workshop on High Luminosity Circular e+e− Colliders (HF2014), held in Beijing, China and hosted by the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), included a Working Group on Instrumentation and Control to consider important issues associated with these systems. While instrumentation and control designs are just starting, HF2014 provided the opportunity to discuss these systems and their challenges.
