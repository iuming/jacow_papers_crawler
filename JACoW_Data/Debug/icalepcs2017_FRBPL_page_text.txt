EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) is a set of Open Source software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes, experiment beam lines and other large scientific experiments. The EPICS collaboration meeting provides an opportunity for developers and managers from the various different sites to come together and discuss their work in progress and make plans for the future. They give a chance to see what is being done at other laboratories, and to review the specifications for new tools or enhancements to existing ones in order to maximize their usefulness to the whole community and avoid duplication of effort. Topics that will be addressed: - The upcoming EPICS 7 release - Project status reports -User Interface tools - Technical presentations from EPICS users.

White Rabbit Tutorial Workshop
 


 

J. Serrano
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

White Rabbit (WR) is a multi-laboratory, multi-company collaboration to design open source hardware, gateware and software in the field of distributed hard real-time controls and data acquisition systems. The core of these systems is a WR network, which features sub-ns synchronization with fiber delay compensation and a guaranteed upper bound in message latency. WR is a backwards compatible extension of Ethernet and IEEE 1588 (aka Precise Time Protocol). The WR collaboration typically conducts workshops where users and core developers present their progress and applications. In this ICALEPCS pre-conference workshop, we would like to take a slightly different approach. We would like to make this a tutorial workshop, meaning that somebody who has never been exposed to WR technology should walk out of the workshop with a very good idea of how to use WR to solve real life problems, having seen real WR gear in action. We would also like to cater for experienced WR users by providing several examples of WR applications in domains they may not have tackled yet, and by including advanced material at the end of the day.

E. Blanco Viñuela
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

This workshop intends to create a collaborative space where attendees will show their best practices, tools employed and return of experience when engineering PLC based control systems. This time the workshop focuses specifically the management of the control applications. Precise topics that will be addressed: - Specifications, requirements trace, documents: analysis, design, implementation - Software development: standards and/or frameworks, novel paradigms (e.g. automatic code generation, object orientation), language choice and coding conventions, best practices. - Testing and verification: methodologies and tests (FAT, SAT), simulation, static analysis, verification (e.g. formal methods) - Application management: versioning, deployment, online changes, upgrades, reverse engineering

HDF5 and Data Format
 


 

E.I. Pourmal
                       The HDF Group, Champaign, Illinois, USA

 


 

During ICALEPCS 2015 it became clear that HDF5 is the de facto standard in the controls and acquisition field for storing large datasets. This workshop builds on the success of the last HDF5 workshop at ICALEPCS 2015. The HDF group will present training tutorials on HDF5 basics including tools, performance tuning and new features. The workshop will discuss recent developments in HDF5 and the experiences and plans of different sites, using the HDF5 library to record and store data and associated metadata. Topics to be addressed include: - HDF5 on multiple-platforms and multiple versions - Use of additional definition standards like NeXus - New tools like HDFql, news on h5py, viewers, 3rd party libraries - Tuning and optimising for High Performance detector systems and HPC - Experiences and plans for use of new features such as Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR), Virtual Dataset (VDS) and Direct Chunk Write.

Control System Cybersecurity Workshop

Today's accelerator and detector control systems do not differ significantly from the control systems used in industry or devices being part of the "Internet-of-Things"(IoT). Modern Information Technologies(IT) are commonly used, control systems are based more and more on common-of-the-shelf hardware/software(VME crates, PLCs, VxWorks, LynxOS, network switches, networked controls hardware, SCADA, commercial middleware, etc.) or Windows/Linux PCs. Furthermore, due to the academic freedom in the High Energy Physics community, control systems are produced in a wide, decentralized community, which leads to heterogeneous systems and often necessitates remote access. With this adoption of modern IT standards, control systems are also exposed to the inherent vulnerabilities of the corresponding hardware and software. The consequences of a security breach in an accelerator or detector control system might be severe, and attackers won't ignore HEP systems just because it's HEP. The series of (CS)2/HEP workshops is intended to share and discuss counter-measures, to review configuration and development procedures for secure control systems, and to review the progress since the last (CS)2/HEP workshop

The ICALEPCS MOCRAF workshop group has been created on www. MOCRAF.org to discuss about the organization of the ICALEPCS Motion Control pre-conference Workshop. Its purpose is to get feedback from attendees to make the workshop as interesting and as pleasurable as possible. This group will remain alive after the workshop to be the input for the future ICALEPCS MOCRAF meeting. The aim of the workshop is to be helpful to you the community and so we welcome input (*) on the content and style. After the previous workshop in at ICALEPCS in Melbourne it was suggested that more time should be put aside for interactive group discussions. We are proposing two talks per session each of around 15 to 20 minutes leaving 50 - 60 minutes for relevant discussion topics.

Sardana (www.sardana-controls.org) is an open source, python software suite for Supervision, Control and Data Acquisition in scientific installations. This workshop will demonstrate how to build a complete laboratory control system from scratch. After a quick guide on how to install and configure the Sardana system the workshop participants will start from learning the generic interfaces of the most common laboratory equipment exposed by the device Pool. Afterwards some practical example of how to integrate a new hardware into Sardana will be demonstrated. In continuation a basic course on how to write and execute the user procedures, called macros, will be given. Finally, it will be demonstrated how easy it is to build a modern and flexible graphical interface to the laboratory instruments using Taurus library (www.taurus-scada.org). Furthermore an example on how to mix different data sources in the same GUI will be shown with the how to write a custom Taurus scheme tutorial.
