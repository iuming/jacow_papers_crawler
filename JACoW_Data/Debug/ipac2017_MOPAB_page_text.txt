The future circular hadron collider (FCC-hh) will have an unprecedented proton beam energy of 50 TeV, and total stored beam energy of 8.4 GJ. We discuss current developments in the collimation system design, and methods with which the challenges faced due to the high energies involved can be mitigated. Finally simulation results of new collimation system designs are presented.

The FCC proton beam is designed to carry a total energy of about 8500 MJ, a factor of 20 above the LHC. In this context, the collimation system has to deal with extremely tight requirements to prevent quenches and material damage. A first layout of the betatron cleaning insertion was conceived, adapting the present LHC collimation system to the FCC lattice. A crucial ingredient to assess its performance, in particular to estimate the robustness of the protection devices and the load on the downstream elements, is represented by the simulation of the particle shower generated at the collimators, allowing detailed energy deposition estimations. This paper presents the first results of the simulation chain starting from the proton losses generated with the Sixtrack-FLUKA coupling, as currently done for the present LHC and for its upgrade. Expectations in terms of total power, peak power density and integrated dose on the different accelerator components are presented.

After the High Luminosity (HL) upgrade in 2024-2026, the LHC is anticipated to increase its integrated luminosity by a factor of 10 beyond its original design value of 300 fb-1. In preparation for this, several improvements to the equipment will already be implemented during the next Long Shutdown (LS2) starting in 2019. In the betatron cleaning insertion, the debris leaking out of several collimators will deposit energy in the downstream warm magnets, causing long-term radiation damage. A new layout has been proposed in which the most exposed magnet of each assembly is removed, reducing the assembly from 6 to 5 magnet units and gaining 2 spare magnets. New absorbers are therefore required to enhance the shielding of the remaining magnet string. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the dose to the warm magnets for post-LS2 operation, and we quantify the achievable reduction of the long-term radiation damage for different absorber configurations. A solution for an improved magnet protection that fulfills the HL-LHC requirements is proposed.

The increase of the stored beam energy in future particle accelerators, such as the HL-LHC and the FCC, calls for a radical upgrade in the design, materials and instrumentation of Beam Intercepting Devices (BID), such as collimators Following successful tests in 2015 that validated new composite materials and a novel jaw design conceived for the HL-LHC collimators, a new HiRadMat experiment, named 'HRMT36-MultiMat', is scheduled for autumn 2017. Its objective is to determine the behaviour under high intensity proton beams of a broad range of materials relevant for collimators and beam intercepting devices, thin-film coatings and advanced equipment. The test bench features 16 separate target stations, each hosting various specimens, allowing the exploration of complex phenomena such as dynamic strength, internal damping, nonlinearities due to anisotropic inelasticity and inhomogeneity, effects of energy deposition and radiation on coatings. This paper details the main technical solutions and engineering calculations for the design of the test bench and of the specimens, the candidate target materials and the instrumentation system

In the framework of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Injectors Upgrade (LIU) and the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) Projects at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland), collimators in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to LHC transfer lines as well as ring collimators in the LHC will undergo important upgrades in the forthcoming years, mainly focused during the Long Shutdown 2 foreseen during 2019-2020. This contribution will detail the current design of the TCDIL collimators with a particular emphasis on the engineering developments performed on the collimator jaws, aiming at getting a stringent flatness while consid-ering also the integration of thermal shock resistant materials. The prototyping phase done at CERN will be also described. The activities ongoing to prepare the series production for other LHC collimator types (TCPPM, TCSPM, TCTPM, TCLD) will be presented, describing the role that each of these collimators play on the HL-LHC Project. A focus on the series production processes, the manufacturing and assembly technologies involved and the quality and performance assurance tests will be given.

Crystal collimation is a technique that relies on highly pure bent crystals to coherently deflect beam particles - through the channeling mechanisms - onto dedicated absorbers. Standard multi-stage collimation systems for hadron beams use amorphous materials as primary collimators and might be limited by nuclear interactions and ion fragmentation that are strongly suppressed in crystals. A crystal collimation setup was installed in the betatron cleaning insertion of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to demonstrate with LHC beams the feasibility of this concept and to compare its performance with that of the present system. Channeling was observed for the first time with 6.5 TeV beam and and plans for further crystal collimation beam tests at the LHC are discussed. Results of these first beam tests are presented.

The LHC collimation system provides betatron cleaning and off-momentum cleaning in two different locations of the LHC ring. In the betatron cleaning area, three primary collimators cut the primary halo in horizontal, vertical and skew planes. The beam loss monitors located downstream each of these collimators can be used to diagnose the main plane of loss. We present here a method to identify these beam losses at the LHC and decompose them as a linear combination of loss scenarios using singular value decomposition to calculate Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the scenario matrix. This matrix has been used to evaluate the type of beam losses in different stages of the LHC cycle.

In the LHC, beam loss maps are used to validate collimator settings for cleaning and machine protection. This is done by monitoring the loss distribution in the ring during infrequent controlled loss map campaigns, as well as in standard operation. Due to the complexity of the system, consisting of more than 50 collimators per beam, it is difficult to identify small changes in the collimation hierarchy, which may be due to setting errors or beam orbit drifts with such methods. A technique based on Principal Component Analysis and Local Outlier Factor is presented to detect anomalies in the loss maps and therefore provide an automatic check of the collimation hierarchy.

Accidental beam impacts on the tertiary collimators (TCTs) can lead to significant energy deposition in the triplet region and to leakage of the induced particle shower towards the experimental cavern. In this work, carried out in the context of the planned High Luminosity Upgrade of the LHC, severe impacts from asynchronous beam dumps on the horizontal tertiary collimators in cells 4 and 6 of the CMS insertion were studied, with half or a full proton bunch impacting on a collimator jaw. The choice of jaw material is shown to be of great importance, with over a factor of 10 increase in peak energy density values in the triplet coils moving from tungsten (Inermet) to molybdenum graphite jaws. Nevertheless, although the quench limit is exceeded in at least one or more triplet magnets in all the evaluated scenarios, values remain well below the damage limit. Energy spectra of particles leaking into the experimental cavern have also been estimated and are presented here.

While the LHC has shown record-breaking perfor-mance during the 2016 run, our understanding of the behaviour of the machine must also reach new levels. The collimation system and especially the betatron cleaning insertion region (IR7), where most of the beam halo is intercepted to protect superconducting (SC) magnets from quenching, has so far met the expectations but could nonetheless pose a bottleneck for future operation at higher beam intensities for HL-LHC. A better under-standing of the collimation leakage to SC magnets is required in order to quantify potential limitations in terms of cleaning efficiency, ultimately optimising the collider capabilities. Particle tracking simulations com-bined with shower simulations represent a powerful tool for quantifying the power deposition in magnets next to the cleaning insertion. In this study, we benchmark the simulation models against beam loss monitor measure-ments from magnet quench tests (QT) with 6.5 TeV pro-ton and 6.37Z TeV Pb ion beams. In addition, we investi-gate the effect of possible imperfections on the collima-tion leakage and the power deposition in magnets.

MERLIN is an high performance accelerator simulation code which is used for modelling the collimation system at the LHC. It is written in extensible object-oriented C++ so new physics processes can be easily added. In this article we present recent developments needed for the Hi-Lumi LHC and future high energy colliders including FCC, such as hollow electron lenses and composite materials. We also give an overview of recent simulation work, validation against LHC data from run 1 and 2, and loss maps for Hi-Lumi LHC.

Muon beams and colliders are rich sources of new physics, if muons can be cooled. A normalized rms transverse muon emittance of 280 microns has been achieved in simulation with short solenoids and a betatron function of 3 cm. Here we use ICOOL, G4beamline, and MAD-X to explore using a 400 MeV/c muon beam and strong focusing quadrupoles to approach a normalized transverse emittance of 100 microns and finish 6D muon cooling. The low beta regions produced by the quadrupoles are occupied by dense, low Z absorbers, such as lithium hydride or beryllium, that cool the beam. Equilibrium transverse emittance is linearly proportional to the beta function. Reverse emittance exchange with septa and/or wedges is then used to decrease transverse emittance from 100 to 25 microns at the expense of longitudinal emittance for a high energy lepton collider. Work remains to be done on chromaticity correction.

Skew Parametric-resonance Ionization Cooling (Skew PIC) is designed for the final 6D cooling of a high-luminosity muon collider. Tracking of muons in such a channel has been modeled in MADX and matter-dominated simulation tool G4beanline in previous studies. In this work, we developed an optimization code based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). We optimized the cooling channel and increased the acceptance of the channel by using the GA code.

The ARIEL electron linac is a 0.3 MW CW accelerator, extensible to 0.5 MW, being installed at TRIUMF for radioactive beam production. To date, 17 view screen monitors have been installed along the beamline and have proven to be essential tools in the commissioning of e-linac systems. These are populated by two types of beam targets: P46 scintillator screens which provide diagnostics for low duty factor operation, while at locations with beam energies at and above 10 MeV, OTR foils using either Pyrolytic Graphite or Niobium foils are included to provide coverage up to 100's of μA average beam current. The design of the view screen is described including the image acquisition system and beam target selection. The performance thus far of the OTR foils under low duty factor commissioning is presented including quantification of the OTR emission distribution, thermal studies, and transmission of the beam through the linac after intercepting a foil.

A 650 MHz RF deflecting mode cavity is required for the ARIEL electron Linac to separate interleaved beams bound for either rare isotope production or a recirculation loop containing a Free Electron Laser. An RF separator will allow both modes to run simultaneously by imparting opposite transverse deflection to adjacent bunches at 1.3 GHz. The SRF cavity has been designed to provide up to 0.6 MV transverse voltage for operation with up to a 50 MeV CW electron beam. The design was optimised for compact geometry with high shunt impedance. Due to the low dissipated power, the cavity will operate at 4 K and allows for investigations into low cost fabrication techniques. The cavity is being machined from bulk reactor grade ingot Niobium and welds will be performed using TIG welding in an ultra-pure Argon chamber. Results of fabrication studies will be presented as well as measurements performed on a copper prototype cavity.

Beam characteristics at low energy are an absolute necessity for an acceptable injection in the next stage of a linear accelerator, and are also necessary to reduce beam loss and radiation inside the machine. CEA is taking part of ESS linac construction, by designing Emittance Measurement Units (EMU) for the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT). The EMU are designed to qualify the proton beam produced by the INFN Catania ion source. This measurement has been decided to be time resolved, allowing to follow the beam emittance reduction, during the pulse length. A 1Mhz acquisition board controlled by EPICS save raw datas to an archiver in order to be able to post process the measurements for time resolution. The design corresponds to an Allison's scanner, using entrance and exit slits, electrostatic plates and a faraday cup. The beamstopper protects the device and can be removable to fit to beam power. It has been manufactured by the CEA/LITEN with copper tungsten HIP technique. This article report the first measurements on the ESS injector at INFN CATANIA.

In different processes of relativistic electron interaction with substance and external fields, the electron loses part of its Coulomb field and becomes half-bare. Such state of electron significantly modifies the characteristics of its electromagnetic radiation during further interaction of the particle with substance. We propose to study the influence of the half-bare state of electron upon its transition radiation (TR). The existence of such influence for the case of electron undressing at its scattering was theoretically predicted. We intend to obtain the electrons in half-bare state in the result of their crossing of a conducting screen such as a TR screen. We propose to investigate the influence of the half-bare state of electron in this process upon TR generated by such electron on a downstream TR screen situated on some distance from the upstream screen which undresses the particle. Calculations are presented for the case of a 45-MeV linac and the distance between the screens in the region between 100 mm and 300 mm. The proposed experiment is expected to reveal new features of TR signal in such process comparing to previous measurements.

SPESO is an experiment installed in the Linac of Synchrotron SOLEIL to study the Coherent Smith-Purcell radiation produced when a grating is approached from the beam. The detectors used to measure this radiation are mounted on 3-translation axis and 2 rotation axis. This allows measurements of the radiation emission map around the grating. In addition a polarizer has been added in 2016 allowing to study the two polarization components of the radiation in this map. Preliminary results of this mapping will be presented.

We report on measurements of Coherent Smith-Purcell radiation at the CLIO Free Electron Laser. Smith-Purcell radiation is emitted when a grating is brought close from a bunch of relativistic particles. When the bunch is sufficiently short coherent radiation is emitted. This coherent radiation encodes the longitudinal form factor of the bunch and can therefore be used as a longitudinal profile monitor. With its short pulses and high charge the 45 MeV Linac of CLIO is a good location to test advanced longitudinal profile diag- nostics. The results will be compared with measurements using the RF dephasing. induced energy dispersion.

The SuperKEKB e+-e− collider aims to reach a very high luminosity of 8×10 35 cm'2s'1, using highly focused ultra-low emittance bunches colliding every 4ns. To meet the requirement of the dithering feedback system used to stabilize the horizontal orbit at the IP (interaction point), a relative precision of 10 '3 in 1ms is specified for the fast luminosity monitoring, which can be in principle achieved thanks to the large cross section of the radiative Bhabha process. This paper firstly presents the fraction of detected Bhabha scattering positrons with a new beam pipe arrangement coupled with a Tungsten radiator to be installed in the Low Energy Ring; Then the characteristics of signals from a sCVD diamond detector with thickness of 140'm coupled with a broadband current amplifier were studied based on tests with a Sr-90 source; Finally, simulated results for the reconstructed luminosity and the relative precision with different assumed luminosities are also reported.

An estimation of the longitudinal dimensions for short electron bunches in an accelerating field is an important diagnostic and can be extremely helpful in evaluating the performance of an accelerator. We investigate a method for close estimation of bunch length for sub-picosecond electron bunches from the measurement of their energy spreads. Three or more measurements for the bunch energy spread are made by varying the phase of the accelerating structure and later a reconstruction of the bunch longitudinal dimensions, namely bunch length, initial energy spread and chirp at the entrance of the accelerating structure are obtained using the least square method. A comparison of the obtained results with ASTRA simulations is also included to validate the 3-phase method for sub-ps electron bunches. It is a simple method from both understanding (easy reconstruction using transport matrices) and experimental point of views (multiple measurements of energy spread with varying phase of the accelerating structure).

For Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2), as well as other high-intensity accelerators, beam halo has been an important aspect reducing the machine performance and activating the components. It is imperative to clearly understand the mechanisms that lead to halo formation and to test the avail- able theoretical models with an adequate experiment setup. In this paper, the experimental measurement of the beam halo formation from beam gas scattering is presented. The upgrading of an OTR/YAG screen monitor for future halo study is also introduced.

Diagnostic refurbishments are ongoing in the booster synchrotron in preparation for the near future Variable pulse Storage Ring (VSR) project at BESSY II. Essential orbit measurements have been re-installed after almost two decades of latency. This diagnostic will help assess the effectiveness of the possible upgrade scenarios such as quasi-low-alpha operation and extraction optimization. The contribution presents the preliminary results of the continual global upgrade of the injector systems.

The upgrade of the BESSY II storage ring to BESSY VSR* demands additional beam diagnostics for machine commissioning and development. Especially bunch resolved measurements are needed. Currently, transverse beam size measurements are done with X-ray pinhole monitor systems, which cannot provide bunch resolved information. Alternative methods to measure the transverse beam size using synchrotron radiation in the visible spectrum are interferometric techniques, which could also be upgraded to bunch resolved systems. For that purpose a double slit interferometer has been constructed. Commissioning of the system has started and experimental results are discussed and compared with the existing pinhole system.

The Berlin Energy Recovery Linac project has taken shape during the past year. The magnets have been set up in the newly constructed subterraneous hall; first electrons are expected in the SRF-gun test laboratory in June 2017. Starting in February 2018 the complete gun module will be transferred to the accelerator hall for the commissioning of BERLinPro. For the first months, operation is planned without further accelerating structures (booster and linac), due to delays in their fabrication. Several modes of operation are applicable at this early stage [1]. The available hardware is displayed and the adapted optics at 2.7 MeV and at 6.5 MeV (including the booster) are presented. The trajectory distortions under the influence of the earth magnetic field are studied. The concept for trajectory correction is outlined.

The FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) accelerator facility presently under construction at GSI will supply a wide range of ion species and beam intensities for physics experiments. Design beam intensities range from 2.5·1013 protons/cycle to be delivered to the pBar-target and separator for production of antiprotons, to beams of e.g. 109 ions/s in the case of slowly extracted beams. The main synchrotron of FAIR is the fast ramped super-conducting SIS100. In the present layout SIS100 will deliver up to 4·1011 U-28+ ions/s with energies of 400-2700 MeV/u, either in single bunches of 30-90 ns, or as slowly extracted beam with extraction times of several seconds, for the radioactive ion beam program of FAIR. This contribution gives an overview of the present layout of beam diagnostic instruments for SIS100 and presents the status of the main development projects regarding e.g. the beam position monitor system, ionization profile monitor and the beam current transformers.

Nowadays, cryogenic current comparators (CCCs) are among the most accurate devices for measuring extremely small electric currents. Probably the most interesting property of this equipment, is the excellent position independence of the current passing through it. This feature motivated the use of CCCs for beam instrumentation in particle accelerators. A typical CCC consists of a ferrite core, a pick-up coil, a superconducting quantum interference device, appropriate electronics and superconducting shielding consisting of a meander structure. This configuration offers a strong attenuation for all the magnetic field components, except for the azimuthal one. Thus, high precision measurements of extremely low beam currents are made possible. The damping performance of this device is analysed in this work. A 3D finite element (FE) analysis has been carried out and the computed results were compared to an analytical model*. Furthermore, in order to reduce the computation time, a 2.5D FE model is also proposed and discussed.

For future experiments with the HADES and CBM detectors at FAIR in Darmstadt, a radiation hard and fast beam detector is required. The beam detector has to perform precise T0 measurements (σT0 < 50 ps) and should also offer beam monitoring capabilities. These tasks can be fulfilled by utilizing single-crystal Chemical Vapor Deposition (scCVD) diamond based detectors. For research and development of such detectors, a test set-up will be installed at the Superconducting Darmstadt Electron Linear Accelerator (S-DALINAC) of TU Darmstadt. A read-out system for a beam monitoring and diagnostics system is currently under development. It is based on the already well established TRB3 platform, which can provide FPGA based signal discriminators and high precision FPGA-TDCs with on-line monitoring capabilities. In this contribution the concept and the performance of a prototype beam monitoring system will be discussed. Furthermore the preparatory work, with particular focus on the beam-line simulations, for a multipurpose beam detector test set-up at the S-DALINAC will be addressed.

Space charge lenses use a confined electron cloud for the focusing of ion beams. The electron density gives the focusing strength whereas the density distribution influences the mapping quality of the space charge lens and is related to the confinement. The major role of the electron density with respect to the focusing quality has been pointed out many times in the past *,**. With an automated measurement system the radial light density profile, plasma stability and mean value of the electron density have been measured in respect to the confining fields and the pressure. The results are summarized in 3D-maps. The theoretical model approximations for space charge lenses predicts high electron densities then measured. With the automated system the realistic 3D-maps can be considered instead of an approximation of a theoretical density including knowledge of the most stable electron cloud achievable within the parameter range of the lens. The experimental results of the automated measurement system will be presented here and a concept of a control system for this type of space charge lenses will be explained.

PETRA III is a 6 GeV third generation synchrotron light source in Hamburg, Germany. The storage ring is operated with a typical beam current of 100 mA and is running in top-up mode. The beam delivered to PETRA III is accelerated by a fast cycling booster synchrotron (DESY II), extracted in a 203 m long beam transport line (E-Weg) and injected afterwards into PETRA III. In the framework of PETRA IV upgrade scenarios the potential for decreasing the extracted emittance from DESY II has been investigated which can be achieved by lowering the extraction energy to 5 GeV and increasing the focusing in DESY II. In addition measuring the emittance of the extracted beam from DESY II and the optics in the beam transport line can help to better understand and improve the injection efficiency of PETRA III. By changing the quadrupole strength and measuring the beam size downstream on a screen monitor in the E-Weg the emittance of DESY II and the Twiss functions at the quadrupole in the E-Weg have been determined. Measurements at different energies and tunes of DESY II will be shown and compared with calculations.

Synchrotron radiation interferometry is widely used at modern 3rd generation light sources in order to measure transverse electron beam sizes. The technique is based on probing of the spatial coherency of synchrotron radiation in the visible spectral region. The light source PETRA III at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) is using this type of interferometer since several years in order to resolve vertical emittances of about 10 pm.rad. In order to overcome some inherent disadvantages in this setup, a new optical diagnostics beamline was recently commissioned with a two-dimensional interferometer, thus allowing to measure beam sizes in both transverse planes simultaneously. This contribution summarizes the status of the interferometer with first operational experience and describes systematical studies concerning the stability and possibilities to increase the sensitivity on small beam sizes using an intensity imbalance technique.

Based on the success of the X-Band Transverse Deflecting Structure (TDS) diagnostic at LCLS*, a collaboration between DESY, PSI and CERN has formed with the aim of developing and building an advanced modular X-Band TDS system. The designed TDS has the new feature of providing variable polarization of the deflecting field**. The possibility of changing the orientation of the streaking field of the TDS to an arbitrary azimuthal angle allows for 3D characterization of the phase space using tomographic methods***. Moreover the complete 6D characterization of the beam phase space is possible by combining this technique with quadrupole scans and a dipole spectrometer. As this new cavity design requires very high manufacturing precision to guarantee highest azimuthal symmetry of the structure to avoid the deterioration of the polarization of the streaking field, the high precision tuning-free assembly procedures developed at PSI for the SwissFEL C-band accelerating structures will be used for the manufacturing****. The high-power rf system is based on the CERN-based X-band test stands. We summarize in this work the status of the projects and its main technical parameters.

A TDS is a well-known device for the characterization of the longitudinal properties of an electron bunch in a linear accelerator. So far, the correlation of the slice properties in the horizontal/vertical planes of the electron bunch distribution has been characterized by using a TDS system deflecting in the vertical/horizontal directions respectively and analysing the image on a subsequent screen*. Recently, an innovative design for a TDS structure has been proposed, which includes the possibility of continuously varying the angle of the transverse streaking field inside a TDS structure**. This allows the beam distribution to be characterized in all transverse directions. By collecting measurements of bunches streaked at different angles and combining them using tomographic techniques, it is possible to retrieve 3D distributions of the charge density. In this paper, a method is proposed and simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of such an approach at the upcoming accelerator R&D facility, SINBAD, at DESY***.

An X-band TDS is a well-known device for the characterization of the longitudinal properties of an electron bunch in a linear accelerator. It is planned that a novel X-band TDS with variable polarization* will be installed within the next few years at SINBAD, an upcoming accelerator R&D facility at DESY**. There are several measurements that can be performed with the TDS, each with specific optics requirements to reach the highest possible resolution and keep induced energy spread to a tolerable level. Quadrupoles will be installed between the TDS and the screen to help satisfy these conditions. In this paper, the requirements for the bunch length measurements, a novel 3D charge density reconstruction technique and slice energy measurements are discussed and some simulation results for the slice energy measurement using example lattices are presented.

The FEL process is determined by the 6D phase space distribution of relativistic electron bunches. Experimental reconstructions of these distributions are therefore a step foreward to understand the beam dynamics and to optimize FEL operation. The reconstructions of the transverse phase spaces can be acieved with tomographic methods. In the injector of the European XFEL, measurements for the reconstruction of the phase spaces were carried out using phase advance scans with multiple quadrupoles. The beam sizes were kept optimized at the measurement screen. A transversely deflecting cavity (TDS) was used to streak the beam vertically. That allows to do longitudinally slice resolved measurements of the horizontal phase space. The horizontal streak required for the slice measurements in the vertical plane was achieved with a correlated linear energy spread and dispersion. In this paper, we present measurement results showing longitudinal slice resolved reconstructions of the transverse phase spaces taken in the European XFEL injector.

Simulation of fs Bunch Length Determination with the 3-Phase Method and THz Dielectric Loaded Waveguides

In this paper, we investigate with ASTRA simulations the capability of the 3-phase method to reconstruct the length of a fs electron bunch. We show that a standard 3 GHz travelling wave accelerating structure is not suited for this purpose, because of the too important effect of the space-charge forces and of the too small variations of the induced energy spread with the bunch injection phase. Our simulations demonstrate that the use of dielectric-loaded waveguides driven by THz pulses would allow overcoming these two limitations and possibly achieving an ultimate resolution better than 5% for the determination of a 6.25 fs rms bunch length at 100 MeV energy and 1 pC charge. The next steps of the study to better evaluate, in simulations and experiments, the possible sources of degradation of the 3-phase method resolution are also mentioned.

In this paper, we investigate with ASTRA simulations the achievable performances for several focusing systems considered in the AXSIS project. We focus our attention on the requirements in terms of position of the focal point and bunch transverse size at this point. We show that they cannot be fulfilled with a solenoid resistive electro-magnet, but that it is possible when using a solenoid permanent magnet. The use of a quadrupole doublet proves to be adequate to fulfil the requirement on the position of the focal point and be very close to the one on the bunch transverse size, which could possibly be achieved by a further optimization of the parameters of the doublet. Finally, we also investigate the possibility to use an active plasma lens, showing that it could easily fulfil the requirements but that several points must be carefully studied before considering its implementation.

With a current trend towards shorter electron beams with lengths on the order of few femtoseconds (fs) to sub-femtoseconds both in conventional and novel accelerator communities, the need for diagnostics with equivalent attosecond resolution is increasing. The proposed design for a sub-femtosecond diagnostic by Andonian et al.* is one such example that combines a laser deflector with an RF deflecting cavity to streak the electron beam in the horizontal and vertical direction. In this paper, we present a tool for the reconstruction of the longitudinal beam profile from this diagnostic data, which can be used both for the analysis of planned experiments and testing of different beam scenarios with respect to their specific setup requirements. Applying this method, the usefulness of the device for measurements in a number of example scenarios, including plasma-accelerated and ultrashort RF-accelerated electron beams, is discussed.

FLASH is the superconducting soft X-ray Free Electron Laser in Hamburg at DESY, Germany. A precise knowledge of the beam optics is a key aspect of the operation of a SASE FEL. A campaign of optics consolidation has started in 2013 when the second beam line FLASH2 was installed downstream of the FLASH linac. We give an update on progress of this effort and on recent results.

Longitudinal bunch measurements are typically done with rf-powered transverse deflection structures with operating frequencies 1-12~GHz. We explore the use of mm-scale, THz-driven, dielectric-lined cylindrical waveguides as transverse deflectors by driving the fundamental deflecting mode of the structure, the HEM11. We give a brief overview of the physics, history, and provide an example with a 5~MeV beam using {\sc astra} and {\sc CST-MWS}.

THz wavelengths provide an excellent scale for electron-bunch acceleration and manipulation. The improvement of laser-based THz-generation efficiencies to ~1% provides a good opportunity for e.g. phase-space manipulation and diagnostics. We describe a simple technique to streak and characterize electron beams. We provide full simulation results and discuss the scaling of this technique to various regimes.

Development and Application of Rogowski Coils as Beam Position Monitors

We have developed segmented Rogowski coils as a beam position monitors at the storage ring COSY Jülich as an alternative to the conventional monitors installed there. These coils feature a torus with two or four segments, each densely covered with an insulating copper wire of 150μm in diameter. The bunched particle beam induces voltages in these segments, which are combined and analysed to yield information about beam displacements in the horizontal and the vertical plane. We highlight our theoretical understanding of position determination of these coils together with corresponding numerical simulations. The integration of such a beam position monitor with COSY and first results with it for a bunched deuteron beam are described. The ultimate goal of this development is a better control of the beam orbit for the very demanding requirements in a future ring dedicated to the measurement of Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) of charged particles.

For electron accelerators, electro-optical methods in the near-field have been shown to be a powerful tool to detect longitudinal bunch profiles. In 2013, we demonstrated for the first time, electro-optical bunch profile measurements in a storage ring at the accelerator test facility and synchrotron light source ANKA at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). To study possible bunch-bunch interactions and its effects on the longitudinal dynamics, these measurements need to be performed in a multi-bunch environment. Up to now, due to long-ranging wake-fields the electro-optical monitoring was limited to single-bunch operation. Here, we present our new in-vacuum setup to overcome this limitation. First measurements show reduced wake-fields in particular around 2 ns, where the subsequent bunch can occur in a multi-bunch environment at ANKA.

4-Channel Single Shot and Turn-by-Turn Spectral Measurements of Bursting CSR

The test facility and synchrotron radiation source ANKA at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Karlsruhe, Germany, can be operated in a short-bunch mode. Above a threshold current, the high charge density leads to microwave instabilities and the formation of sub-structures. These time-varying sub-structures on bunches of picosecond duration lead to the observation of bursting coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. The spectral information in this range contains valuable information about the bunch length, shape and sub-structures. We present recent measurements of a spectrometer setup that consists of 4 ultra-fast THz detectors, sensitive in different frequency bands, combined with the KAPTURE readout system developed at KIT for studies requiring high data throughput. This setup allows to record continuously the spectral information on a bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn basis. This contribution describes the potential of time-resolved spectral measurements of the short-bunch beam dynamics.

The advanced source of Gamma-ray photons will be soon built near Bucharest (Romania) by an European consortium (EurogammaS) led by INFN, as part of the ELI-NP (Extreme Light Infrastructure-Nuclear Physics). It will generate photons by Compton back-scattering in the collision between a multi-bunch electron beam, at a maximum energy of 720 MeV, and a high intensity recirculated laser pulse. An S-Band photo-injector and the following C-band Linac, which are under construction, will operate at 100Hz repetition rate with macro pulses of 32 electron bunches, separated by 16ns and with 250pC nominal charge. Stripline and cavity BPMs will be installed along the linac, in order to measure both the position and charge of the electron beam. Stripline BPM response can be considered linear within a limited area around the BPM origin. In order to use the full BPM acceptance area, without accuracy losses due to non-linearities, we plan to use correction algorithms, developed on the basis of simulations and measurements of BPMs response. In particular, suitable high-order surface polynomials will be used.

A high brightness electron Linac is being built in the Compton Gamma Source at the ELI Nuclear Physics facility in Romania. To achieve the design luminosity, a train of 32 bunches, 16 ns spaced, with a nominal charge of 250 pC will collide with the laser beam in the interaction point. Electron beam spot size is measured with optical transition radiation (OTR) profile monitors. In order to measure the beam properties, the optical radiation detecting system must have the necessary accuracy and resolution. This paper deals with the studies of different optic configurations to achieve the magnification, resolution and accuracy in order to measure very small beam (below 30 um) or to study the angular distribution of the OTR and therefore the energy of the beam. Several configurations of the optical detection line will be studied both with simulation tools (e.g. Zemax) and experimentally. The paper will deal also with the sensibility of optic system (in terms of depth of field, magnification and resolution) to systematic errors.

RF Deflector (RFD) based measurements are widely used in high–brightness electron LINAC around the world in order to measure the ultra–short electron bunch length. The RFD provides a vertical kick to the particles of the electron bunch according to their longitudinal positions. In this paper, a measurement technique for the bunch length and other bunch proprieties, based on the usage of an RFD, is proposed. The basic idea is to obtain information about the bunch length, energy chirp, and energy spread from vertical spot size measurements varying the RFD phase, because they add contributions on this quantity. The case study is the Gamma Beam System (GBS), the Compton Source being built in the Extreme Light Infrastructure–Nuclear Physics (ELI–NP) facility. The ELEctron Generation ANd Tracking (ELEGANT) code is used for tracking the particles from RFD to the measurement screen.

A high brightness electron Linac is being built in the Compton Gamma Source at the ELI Nuclear Physics facility in Romania. To achieve the design luminosity, a train of 32 bunches, 16 ns spaced, with a nominal charge of 250 pC will collide with the laser beam in two interaction points. Electron beam spot size is measured with optical transition radiation (OTR) profile monitors. In order to measure the beam properties, the OTR screens must sustain the thermal and mechanical stress due to the energy deposited by the bunches. This paper is an ANSYS study of the issues due to the high energy transferred to the OTR screens. Thermal multicycle analysis will be shown; each analysis will be followed by a structural analysis in order to investigate the performance of the material. The multiphysics analysis will be extended to the mechanical contact areas with the target frame in order to evaluate the order of magnitude of the phenomena in those regions.

The DAΦNE BTF (beam-test facility) can provide electrons and positrons, tuning at runtime different beam parameters: energy (from about 50 MeV up to 750 MeV for e- and 540 MeV for e+), intensity (from single particle up to 1010/bunch) and pulse length (in the range 1.5-40 ns) up to 49 Hz, depending on the operations of the DAΦNE collider. The beam spot and divergence can be adjusted, down to sub-mm sizes and 2 mrad (downstream of the vacuum beam-pipe exit window), matching the user needs. We describe of the BTF beam transverse monitor systems based on FitPIX detectors, operating in bus synchronization mode externally timed to the BTF beam. We also describe our custom software allowing the acquisition and synchronization of the beam diagnostics with the users data, using TCP/IP calls to MEMCACHED. The performance of the system in a variety of beam intensity, energy and focusing conditions is reported.

In the IFMIF EVEDA project, normal conducting Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) is used to bunch and accelerate a 130 mA steady beam to 5 MeV. RFQ cavity is divided into three structures, named super-modules. Each super-module is divided into 6 modules for a total of 18 modules for the overall structure. The final three modules have to be tested at high power to test and validate the most critical RF components of RFQ cavity and, on the other hand, to test performances of the main ancillaries that will be used for IFMIF EVEDA project (vacuum manifold system, tuning system and control system). The choice of the last three modules is due to the fact that they will operate in the most demanding conditions in terms of power density (100 kW/m) and surface electric field (1.8*Ekp). The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) environment [1] provides the framework for monitoring any equipment connected to it. This paper reports the usage of this framework to the RFQ power tests at Legnaro National Laboratories [2,3,4].

STAR is an advanced Thomson source of monochromatic and tunable, ps-long, polarised X-ray beams in the 40-140 keV range. The commissioning has started at the Univ. of Calabria (Italy). The light source is driven by a high-brightness, low-emittance electron beam produced in a LINAC allowing for the source tunability and spectral density. This note reports on an emittance measurement schema based on the insertion of a slit mask in the vacuum chamber dedicated to the photocathode laser entrance. Results of the simulation of the measurement technique are reported, and the use of the data for the optimisation of the accelerator performance are detailed. The experimental setup and the application developed in EPICS for image recording and analysis are also described.

We present the dimensioning of a photon-photon collider based on conventional Compton gamma sources for the observation of Breit-Wheeler pair production and QED gamma-gamma generation. Two symmetric electron beams, generated by photocathodes and accelerated in linacs, produce two primary gamma rays through Compton back-scattering with two high-energy lasers. Tuning the system energy above the Breit-Wheeler cross section threshold, a flux of secondary electrons and positrons is generated. The process is analyzed by start-to-end simulations. The Monte Carlo code 'Rate Of Scattering Events' (ROSE) has been developed ad hoc for the counting of the QED events. Realistic numbers of the secondary particles yield, referring to existing or approved set-ups, a discussion of the feasibility of the experiment and the evaluation of the background are presented.

We are developing a stable and precise BPM system for the low-emittance upgrade of SPring-8. One of the essential requirements for the BPM is the long term stabilization of the photon beam by regulating the electron beam orbit. Both the single-pass resolution of 100 um rms for an injected beam charge of 100 pC and an accuracy of 100 um rms are also crucial for beam commissioning. Drift sources of the present BPM system have been investigated extensively, such as humidity-dependent drifts coming from the radiation damage of coaxial cables, and the results are fed back to the design of the new BPM system. We have optimized the design of the button BPM electrodes to reconcile reduction of trapped-mode heating and maximization of the signal intensity. Stringent machining tolerance is imposed on a BPM head to align the BPM electric center accurately. A few kinds of the BPM head prototypes were produced and the machining accuracy, RF characteristics etc. were confirmed to be sufficient. We have installed one of the prototypes in the present storage ring to test the performance of the new BPM system under development, and have been obtaining successful results satisfying the requirements.

Inorganic scintillating screens are very useful tool to measure transverse profile of charged particle beams. The cerium-doped yttrium:aluminum:garnet (YAG:Ce) crystal scintillator is used in many accelerating facilities. The scintillating screen shows good resolution comparable to that of OTR screen. However, response to high charge density electron beam, more than 10 nC per square millimeter, has not been clarified. In KEK e+/e− injector linac, the charge areal density (σ) will exceed 25 nC per square mm. Thus, beam tests has been performed on YAG:Ce, LYSO, and BGO crystals for 1.5 GeV, 1 nC/bunch electron beam at the linac. Saturation of the luminescence which causes degradation of the resolution has been observed above 1 nC per square mm in those crystals. We will report the response of the scintillating screens to high charge density electron beam and discuss the degradation of the resolution due to the saturation of the light yield.

At Japan accelerator reserch complex (J-PARC), the linac, which serves as the injector for the downstream 3-GeV synchrotron, accelerates a negative-hydrogen-ion beam (H−) to obtain a 400-MeV beam energy. We use an accelerating frequency of 324 MHz for the accelerator cavities and of 972 MHz. Both the centroid-phase set point at the frequency jump from 324 MHz to 972 MHz and the phase-width control are key issues for suppressing the excess beam loss. In order to optimize a set point of the tuning cavities, we developed a bunch-shape monitor (BSM) to measure the phase width as well as a tuning strategy to minimize the beam loss. In the development of the BSM, the design developed in the INR, Russia. Because the BSM had first experienced to be used between accelearation cavities, we need to protect the leak-magnetic field from quadrupole magnets and outgas impacts to cavities. We installed a BSM again in the beamline, BSM started to measure the phase width and evaluated its performances with a peak-beam-current dependence. We proposed new strategy to use BSM-measurment data for the tuning cavity. This paper describes the BSM development, its modification, and new strategy.

Transverse multipole moments (quadrupole and more) of the beam may give important informations of the beam such as beam sizes, nonlinear resonances and so on. However higher moments are difficult to measure because signal-to-noise-ratio becomes smaller proportional to the n-th order of the beam-radius-to-vacuum-duct-radius ratio. In order to increase the SNR and to extend the multipole order, we developed and installed a 16 electrode beam monitor in the J-PARC MR, which consists of guard-potential-separated 16 striplines. The calibration method, beam test results will be presented.

Multi-turn painting injection scheme is important for high intensity proton accelerators. At the J-PARC RCS, a transverse painting scheme was adapted by adding vertical painting magnets to the beam transport line before the injection point, with horizontal painting being performed by a set of dedicated pulse magnets in the ring. To establish a transverse painting condition, it is usual to base on the pulse magnet current pattern. However, it is more desirable to directly measure the beam orbit time variation for evaluation. A linac beam was chopped to match the ring RF bucket. We thought that it would be difficult to measure the position for each pulse; however, the average position could be extracted by introducing a particular device. For the beam injected into the ring, because the linac RF frequency component was diminished due to debunching quickly, one could determine its position in the beginning of the injection period. However, due to rebunching effect the position determination becomes difficult. This problem needs to be resolved.

In the linac of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC), the neutral hydrogen (H0) generation from the negative hydrogen ion (H−) beam is one of key issues to mitigate the beam loss. In order to diagnose the H0 particles, we installed the bump magnets to make a chicane orbit of the H− beam. To evaluate the horizontal shifts of the beam orbit, a beam position monitor (BPM) is fabricated. The BPM measures the shift-positions with various driving currents of the bump magnets. We employed the WSM to measure the H− beam profile. It also help us to compare the shift-positions measured by BPM. In this paper, the design and the performance of the BPM is described. In addition, we describe how to compare the shift position.

We have been studying a high quality electron beam generated by a photocathode RF gun at Waseda University. The electron beam is applied to a pulse radiolysis experiment, laser Compton scattering for soft X-ray generation, and a THz imaging experiment using coherent radiation. In these applications, longitudinal parameters of the electron beam are important. For this reason, we developed the RF deflector system which can directly convert longitudinal distribution of the beam to transverse with high temporal resolution, and performed longitudinal profile measurements of an electron beam from the RF gun. During a series of experiments using an RF deflector, we found that the bunch had a horizontal angle with respect to z axis. Thus we tried to reconstruct the three-dimensional profile of the bunch by computed tomography* in order to visualize the three-dimensional distribution of the bunch. In this conference, we will report the principle of measurement, experimental results of the bunch three-dimensional measurement, and future prospects.

We have studied techniques evaluating bunch length of micropulses in an electron beam. The bunch length of the electron beam is an important parameter for free-electron laser (FEL) facilities with linear accelerators. In order to obtain high FEL gain at Laboratory for Electron Beam Research and Application (LEBRA) in Nihon University and at Kyoto University Free Electron Laser (KU-FEL), the electron-bunch length is compressed to less than 1 ps in their undulator sections. Using the compressed electron beams, intense terahertz lights were generated by coherent radiation. The power of the coherent radiation was more than 50 micro-joule per electron-beam macropulse. We can extract the information of the bunch length of the electron-beam micropulse from the intense coherent radiation by using narrow-band diode detectors. In this presentation, experimental results of the measurements of the root-mean-square electron-bunch length using the coherent radiation at LEBRA* and KU-FEL** will be reported.

To calibrating a cosmic-ray detector, a low beam current accelerator has been built to generate ultra low intensity electron beams at Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP). The minimum beam charge obtained was estimated to be about one electron/pulse. Beam commissioning has been carried out. The key technologies for achieving such low intensity electron beams are to control the beam using 8 movable slits and to measure the intensity of the beam using 9 movable current monitors based on scintillator. In this paper, principal of operation, instrumentation and programming of the movable slits and movable current monitors are discussed. Some results of beam commissioning are also presented.

A THz undulator with widely tunable gap is constructed and installed at Tsinghua University beamline, which is applied for narrow-band THz radiation and measurements of electron bunch longitudinal structure. This is a planar electromagnetic device with 8 regular periods, each 10 cm long. The field range B=0.15- 0.99 T peak field on axis while changing the gap from 75mm to 23mm. In the experiments, we scanned the undulator gap to measure the radiation intensity at different resonant frequency, thus we can get the bunch length even form factor of the bunch. The demonstrated experimental results show that the bunch of 220pC compressed by chicane in Tsinghua beamline is about 120fs (rms), which agree well with the simulations. The resolution of bunch length measurement with this method can be attoseconds by optimized undulator. Furthermore, the form factor of electron bunch train can also be measured.

Beam profile is a key parameter for high current proton linac. Compact Pulsed Hadron Source(CPHS) has two type of detectors to monitor beam 2D beam profile: scintillator screen and rotatable multi-wire scanner. A retractable chromium-doped alumina (Chromox) screen is used as scintillator, emitted lights when impacted by proton are captured by a 12 bit CCD camera. Nineteen carbon fibre wires with a diameter of 30 'm, 3 mm separated from each other, are used to measure beam 1D distribution. Projection can be measured at different direction by rotating the multi-wire scanner about beam direction. 2D beam distribution is reconstructed from multiple projections with the help of CT. Different CT algorithms, Algebra Reconstruct Technique (ART) and Maximum Entropy algorithm (MENT), are applied to achieve accurate or quick reconstruction. The preliminary experimental results show the two profile monitors working consistently with each other.

Electron bunches with duration of sub-picosecond are essential in ultraviolet and X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to reach the desired peak current. Electro-optic (EO) technique is suitable for temporal profile measure-ment of these ultrashort bunches which is one of the key diagnostics in FELs. An electro-optic monitor based on spatial sampling has recently been designed and installed for bunch profile diagnostic at Tsinghua Thomson scat-tering X-ray source (TTX). An ultrashort laser pulse is used to detect the field induced birefringence of the bunch Coulomb field in an electro-optic crystal and the monitor allows direct time-resolved single-shot measure-ment of bunch profile with an accuracy of 135 femtosec-onds for a 40 MeV electron bunch in a non-destructive way, which can simultaneously record the relative time jitter between probe laser and electron bunch. This paper performs the layout of the setup and presents the current measurement results.

A tune measurement system based on FPGA development board is developed at HLS II. The FPGA development board based on Zynq SOC, have ADC and DAC on board. The FPGA can provide two kinds of signal for exciting the beam: parametric frequency sweep signal and bandwidth limited white noise signal. The FFT algorithms and calculation of tune are running in the ARM CPU. In order to compare performance with the original system which is based on spectrum analyzer, we did experiments with new system based FPGA and original system respectively. The experiments on HLSII storage ring show that the tune measuring accuracy have reached 0.0006 / 0.0001 in horizontal and vertical direction based on sweep frequency of FPGA-based system.

A bunch length monitor using resonant cavity has been designed for the NSRL Infrared Free Electron Laser (IR-FEL) facility. To avoid the restriction of working fre-quency caused by the beam pipe radius, the high order modes of the harmonic cavities are utilized. The position and orientation of coaxial probes are optimized to avoid interference modes which come from the cavity and beam tube according to the analysis formula of electro-magnetic field distribution. Based on the parameters of IR-FEL, a simulation is performed to verify the feasibility of the bunch length monitor. The simulation result shows that the design meets the requirements of IR-FEL, and the resolution can be better than 50 fs.

The beam current transformer (CT) is an important part of the beam diagnostics system as a kind of non-destructive intensity measurement. The beam CT has the strong dependence of the sensitivity and time constant on the time structure of the beam. To measure the macro-pulse beam intensity with 5-10 's length and 238 MHzμpulse repetition rate in the IR-FEL, it is necessary to find a suitable material as the CT core which can meet the measure requirement of the beam current. In this paper, three different magnetic materials were tested to find out that the laminated amorphous core owned the best performance, meanwhile, the mechanical structure was designed. The finished product passed the acceptance test.

Three axially symmetric stripline beam position monitors were installed in the HLS II storage ring and each stripline BPM was machined with button BPM together. Due to mechanical errors of stripline BPM, differences in electrode gains will lead to measurement error for beam position and mutual coupling between beam horizontal position and vertical position. So it is very important to calibrate electrode gains for axially symmetric BPM. A method was proposed to calibrate electrode gains of this kind of BPM. This method is suitable for all axially symmetric BPMs, whether stripline BPM or button BPM. The online calibrated gains were compared with offline calibrated gains and the results have shown that online and offline calibrated electrode gains were basically consistent.

Beam position monitor(BPM) system for the HLS II storage ring were designed in the HLS II upgrade project. This system is composed of BPM, BPM processor embedded with IOC and OPI. Every component of BPM system is introduced in this paper. BPM processors have different modes of data, such as ADC data, turn-by-turn(TBT) data, fast acquirement(FA) data and slow acquirement(SA) data. Different modes of data are used to different applications. Two applications based on SA data of the BPM system, such as BBA for quadrupole magnet center measurement and beam closed orbit feedback, are described in detail. The result of BBA shows that most magnetic centers of quadrupole magnets are in the range of [-1 mm, 1 mm] with respect to BPM electric centers. The result of beam closed orbit feedback shows that beam orbit stability when the closed orbit feedback system is on is far better than that when the closed orbit feedback system is off.

The High Energy Photon Source(HEPS), a third generation light source with the energy of 6 GeV, is under constructed at IHEP. It has an ultralow emittance (~50pm.rad) and small beam size, thus the requirement of BPM in precision and resolution is quite high. Independent supports with high degree of mechanical and thermal stability will be employed for some special BPMs, such as the BPMs near the insert devices. The supports should have high eigen-frequencies to minimize the amplification of vibration from the ground. Vibrations information of the ground around the supports also need be estimated, with which FEA (finite element analysis) had be utilized to simulate the performance of the supports. Measurements of vibrational stability of the prototype supports have be done and compared with the simulation.

The high power Linac places many crucial requirements on the beam diagnostics for the China initiative accelerator driven subcritical(CIADS) facility. Measuring the beam loss is essential for the purpose of machine protections for the facility. A beam position pickup based differential beam current monitoring (BPDBCM) scheme has been proposed for the MEBT section at CIADS. Discussions of the principles for the scheme and the realtionship between beam intensity measurement and the pulse length are presented. Simulations are performed and they demonstrate that the proposed system can be effective at the low enery section for the CIADS beam. This paper describes the proposed implementation that will have the capability of detecting both the instantaneous and chronicle loss in real time.

The Synchrotron Radiation Monitor (SRM) system has been designed and constructed at the Shanghai synchrotron radiation Facility (SSRF) for several years and runs good. However, the monitor extraction mirror deformation is quite common at different facilities, and other reflecting mirrors in the optic path also have surface error and angle error. As we decide to upgrade the SR monitor system at SSRF, this issue is also one of the most import thing what we should overcome. In order to verify the feasibility and evaluate the accuracy, simulations based on SRW code have been done. In this simulation, a dedicated algorithm was developed to reconstruct wavefront. The result and the algorithm is very useful for our experiment and upgrade program. In this paper, the algorithm and the experiments based on Shark-Hartmann wavefront sensor will be presented detailed.

Tank impedance of in-vacuum insertion device is one important source of beam transverse instability, which was expected to be suppressed by transverse feedback system (TFB). For the observation and study of transverse instability affected by insertion device and TFB, sets of an in-vacuum undulator narrow gap setting and TFB gain setting were operated in a beam-based experiment. A bunch-by-bunch (BYB) position on-line DAQ system was employed in the measurement to characterize frequencies of individual bunches. Bunch-train transverse oscillation amplitude variation were curved by harmonic analysis. In this paper, we will introduce the BTB ADQ system, and report on the measurement experiment and related data analysis.

A bunch-by-bunch phase measurement system has been studied to improve the accuracy of phase measurement. Longitudinal phase information will be retrieved from beam signals picked up from the button electrodes. The signals from four electrodes in the BPM are summed by using a 4-way power driver, by which the effect of the transverse beam offset on the phase measurement can be eliminated. Four samples with fixed time interval (typical 100ps) for each bunch, which are taken by a 500MHz waveform recorder with a four channels signal splitting and delaying network, will be used to calculate bunch phase. In this paper, we present the layout of the system and primary experimental results.

A fast beam size diagnostic system is developing at SSRF (Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility) storage ring for turn-by-turn and bunch-by-bunch beam trans-verse oscillation study and fast transverse feedback sys-tem improvement. The system is based on visible synchrotron radiation diagnostic, detected by a Hamamatsu H10515B 16-channel photomultiplier array with 0.6ns rise time. A telescope imaging system is also developing for optical front-end process, with simulation optical path calibra-tion and high-resolution CCD camera reference. A fast pick-up board and amplifiers are designed for analogue signal optimization. The data acquisition and analyse solution is Tektronix oscilloscope with 6GHz analogue bandwidth and 25GS/s sampling rate or four synchronized ADQ14 digitizers with 700MHz analogue bandwidth and 1GS/s sampling rate. By now, we have finished the detector selection, sys-tem setup, data acquisition design and system response testing. The telescope imaging testing and 16-channels data acquisition based on synchronized ADQ14s are under development. A new photomultiplier array with less response time is in plan for strictly bunch-by-bunch diagnostic.

In recent years, the development and construction of Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities are in full swing. For FEL facilities, to generate coherent X-ray, cavity beam position monitor (CBPM) system which consist of cavity BPM, RF front-end and signal processor are employed to measure the transverse position in the undulator section. A generic simulation software package, with the S21 parameters of the real components, for the design of the RF front-end and the optimize of the CBPM system was developed. In this paper, the development of the generic simulation software package, and the experiment results with beam at Shanghai Deep ultraviolet (SDUV) FEL facility to verify the correctness of the simulation soft package will be introduced. The application in the design and optimize of the RF front-end for the Dalian Coherent Source (DCLS) will be addressed as well .

Universal digital aggregator is a device for general signal processing with around 100kHz bandwidth. It contains of 4 inputs and 4 open-drain outputs - all of which are fully programmable. When the number of controlling digital signals exceeds the number of input ports of a device there is a need to either multiplex those signals or process them before the target device. The aggregator can be powered from the target device so no additional cabling is needed, especially considering its low power consumption. This straightforward, complex and portable device can be easily applied where PLC solutions are difficult to implement.

For linac based high power electron machines, beam halo induced by nonlinear space charge force and scattering of trapped ions is one of the critical issues on a machine protection system. It causes additional radiation which can be a heat source on a cryogenic system as a result of uncontrolled beam losses. During the last decades, several instruments have been newly developed for measuring the beam halo distribution. The conceptual design and optimization of the coronagraph based halo monitor were performed to measure the beam halo which has ~ 10-3 contrast to the beam core.

A-BNCT accelerator is being developed as a proton accelerator with a high beam current of 50 mA for effective cancer therapy. Drift tube linac (DTL) with the length of 4.5 m is composed of 1 tank and 48 drift tubes (DTs). Proton beam is accelerated from 3 MeV to 10 MeV. Electromagnetic quadrupoles (EMQs) are inserted into every DT for transverse focusing. Slug tuners and post couplers (PCs) are used for accelerating field stabilization and resonant frequency tuning, respectively. The beam dynamics and engineering design for the DTL are performed for effective beam acceleration, and the design results are in detail presented.

RAON is a heavy ion accelerator for the Rare Isotope Science Project in Korea. The main goals of RAON is to accelerate various stable ions from ECR ion source and rare isotopes ions from ISOL beam line. For the stable beam operation, the beam diagnostics equipment is very important. Recently, we developed a digital board electronics for the button type beam position monitor (BPM) to measure the position of ion beams. In this presentation, design of electronics, beam signal simulation results, and RF measurement test results with a developed button BPM will be described.

At ALBA the standard orbit response matrix measurement with DC corrector magnet (CM) modulation is being upgraded with an AC excitation of the correctors combined with the synchronized beam position monitor (BPM) acquisition data rate at 10 kHz. Several types of excitation waveforms (sinusoidal vs square types) and frequencies have been tested and compared to optimize the measurement precision and repeatability. The data acquisition time of the ALBA response matrix (88 horizontal and 88 vertical correctors) with the new AC method takes 1 minute to complete instead of 7 minutes of the standard technique.

The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) accelerating structures have a four-fold symmetry from the radial waveguides for damping higher order modes. This symmetry allows for an octupole component of the rf fields to co-propagate with the main accelerating field. The effect of this octupole mode has been observed at the CLIC test facility 3. In CLIC the accelerating structures are mounted together on a moveable girders. There are four vertical and four horizontal actuators on the girder, which allows for 5D control in a limited range and for instance we can roll the girder. By observing the beam shape perturbed by the octupole field on a screen downstream from the structure we can determine the roll angle and thus align the structure azimuthally. Here we discuss a possible method and show some preliminary results.

The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) uses normal-conducting accelerating structures that are sensitive to wakefield effects and therefore their alignment is extremely important. Due to the four-fold symmetry of the structures, they allow for an octupole component of the rf fields. By scanning the beam transversely we can determine the center of the structures from the shifts in beam position due to the kicks from the octupole field. We present some initial results from measurements at the CLIC test facility 3 at CERN.

Luminosity scans were regularly performed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as of 2015 as a complementary method for measuring the beam size. The CMS experiment provides bunch-by-bunch luminosities at sufficient rates to allow evaluation of bunch-by-bunch beam sizes, and the scans are performed in the horizontal and vertical plane separately. Closed orbit differences between bunches can also be derived by this analysis. During 2016 LHC operation, these scans were also done in an automated manner on a regular basis, and the analysis was improved to significantly reduce the systematic uncertainty, especially in the crossing plane. This contribution first highlights the recent improvements to the analysis and elaborates on their impact. The measured beam sizes during 2016 proton physics operation are then shown and compared to measurements from synchrotron light telescopes and estimates based on the absolute luminosities of the LHC experiments.

Transverse emittance measurement in a collider is of crucial importance for understanding beam dynamics observations and evaluating the machine performance. Devices measuring the beam emittance face the challenge of dealing with considerable systematic errors that can compromise the quality of the measurement. Having different instruments or techniques that provide beam size estimations in order to compare the outcome and give an unbiased value of the emittance is very important in a collider. The comparison of the different results is as well very useful to identify possible problems in a given equipment which could remain unnoticed if such device is the only source of emittance reconstruction. In the LHC several of these instruments and techniques are available; wire scanners, synchrotron light monitors, emittance reconstruction from transverse convolved beam sizes extracted from luminosity scans at the LHC collision points and from beam-gas imaging in the vertex detector of the LHCb experiment. Those systems are briefly presented in this paper together with the comparison of the emittances reconstructed by each of them during physics production over the 2016 LHC run.

Next generation linear colliders such as the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) or the International Linear Collider (ILC) will accelerate particle beams with extremely small emittance. The high current and small size of the beam (micron-scale) due to such small emittance require non-invasive, high-resolution techniques for beam diagnostics. Diffraction Radiation (DR), a polarization radiation that appears when a charged particle moves in the vicinity of a medium, is an ideal candidate being non-invasive and allowing beams as small as a few tens of microns to be measured. Since DR is sensitive to beam parameters other than the transverse profile (e.g. its divergence and position), preparatory simulations have been performed with realistic beam parameters. A new dedicated instrument was installed in the KEK-ATF2 beam line in February 2016. At present DR is observed in the visible wavelength range, with an upgrade to the ultraviolet (200nm) planned for spring 2017 to optimize sensitivity to smaller beam sizes. Presented here are the latest results of these DR beam size measurements and simulations.

Schottky Based Intensity Measurements and Errors Due to Statistical Fluctuations

The beam intensities at the Extra Low ENergy Antiproton ring ELENA are too low for standard beam current transformers and, thus, are measured with longitudinal Schottky diagnostics. This method is already successfully used at the Antiproton Decelerator since the commissioning of this machine. The fact that Schottky noise is a statistical phenomenon implies statistical errors of these measurements. Simple analytical formulas describing the statistical error to be expected as a function of the frequency spread of the band considered, the time resolution chosen and the background noise have been derived. On the one hand, low revolution harmonics and, in turn, frequency spread of the band analysed lead to large measurement errors as this situation corresponds to low momentum resolution of the resulting distribution describing the beam. At very large revolution harmonics and, thus, frequency spreads of the band analysed, the measurement error increases again due to additional contributions from the background noise.

The transverse damper observation box (ADTObsBox) is a device that makes accessible the bunch-by-bunch turn-by-turn data recorded from the pickups of the LHC transverse damper. This device can provide online transient analysis of different beam dynamics effects (tunes and damping times at injection, for example), while also under development is an online coherent instability triggering system. This paper will provide an overview of the current setup and plans for future upgrades, as well as detailing how it deals with the large volume of data being generated. The results of some analysis that rely on the ADTObsBox will also be shown.

One of the objective of the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) at CERN is to demonstrate the CLIC Drive Beam Recombination concept. An accurate control of the transverse beam parameters is necessary in order to succeed in preserving the beam quality after the recombination. During the activity of the facility we improved our tools and technique for characterising the transverse phase space of the beam before and after recombination. The common quadrupole scan technique was improved by performing constant-beam-size measurement and it was enriched by a tomographic reconstruction of the phase-space. Moreover studies have been performed in order to estimate and subtract the impact of dispersion on such a measurements. An overview of these techniques will be presented with actual measurements performed over the last year of operations of the facility.

Reliable detection of developing transverse instabilities in the Large Hadron Collider is one of the main operational challenges of the LHC's high intensity proton run. A full machine snapshot provided from the moment of instability is a crucial input to develop and fine tune instability models. The transverse feedback system (ADT) is the only instrument in LHC, where a full rate bunch by bunch transverse position information is available. Together with a sub-micron resolution it makes it a perfect place to detect transverse beam motion. Very large amounts of data, at very high data rates (8 Gb/s) need to be processed on the fly to detect onset of transverse instability. A very powerful computer system (so called ADTObsBox) was developed and put into operation by the CERN RF group, which is capable of processing the full rate data streams from ADT and perform an on the fly instability detection. The output of this system is a timing event with a list of all bunches developing instability, which is then sent to the LHC-wide instability trigger network to freeze other observation instruments. The device also provides buffers with raw position data for offline analysis.

This paper presents the design on the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) of an experimental set-up to meas-ure incoherent Diffraction Cherenkov Radiation (DChR) produced in a 2 cm long SiO2 radiator by a 2.1 GeV elec-tron beam. The electron beam is circulating at a distance of few mm from the edge of the radiator and the DChR photon output power is expected to be significantly higher than the diffraction radiation power emitted from a metal-lic slit of similar aperture. The radiator design and the detection set-up are presented in detail together with sim-ulations describing the expected properties of the emitted DChR in terms of light intensity and spectral bandwidth. Finally, potential applications of DChR are discussed.

The Advanced Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment (AWAKE) at CERN aims to develop a proof-of-principle electron accelerator based on proton driven plasma wake-field acceleration. The core of AWAKE is a 10 metre long plasma cell filled with Rubidium vapour in which single, 400 GeV, proton bunches extracted from the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) generate a strong plasma wakefield. The plasma is seeded using a femtosecond pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser. The aim of the experiment is to inject low energy electrons onto the plasma wake and accelerate them over this short distance to an energy of several GeV. To achieve its commissioning goals, AWAKE requires the precise measurement of the position and transverse profile of the laser, proton and electron beams as well as their temporal synchronisation. This contribution will present the beam instrumentation systems designed for AWAKE and their performance during the 2016 proton beam commissioning period.

The construction, installation and initial commissioning of CERN's LINAC4 was completed in 2016 with H− ions successfully accelerated to its top energy of 160 MeV. The accelerator is equipped with a large number of beam diagnostic systems that are essential to monitor, control and optimize the beam parameters. A general overview of the installed systems and their functional specifications will be followed by a summary of the most relevant results. This includes transverse profile monitors (wire scanners, wire grids and a laser profile monitor), beam position and phase monitors (whose ToF measurements were essential for adjusting RF cavity parameters), beam loss monitors, beam current transformers and longitudinal beam shape monitors. This contribution will also cover the beam instrumentation for the so-called PSB Half Sector Test, which has been temporarily installed in the LINAC4 transfer line to study H− stripping efficiency. At this facility it was possible to test the new H0/H− beam current monitor, designed to monitor the stripping efficiency and an essential element of the beam interlock system when the LINAC4 is connected to the PSB in 2019.

A new generation of fast wire scanners is being developed for the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project at CERN. These will be essential tools for transverse profile measurement with the higher brightness LIU beams, and are planned for installation in 2019 in all three synchrotrons making up the LHC injector chain. An active period of development and test has resulted in prototype installations in the SPS and PSB rings. This paper will summarise the design and report on the results to-date.

The CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) is a crucial component of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) injector complex. The PS role is to provide beams of high brightness and with the required time structure. In this paper, we present the results of bunch-by-bunch tune measurements by using turn-by-turn transverse beam position monitors (BPMs). The data from different BPMs are combined together to allow fast and accurate tune measurements for each bunch. The obtained results are compared with the present PS tune-meter system and the specific advantages and limits of this technique are commented and exemplified.

A stable, reliable and well-calibrated beam position monitor (BPM) system is essential for the operation of accelerators. At newly constructed Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), it not only helps us to determine the accelerator parameters, such as Twiss parameters and tune, but also to avoid the damage on accelerator instruments caused by high-energy particle beams or radiation. In this study, we demonstrate a new BPM calibration scheme at TPS storage ring. To excite the electron beams inside accelerator beam pipe by one horizontal or vertical corrector magnet, we measure the response of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of each BPM pick-up electrodes with different lateral positions and beam currents. Depending on the measured ADC responses, we calibrated the beam position monitor system. Simultaneously, because of limited preparation time after every long shutdown, we are looking for a fast algorithm to ensure the measurement could be done easily and finished as quickly as possible.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), a 3-GeV third-generation synchrotron light source located in Hsinchu, is available to users since 2016. During operation, it will inevitably encounter system trips caused by beam losses. Thus, a post-mortem (PM) system is an important tool to analyze the cause of such events. Main functions of the PM system are: (i) PM trigger will be generated when the stored beam is suddenly lost abnormally; (ii) storage of relevant signals when the server receives such a trigger; (iii) PM Viewer to analyze each event and understand the cause and effect of a beam trip event. The post-mortem system architecture, plans and implementation will be discussed in this report.

Modern and future accelerators, such as linear colliders and X-ray Free Electron Lasers (X-FELs), will be capable of producing femtosecond and sub-femtosecond electron bunches with unprecedented intensity. Non-invasive beam diagnostics will be an integral component of such machines. A new non-destructive method, which employs a Left Handed Metamaterial (LHM), is promising as it provides additional flexibility in the generation and manipulation of radiation compared to techniques which use conventional materials. Simulations of the interaction of a photon beam with the LHM target have been performed using CST Microwave Studio. The range over which the frequency responce is negative can be tuned to the bunch length requirements by varying the parameters of the unit cell such as: the dimensions of the rings and the number of slits in each ring. Simulations have also been performed using Particle Studio on the interaction of an electron beam with the LHM. With a flexible resonance in the terahertz range, this material not only offers applications for ultra short bunch length measurements, but it also opens up the possibility to be used to generate coherent terahertz radiation.

Beam scraping is a standard method for beam emittance measurements at low energies and will be applied at the Extra Low ENergy Antimatter (ELENA) ring. However, in ELENA, as in many other low energy storage rings, the scraper is located in a position of finite dispersion which poses a unique challenge when reconstructing the emittance from beam intensity data. A new algorithm for ELENA and other machines that use a scraper in a dispersive region has been developed. It combines data obtained by scraping the beam from opposite sides with information on the storage ring lattice. In this contribution, the new algorithm is presented, tested using simulations and compared with alternate methods for emittance reconstruction.

The conceptual design for a single-shot longitudinal bunch profile monitor using coherent Smith-Purcell radiation (cSPr) has recently been completed. The exploitation of the directionality and the polarization of cSPr to reduce the length of the monitor and to eliminate background radiation are discussed. The linear polarization of cSPr will be used to separate the signal from background radiation and experiments to test this design will be presented. Alongside the conceptual design an investigation to optimize the number of detection channels needed to produce high quality longitudinal bunch profile reconstructions has been carried out. It has been determined that the number of detection channels can be reduced compared to previous experiments if measurement uncertainty and background radiation are minimized effectively.

Calibration of a transverse beam profile monitor is of fundamental importance to guarantee the best possible accuracy and reliability of the instrument over time. In LHC the calibration standard for transverse-profile measurements are the wire scanners. Other profile monitors such as beam synchrotron light telescopes and interferometers are calibrated with respect to them. Additional information about single-bunch sizes can be obtained from beam-gas imaging in the LHCb vertex detector, from the transverse convolved beam sizes extracted from luminosity scans at the collision points, and from the evolution of the luminous-region parameters as reconstructed by ATLAS and CMS inner tracker detectors during such scans. For the first time in LHC, a dedicated cross-calibration of all the above-mentioned systems was carried out with beam in 2016. Additionally, dedicated optics measurements were also performed in order to determine with the highest possible accuracy the amplitude function at the interaction points and at the position of the profile monitors. Results of these measurements are presented in this paper.

Measurements of the transverse beam emittance are of great importance at particle accelerators such as the LHC in order to monitor, understand and improve the performance of the machine. A number of profile monitors at the LHC are capable of measuring the transverse emittance from a range of different processes including wire scanners and beam synchrotron light monitors, each having advantages and shortcomings. It is possible additionally to measure the beam profiles using interaction vertices reconstructed in LHCb's vertex locator (Velo). Interactions between colliding beam particles and between beam particles and residual gas nuclei are used to build up a picture of the beam profiles. To guarantee the reliability and quality of the different emittance measurements, a dedicated cross-calibration was performed during a machine development period in October 2016. The results obtained with the LHCb Velo during this cross-calibration are presented here.

Beam Size Measurement Using High Aspect Ratio LIGA Apertures in an X-Ray Pinhole Camera

For optimal brilliance third generation light sources operate at a low emittance and low coupling. Commonly, transverse beam profile measurements are provided by direct imaging of the electron beam using X-ray pinhole cameras. From these beam size measurements and given knowledge of the lattice parameters the emittance, coupling and energy spread are calculated. Ideally, the pinhole aperture should be formed in an infinitely thin screen. However, due to the penetration of X-rays in the keV spectral range, stacked tungsten blades are often used to form the pinhole aperture. In this arrangement the absolute size of the pinhole aperture is unknown and cannot be directly measured, which affects the spatial resolution of the imaging system. Here we investigate the use of X-ray Lithography, Electroplating and Moulding (commonly known as LIGA) to fabricate high aspect ratio pinhole apertures in a gold screen of approximately 1 mm thickness.

In planning the upgrade of one cell of the Diamond Storage Ring, the DDBA upgrade, it was evident that the electrical installation and commissioning would contribute a significant component of the overall installation time. Given the pressures to minimise the shutdown length, the electrical and instrumentation design was optimised for time effective installation and commissioning. This paper outlines the electrical and instrumentation design for DDBA; explores the installation time determining issues and how these were addressed; and reports on the lessons learnt from the actual installation and commissioning process.

Exact knowledge of beam emittance is of central importance for essentially every accelerator. However, there are only few methods to determine it when the beam has significant space charge. We report on our progress to validate a novel diagnostic method that has been proposed to determine the RMS emittance of an electron beam with space charge. This method uses RMS divergence and beam size data measured at a screen placed in a free drift region for selected values of magnetic focusing strength. A novel algorithm is then used to determine the cross correlation term and consequently the RMS emittance of the beam. Simulations, quadrupole scans, phase space tomography and optical diffraction-dielectric foil radiation interferometry are currently being employed to determine and compare the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) emittances of the 14 MeV witness electron beam at Argonne National Laboratory's Wakefield Accelerator. The results of simulations and current measurements are presented and the advantages of the new technique are discussed.

The majority of optical diagnostics currently used will not stand up to the requirements of the next generation of particle accelerators. Current methodologies need innovation to be able to reach the sub-micrometre resolution and sensitivity that will be required. One technique that has the potential to meet these requirements is optical transition radiation (OTR) imaging. A new algorithm is proposed which incorporates OTR theory, optical effects and beam distribution. This algorithm takes an existing method used for beam imaging and pushes the limits resolution beyond that normally attainable. In doing so, it can provide a reliable and economical diagnostic for future accelerators. A discussion on further applications of the algorithm is also presented.

Supersonic gas jets have been used in transverse beam profile monitoring as Ionization Profile Monitors (IPMs) and Beam Induced Fluorescence (BIF) monitors. The former method images ions generated by the projectile beam, whilst the latter is based on the detection of photons. This is a promising technology for use in high energy accelerators, such as the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HLLHC). In this paper, the suitability of a supersonic gas jet in combination with a BIF detection system for the measurement of the transverse beam profile of a low energy electron beam is discussed. The technical layout and experimental results from measurements at a test installation at the Cockcroft Institute are also presented.

In the next decade the Fermilab Muon Campus will host two world class experiments dedicated to the search for signals of new physics. The Muon g-2 experiment will determine with unprecedented precision the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The Mu2e experiment will improve by four orders of magnitude the sensitivity on the search for the as-yet unobserved Charged Lepton Flavor Violation process of a neutrinoless conversion of a muon to an electron. Maintaining and preserving a high density of particles in phase-space is an important requirement for both experiments. This paper presents a new experimental method for mapping the transverse phase space of a particle beam based on tomographic principles. We simulate our technique using the tracking code GEANT4, to ascertain accuracy of the reconstruction. Then we apply the technique to a series of proof-of-principle simulation tests to study injection, transport and extraction of muon and proton beams for the Fermilab g-2 and Mu2e Experiments.

The Fermilab Muon Campus will host the Muon g-2 experiment - a world class experiment dedicated to the search for signals of new physics. Strict demands are placed on the beam diagnostics in order to ensure delivery of high quality beams to the storage ring with minimal losses. In this study, we briefly describe the available secondary beam diagnostics for the Fermilab Muon Campus. Then, with the aid of numerical simulations we detail their interaction with the secondary beam. Finally, we compare our results against theoretical findings.

Muons, Inc. proposes to develop a Residual-Gas Beam Profile Monitor for Transfer Lines with pulse-to-pulse precision of better than 0.1 mm in position and size that will operate over a wide range of proton beam intensities including those needed for multi-MW beams of future facilities. Traditional solid-based beam intercepting instrumentation produces unallowable levels of radiation at high powers. Our alternative approach is to use a low mass residual-gas profile monitor, where ionization electrons are collected along extended magnetic field lines and the gas composition and pressure in the beam pipe are locally controlled to minimize unwanted radiation and to improve resolution. Beam Induced Fluorescence profile monitor with mirascope light collection is proposed.

The mean energy, energy spread and divergence of the electron beam can be deduced from laser-Compton scattered X-rays filtered by a material whose K-edge is near the energy of the X-rays. This technique, combined with a spot size measurement of the beam, can be used to measure the emittance of electron bunches, and can be especially useful in LWFA experiments where conventional methods are unavailable. The effects of the electron beam parameters on X-ray absorption images are discussed, along with experimental demonstrations of the technique using the Compact Laser-Compton X-ray Source at LLNL.

SLAC's LCLS-II is a next generation X-ray FEL that will use a CW 4 GeV superconducting linac with nominal bunch spacing of 1us will deliver both soft and hard x-ray FEL to users. In order to achieve the required performance, the SLAC Technical Innovation Directorate has developed a common hardware and firmware platform for beam instrumentation based on the ATCA crate format. We have designed a stripline and cavity BPM system based on this platform that is capable of measuring the beam position at full beam rate. The system will have a dynamic range between 1 pC to 300 pC. This paper will discuss the design of the BPM electronics, overall architecture and performance on LCLS-I.

We describe Bragg diffraction of relativistic electron beams through a patterned Si crystal consisting of alternating thick and thin strips to produce nanometer scale electron density modulations. Multi-slice simulations show that a two-beam situation can be set up where, for a particular thickness of Si, nearly 100% of the electron beam is diffracted. Plans are underway to carry out experiments showing this effect in UCLA's ultrafast electron microscopy lab with 3.5 MeV electrons. We will select either the diffracted beam or the primary beam with a small aperture in the diffraction plane of a magnetic lens, and so record either the dark or bright field magnified image of the strips. Our first goal is to observe the nanopatterned beam at the image plane. We will then investigate various crystal thickness and sample orientations to maximize the contrast in the pattern and explore tuning the period of the modulation through varying magnification.

NSLS-II storage ring started top off operation since Oct 2015. It has been noticed during the user operation that machine lattice was affected by insertion devices (ID). The storage ring coupling, emittance and lifetime vary when ID gap changes. Lattice characterization was typically carried out with dedicated machine study time with low storage current. Due to collective effect, the lattice at high operation current is different. To characterize the machine lattice during normal user operation with little disturbance, a small portion of beam (~1%) filled in the ion gap can be excited by the bunch by bunch feedback system near betatron frequency. Recent development on BPM electronics enables the gate function to detect partial beam motion in the ring. With the gated BPM turn by turn data from excited bunches, storage ring lattice can be measured and corrected with the well-developed tools. We present in the paper preliminary test results with these tools to characterize the lattice and how it improves the machine performance during user operation.

Precise measurements of storage ring synchronous phase helps to understand the machine impedance and improve the high current performance. We present different methods tested at NSLS-II, including the streak camera measurement, relative phase measurement from a high sampling frequency oscilloscope by comparing the beam signal and reference signal. Both streak camera and scope method have high precision to measure the synchronous phase (<1ps). Other methods to measure the synchronous phase include the I-Q detection from BPM electronics, FPM scope have been tested as well. We have used these systems to study the synchronous phase shift at different beam current, RF voltages and ID gaps. Recent results will be presented and discussed in the paper.

A MW-power beam facility is desired to produce an intense neutrino beam for study of fundamental particle physics. It is a critical challenge to measure beam profile in extreme radiation environments. To this end, a novel beam profile monitor based on a gas-filled multi-RF cavity is proposed. Charged particles through the gas-filled RF generate plasma that changes the gas permittivity. The modulated RF signal in the cavity due to the permittivity shift will be measured to reconstruct the flux of charged particles in the cavity. The demonstration is proposed to validate the concept of the monitor. We report the progress of the demonstration test.

High luminosity and high polarization in RHIC require good control and measurement of emittance in its injector, the Brookhaven AGS. In the past, the AGS emittance has been measured by using an ion collecting IPM during the whole cycle. The beam profiles from this IPM are distorted by space charge forces at higher energy, which makes the emittance determination very hard. The effect has been measured with IPM measurement at different energies with RF off to mitigate the space charge effect. In addition, helical snake magnets and near integer vertical tune for polarized proton operation distort the lattice in the AGS and introduce large beta beating. For more precise measurements of the emittance, we need turn-by-turn (TBT) measurements near injection and beta function measurements at the IPM. The AGS has also been modeled to get the beta functions at the locations of IPM. A new type of electron collecting IPM has been installed and tested in the AGS with proton beam. The vertical beta functions at the IPM locations have been measured with a local corrector near the IPM. This paper summarizes our current understanding of AGS emittances and plans for the further improvements.

In modern generation light sources, it is desired to have SR performance at high beam current, low horizontal emittance with small coupling, resulting in intense Touschek scattering, which is the dominant limitation of beam lifetime. Touschek scattering strongly depends on momentum aperture. Understanding momentum aperture is extremely important. NSLS II storage ring RF system has the digital ramp control function, enabling rapid change of the cavity phase and amplitude. This makes the possibility to ping the beam in longitudinal phase space and directly measure the longitudinal acceptance, in contrast with traditional indirect way to understand it from other aspect of parameters. In this paper, we present the tool, longitudinal pinger, its application to characterize NSLS II longitudinal acceptance and localize the momentum aperture limit with SR BPMs.
