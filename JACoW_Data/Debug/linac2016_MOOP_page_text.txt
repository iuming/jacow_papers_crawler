The RISP (Rare Isotope Science Project) has been proposed as a multi-purpose accelerator facility for providing beams of exotic rare isotopes of various energies. It can deliver ions from proton to uranium. Proton and uranium ions are accelerated upto 600 MeV and 200 MeV/u respectively. The facility consists of three superconducting linacs of which superconducting cavities are independently phased. Requirement of the linac design is especially high for acceleration of multiple charge beams. We present the RISP linac design, the prototyping of superconducting cavity and cryomodule.

Carbon therapy is the most promising among techniques for cancer treatment, as it has demonstrated significant improvements in clinical efficiency and reduced toxicity profiles in multiple types of cancer through much better localization of dose to the tumor volume. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, are developing an ultra-high gradient linear accelerator, Advanced Compact Carbon Ion Linac (ACCIL), for the delivery of ion-beams with end-energies up to 450 MeV/u for 12C6+ ions and 250 MeV for protons. In this paper, we present a thorough comparison of standing and travelling wave designs for high gradient S-Band accelerating structures operating with ions at varying velocities, relative to the speed of light, in the range 0.3-0.7. In this paper we will compare these types of accelerating structures in terms of RF, beam dynamics and thermo-mechanical performance.

An accelerating structure is a critical component of particle accelerators for medical, security, industrial and scientific applications. Standing-wave side-coupled accelerating structures are used where available RF power is at a premium, while average current and average RF power lost in the structure are high. These structures are expensive to manufacture and typically require a circulator to divert structure-reflected power away from RF source, klystron or magnetron. In this report a traveling wave accelerating structure is presented which combines high shunt impedance of the side-coupled standing wave structure with such advantages as simpler tuning and manufacturing. In addition, the structure is matched to the RF source so no circulator is needed. This paper presents the motivation for this structure and shows a practical example.

Dry-Ice cleaning is today a well established cleaning method in matters of reducing harmful dark current and field emission in copper RF-structures like RF-Guns such as for the European XFEL, FLASH and REGAE. This led to the idea to clean longer RF-structures, in particular 3GHz transverse deflecting structures for the European XFEL. We developed a cleaning device with the possibility to clean up to 2 m long structures in horizontal position with an inner diameter of not more than 40 mm. Furthermore this device also allows to clean 9-cell TESLA-type Nb-cavities as well. A report of the technical layout and results of RF-tests will be given.

The FAIR facility at GSI requires a dedicated 70 MeV, 70 mA proton injector for the research program with intense antiproton beams. The main accelerator part consists of six 'Crossbar H-type' (CH) cavities operated at 325 MHz. Based on a linac layout carefully developed over several years, recently the beam dynamics has been revised with the scope of finalising the design and thus being able to start the construction of the main linac components. As compared to previous designs the MEBT behind the RFQ was slightly extended, the gap numbers per CH cavity and the voltage distributions were optimised and the layout of the intermediate diagnostics section including a rebuncher cavity at 33 MeV was redesigned. Finally, detailed machine error studies were performed in order to check the error response of the new design and the steering concept in particular. In the consequence, the final parameters obtained from the beam dynamics update are used for finalizing the CH-DTL cavity design by CST-MWS calculations.

Low energy neutron accelerator can be realized by the combination of an adiabatic fast passage spin flipper and a gradient magnetic field. Neutrons have magnetic moments, so that the accumulated potential energies are not cancelled before and after passage of a magnetic field and their kinetic energies change in case their spins are flipped in the field. This accelerator handles lower kinetic energy neutrons than approximately 300 neV. Currently we have developed the advanced version which makes it possible to handle broader kinetic energy range. The design and measured characteristics are described.

The Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) develops, tests and characterizes high brightness electron sources for FLASH and European XFEL. Since these FELs work with superconducting accelerators in pulsed mode, also the corresponding normal-conducting RF gun has to operate with long RF pulses. Generating high beam quality from the photocathode RF gun in addition requires a high accelerating gradient at the cathode. Therefore, the RF gun has to ensure stable and reliable operation at high average RF power, e.g. 6.5 MW peak power in the gun for 650 μs RF pulse length at 10 Hz repetition rate for the European XFEL. Several RF gun setups have been operated towards these goals over the last years. The latest gun setup was brought into the PITZ tunnel on February 10th 2016 and its RF operation started on March 7th. This setup includes RF gun prototype 4.6 with a new cathode contact spring design and an RF input distribution which consists of an in-vacuum coaxial coupler, an in-vacuum T-combiner and 2 RF windows from DESY production. In this contribution we will summarize the experience from the RF conditioning of this setup towards high average RF power and first experience from the operation with photoelectrons.

Normal conducting RF systems are currently able to pro-vide gradients of around 100 MV/m, limited by break-down on the metallic structures. The breakdown rate is known to scale with pulse length and, in conventional RF systems, this is limited by the filling time of the RF struc-ture. Progressing to higher frequencies, from RF to THz and optical, can utilise higher gradient structures due to the fast filling times. Further increases in gradient may be possible by replacing metallic structures with dielectric structures. The DATA programme at the Cockcroft Insti-tute is investigating concepts for particle acceleration with laser driven THz sources and dielectric structures, beam driven dielectric and metallic structures, and optical and infrared laser acceleration using grating and photonic structures. A cornerstone of the programme is the VELA and CLARA electron accelerator test facility at Daresbury Laboratory which will be used for proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating particle acceleration.

FERMI is the Italian externally seeded free electron laser in the UV and soft x-rays, driven by a high brightness electron beam S-band plus X-band linac. In recent times, the linac has been upgraded, leading the final beam energy from the design value of 1.2 GeV to 1.5 GeV. Together with proper management of the electron beam quality, fundamental wavelengths down to 4 nm become therefore accessible to users. Additional upgrades concerning laser systems, diagnostics and RF structures are on the path. We present the FERMI FEL linac status, and provide an overview of running and future capabilities of the facility.

The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) 12 GeV upgrade reached its design energy in December of 2015. Since then CEBAF has been delivering 12 GeV beam to experimental Hall D and 11 GeV to experimental halls A and B in support of Nuclear physics. To meet this energy goal, ten new 100 MV cryomodules (80 cavities) and RF systems were installed in 2013. The superconducting RF cavities are designed to operate CW at a average accelerating gradient of 19.2 MV/m. To support the higher gradients and higher QL (3.2×107) operations, the RF system uses 13 kW klystrons and digital LLRF to power and control each cavity. This paper reports on the C100 operation and optimization improvements of the RF system and cryomodules.

We present results of a proof-of-principle demonstration of the first ever klynac, a compact 1 MeV linear accelerator with integrated klystron source using one electron beam. This device is bi-resonant, utilizing one resonant circuit for the klystron input and gain cavities, and one for the klystron output and linac cavities. The purpose of a klynac-type device is to provide a compact and inexpensive alternative for a conventional 1 to 6 MeV accelerator. A conventional accelerator requires a separate RF source and linac and all the associated hardware needed for that architecture. The klynac configuration eliminates many of the components to reduce the weight of the entire system by 60%. We have built an 8-cavity, 2.84-GHz RF structure for a 1-MeV bi-resonant klynac. A 50-kV, 10-A electron gun provides the single beam needed. Numerical modeling was used to optimize the design. The separation between the klynac ouput cavity and the first accelerator cavity was adjusted to optimize the bunch capture and a pin-hole aperture between the two cavities reduces the beam current in the linac section to about 0.1 A. Standard high-shunt impedance linac cavities designs are used. We have fabricated the first test structure. The structure will be tested with beam in early Summer 2016. Results will be presented at LINAC 2016.
