Not only beam quality of laser wakefield accelerated electron beams but parameter control has been improved in recent years by individual optimization of electron injection and acceleration. We here present novel results of a scheme called tailored self-truncated ionization injection that allows for independent tuning of the injected bunch charge and the acceleration conditions, and results in unprecedented charges of up to 0.5 nC or peak currents exceeding 10s of kA with typical quasi monoenergetic spectra. Beam loading is demonstrated to improve beam parameters if properly controlled. Such bunches are ideal drivers for various radiation sources and potentially for lab-scale beam driven plasma wakefield accelerators.

On the wake of the results obtained so far at the SPARC_LAB test-facility at LNF, we are currently investigating the possibility to design and build a new multi-disciplinary user-facility, equipped with a soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) driven by a ~1 GeV high brightness linac based on plasma accelerator modules. It is in fact widely accepted by the international accelerator scientific community that a fundamental milestone towards the realization of a plasma driven future Linear Collider (LC) will be the integration of the new high gradient accelerating plasma modules in a FEL user facility, as proposed in the approved H2020 Design Study EuPRAXIA. This fundamental goal will be integrated in the LNF facility by using a high gradient X-band RF linac and the high power laser FLAME to drive Plasma Oscillations in the accelerator module. This activity is performed in synergy with the EuPRAXIA and CompactLight design studies. In this talk we report about the recent progresses in the on going European and National design studies and about opportunities and perspectives for the FEL community.
