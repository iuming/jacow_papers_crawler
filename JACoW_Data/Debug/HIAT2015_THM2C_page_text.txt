This contribution describes new technique to diagnose faults with high-voltage components in electrostatic accelerators. The main application of this technique is non-invasive testing of high-voltage grading systems; measuring insulation resistance or; determining the volume and surface resistivity of insulation materials used in column posts and acceleration tubes. In addition, it allows verification of the continuity of the resistive divider assembly as a complete circuit. A simple and practical fault finding data interpretation procedure has been established based on simple concepts. As a result of efficient in-situ troubleshooting and fault elimination techniques, the maximum values of |ΔR/R| are kept below 2.5% at the conclusion of maintenance procedures. The 2015 and beyond acceptance margin was reduced further to below 1% by increasing the test voltage from 40 V to 100 V. The experimental verification of improved resolution has been conducted during recent scheduled accelerator maintenance in May-June 2015 when few unique fault categories have been identified by the ultra-high impedance technique.

The University of Tsukuba's Tandem Accelerator Complex (UTTAC) is a major center of ion beam research in Japan. We planned to install the new horizontal-type 6 MV Pelletron tandem accelerator to replace the damaged 12UD Pelletron tandem accelerator by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 11 March 2011. A three-year plan for the new accelerator's construction was started in 2012. The 6 MV Pelletron tandem accelerator will be used for various ion-beam research projects, such as AMS, microbeam applications, particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) analysis for geoscience and materials research, heavy ion RBS and elastic recoil detection analysis, nuclear reaction analysis for hydrogen in materials, and high-energy ion irradiation for semiconductor and nuclear physics. The new accelerator system consists of the 6 MV Pelletron tandem accelerator, four new ion sources, the Lamb-shift polarized ion source, and twelve beam courses. The 6 MV Pelletron tandem accelerator was installed in the spring of 2014 at the University of Tsukuba. Routine beam delivery and experiments will start in 2015.
