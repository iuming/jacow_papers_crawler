CompactLight (XLS) is an H2020 Design Study funded by the European Union under grant agreement No. 777431 and carried out by an international collaboration of 23 international laboratories and academic institutions, three private companies, and five third parties. The project, which started in January 2018 with a duration of 48 months, aimed to design an innovative, compact, and cost-effective hard X-ray FEL facility complemented by a soft X-ray source. In December 2021, the Conceptual Design Report was completed. The result is an accelerator that can be operated at up to 1 kHz pulse repetition rate, beyond today’s state of the art, using the latest concepts for high brightness electron photoinjectors, very high gradient accelerating structures in X-band, and novel short-period undulators. This paper gives an overview of the current status, focusing particularly on the technological challenges addressed and their future applications to compact accelerator-based facilities.

Tanning of leather for clothing, shoes and handbags uses potentially harmful chemicals that are often run off into local water supplies or require a large carbon footprint to safely recover these pollutants. In regions of the world with significant leather production this can lead to a significant environmental impact. However recent studies have suggested that leather can instead be tanned using a combination of electron beams in a process inspired by the industrial crosslinking of polymers, to drastically reduce the quantity of wastewater produced in the process; thereby resulting in a reduced environmental impact as well as potential cost savings on wastewater treatment. In this talk, initial studies of leather tanning will be presented as well as accelerator designs for use in leather irradiation.

Ac-225 is a descendant nuclide of Ra-225 and has nuclear properties that make it well suited for use in targeted alpha therapy. However, Ac-225-radiopharmaceutical development has been prevented by insufficient supplies of Ac-225. An electron linac based Ra-225/Ac-225 production system has many advantages: the size of the system is relatively small, a high beam current is easily achieved and the cross section of the Ra-225 production reaction, Ra-225(gamma, n)Ra-225, is relatively high. Moreover, the production amounts of impurity nuclides are very small. These advantages can lead to a cost-effective system. With the final goal of implementing such a system, we have been evaluating the Ra-225/Ac-225 production amount in a real-scale system. To provide more cost-effectiveness, we have been considering production of other medical nuclides using the same system. Cu-67 is recently being studied as nuclides for treatment agents. Mo-99 is a parent nuclide of Tc-99m and commonly used in nuclear medicine. We also have carried out the evaluation of Cu-67 and Mo-99/Tc-99m production amounts. The R&D project of radioisotope production using electron linac will be presented in this conference.

MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (MUED) is a pump-probe material characterization technique to study ultrafast lattice dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution. It is a relatively young technology that has the potential to shed light onto some of the most puzzling problems in physics. This complex instrument can be advanced into a turn-key high-throughput tool with the aid of machine learning (ML) mechanisms together with high-performance computing. The MUED instrument located in the Accelerator Test Facility of Brookhaven National Laboratory was employed in this work to test different ML approaches for both data analysis and control. We characterized three materials using MUED: graphite, black phosphorous and gold thin films. Diffraction patterns were acquired in single shot mode and different ML methodologies were applied to reduce image noise. Convolutional neural network autoenconder and variational autoenconder models were utilized to extract the noise features and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The energy jitter of the electron beam was analyzed after noise reduction of the single shot diffraction patterns.
