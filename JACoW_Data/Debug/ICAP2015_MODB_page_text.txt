Big data from both beam position monitor turn-by-turn readings and the designed model are intensively used in the NSLS-II storage ring commissioning. From beam-baesd data, various beam parameters, including Twiss parameters, tune, dispersion, chromaticity, linear coupling, are characterized and compared against the design model. Then, iterative optimizations yield very promising results, such as, nearly 100% injection efficiency, small Beta-phase beat, a diffraction limit vertical beam size, etc. within a short period of time. Various lattice configurations of w/o damping wigglers, high linear chromaticity have been optimized and commissioned successfully also.

The high luminosity large hadron collider (HL-LHC) upgrade envisions an unprecedented stored beam energy of up to 700 MJ. To protect the machine during operation, an efficient collimation system is vital. The hollow electron lens (HEL) is being explored as a possible collimation enhancer for the LHC, based on Tevatron designs and operational experience, for active halo control. A HEL produces a hollow cylindrical beam of electrons through which the accelerator (proton) beam travels, particles that overlap undergo an electromagnetic interaction. As they can operate close to the beam core without being damaged, HELs may serve as soft scraper devices. For the first time a HEL in high luminosity configuration is simulated in the HL LHC using the recently updated MERLIN 5 accelerator libraries. The effects on the LHC beam halo are observed for various HEL operation modes.

Currently there is substantial interest in making precision measurements utilizing storage rings. For example, the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab and the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) program of the JEDI Collaboration require measurements of sub-ppm precision. A set of benchmarks has been proposed* to test the accuracy of codes used for tracking orbital and spin dynamics through storage rings. These benchmarks have been implemented by our group at Michigan State University, and used to test a variety of popular codes. In addition, we track actual lattices, namely the E989 storage ring and the COSY-JÃ¼lich ring at Forschungzentrum JÃ¼lich, and compare the results. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss our findings.

The quasi-frozen spin (QFS) concept of a storage ring for deuteron EDM measurement is based on the fact that the anomalous magnetic moment has a small negative value. Due to this fact, the rotation of spin in two parts of ring with the magnetic and electric fields relative to the momentum can compensate each other. In contrast to the concept of frozen spin we have the freedom to choose the ring parameters and also greatly simplified lattice. We consider two possible options for the lattice based on QFS concept and compare them with the frozen spin lattice proposed by BNL. In the first QFS option, we use completely separate electric and magnetic parts that form a structure. In the second option, we suggest using only two magnetic arcs with two straight sections having the straight elements with magnetic and electric fields. The straight elements have a horizontal electric field of 120 kV/cm and a vertical magnetic field of 80 mT. They provide the compensation for the spin rotation in the arc and at the same time allow having straight electric plates without the higher orders field. This scheme could be tested in the COSY ring at FZ JÃ¼lich to prove the quasi-frozen spin concept.
