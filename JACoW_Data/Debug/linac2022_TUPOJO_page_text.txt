IFMIF-DONES (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility- DEMO-Oriented Neutron Early Source) - a powerful neutron irradiation facility for studies and certification of materials to be used in fusion reactors - is planned as part of the European roadmap to fusion electricity. Its main goal will be to characterize and to qualify materials under irradiation in a neutron field similar to the one faced in a fusion reactor. The intense neutron source is produced by impinging deuterons, from high-power linear deuteron accelerator, on a liquid lithium curtain. The facility has accomplished the preliminary design phase and is currently in its detailed design phase. At the present stage, it is important to have a clear understanding of how the commissioning of the facility will be performed, especially the commissioning of a 5 MW CW deuteron beam, together with the lithium curtain and the beam optimization for the neutron irradiation. In this contribution, the present plans for the hardware and beam commissioning of the accelerator will be given, focusing on the most critical aspects of the tiered approach and on the integration of the procedure with the lithium and tests systems.

Multi-harmonic buncher cavities (MHB) are used in ion linacs to increase the bunch separation so the beam can be injected in rings or used in applications like time-of-flight experiments. The ideal saw-tooth electric field profile of the buncher is achieved in practice by adding several components of its Fourier expansion (multi-harmonics). ESS-Bilbao will develop* a MHB intended to be tested in the CERN-ISOLDE facility. The design and prototyping include the buncher device itself as well as the solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) to power it. The buncher design (finite elements and beam dynamics) has been carried out to optimize it for ISOLDE beams and frequencies of 1/10th of the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) frequency. The testing of the cavity at ESS-Bilbao proton beam injector (before the RFQ) has also been studied.

The MYRRHA design for an accelerator driven system (ADS) is based on a 600 MeV superconducting proton linac. The first stage towards its realization is called MINERVA and was approved in 2018 to be constructed by SCK•CEN in Belgium. This 100 MeV linac, will serve as technology demonstrator for the high MYRRHA reliability requirements as well as driver for two independent target stations, one for radio-isotope research and production of radio-isotopes for medical purposes, the other one for fusion materials research. This contribution gives an overview of the latest accelerator machine physics design with a focus on the optimized medium (17 MeV) and high energy (100 MeV) beam transfer lines.

A 704.4 MHz Crossbar H-mode (CH) drift tube linac has been proposed for performing a radio frequency jump at ß = 0.2. Up to now, the highest frequency of the constructed CH cavities is 360 MHz. Simulations have shown that the operation frequency for an H210-mode cavity can be up to ~800 MHz. At 704.4 MHz, the cavity dimensions become small, which bring challenges for many practical problems e.g. construction, vacuum pumping and RF coupling. This paper presents the performed R&D studies for the realization of such a very high frequency cavity.

A dedicated proton injector Linac (pLinac) for the Facility of Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI, Darmstadt, is currently under construction. It will pro-vide a 68 MeV, up to 70 mA proton beam at a duty cycle of max. 35µs / 4 Hz for the SIS18 synchrotron, using the UNILAC transfer beamline. After further acceleration in SIS100, the protons are mainly used for antiproton production at the Antiproton Annihilation Darmstadt (PANDA) experiment. The Linac will operate at 325 MHz and consists of a novel so called ’Ladder’ RFQ type, followed by a chain of CH-cavities, partially coupled by rf-coupling cells. In this paper we present the beam diagnostics system for the pLinac with special emphasis on the Secondary Electron Emission (SEM) Grids and the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system. We also describe design and status of our diagnostics testbench for stepwise Linac commissioning, which includes an energy spectrometer with associated optical system. The BPMs and SEM grids have been tested with proton and argon beam during several beamtimes in 2022. The results of these experiments are presented.

The Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT) for the Frankfurt Neutron Source (FRANZ) has been redesigned to accommodate a 60 keV proton beam. Driven by a CHORDIS ion source, operating at 35 kV, a newly designed electrostatic postaccelerator has beeen installed to reach the desired beam energy of 60 keV. Additional upgrades to the beamline include two steerer pairs, several optical diagnostics sections and an additional faraday cup. We present the results of beam commissioning up to the point of RFQ injection. Emittance measurements were performed to prepare matching to the RFQ and improve the beam dynamics model of the low energy beamline. Due to the successful operation of the beamline at 60 keV, retrofitting of the RFQ for the new energy has been initiated.

The first tank of Drift Tube Linac (DTL) for the European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS), delivered by INFN, has been installed in the ESS tunnel in Summer 2021. The DTL-1 is designed to accelerate a 62.5 mA proton beam from 3.62 MeV up to 21 MeV. It consists of 61 accelerating gaps, alternate with 60 drift tubes equipped with Permanent Magnet Quadrupole (PMQ) in a FODO lattice. The remaining drift tubes are equipped with dipole correctors (steerers), beam position monitors (BPMs) or empty. The total length of the cavity is 7.6 m and it is stabilized by post couplers. Two waveguide couplers feed the DTL with the 2.2 MW of RF power required for beam operation, equally divided by RF power losses and beam power. This paper first presents the main systems required for the DTL conditioning. Then it summarizes the main steps and results of this high power RF conditioning done at ESS to prepare the DTL for the consequent beam commissioning.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) aims to build and commission a 2 MW proton linac ready for neutron production in 2025. The normal conducting section of the ESS linac is designed to accelerate a 62.5 mA proton beam to 90 MeV at 14 Hz. The section consists of a microwave ion source, Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and 5-tank Drift Tube Linac (DTL). All sections are provided to ESS by in-kind partners across Europe. This paper reports the recent progress on the assembly, installation, testing and commissioning of the ESS normal conducting linac.

Space charge compensation technology using higher-order multipole magnetic field components has been proposed to transport high-intensity charged particle beams for J-PARC LINAC MEBT1. In order to realize this compensation technology in a limited beam line space, we devised a compact-size combined-function multipole permanent magnet. This magnet can produce two multipole components at the same location on the beam line. As a first step, we have designed a magnet to simultaneously generate a fixed-strength quadrupole and an adjustable-strength octupole component using permanent magnet materials. In this magnet model, the magnetic circuit consists of two groups of magnets.

For the commissioning of the Myrrha proton Linac an Emittance Meter Instrument (EMI) has been foreseen. The EMI will be installed in a dedicated test bench for linac commissioning. The test bench will be initially placed after the RFQ with energies of 1.5 MeV, and in later stages moved to other sections of the Normal Con-ducting Linac for operation at 6 and 17 MeV. The Myrrha EMI will be composed by two slit and grid subsystems for measurement of the phase space in the horizontal and vertical directions. For collimating the beam, graphite slits are used, and the beam aperture is measured in the SEM grids placed downstream. Then, the control system performs signal amplification, data acquisition, and motion control, with the different sys-tems integrated in an EPICs IOC. The system, manufactured by ESS-Bilbao and Proac-tive R&D, has been tested on the ESS-Bilbao 45 keV and soon will be integrated in Myrrha facilities. We present the EMI design, with irradiation analysis and emittance reconstruction, and the integration tests results.

The ESS beam instrumentation includes 3 different type of Wire Scanners (WS). Double wires systems are deployed in the MEBT part of NCL, and single wires and flying wire instruments are being tested and installed in the higher energy sections of the ESS linac. First beam tests result from the MEBT systems will be presented. The superconducting linac WS systems are based on scintillator detectors and wavelength shifting fibers are mounted on the beam pipe. The detectors are coupled to long haul optical fibers, which carry the signals to custom front end electronics sitting in controls racks at the surface. The acquisition chain have been characterized at IHEP (Protvino, Russia), ELETTRA (Trieste, Italy), CERN PSB, CoSy (IKP, Germany) and SNS (USA) before installation in the ESS tunnel. The test results of this system design, differing from the standard approach where photomultipliers are coupled to the scintillator will be presented.

The latest beam commissioning phase of the Normal Conducting Linac at ESS delivered a proton beam through the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) into the first Drift Tube Linac (DTL) tank. The probe beam in MEBT consisted of 3.6 MeV protons of <6 mA, <5 microseconds pulse length and 1 Hz repetition rate. Following the delivery of the components at ESS in Lund in June 2019, the commissioning phase with the MEBT was completed in July 2022. In March 2022, the maximum beam current of 62.5 mA was transported up to the MEBT Faraday cup. This proceeding focuses on the status of MEBT including magnets, buncher cavities, scrapers and beam diagnostics designed and tested in collaboration with ESS Bilbao.

Mark Pendleton, et al. The UK’s first and only vertical test facility and associated cleanroom reprocessing suite has been developed, commissioned, and entered steady-state operations at the UKRI-STFC Daresbury Laboratory. The facility is capable of 2 K testing of 3 jacketed SRF cavities in a horizontal configuration per 2-week test cycle. We report on the associated cryogenic, RF, UHV, mechanical, cleanroom, and HPR infrastructure. SRF cavity workflows have been developed to meet the requirements of the ESS high beta cavity project within a newly developed quality management system, SuraBee, in accordance with ISO9001. To support standardisation of measurements across the collaboration, reference cavities have been measured for cross-reference between CEA, DESY, and UKRI-STFC. We further report on commissioning objectives, observations, and continuous improvement activities.

An advanced high-power, high power density, solid state power amplifier (SSPA) was developed to replace Vacuum Electron Devices (VEDs). Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) developed and integrated a resonant-cavity combiner with solid state amplifiers for the Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) at Fermilab. The architecture combines the power of N-many RF power transistors into a single resonant cavity that are surface-mounted and -cooled. The system is designed so that failure of individual transistors has negligible performance impact. Due to the electrical and mechanical simplicity, maintenance and logistics are simplified. DTI demonstrated the basic feasibility of a 50-100 kW class amplifier resonant cavity combiner system at 650 MHz. A single-cavity system reached 15 kW at 66% power-added efficiency with ten of 12 slots filled on only 1 of 2 cavities faces. The system further demonstrated the expected graceful degradation; an intermittent fault occurred on 1 of the 10 modules and the only observable effect was a reduction in output power to 13.3 kW with a slight reduction in efficiency. Combining of multiple cavities was also demonstrated at low power.

The Proton Power Upgrade (PPU) project at Oak Ridge National Lab’s Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) currently being constructed will double the proton beam power capability from 1.4 to 2.8 MW by adding seven cryomodules, each containing four six-cell high-beta (β = 0.81) superconducting radio frequency cavities. Research Instruments, located in Germany, built and processed the cavities at the vendor site, including electropolishing as the final active chemistry step. Twenty-eight cavities for seven cryomodules and an additional four cavities for a spare cryomodules were delivered to Jefferson Lab and first qualification tests were completed on all cavities as received from the vendor. The performance largely exceeded the requirements on quality factor and accelerating gradient. Here we present the status of initial cavity qualification tests, rework on unqualified cavities and final cavity qualification with helium vessel prior to installation in cryomodules. In addition, an update on cryomodule production is presented.

The Proton Power Upgrade Project at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will increase the proton beam power capability from 1.4 to 2.8 MW. Upon completion of the project, 2 MW of beam power will be available for neutron production at the existing first target station with the remaining beam power available for the future second target station. The project will install seven superconducting RF cryomodules and supporting RF power systems and ancillaries to increase the beam energy to 1.3 GeV . The injection and extraction region of the accumulator ring will be upgraded, and a new 2 MW mercury target has been developed along with supporting equipment for high-flow gas injection to mitigate cavitation and fatigue stress. Equipment is being received from vendors and partner laboratories, and installation is underway with three major installation outages planned in 2022-2024. The project is planned to be completed in 2025.

The ESS Target Proton Beam Imaging System has as objective to image the 5 MW ESS proton beam as it enters the spallation target. The Imaging System has to operate in a harsh radiation environment, leading to a number of challenges : development of radiation hard photon sources, long and aperture-restricted optical paths and fast electronics required to provide rapid information in case of beam anomalies. This paper outlines how main challenges of the Imaging System have been addressed, and the status of deployment as ESS gets closer to beam.

A new maintenance-free, high current, high duty-factor H− linac pre-injector is being commissioned for the ISIS pulsed spallation neutron and muon facility. As well as delivering a low emittance-growth, loss-free beam, the pre-injector incorporates a chopper to facilitate arbitrary bunch time-structures. A 50 Hz, 0.9 ms (4.5% duty factor) RF-driven H− ion source operates extremely reliably and with a large available parameter space via a novel microwave ignition gun and a wideband solid-state RF amplifier. A 202.5 MHz medium energy beam transport (MEBT) incorporates eight quadrupole magnets with integrated xy steerers, four quarter-wave re-bunching cavities, four extremely compact beam position monitors and an electrostatic chopper in just two metres of footprint. Beam has been extracted from the ion source and MEBT commissioning is due Spring 2023. Thereafter, the entire pre-injector will be soak-tested offline for a year before installing on the user facility.

Within the framework of MINERVA, the first Phase of MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) project, IN2P3 labs are in charge of the developments of several accelerator elements. Among those, a fully equipped Spoke cryomodule prototype was constructed, it integrates two superconducting single spoke cavities operating at 2K, the RF power couplers and the associated cold tuning systems. The extreme reliability specified for this project motivated to conduct ALT (Accelerated Lifetime Test) on two extra cold tuning systems in cryomodule like environment. Thus, by gathering information from experimental data, many aspects can be enhanced like maintenance plan consolidation, determination of aging indicators and design optimization of the whole system and its sub components. This paper describes the complete ALT process from the studying elements and the test environment design, to the experimental results and findings.
