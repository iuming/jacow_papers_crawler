A new concept for a low cost high efficiency linear collider based on LN2 cooled copper accelerator structures will be described. The collider is expected to have a performance similar to ILC with higher gradients allowing for the potential of higher energy reach at a substantially lower cost per GeV. The R&D status, expected performance, and future plans will be described.

The FLASHForward experiment at DESY is a beamline built for electron-beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration. The drive beams, supplied by the linac of the free-electron laser FLASH, have energies of up to 1.40 GeV, a charge of up to 1 nC, emittance of a few mm mrad, a pulse duration down to 50 fs, and can be supplied at up to MHz repetition rates. In the future, FLASHForward aims to operate as a beam-quality-preserving, high efficiency, high-average-power plasma-based energy booster for FLASH. To achieve this, during its first data-taking period (2018-2021) novel techniques were developed to enable high-quality plasma wakefield acceleration at >GV/m accelerating gradients*. Further, the upper limits of the achievable repetition rate of plasma-based accelerators were explored for the first time with a view to demonstrating high-average-power (>kW) operation**. We report on recent experimental highlights and future plans for the facility.

Intra-beam Scattering (IBS) and other diffusion mechanisms in the EIC Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) degrade the beam emittances during a store, with growth times of about 2 hours at the nominal proton energies of 275GeV, 100 GeV, and 41 GeV. Strong Hadron Cooling (SHC) can maintain good hadron beam quality and high luminosity during long collision stores. A novel cooling method ’ Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) ’ is chosen as the baseline SHC method, due to its high cooling rates. An Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) is used to deliver an intense high-quality electron beam for cooling. In this paper, we discuss the beam requirements for SHC-CeC and describe the current status of the injector and ERL designs. Two designs of injector and ERL will be presented: one for dedicated SHC and another one for SHC with precooler.
