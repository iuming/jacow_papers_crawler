When it comes to applying AI to smart manufacturing, the first problems that come to mind are usually the automatic inspection of products. The reality is we often need to carefully re-define the problems to yield a satisfactory solution and return on investment. In this talk, we share our experiences working with first-tier electronics manufacturing facilities to apply machine learning techniques to their product design process and production pipeline. We will also talk in more detail about several applications in the domains of circuit defect and product appearance inspections, quality control, and the associated edge AI algorithms and machinery we have created to solve these problems.
