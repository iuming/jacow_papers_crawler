TRIUMF fabricated two coaxial test cavities (one QWR and one HWR) in order to investigate the characterization of TEM-mode cavities with standard and novel surface treatments. The cavities are intended as the TEM mode equivalent to the 1.3 GHz single cell cavity, which is the essential tool for high frequency cavity research. Given these coaxial structure, the cavities allow testing at the fundamental mode and higher harmonics, giving unique insight into the role of RF frequency on fundamental loss mechanisms from intrinsic and extrinsic sources. This talk will report the results related to the various heat treatments: 120OC bake, Mid-T bake, and Infusion. The characterization will be over a broad frequency range. In addition initial flux expulsion studies from built in Helmholtz coils will also be presented.
