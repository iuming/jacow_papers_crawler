The Linac4 front-end (3MeV) was first commissioned in a dedicated test stand and then moved to its final position in the Linac4 tunnel. Accelerating cavities will be added progressively over two years to allow the characterisation of the beam with a dedicated measurement line at several energy stages (3,12,30,50, 100 and finally160MeV). This paper reports about the progress and the commissioning experience up to today.
