Since the Higgs boson discovery at CERN, precision measurement of its properties has become the first priority in the field of High Energy Physics. Two laboratories, CERN from Europe and IHEP from China, have proposed large scale circular electron-positron colliders, namely FCC-ee and CEPC. Record luminosities are expected in the center of mass energy range from 90 to about 365 GeV. In this talk the statuses of both projects are reviewed: Following the publication of the first CDR FCC-ee and CEPC entering the phase of consolidation and feasibility study. Special focus will be put on R&D plans, prototyping and key technologies.

Muon colliders are considered nowadays in the landscape of future lepton colliders. Since the MAP project in USA, an important effort is being made in Europe to identify the neccesary R&D to advance towards a Conceptual Design Report in the next years. The talk will review the status of the technologies and accelerator designs and will present the R&D plans.
