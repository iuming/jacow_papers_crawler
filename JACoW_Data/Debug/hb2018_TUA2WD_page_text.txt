FAIR Commissioning - Concepts and Strategies in View of High-Intensity Operation

The Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) presently under construction, extends and supersedes GSI's existing infrastructure. Its core challenges include the precise control of highest proton and uranium ion beam intensities, the required extreme high vacuum conditions, machine protection and activation issues while providing a high degree of multi-user mode of operation with facility reconfiguration on time-scales of a few times per week. Being based on best-practices at other laboratories, this contribution outlines the applicable hardware and beam commissioning strategies, as well as concepts, beam-based and other accelerator systems that are being tested at the existing facility in view of the prospective FAIR operation.

The Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) is a multipurpose high-power proton accelerator facility, comprising a 400 MeV linac, a 3 GeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) and a 30 GeV main ring synchrotron (MR). RCS is now providing 500 kW beams to the materials and life science experimental facility (MLF) and its beam power will be increased step by step toward the design value of 1 MW. MR has been operated with the beam power of 500 kW at maximum for the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment (T2K). An upgrade plan of MR for the beam power of 1.3 MW for the T2K experiment is promoted with a faster cycling scheme.

The RHIC-EBIS pre-injector is a heavy ion pre-injector to deliver multiple heavy ion species at 2 MeV/u to the AGS-Booster at the RHIC accelerator complex. In addition to collider experiments at RHIC, multiple heavy ion species are used for the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) to evaluate the risk of radiation in space in radiobiology, physics, and engineering. A GCR simulator is one of the operation modes of NSRL to simulate a galactic cosmic ray event, which requires switching multiple ion species within a short period of time. The RHIC-EBIS pre-injector delivers various heavy ion species independently for simultaneous operation of RHIC and NSRL. We developed an automated scheme of the rapid species change and it is routinely used by NSRL or Main Control Room for daily operation without assistance of RHIC-EBIS experts. The number of species change exceeds one hundred. This paper describes the automated operation of the RHIC-EBIS pre-injector and the operational performance.
