VEPP-2000 is the only electron-positron collider operating with round beams that allow to enhance beam-beam limit. VEPP-2000 with SND and CMD-3 detectors carried out two successful data-taking runs after new BINP injection complex was commissioned. The 2016/2017 run was dedicated to high energy range (640-1000 MeV per beam) while the 2017/2018 run was focused at 275-600 MeV/beam energies. With sufficient positron production rate and upgraded full-energy booster the collider luminosity was limited by beam-beam effects, namely flip-flop effect. Thorough machine tuning together with new ideas introduced to suppress flip-flop allowed to achieve high beam-beam tuneshift and bunch-by-bunch luminosity values at specific beam energies. The achieved luminosity increased 2-5 times in a whole energy range in comparison to phase-1 operation (2010-2013).

From six leptonic atoms (e+e−), (μ+e-), (μ+μ-), (τ+e-), (τ+μ-), (τ+τ-) only positronium (e+e−) and muonium (μ+e-) were observed. Observation and study of dimuonium (μ+μ-) will test QED and quantum mechanics computations in the new regime. Dimuonium radius is 200 times smaller than positronium; therefore, it has a higher new-physics reach potential in comparison with other exotic atoms. We propose a low energy e+e− collider for production of the not yet observed (μ+μ-) bound system. Low beam energy E(beam)=400 MeV and small circumference Π=30 m of the machine make it inexpensive to manufacture and operate. Large crossing angle (75 degrees)of e+e− beams produces dimuonium with non-zero momentum shifting decay point from beams collision area and providing effective suppression of the main source of background – elastic e+e− scattering. The peak luminosity at μ+μ- production threshold is 8×1031 cm-2s-1. Reversing one of the beams direction allows to study π± and η mesons with high luminosity.

The paper concerns the status of the e+e− collider Super Charm-Tau Factory at Budker INP, Novosibirsk, Russia. In particularly the issues related to the lattice design, collider performance, accelerator systems, CDR preparation, etc. are discussed. The project aims at realization a variable energy flavor factory between 2 GeV and 6 GeV in the center of mass with unprecedented luminosity of 1035 cm-2s−1 provided by a Crab Waist collision technology.

Several novel concepts could help the muon collider become a reality. These concepts include parametric ionization cooling, low-emittance muon production by positron annihilation (LEMMA scheme), production of low-emittance muon or positron beams using the Gamma Factory concept, and strategies to upgrade large accelerator complexes, like the LHC or the FCC, into a highest-energy muon collider. The muon collider workshop organized by ARIES APEC at Padua in July 2018 gathered the international community in order to review the recent progress and to formulate a common R\&D strategy. Several important conclusions and recommendations were drawn.
