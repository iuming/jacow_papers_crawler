Jupyter Notebook is an Open Source alternative to Matlab and similar tools, providing scientists and engineers with an interactive environment capable of advanced numeric processing, graphing and data transformation, leveraging some of the best libraries available in domains as diverse as natural language processing and quantitative finance. Jupyter Notebook supports Python, R, Julia and dozens of other languages, but this tutorial will focus on Python. It will cover how to install and run Jupyter Notebook with Python, the structure of a Notebook (text, code and output cells of various formats), the Python syntax, array operations, data ingestion and transformation with Pandas, graphing and Basic simulation with interactive controls

Over the past few years, Python got a dedicated library for data analysis and predictive modeling, due to its strong community support. The main reason is because Python is easy to learn and can be well integrated with other databases and tools, such as Spark and Hadoop. This workshop will guide you through data science main steps, which includes, reading, analyzing, visualizing and making predictions, split into: 1) Exploratory analysis: first of all, it is needed to explore the available dataset. 2) Performing Data Munging: the available dataset probably contains some issues (as missing values or outliers, which are samples with dissonant values, for example). Before moving on, it is necessary to deal with these cases. 3) Building a predictive model: after data munging, the available dataset is clean and ready to build a predictive model. At this step, it is possible to train a classifier/regressor and evaluate its performance using Scikit Learn library.
