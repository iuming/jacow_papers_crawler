For the 'Frankfurt Neutron Source at the Stern-Gerlach-Zentrum' (FRANZ) facility an inductively coupled combination of a 4-rod radio-frequency-quadrupole (RFQ) and an 8 gap interdigital H-type (IH-DTL) structure will provide the main acceleration of an intense proton beam from 120 keV to 2.0 MeV. The RFQ-IH combination with a total length of about 2.3 m will be operated at 175 MHz in cw mode. The expected total power need is around 200 kW. Due to the internal inductive coupling only one RF amplifier is needed, which significantly reduces the investment costs. At present the RFQ is installed separately in the beam line for conditioning up to the design rf power and for measuring the beam quality behind the RFQ. In parallel, the IH-DTL is rf tuned together with a dummy RFQ outside the FRANZ cave. This paper will present the status of the project with emphasis on key questions like beam dynamics constraints, rf tuning issues and technological challenges resulting from the high thermal load in cw operation.

The CSNS Linac is comprised of RFQ, two Buncher cavities, four DTL accelerators and one Debuncher cavity. The RFQ accelerator is powered by two 4616 vacuum tubes, the maximum output power of each tube is 350kW. Three 25kW solid state amplifiers supply RF power for two Buncher cavities and the Debuncher cavity, repectively. The RF power sources of four DTL accelerators are four 3MW klystrons. Each RF power source owns a set of digital LLRF control system in order to realize an accelerating field stability of ±1% in amplitude and ±1° in phase. The front four LLRF control systems have been used in the beam commissioning of CSNS Linac from the end of 2015. This paper will introduce the design and the performance of the LLRF control system.

The CPHS (Compact Pulsed Hadron Source) linac at Tsinghua University, is now in operation as an achievement of its mid-term objective. Presently the RFQ accelerator is operated stably with the beam energy of 3 MeV, peak current of 26 mA, pulse length of 100 μs and repetition rate of 20 Hz. After the maintenance period the transmission rate of the RFQ accelerator has been recovered from 65% to 91%. The application of the proton and neutron beam is introduced in this paper.

A cryomodule integrating two superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) double Spoke cavities and their RF power couplers is now being assembled at IPNO. It is the prototype version of the 13 future cryomodules composing a 56 meters long double Spoke section which will be operated for the first time in a linear accelerator (linac) for the European Spallation Source (ESS). ESS will be the most powerful neutron source feeding multidisplinary researches. This cryomodule provides the cryogenic environment for operating the two '=0.5 cavities at full power in a saturated superfluid helium bath at a temperature of 2 K. Thermally and magnetically shielded, they will each be fed by a 352 MHz electromagnetic wave, with a peak power of 400 kW, to generate an accelerating pulsed field of 9MV/m. For this operation, the prototype cryomodules includes all the interfaces with RF, cryogenics, vacuum, beam pipe and diagnostics. It will be tested by 2016 at IPNO by use of a test valve box which is also a prototype of the future Spoke cryogenic distribution system, another contribution to ESS. Both prototypes will then be tested at full power at Uppsala university FREIA facilities.
