SwissFEL is a hard x-ray free-electron laser facility that is currently constructed at PSI. This paper gives an overview of the facility, describes the main sub-systems of the accelerator, and summarizes the installation and commissioning status.

The beam commissioning of the ATF2 facility at KEK - a 1.3 GeV prototype of the compact local chromaticity correction final focus system for the linear collider - achieved 44nm beam size, very close to ideal expected size of 37nm, by developing various knobs and improving the performances of the interferometric Shintake monitor at the same time. These results have opened the way to reliable and predictable operation of the linear collider.

High-power electron beam generators in space will enable the studies of solar and space physics, specifically the interrogation of magnetic connection between the magnetosphere and ionosphere. This study plans to map the magnetic connection between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, using a satellite equipped with an electron beam accelerator that can create a spot in the ionosphere, observable by optical and radar detectors on the ground. To date, a number of spacecraft carrying low-power, <50-keV DC electron beam sources have been launched to study the upper ionosphere. The overall instrument weight will likely be dominated by the weight of the energy storage, the RF power amplifiers and the accelerator structure. We present the notional concept of a quasi-CW, C-band electron accelerator with 1-MeV beam energy, 10-mA beam current, and requiring 40 kW of prime power during operation. Our novel accelerator concept includes the following features: individually powered cavities driven by 6-GHz high-electron mobility transistors (HEMT), passively cooled accelerator structures with heat pipe technology, and active frequency control for operating over a range of temperatures.
