The RF superconducting (SC) linac at the Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility (SARAF) is designed for CW 5 mA 40 MeV proton and deuteron beams. SARAF Phase-I has been built to test and characterize the required novel technologies. Phase-I includes a 20 keV/u ECR ion source, a LEBT, a 4 m long 176 MHz 4-rod RFQ, a short MEBT, one 4K SC module that hosts 6 HWRs and 3 SC solenoids and 13 m long beam lines for beam and basic studies. Since 2011, SARAF Phase-I was the first accelerator to use HWR and the first to accelerate variable energy 2 mA CW protons beam. Beam dynamics simulations are used in the design phase, for everyday beam tuning and for beam studies. However, the simulation predictions of the RFQ transmission and the SC linac beam loss don’t reach the required level of confidence. This is assumed to be due to unknown absolute values of initial beam distribution, LEBT space charge compensation, components misalignment and more. The experience of matching beam dynamics phenomena to beam measurements will be presented.

The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility will produce a high flux (1018 n.m−2 .s−1 ) of 14 MeV neutron dedicated to characterization and study of candidate materials for future fusion reactors. To reach such a goal, a solution based on two high power cw accelerator drivers, each delivering a 125 mA deuteron beam at 40 MeV to a liquid lithium target, is foreseen. With theses accelerators, a simultaneous combination of unprecedentedly high intensity, power (2 x 5 MW) and space charge has to be addressed. In this paper, special considerations and concepts that have been developed to overcome these challenges are introduced. The methods that have been applied for beam loss prediction, optimization, beam diagnostic and characterization are presented. Then, in order to have a better understanding of beam loss mechanisms along the accelerator, massive computing activities have been launched: end-to-end particle simulations using a number of macro-particle that corresponds to the actual number of particles that will populate a bunch in the real IFMIF machine. The obtained simulation results are presented and discussed in terms of beam halo and emittance growth.

The European Spallation Source will be the worlds brightest neutron source. It will be driven by a 5~MW proton linac that delivers a 2.86~ms pulse at 14~Hz, which means the peak beam power is 125~MW. This requires a careful design of the lattice structures in order to allow for safe and reliable operation of the accelerator. We will discuss some of the design choices and some of the particular challenges that were faced during the design of the ESS lattice.

The instablility of the China ADS SC section of the injector-I testing facility is investigated. The performance of the beam footprinted at different positions of the instability chart are studies using program and compared with experiment results. A moderate design was chosen to avoid envelope resonances or equipartitioning between different freedom of planes. The longitudinal acceptance is determined by the stabilization of the cavity phase and amplitude. The details will be reported in this presentation.
