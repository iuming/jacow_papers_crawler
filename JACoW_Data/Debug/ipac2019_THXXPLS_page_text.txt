The synchrotron-based MedAustron Particle Therapy Accelerator MAPTA located in Austria, delivers proton beams for medical treatment in the energy range 62-252 MeV/n since the year 2016 and is in preparation to provide C6+ carbon ions in the range 120-400 MeV/n to two of the three clinically used ion therapy irradiation rooms. In addition, carbon and proton beams, the latter with up to 800 MeV, will be provided to a fourth room dedicated to research. After beam generation and pre-acceleration to 7MeV, a 77m long synchrotron accelerates particles up to the requested energy for clinical treatment. A third-order resonance extraction method is used to extract the particles from the synchrotron in a slow controlled process and then transfer the particles to the 4 irradiation rooms with a spill time of 0.1-10 seconds to facilitate the control of the delivered radiation dose during clinical treatments. Presently, proton beams are delivered to the horizontal and vertical beam lines of three rooms. Commissioning of the accelerator with carbon ions has been completed for one beam line. In parallel, the installation of the beam line magnets for the proton Gantry is ongoing. A review of the accelerator and the status of the carbon commissioning, ongoing in parallel with clinical operations, and an outlook to future roadmap projects are presented.

RFT-30 cyclotron has been regularly operated since 2013, and research on the production of radioisotopes (RIs) has been performed using this cyclotron. Fluorine-18 (F-18), which is the most widely-used positron emitter, has been regularly produced and provided to users in universities and research institutes since 2015. In 2018, mass-production of zirconium-89 (Zr-89) is successfully achieved. Zr-89 has a half-life of 3.3 days which is well matched to the circulation half-lives of antibodies. In addition, long-term proton irradiation for the production of germanium-68 (Ge-68), which is one of the typical generator RIs, was also carried out. A generator is a device used to extract the positron-emitting daughter radioisotope from a source of the decaying parent radioisotope which has a relatively long half-life. Furthermore, we are trying to optimize irradiation conditions for the RI production and following processes after the irradiation. The research on the production of other useful RIs and the performance improvement for the mass-production will be accomplished in the future.

Ultrafast electron probe is the new frontier for electron scattering instrumentations. The development in high-brightness electron beam made it feasible to explore megaelectronvolt electrons for Ultrafast Electron diffraction and Microsscopy (MeV-UED/UEM)*. Recent development in MeV-UED [2-3] has enabled broad scientific opportunities in ultrafast material science and chemical dynamics, such as the ripples of monolayer MoS2 and atomic movie of light-induced structural distortion in the perovskites solar cell were captured for the first time by the MeV-UED. Single-shot MeV-UED was successfully employed for the first observation of heterogeneous melting**. In the gas phase UED, real space movie of a nuclear wavepacket passing through conical intersections was sucesffuly recorded ***. To probe and controlling electron motion within a molecule and image bio-molecules in its nature environments, new generation electron scattering instruments with better time resolution, higher sensitivity and real space imaging are needed. SLAC’s strategy for next generation ultrafast electron instrument based on the superconductor RF gun will be discussed.
