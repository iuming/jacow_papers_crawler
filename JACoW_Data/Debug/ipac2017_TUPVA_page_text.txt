The FCC-hh (Future Hadron-Hadron Circular Collider) is one of the three options considered for the next generation accelerator in high-energy physics as recommended by the European Strategy Group, and the natural evolution of existing LHC. Studies are ongoing about the evaluation of the various magnets mechanical errors and field errors tolerances in the arc sections of FCC-hh, as well as an estimation of the correctors strengths necessary to perform the corrections of the errors. In this study advanced correction schemes for the residual orbit, the linear coupling and the ring tune are described. The impact of magnet tolerances on the residual errors, on the correctors technological choice and on the beam screen design are discussed. In particular the effect of the dipole a2 error is emphasized.

The FCC-hh (Future Hadron-Hadron Circular Collider) is one of the three options considered for the next generation accelerator in high-energy physics as recommended by the European Strategy Group. The layout of FCC-hh has been optimized to a more compact design following recommendations from civil engineering aspects. The updates on the first order and second order optics of the ring will be shown for collisions at the required centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. Special emphasis is put on the dispersion suppressors and general beam cleaning sections as well as first considerations of injection and extraction sections.

In the hadron machine option, proposed in the context of the Future Circular Colliders (FCC) study, the first evaluation of dipole field quality, based on the Nb3Sn technology, has shown a Dynamic Aperture at injection above the LHC target value. In this paper the effect of field imperfections on the dynamic aperture, using the updated lattice design, is presented. Tolerances on the main multipole components are evaluated including feed-down effect.

Funding: This work was supported by the HORIZON 2020 project EuroCirCol, grant agreement 654305.
We present in this paper a detailed analysis of the synchrotron radiation emitted by the 50 TeV protons of the FCC-hh in the last bending and quadrupole magnets upstream the interaction region. We discuss the characteristics of this radiation in terms of power, flux, photon spectrum and fans in different running conditions such as, for example, with and without crossing angle. We mainly focus our study on the fraction of photons that may hit the detector, with a full tracking into GEANT4 that simulates their interaction within the central beam pipe.

During 2016 proton physics operation at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an asymmetry of up to 10% was observed between the luminosities measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. As the same bunch pairs collide in both experiments, a difference in luminosities must be of either geometric or instrumental origin. This paper quantifies the impact of the crossing angle on this asymmetry. As the beams cross in different planes in the two experiments, non-round beams are expected to yield an asymmetry due to the crossing angle. Results from crossing angle measurements at both experiments are also shown and the impact on the luminosities is evaluated.

Lessons Learnt from the 2016 LHC Run and Prospects for HL-LHC Availability

The LHC exhibited unprecedented availability during the 2016 proton run, producing about 40 fb-1 of integrated luminosity, surpassing the sum of production during the 4 previous years. This was achieved while running steadily with a peak luminosity above the design target of 1034 cm- 2s−1. Individual system performance and an increased experience operating the LHC were fundamental for these achievements, following the consolidations and improvements deployed during the Long Shutdown 1 and the Year End Technical Stop in 2015. The implications of this excellent performance in the context of the High Luminosity LHC are discussed in this paper, with the goal of defining the possible integrated luminosity reach of HL-LHC when considering the different operating conditions and the newly developed systems and technologies.

Impact of LHC and SPS Injection Kicker Rise Times on Lhc Filling Schemes and Luminosity Reach
2043

The 2016 LHC proton filling schemes generally used a spacing between injections of batches of bunches into SPS and LHC corresponding to the design report specification for the SPS and LHC injection kicker rise times, respectively. A reduction of the batch spacing can be directly used to increase luminosity without detrimental effects on beam stability, and with no increase in the number of events per crossing seen by the experiments. Measurements and simulations were performed in SPS and LHC to understand if a shorter injection kicker rise time and associated tighter batch spacing would lead to increased injection oscillations of the first and last bunches of a bunch train and eventually also a systematic growth of the transverse emittance. The results were used to define the minimum possible batch spacing for an acceptable emittance growth in LHC, with gains of reductions of about 10% possible in both machines. The results are discussed, including the potential improvement of the LHC luminosity for different filling schemes.

As a part of the HL-LHC upgrade, a cryomodule is designed to host two crab cavities for a first test with protons in the SPS machine. The evaluation of the cryomodule heat loads is essential to dimension the cryogenic infrastructure of the system. The current design features two cryogenic circuits. The first circuit adopts superfluid helium at 2 K to maintain the cavities in the superconducting state. The second circuit, based on helium gas at a temperature between 50 K and 70 K, is connected to the thermal screen, also serving as heat intercept for all the interfaces between the cold mass and the external environment. An overview of the heat loads to both circuits, and the combined numerical and analytical estimations, is presented. The heat load of each element is detailed for the static and dynamic scenarios, with considerations on the design choices for the thermal optimization of the most critical components.

We performed extended simulations of LHC dynamic aperture (DA) in the presence of beam-beam effects in the weak-strong approximation, evaluating the contributions of parameters such as: tunes, optics, bunch intensity, crossing angle, emittance, chromaticity and current in the Landau octupoles. Here we present a summary of these studies, giving an overview of the amplitude of the LHC operational space and pointing out the remaining margins for mitigation of instabilities. These studies supported the actions deployed during the 2016 run of the LHC, which aimed at maximising its performances. Examples of such actions are the switch to lower emittance beams, the reduction of crossing angle and tune trims. More recently, DA scans have been used to help the definition of the operational scenarios for the 2017 run. Additional room for improvements, for instance by deploying crossing angle levelling, will be explained.

Multiparametric Response of the HL-LHC Dynamic Aperture in Presence of Beam-Beam Effects
2055

We performed extended simulations of HL-LHC dynamic aperture in the presence of beam-beam effects in the weak- strong approximation, evaluating the contributions of param- eters such as: bunch intensity, crossing angle, chromaticity, current in the Landau octupoles and multipole errors. From the beam dynamics point of view, the main differ- ence between the LHC (until 2017) and the HL-LHC is the deployment of the achromatic telescopic squeezing (ATS) optics, allowing not only for a smaller '' reach, but also modifying the phase advances between the lattice correctors (sextupoles, octupoles) and the main IPs, and increasing the peak ' functions in the arcs. These correctors become therefore more efficient for the chromatic correction, but also a mitigation of the beam-beam long range interactions using the Landau octupoles is enabled, resulting in a possible reduction of the normalised crossing angle. The limits have been investigated in a tracking simulation campaign aimed at exploring the operational space for the HL-LHC and two possible options for luminosity levelling.

In previous work it was shown that at high proton-beam energies, synchrotron radiation is an important source of beam-screen heating, of beam-related vacuum pressure increase, and of primary photoelectrons, which can contribute to electron cloud formation. We have used the Synrad3D code developed at Cornell to simulate the photon distributions in the arcs of the LHC, HL-LHC, and FCC-hh. Specifically, for the LHC we studied the effect of the sawtooth chamber. In this paper specific results of the Synrad3D simulations are compared with simulations in Synrad+, developed at CERN; and later on compared with experimental data for actual LHC vacuum-chamber samples.

In the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study, each nominal proton beam at top particle energy of 50 TeV has an energy of 8500 MJ, which is more than 20 times the energy of today's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) beam. Machine protection of such a high-energy and high-energy density accelerator becomes very challenging. In this paper, preliminary considerations of beam related machine protection issues of the FCC will be reported. Based on the current optics design, a few major critical equipment failures that could potentially lead to very fast (within a few turns) beam losses have been studied. The serious failure scenarios that have been considered, typically occurring at locations with high beta functions, include powering failures of normal conducting magnets, quenches of superconducting magnets as well as critical RF failures. Some fundamental questions related to the beam interlock system, e.g., the need for additional particle free abort gaps to shorten the synchronization time before executing a beam dump, will be discussed.

In the 2013 proton-nucleus (p-Pb) run of the LHC, the lifetime of the lead beam was significantly shorter than could be accounted for by luminosity burn-off. These effects were observed at a lower level in 2016 and studied in more detail. The beams were not only asymmetric but the differences in the bunch filling schemes between protons and Pb nuclei led to a wide variety of beam-beam interaction sequences in the bunch trains. The colliding bunches were also of different sizes. We present an analysis of the data and an interpretation in terms of theoretical models.

For five of the LHC experiments the second p-Pb collision run planned in 2016 offered the opportunity to answer a range of important physics questions arising from the surprise discoveries (e.g., flow-like collective phenomena in small systems) made in earlier Pb-Pb, p-Pb and p-p runs. However the diversity of the physics and their respective capabilities led them to request very different operating conditions, in terms of collision energy, luminosity and pile-up. These appeared mutually incompatible within the available one month of operation. Nevertheless, a plan to satisfy most requirements was developed and implemented successfully. It exploited different beam lifetimes at two beam energies of 4 Z TeV and 6.5 Z TeV, a variety of luminosity sharing and bunch filling schemes, and varying beam directions. The outcome of this very complex strategy for repeated re-commissioning and operation of the LHC included the longest ever LHC fill with luminosity levelled for almost 38 h. The peak luminosity achieved exceeded the design value by a factor 7.8 and integrated luminosity substantially exceeded the experiments' requests.

The variety of beam losses produced in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) creates a mixed and complex radiation field. During 2012, 2015 and 2016, Beam Loss Monitors and RadMons were used to monitor the inte-grated dose and the High Energy Hadrons fluence in order to anticipate the electronics degradation and inves-tigate the cause of failures. The annual radiation levels are compared; highlighting the mechanisms in the pro-duction of beam losses and the impact of the different squeeze and crossing angle. In addition, the increase of beam-gas interaction is discussed comparing operations at 25 ns and 50 ns bunch spacing. A strategy is presented to allow for a continuous respective evaluation during the upcoming LHC and future High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operations.

During the operation of the LHC the continuous particle losses create a radiation field in the LHC tunnel and the adjacent caverns. Exposed electronics and accelerator components show dose dependent accelerated aging effects and stochastic Single Event Effects which can lead to faults and downtime of the LHC. In order to achieve an optimal life duration, the position of the equipment is chosen in dependency of the amplitude of the radiation fields. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the prompt dose distributions along the whole LHC. By using the LHC beam loss monitor and RadMon systems, the prompt dose during the accelerator operation is continuously monitored. Measurements in the long straight sections and the dispersion suppressors in IR1 (ATLAS) and in IR5 (CMS) have shown that the radiation levels have localised maxima which exceed the base line by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. The analysis of these radiation peaks will be presented and the underlying loss mechanisms will be discussed. The results will help to identify areas not suitable for radiation sensitive electronics. Implications on the expected radiation levels for High-Luminosity LHC are also discussed.

Beam quality degradation caused by the Electron Cloud (EC) effects has been identified as one of the main performance limitations for the high intensity 25 ns beams in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). When a proton bunch passes through an EC, electrons are attracted towards the transverse center of the beam resulting into an increasing electron density within the bunch. The effects driven by the interaction of the electrons with the bunch have been studied with macroparticle simulations in order to evaluate, in different operational scenarios, the threshold for the coherent instabilities as well as the incoherent tune spread. This contribution will summarize the main findings of the simulation study and compare them with the available experimental observations.

Impact and Mitigation of Electron Cloud Effects in the Operation of the Large Hadron Collider

In 2015 and in 2016 the Large Hadron Collider has been routinely operated with 25 ns bunch spacing. With this beam configuration electron clouds develop in a large fraction of the beam chambers, in spite of a very large electron dose accumulated on the surfaces. This posed several challenges to different aspects of the beam operation. In particular, the machine settings had to be optimized in order to mitigate coherent and incoherent effects of the electron cloud on the beam dynamics while a specifically designed feed-forward control had to be implemented and optimized in order to dynamically adapt the regulations of the cryogenic system to the strong heat load deposited by the electron cloud on the beam screens of the cryogenic magnets. At the same time, the data collected from the different accelerator subsystems (heat loads, vacuum pressures, evolution of the bunch by bunch beam parameters) allowed to significantly improve our models and understanding on these phenomena.

The LHC injector chain for Pb-ion beams at CERN consists of Linac3, the accumulator ring LEIR, the PS and the SPS. In the context of the LHC injectors upgrade (LIU) project an intense program of machine development studies has been performed in the last two years to maximise the intensity of Pb-ion beams at LHC injection. In this paper we present an analysis of the operational performance achieved so far, with the goal of 1) identifying the remaining performance bottlenecks along the chain and possible areas for improvement, and 2) to optimize the Pb-ion beam production scheme for the High Luminosity (HL-) LHC era. A consistent set of beam parameters for the HL-LHC era has been established taking into account the already achieved improvements as well as foreseen upgrades still to be implemented, such as slip stacking in the SPS.

The High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) foresees the baseline operation of the accelerator at a 5 times higher peak luminosity (5.0x1034cm-2s−1). The impact of collision debris on the magnets and other equipment in the triplet region and matching section of the ATLAS and CMS insertions has been evaluated by means of detailed FLUKA models implementing the latest optics and layout version. Qualitative and quantitative differences between the vertical and horizontal beam crossing schemes are highlighted. With measures in place to mitigate the effects of the interruption of the beam screen in the triplet interconnections and the Q4 aperture reduction, peak dose values in the superconducting coils remain below 30MGy in the triplet-D1 and below 12MGy in the matching section magnets for an integrated luminosity of 3000fb-1. Peak power density values are lower than 3mW/cm3 and 1mW/cm3 in the triplet and matching section respectively. Total heat loads in magnets, collimators, masks and absorbers were also estimated, along with dose and particle fluence maps relevant for Radiation to Electronics (R2E) aspects. The effect of a displacement of the interaction point is also addressed.

Crab Cavities will be installed in the High Luminosity LHC in order to increase the effective peak luminosity through a partial compensation of the geometric factor. This will allow extending the levelling time resulting in an increased production of integrated luminosity. Based on the availability of the LHC during 2016 operation, the expected yearly-integrated luminosity of the future HL-LHC was estimated using a Monte Carlo model. Crab cavity faults were added to the observed failure distribu-tions and their impact on integrated luminosity produc-tion as a function of fault time and fault frequency was studied. This allows identifying a breakeven point in luminosity production and defining minimum system availability requirements for the crab cavities to reach the design goal of 250 fb-1 of integrated luminosity per year.

A small vertical orbit oscillation of the LHC beam was observed following a quench of a main dipole magnet. This effect was thought to be caused by the current dis-charged in the quench heater (QH) strips of the superconducting magnet and confirmed in dedicated experiments with beam in the LHC. Quench heater connection schemes with the largest effect have been identified for the LHC and its future HiLumi upgrade (HL-LHC). Furthermore, the impact on the beam following discharges of the Coupling-Loss Induced Quench (CLIQ) system, a novel technology to protect high current superconducting magnets in case of a quench, was studied to evaluate the possible failure cases.

Several machine development studies have been performed in 2016 at the LHC in order to evaluate the effects of reducing the crossing angles in favor of defining the maximum achievable luminosity in the ATLAS and CMS experiments. At the end of the LHC proton-proton run at 6.5TeV the reduction of the crossing angle from 185urad to 140urad was operationally implemented. The observation of beam losses and lifetimes during this process are analysed and discussed.

The Future Circular Collider hadron-hadron (FCC-hh) design study is currently exploring different IR design possibilities including round and flat optics or different crossing schemes. The present study intends to evaluate each scenario from the beam-beam effects point of view. In particular the single particle long term stability to maximize beam lifetimes and luminosity reach is used to quantify the differences. The impact of strong head on interactions on the beam quality and lifetime is addressed by means of GPU accelerated simulations code featuring a weak-strong 6-dimensional beam-beam interaction.

Long range beam-beam effects are responsible for particle losses and define fundamental operational parameters of colliders (i.e. crossing angles, intensities, emittances, β*). In this study we propose octuple magnets as a possible scheme to efficiently compensate long-range beam-beam interactions with a global correction scheme. The impact and improvements on the dynamic aperture of colliding beams together with estimates of the luminosity potentials are discussed for the HL-LHC upgrade and extrapolations made for the FCC project. Results are compared to other compensating schemes.

The LHC operation relies on a good knowledge of the optics, usually corrected in absence of beam-beam interactions. In a near future, both the LHC and the HL-LHC will need to cope with large head-on beam-beam parameters, the impact on the optics needs to be understood and, if necessary, corrected. The results of a dedicated experiment performed at injection energy are discussed in this paper.

Instability thresholds are explored at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by means of the computation of the Landau Stability Diagrams (SD). In the presence of diffusive mechanisms, caused by resonance excitations or noise, the SD can be reduced due to the modification of the particle distribution inside the beam. This effect can lead to a possible lack of Landau damping of the coherent modes previously damped by lying within the unperturbed SD area. The limitations deriving from coherent instabilities in the LHC is crucial in view of future projects that aim to increase the performance of the LHC such as the High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Simulation tools for the computation of the SD have been extended in order to take into account the incoherent effects from long tracking through the detailed model of the accelerator machine. The model includes among others beam-beam interactions and octupoles and the interplay between both is addressed. Finally the simulation results are compared to the Beam Transfer Function (BTF) measurements in the LHC.

Observations of beam-induced background at LHC during 2015 and 2016 are presented in this paper. The four LHC experiments use the non-colliding bunches present in the physics-filling pattern of the accelerator to trigger on beam-gas interactions. During luminosity production the LHC experiments record the beam-gas interactions using dedicated background monitors. These data are sent to the LHC control system and are used to monitor the background levels at the experiments during accelerator operation. This is a very important measurement, since poor beam-induced background conditions can seriously affect the performance of the detectors. A summary of the evolution of the background levels during 2015 and 2016 is given in these proceedings.

A local Crab Cavity (CC) scheme will recover head-on collisions at the Interaction Points (IPs) of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which aims to increase the LHC luminosity by a factor of 3-10. The first time that CC will ever be tested with proton beams will be in 2018 in the SPS machine. The available dedicated Machine Development (MD) time after the installation of the cavities will be limited and therefore good preparation is essential in order to ensure that the MDs are as efficient as possible. This paper presents the simulations and experimental studies performed in preparation for the future MDs and discusses the next steps.

Debris from 50 TeV proton-proton collisions at the main interaction point in the FCC-hh may contribute to the background in the subsequent detector. This cross-talk is of possible concern for the FCC-hh due to the high luminosity and energy of the collider. DPMJET-III is used as a collision debris generator in order to assess the muon cross-talk contribution. An analytical calculation of muon range in rock is performed. This is followed by a full Monte Carlo simulation using FLUKA, where the accelerator tunnel has been modelled. The muon cross talk between the adjacent interaction points is assessed and its implications for FCC-hh design are discussed.

The international Future Circular Collider (FCC) study comprises the study of a new scientific structure in a tunnel of 100 km. This will allow the installation of two accelerators, a 45.6'175 GeV lepton collider and a 100-TeV hadron collider. An optimized design of a final-focus system for the hadron collider is presented here. The new design is more compact and enables unequal β* in both planes, whose choice is justified here. This is followed by energy deposition studies, where the total dose in the magnets as a consequence of the collision debris is evaluated.

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) design study aims to develop the designs of possible circular colliders in the post LHC era. In particular the FCC-hh will aim to produce proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 100 TeV. Given the large beta functions and integrated length of the quadrupoles of the final focus triplet the effect of systematic and random non linear errors in the magnets are expected to have a severe impact on the stability of the beam. Following the experience on the HL-LHC this work explores the implementation of non-linear correctors to minimize the resonance driving terms arising from the errors of the triplet. Dynamic aperture studies are then performed to study the impact of this correction.

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) design study aims to develop the design of possible circular colliders in the LHC era. In particular the FCC-hh will aim to produce proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 100 TeV. The interaction region has been designed to meet the requirements in terms of energy and luminosity. However, as it is the case in any real accelerator, misalignments in the magnets are likely to occur; the effect of these misalignments, if not properly compensated for, can jeopardize the performance of the machine. This study contemplates alignment and field errors in the interaction region in order to estimate the tolerance necessary to provide a good correction measured in terms of deviation of the orbit and strength of the correctors.

The experimental interaction region is one of the key areas that define the performance of the Future Circular Collider. In this overview we will describe the status and the evolution of the design of EIR of FCC-hh, focusing on design of the optics, energy deposition in EIR elements, beam-beam effects and machine detector interface issues.

Exploring the Triplet Parameter Space to Optimise the Final Focus of the FCC-hh

One of the main challenges when designing final focus systems of particle accelerators is maximising the beam stay clear in the strong quadrupole magnets of the inner triplet. Moreover it is desirable to keep the quadrupoles in the inner triplet as short as possible for space and costs reasons but also to reduce chromaticity and simplify corrections schemes. An algorithm that explores the triplet parameter space to optimise both these aspects was written. It uses thin lenses as a first approximation and MADX for more precise calculations. In cooperation with radiation studies, this algorithm was then applied to design an alternative triplet for the final focus of the Future Circular Collider.

A parasitic effect of k-modulation is that if the modulated quadrupole has an offset the modulation results in a dipole like kick forcing the beam on a new orbit. This paper presents a new method using the orthonormality of singular value decomposition that uses this new orbit to estimate the offset. This could be used to measure misalignments or crossing angles but could also help improve k-modulation \beta measurements by predicting the parasitic tune change caused by the new orbit not passing through the centre of the sextupoles.

Moreover it is desirable to keep the quadrupoles in the inner triplet as short as possible for space and costs reasons but also to reduce chromaticity and simplify corrections schemes. An algorithm that explores the triplet parameter space to optimise both these aspects was written. It uses thin lenses as a first approximation for a broad parameter scan and MADX for more precise calculations. The thin lens algorithm is significantly faster than a full scan using MADX and relatively precise at indicating the approximate area where the optimum solution lies.

The bunch profiles in the LHC are often observed to be non-Gaussian, both at Flat Bottom (FB) and Flat Top (FT) energies. Especially at FT, an evolution of the tail population in time is observed. In this respect, the Monte-Carlo Software for IBS and Radiation effects (SIRE) is used to track different types of beam distributions. The impact of the distribution shape on the evolution of bunch characteristics is studied. The results are compared with observations from the LHC Run 2 data.

A head-on beam-beam compensation scheme was implemented for operation in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The compensation consists of a lattice for the minimization of beam-beam driven resonance driving terms, and electron lenses for the reduction of the beam-beam induced tune spread. We describe the implementations of the lattice and electron lenses, and report on measurements of lattice properties and the effect of the electron lenses on the hadron beam.

A beam energy scan of deuteron-gold collision, with center-of-mass energy at 19.6, 39, 62.4 and 200.7 GeV/n, was performed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in 2016 to study the threshold for quark-gluon plasma (QGP) production. The lattice, RF, stochastic cooling and other subsystems were in different configurations for the various energies. The operational challenges changed with every new energy. The operational experience at each energy, the operation performance, highlights and lessons of the beam energy scan are reviewed in this report.

This report focuses on three dimensional emittance growth of polarized proton beam due to Intra-Beam Scattering (IBS) at RHIC. Simulations are presented which give guidance on the configuration of the RF systems to mitigate IBS-induced emittance growth. In addition, simulated growth rates are compared with measured emittance evolution at injection, which shows better agreement in longitudinal than transverse dimension. The results in this report will help us better understand the emittance evolution for current RHIC operations and for future operations (eRHIC).

In the 2016 RHIC 100~GeV gold-gold (Au-Au) run, 20~mm orbit bumps were installed in the arcs to protect the experimental detectors from abort kicker prefiring. Chronic particle losses were observed in the arcs with these orbit bumps. Those particle losses are mainly from the 78+Au197 and 79+Au196 particles generated from bound-free pair production (BFPP) and electromagnetic dissociation (EMD) associated with the Au-Au collision at the IPs. In this article, we present simulated particle losses of 78+Au197 and 79+Au196 and calculate the particle loss distribution in the ring. The calculated particle loss maps are compared with operational observations.

Recent analyses of RHIC run12 to run15 proton-carbon polarimeter measurements have shown significant tilt of the polarization vector from vertical, at high energy essentially. This is confirmed by extensive measurements performed in the present Run 17. Possible origins of such large tilt may reside in snake spin rotation angle or orbit defects, to mention just two. Dedicated simulations have been undertaken to investigate possible causes, they are presented and discussed, they include the computation and use of 3-D field maps of RHIC siberian snakes.

The 2017 operation of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) involved the running of only a single experiment at STAR with PHENIX offline in the process of the upgrade to sPHENIX. For this run there were several notable changes to machine operations. These included, transverse polarization, luminosity leveling, a new approach to machine protection and the development of new store and ramped lattices. The new 255 GeV store lattice was designed to both accommodate the necessary phase advance between the e-lens and IP8 for testing and to maximize dynamic aperture. The new lattices on the ramp were designed to maximize polarization transmission during the three strong intrinsic spin resonances crossings. Finally we are also commissioning new 9 MHz RF cavities during this run.

The Separator for Capture Reactions, SECAR, is being built at Michigan State University for the study of low-energy capture reactions. The high performance magnets and two large Wien filters required to reach the very high recoil mass separation factor are being designed and produced at Danfysik to the SECAR specifications. The 2.4 m long Wien filters with a weight of 35 ton each including a large vacuum tank have high electrode voltages of ±300 kV combined with a magnetic field of 0.12 T. Challenging design requirements for integrated magnetic and electrostatic field homogeneity combined with tight tolerance on the effective lengths have been meet. The dipole magnets for this facility are special in having stringent ±0.5 mm effective magnetic length specifications in a wide excitation range and the transverse field boundary variation is described by a 4th order polynomial. Most of the dipoles are made with variable segmented field clamps in order to keep the deviation of the magnetic fringe field boundary within the required ±0.1 mm. The wide range of different quadrupole, sextupole and octupole magnets are required to meet the specified magnetic length with a tight tolerance.

For superconducting (sc) accelerator sections operating at low and medium beam energies very compact accelerating-focusing structures are strongly required, as well as short focusing periods, high accelerating gradients and very short drift spaces. The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is going to use heavy ion beams with extremely high peak current from UNiversal Linear ACcelerator (UNILAC) and the synchrotron SIS18 as an injector for the SIS100. To keep the GSI-Super Heavy Element program competitive on a high level and even beyond, a standalone sc continuous wave LINAC in combination with the upgraded GSI High Charge State injector is envisaged. In preparation for this, testing of the first LINAC section (financed by HIM and GSI) as a demonstration of the capability of 216 MHz multi gap Crossbar H-structures (CH) is still ongoing, while an accelerating gradient of 9.6 MV/m (4K) at a sufficient quality factor has been already reached in a horizontal cryostat. As a final R&D step towards an entire LINAC three advanced cryo modules, each comprising two short CH cavities, should be built until 2019, serving for first user experiments at the coulomb barrier.

Dynamic vacuum effects, induced by charge exchange processes and ion impact driven gas desorption, generate an intensity limitation for high intensity heavy ion synchrotrons. In order to reach ultimate heavy ion intensities, medium charge state heavy ions are used. The cross sections for charge exchange in collisions with residual gas molecules for such beams are much higher, than for highly charged heavy ion beams. Therefore high pumping power is required to obtain a very low static residual gas pressure and to suppress vacuum dynamics during operation. In modern heavy ion synchrotrons different techniques are employed: NEG-coating, cryogenic pumping, and low-desorption ion-catcher. The unique StrahlSim code allows the comparison of different design options for heavy ion synchrotrons. Different aspects of dynamic vacuum limitations are summarized, such as the dependence on different injection parameter. A comparison between a room temperature and a cryogenic synchrotron from the vacuum point of view is given.

The design study describes the prototype Alvarez-tank of the new post-stripper of the UNILAC. A prototype with 17 drift tubes (including quadrupole singulets) of 3 m of total length and 2 m of diameter will be manufactured. This cavity features new drift tube shape profiles to provide for high shunt impedance at a maximum electric surface field of 1 Ek. Additionally, it allows realization and high power testing of an optimized stem configuration for field stabilization. In case of successful tuning and long-term operation at high power level, it shall be used as a first of series cavity of the new UNILAC post-stripper DTL.

This paper describes the development progress of the 70 MeV, 70 mA proton injector for the FAIR facility. The injector comprises an ECR-type high current proton source followed by a ladder 4-rod RFQ and six normal conduction CH-DTL accelerating cavities. This unique design allows for a compact structure. The design work of the cavities has been mostly completed by our collaberation partners at IAP Frankfurt. The design of the buncher cavities, the mechanical integration as well as beam diagnostic devices are currently under development. The construction of a new modulator for the pLinac rf-system has been started on site. The proton source and the LEBT as well as the subsequent chopper are currently assembled at CEA/Saclay. Beam commissioning of the source at Saclay will start at the beginning of 2017. An overview of the pLinac main parameters and design choices is given, and the overall status reported.

The 'Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research' (FAIR) presently under construction will deliver intense ion beams to its experimental users. The requested intensities require filling the existing synchrotron SIS18, which serves as injector to FAIR, up to the space charge (SC) limit. Operation under these conditions is challenging due to the large tune footprint of the beam, demanding delicate control of adverse effects caused by machine imperfections to avoid emittance growth and beam loss. To facilitate the high intensity operation, the installation of an electron lens for SC compensation into SIS18 is foreseen. This requires an electron beam of a current of several amperes with longitudinal and transverse distributions matched to those of the ion beam during the cycle. The electron beam needs to be RF modulated at a bandwidth of a few MHz with time varying amplitude ranging from DC to fully modulated, while the transverse size needs to be continuously adapted to the adiabatically shrinking ion beam. This contribution reports on the requirements on an electron lens for SC compensation in SIS18.

HADES is a fixed target experiment using SIS18 heavy-ion beams. It investigates the microscopic properties of matter formed in heavy-ion, proton and pion - induced reactions in the 1-3.5 GeV/u energy regime. In 2014 HADES used a secondary pion beam produced by interaction between high-intensity nitrogen primary beam and a beryllium target. In these conditions beam losses, generated by slow extraction and beam transport to the experimental area, led to activation of the beam line elements and triggered radiation alarms. The primary beam intensity had to be reduced and the beam optics modified in order to keep radiation levels within the allowed limits. Similar beam conditions are requested by HADES experiment for upcoming run in 2018 and in the following years. Therefore, a number of measures have been proposed to improve beam transmission and quality. These measures are: additional shielding, additional beam instrumentation, modification of beam optics and increase of vacuum chambers' apertures in critical locations. The optics study and preliminary results of FLUKA simulations for optimization of location of loss detectors are presented.

A sc cw-linac with variable output energy from 3.7 to 7.5 MeV/u for ions with mass to charge ratio of A/Z<6 is recently under development at HIM and GSI. Following the results of the latest RF-tests with the newly constructed sc CH-DTL cavity, even heavier ions up to Uranium 28+ could be potentially accelerated with the already reached higher RF-voltage. Also the possibility for an up to 10 MeV/u increased output energy, using the same 13 independent cavities, is under consideration. All these options require an advanced beam dynamics layout, as well as a versatile procedure for transverse and longitudinal beam matching along the entire linac. The proposed algorithms are discussed and the obtained simulation results are presented.

The neutron beam at the FRANZ facility will be produced by the 7Li(p, n)7Be reaction using an intense 2 MeV proton beam. These protons will be accelerated from 120 keV to 2 MeV by a coupled 4-Rod-type RFQ and a 8 gap interdigital H-type structure (IH-DTL). This coupled RFQ-IH-cavity will be operated at 175 MHz in cw mode and it has a total length of about 2.3 m. The two structures (RFQ, IH-DTL) are internally coupled inductively, and consequently only one RF-amplifier providing a total power up to 250 kW is needed for operation. The IH-DTL is RF tuned together with an Al-RFQ model, before final IH-DTL installation in the FRANZ cave, while the original RFQ was already installed in the beam line. After RF power and beam tests the coupled structure will be installed and continued with RF and beam. This paper will be focused on the RF tuning process and the main results will be presented.

The research program of antiproton beams for the FAIR facility requires a dedicated 68 MeV, 70 mA proton injector. This injector will consist of an RFQ followed by six room temperature Crossbar H-type CH-cavities operated at 325 MHz. The beam dynamics had been revised by IAP Frankfurt in collaboration with GSI-FAIR in Darmstadt to further optimize the design. This step was followed by cavity RF design. The detailed mechanical cavity design will begin in 2017, while the quadrupole lenses are under production already. In this paper, besides an overview the RF design of the coupled cavities with integrated focusing triplets will be a main focus.

The GSI UNILAC will serve as the main injector for the upcoming FAIR project. Since the existing Alvarez DTL is in operation for more than 40 years, it has to be replaced to ensure reliable operation in the future. To this purpose a compact and efficient linac design based on IH-type cavities and KONUS beam dynamics has been designed at IAP Frankfurt*. It consists of five 108 MHz IH-type cavities that can be operated by the existing UNILAC RF amplifier structure. The transversal focusing scheme is based on magnetic quadrupole triplet lenses. The optimized design provides full transmission and low emittance growth for the design current of 15 emA U28+ accelerating the beam from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u. Extensive error studies were performed to define tolerances and verify the stability of the design with respect to misalignment and injection parameters. The design provides a compact and cost efficient alternative to a new Alvarez linac. With a total length of just 22.8 meters it will leave room for future energy upgrades in the UNILAC tunnel.

The MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) Project is a planned accelerator driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of long-living radioactive waste. A critical passage for the beam quality and especially for the emittance is the injector. Therefore, a new injector design with improved beam dynamics has been developed, featuring low emittance growth rates while using only room temperature structures. The previous design consisted of a 4-Rod RFQ, 7 room temperature and 5 superconducting CH-DTL cavities and 2 rebuncher cavities, whereas the superconducting cavities in the new design have been replaced by 8 room temperature CHs and an additional rebuncher. The main challenge during the development is achieving the required reliability to reduce the thermal stress inside the planned reactor. Therefore, simulations with CST MICROWAVE STUDIO have been made to compare several cooling concepts and to optimize the cavities, especially in terms of the shunt impedance.

The Frankfurt Neutron Source at the Stern-Gerlach-Zentrum (FRANZ) is planned to deliver ultra-short neutron pulses at high intensities and repetition rates. As part of FRANZ a 175 MHz room temperature 5-gap CH DTL cavity was designed and built. Its main task will be focusing the particle bunch longitudinally at 2 MeV particle energy. Furthermore the CH cavity can also be used to increase the energy as well as decrease it by 0.2 MeV. The rebuncher and its cooling system is optimized to work with a 5 kW amplifier. The amplification system is intended to provide continuous power (cw mode). Due to its operating parameters being nearly identical to the requirements of the MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) Project, experience for future cavity designs was gained. This includes considerations concerning cooling with use of a 12 kW amplifier. The recent results of conditioning and high power tests will be presented.

The MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) Project is planned as an accelerator driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of long-living radioactive waste. For this project a cw 4-Rod-RFQ with 176 MHz and a total length of about 4 m is required. It is supposed to accelerate protons from 30 keV up to 1.5 MeV*. One of the main tasks during the development of the RFQ is the very high reliability of the accelerator to limit the thermal stress inside the reactor. Another challenge was to compensate the dipole component of the MYRRHA-RFQ which is due to the design principle of 4-Rod-RFQs. This dipole component is responsible for shifting the ideal beam axis from the geometrical center of the quadrupole downwards. Design studies with CST MICROWAVE STUDIO have shown that the dipole component can be almost completely compensated by widening the stems alternately so that the current paths of the lower electrodes are increased.

The MYRRHA project requires a proton linac with an energy of 600 MeV with a beam current of 4 mA in cw operation. As first RF structure a 176 MHz 4-Rod RFQ has been chosen because of tuning possibilities, maintenance, lower capital costs and technological risk compared to a 4-Vane-RFQ. The aim of beam dynamics design was to preserve excellent beam quality and to avoid the creation of halo particles especially in the longitudinal plane. Using the NFSP (New Four-Section Procedure) with a soft and symmetric pre-bunching with full 360° acceptance it was possible to reach the requirements. The simulated transmission of the 4 m long RFQ is close to 100%. The electrode voltage has been chosen to 44 kV which gives enough transverse focusing but limits the required RF losses to about 25 kW/m. The cooling has been optimized for reliable operation and a new method of dipole compensation has been applied. The RFQ has been built and tuned with respect to field flatness. The paper describes the status of the RFQ and first measurements.

An electron-hadron collider (EIC) could be the next large-scale nuclear physics facility in the United States. A hadron linac with a final energy of 40 AMeV (heavy ions) and up to 130 MeV for protons with an upgrade path to higher energies is required as the first step of the hadron accelerator chain. From a cost point of view superconducting technology seems to be the better choice above an energy of about 5 AMeV compared to a room temperature (rt) solution. This paper describes the conceptual design of a rt front-end up to an energy of 5 AMeV appropriate as initial element of the EIC hadron linac. It consists of two separate injectors based on efficient H-mode cavities, one optimized for heavy ions (Pb30+) and the other optimized for protons and deuterons. Beam dynamics and first RF simulations are presented.

Based on the positive results of the unmodulated 325 MHz Ladder-RFQ from 2013 to 2016, we develop a modulated 3.3 m Ladder-RFQ. The unmodulated Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. It could withstand more than 3 times the operating power of which is needed in operation at a pulse length of 200μseconds. That corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the p-linac at FAIR. This particularly high frequency for a 4-Rod-type RFQ creates difficulties, which are challenging in developing an adequate cavity. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is a suitable candidate for that frequency. Inspired by the successful rf power test, the nominal vane-vane voltage was increased from 80 kV to 96 kV. The basic design and tendering of the RFQ has been successfully completed in 2016. EM simulations of a modulated full structure, especially in terms of field-flatness and frequency tuning, will be shown. Furthermore, the mechanical design including a direct cooling of the structure for duty cycles up to about 5% will be discussed.

After the successful measurements with a 0.8 m prototype (see Fig. 1), a 3.3 m Ladder-RFQ is under construction at IAP, Goethe University Frankfurt. It is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3 MeV according to the design parameters of the Proton Linac at FAIR. The development of an adequate beam dynamics design was done in close collaboration with the IAP resonator design team. A constant vane curvature radius and at the same time a flat voltage distribution along the RFQ was reached by implantation of the modulated vane geometry into CST Microwave Studio RF field simulations. Points of reference for the beam dynamics layout are the beam dynamics designs of C. Zhang* and A. Lombardi**. The Code RFQGen*** was used for the beam dynamics simulations. In order to increase the transmission and to reduce the longitudinal and transversal exit emittances, the evolution of the modulation parameter m within the first 90 cells was investigated in detail. This paper presents the simulation results of this study.

For the determination of the momentum spread of an ion beam from the measurable revolution frequency distribution the knowledge of the phase slip factor of the storage ring is necessary. At various working points of the cryogenic storage ring CSR installed at the MPI for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg the slip factor was simulated and compared with measurements. The predicted functional relationship of the slip factor and the horizontal tune depends on the different islands of stability, which has been experimentally verified. This behavior of the slip factor is in clear contrast to magnetic storage rings. In the paper we compare the results of the simulations with the measurements

Model of Statistical Errors in the Search for the Deuteron EDM in the Storage Ring

In this work we investigate the standard error of the spin precession frequency estimate in an experiment for the search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the deuteron using the polarimeter. The basic principle of polarimetry is the scattering of a polarized beam on a carbon target. Since the number of particles in one fill is limited, we must maximize the utility of the beam. This raises the question of sampling efficiency, as the signal, being an oscillating function, varies in informational content. To address it, we define a numerical measurement model, and compare two sampling strategies (uniform and frequency-modulated) in terms of beam-use efficiency. The upshot is the formulation of the conditions necessary for the effective use of the modulated sampling strategy, and the evaluation of its advantage over the uniform strategy. The simulation results are also used to compare two competing analytical models for the standard error of the frequency estimate.

Stochastic Cooling Hardware for Low Energy Deuterons at COSY

One of the central utilizations of the COSY facility nowadays is to host experiments for the JEDI (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) collaboration. These experiments use polarized deuteron beams at momenta below 1 GeV/c, that are stored for several minutes. In order to increase the spin coherence time, beam cooling is necessary. Electron cooling is applied to pre-cool the beam, but the solenoids of the electron cooler may not be perfectly compensated. Thus, stochastic cooling would be desirable instead. Unfortunately, the existing stochastic cooling system is not sensitive at low beam velocities. This paper presents newly developed stochastic cooling pickups and kickers for a system dedicated to low beam velocities of approximately 0.5c. The design is based on the slot-ring type pickups that have been developed for the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR), but optimized for low particle velocities and a low frequency band of 350-700 MHz. Since the structures get much bigger in comparison to the HESR version, mechanical properties must be reconsidered and a trade-off between electrical properties, cooling performance and constructability must be found.

A storage ring provides an attractive option for directly measuring the electric dipole moment (EDM) of charged particles. To reach a sensitivity of 1029 e.cm, it is critical to mitigate the systematic errors from all sources. This daunting task is pushing the precision frontier of accelerator science and technology beyond its current state of the art. Here, we present a unique idea of a magnetic dipole moment (MDM) spin transparent quadrupole that can significantly reduce the systematic errors due to the transverse electric and magnetic fields that particle encounters.

The purpose of the Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations (JEDI) collaboration is the measurement of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of charged particles like deuterons. There are two possible experimental setups under consideration for realization of this measurement with deuterons: The Frozen and Quasi Frozen Spin storage ring experiments. Both approaches are discussed and compared in this presentation. Various misalignments and systematic effects are simulated in the context of comparison. Furthermore the clockwise-counterclockwise method (CW-CCW) is applied and checked for its validity.

This presentation investigates closed orbit influencing effects focusing on transverse orbit deviations. Using a model of the Cooler Synchrotron COSY at the Forschungszentrum Jülich implemented in the Methodical Accelerator Design program, several magnet misalignments are simulated and analyzed. A distinction is made between magnet displacements along the axes and rotations around them. Results are always analyzed for the uncorrected as well as for the orbit after the application of an orbit correction. Furthermore, the effect of displaced beam position monitors is simulated and a constraint resolution of their readout is considered. Besides magnet misalignments also field variations resulting from residual power supply oscillations are quantified for all types of magnets.

One of the possible arguments for the breaking of CP invariance is the existence of non-vanishing electric dipole moments (EDM) of elementary particles. Currently, the Jülich Electric Dipole Moment Investigation (JEDI) collaboration works under the conceptual design of the ring specifically for search of the deuteron electrical dipole moment (dEDM). The proposed Quasi-Frozen Spin concept differs from the Frozen Spin concept in that the spin of the reference particle is alternately deflected by a few degrees in different directions relative to momentum in the electric and magnetic parts of the ring. The QFS concept will allow using the existing COSY ring as pilot facility. The paper presents conceptual approach to ring design based on results of a study of spin decoherence and systematic errors, as well as the sensitivity estimation of the method to the determination of EDM.

The stochastic cooling system of the HESR (High Energy Storage Ring) is based on completely new structures especially designed for the HESR. Each beam surrounding slot of these so called slot-ring couplers covers the whole image current without a reduction of the HESR aperture and without any plunging system. One pickup and one kicker have been already fabricated and installed into the COSY ring to demonstrate stochastic cooling in all three dimensions with only one structure. First results of commissioning with proton beams will be presented. The longitudinal cooling system at HESR is based on filter cooling with an optical notch-filter and ToF cooling. The demanding accuracy concerning phase stability requires dedicated control of the notch-frequency. The optical COSY filter has been modified and can be proven in long term runs together with the new stochastic cooling system.

The Selective Production of Exotic Species (SPES) project is presently under development at INFN-LNL: aim of this project is the production, ionization and post-acceleration of radioactive ions to perform forefront research in nuclear physics. An ECR-based charge breeder (SPES-CB) will allow post-acceleration of radioactive ions: in particular, the SPES-CB has been designed and developed by LPSC of Grenoble, based on the Phoenix booster. It will be equipped with a complete test bench totally integrated with the SPES beam line: this part of the post-accelerator, together with the newly designed RFQ, composes the so-called ADIGE injector for the superconducting linac ALPI. The injector will employ a unique Medium Resolution Mass Spectrometer (MRMS, R=1/1000), mounted downstream the SPES-CB, in order to avoid the typical drawback of the ECR-based charge breeding technique, that is the beam contamination. This contribution describes the ADIGE injector, with particular attention to the analysis of possible contaminations and the performances expected for the MRMS, showing the beam dynamics calculations for a reference radioactive beam.

Observing Suppression of Syncrotron Oscillation Amplitudes

We proposed a method to reduce loosing particles in acceleration stage of synchrotrons. A slowly varying horizontal electrostatic field may be useful to de-excite synchrotron oscillations. Then we have to somehow observe the damping of amplitudes of synchrotron oscillations to confirm the effect. We assume that the synchrotron component of rationalized Hamiltonian in acceleration stage is kept constant. Our experimental results did not contradict with this assumption. Taking advantage of this assumption, we can easily confirm the damping of synchrotron oscillation amplitudes experimentally through the increase of synchrotron frequencies.

A high-intensity deuteron linear accelerator is currently beding studied as a promising candidate to treat high-level radioactive wastes through the nuclear transmutation process. This paper presents the study on a design of a 75.5 MHz, 400 mA, continuous-wave deuteron radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ), which is proposed as the front-end of such a linear accelerator. The results of the beam dynamics simulation suggest that the designed RFQ can accelerate a 400-mA deuteron beam from 100 keV to 2.5 MeV with a transmission rate of 92 ~ 93.3%, depending on the assumed input transverse emittance.

The J-PARC is a high intensity proton facility and the accelerator consists of a 400 MeV linac, a 3 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and a Main Ring Synchrotron (MR). We have taken many hardware upgrades. The beam powers for the neutrino experiment and hadron experiment from the MR have been steadily increased by tuning and reducing beam losses. The designed 1 MW equivalent beam was demonstrated and user program was performed at 500 kW from the RCS to the neutron and muon experiments. We have experienced many failures and troubles, however, to impede full potential and high availability. In this report, operational performance and status of the J-PARC accelerators are presented.

Replacement of all J-PARC MR cavities has completed in this summer to increase the RF voltage. Nine sets of new high-gradient FT3L cavities will generate the required RF voltage for the 1.16 second cycle operation. Upgrade of magnet power supplies is planned and the cycle time becomes 1.3 seconds from the present 2.48 seconds in FY2018 to achieve the beam power of 750 kW-1 MW. For the further improvement of beam power, a new rapid-cycling booster is considered to increase the injection energy of the MR from 3 GeV to 6-8 GeV. By the reduction of the space charge effects, the injection time can be extended and a batch compression scheme becomes possible. It will increase the number of bunches from 8 to 11 or 12 during the beam injection. And, recent beam study of the 3 GeV RCS shows the potential capability of 6.6·1013 proton per bunch. Combining these improvements with the booster, the beam power of 3 MW will be manageable.

The J-PARC RCS has successfully accelerated 1 MW equivalent proton beam. However, the beam commissioning results and the particle tracking simulation suggest that the RCS has possibility to accelerate up to 1.6 MW beam. Since the power supply of the rf system almost reaches the limit under the condition of 1 MW beam, we consider the possible upgrade scenario of the rf system to accelerate 1.6 MW beam.

The most important issue in realizing such a MW-class high-power routine beam operation is to keep machine activations within a permissible level, that is, to preserve a better hands-on-maintenance environment. Thus, a large fraction of our effort has been concentrated on reducing and managing beam losses. However the high residual activation is appeared around the stripper foils. It is caused by not primary particles due to the beam losses but secondary particles due to nuclear reaction at the foil. This radio-activation is an intrinsically serious problem for the RCS which adopts the charge exchange multi-turn beam injection scheme with the stripper foil. In this presentation, we report a detail measurement of the residual dose around the stripper foil together with the cause estimated based on simulation studies.

A muon linac development for a new muon g-2 experiment is now going on at J-PARC. Muons from the muon beam line (H-line) at the J-PARC MLF are once stopped in an silica aerojel target and room temperature muoniums are evaporated from the aerogel. They are dissociated with laser (ultra slow muons), then accelerated up to 212 MeV using a linear accelerator. For the accelerating structure from 40 MeV, disk-loaded traveling-wave structure is applicable because the particle beta is more than 0.7. The structure itself is similar to that for electron linacs, however, the cell length should be harmonic to the increase of the particle velocity. In this paper, the beam dynamics design of this muon linac using the disk-loaded structure is described.

In the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC), H0 particles generated by collisions of accelerated H− beams with residual gases are considered as one of the key factors of the residual radiation in the high energy accelerating section of the linac. To diagnose the H0 particles, the new beam line for analyzing H0 and H− particles was installed in the second medium energy beam transport (MEBT2), which is the matching section from the separated-type drift tube linac (SDTL) to the annular-ring coupled structure linac (ACS). The analysis line consists of four dipole magnets for giving the H− beam chicane orbit, and a wire scanner monitor (WSM) for measuring the horizontal shift of the H− beam. To detect the H0 particles, a carbon plate is installed to the WSM. In the beam commissioning, we detected the signals of H0 particles penetrating the plate and observed the transition of the signal with various vacuum condition in the SDTL section.

J-PARC E34 experiment aims to measure the muon g-2 and EDM precisely with the unique approach. The muon acceleration is the one of the most critical technique to achieve the goal of the sensitivity. The world's first muon LINAC is planed toward the muon acceleration to 212 MeV in J-PARC. The first trial of the muon acceleration is planed in the early 2017 with the J-PARC prototype RFQ ahead of the construction of the actual muon LINAC. The slow muon source is required for the RFQ test, since the input energy of the RFQ is 5.6 keV. The slow muon produced by the deceleration using the thin aluminum foil was observed. The demonstration of the muon extraction with 7 keV by the electrostatic accelerator called SOA lens was also done. The low-energy muon beam profile monitor (muon BPM) for the measurement of the beam intensity and profile in order to estimate the beam emittance was tested using the surface muon beam. The simulation for the beam emittance measurement has been developed. In this paper, the latest preparation status for the RFQ and the prospects for the muon acceleration test in J-PARC will be presented.

As a key part of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) Project, the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) accumulates and accelerates the proton beam from 80MeV to 1.6GeV for extracting and striking the target with a repetition rate of 25Hz. As a commissioning plan, the BPM offset should be carefully investigated before closed orbit distortion (COD) correction. The fast response correctors are installed to correct orbit distortion and model the lattice of the RCS in every 1ms period. The bunch-by-bunch data from BPMs are collected and decomposed for better known of the RCS Lattice.

The CSNS DTLs are divided into 4 cavities. The DTL-1 was transferred and installed in the CSNS Linac tunnel in August of 2015. The RF high power conditioning of DTL-1 started in December 2015 and ended in February 2016. At the end, we finished DTL-1 high power conditioning mission with peak power 1.5MW (1.1 times design value), 1.625% duty factor (650us, 25Hz). And the first beam has been successfully accelerated to the design value 21.6MeV with nearly 100% transmission efficiency. In this paper, the details of conditioning process were presented and one severe RF discharge breakdown was described specifically, which occurred during high power conditioning.

China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is a high intensity accelerator based facility. Its accelerator consists of an H− injector and a proton Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS). The injector includes the front end and linac. The RFQ accelerates the beam to 3MeV, and then the Drift Tube Linac (DTL) accelerates it to 80MeV. A Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) matches RFQ and DTL, and the DTL consists of four tanks (DTL1, 2, 3, 4). A Linac to Ring Beam Transport (LRBT) matches DTL and RCS, also decreases beam energy spread. Commissioning of the first three DTL tank and LRBT straight section have been almost accomplished in this run. This paper takes a beam dynamics simulation on beam transport in MEBT and DTL at different DTL accelerate models. Meanwhile, beam's central orbit deviation at DTL and LRBT straight section due to DTL mechanical cavity's alignment errors is studied with IMPACT-Z code.

Most of existing high-current RFQs in the world encounter the degrade of beam transmission or unstable operation, even RF ramping can't go up to nominal design voltage after several years or long time beam commissioning. One of the main reasons is that the irradiation damage to electrode surface, caused by beam losses, influences RF performance of RFQ cavity. This is especially serious for high-current RFQ. By simulation and irradiation experiments, proton irradiation damage to copper target has been studied. The simulation results showed that normally incident proton beams with input energy lower than 1 MeV damage the copper surface in the range of one skin depth at 162.5 MHz, which indicated that almost all the lost beams with small incident angles impact RF performance of RFQ cavity. By the irradiation experiments, the damage within 60 nm depth from surface was proved to have a greater impact on surface finish. The conclusion is that low energy beam losses also need to be kept as low as possible to prolong the life of the RFQ electrodes, especially in high-current RFQ design.

The Beijing isotope separation online (BISOL) facility will be used to study the new physics and technologies at the limit of nuclear stability. The facility can be driven by a reactor or a deuteron accelerator. The driver accelerator for the BISOL facility aims to accelerate a 50 mA D+ beam to 40 MeV. As an injector for the downstream su-perconducting linac, a 4-vane RFQ operating at 162.5 MHz has been designed to accelerate the deuteron beam from 0.05 MeV to 3.0 MeV in CW mode. For the beam dynamics design of this high-intensity RFQ, a matched and equipartitioned design method is adopted in order to control beam loss. After the optimization, the simulated beam transmission efficiency is higher than 99%. The transverse normalized rms emittance growth is approxi-mately 12%. Detailed results of the beam dynamics as well as the error study of the RFQ are presented in this paper.

An interdigital H-mode drift tube linac (IH-DTL), which is aimed at proton medical facilities, has been proposed and developing at Tsinghua University. Considering following 3 MeV RFQ in the platform of CPHS (Compact Pulse Hadron Source at Tsinghua University) and XiPAF (Xi‘an Proton Application Facility) project, the input energy of IH-DTL is 3 MeV and the RF frequency is 325 MHz. The proton beam can be accelerated from 3 MeV to 7 MeV and the peak current of the beam at the exit of the cavity is about 15 mA. In order to simplify the fabrication, A KONUS structure without focusing element in the cavity is chosen. The RF design of single CELL and the primary dynamics design is done. The co-iteration of dynamics simulation and RF calculation of whole cavity is undergoing.

For the purpose of the ion beam irradiation, especially for helium beam application to semiconductor industry, an ion beam RFQ is under development at KOMAC (Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex). The output energy of the RFQ is determined to be 1 MeV/n, which corresponds to 4 MeV in helium beam case, in consideration of the penetration depth in the silicon substrate. The RFQ is a four-vane type and will be fabricated through vacuum brazing technique. The RF power of 130 kW at 200 MHz will be provided to the RFQ by using a solid-state RF amplifier through two coaxial RF couplers with coaxial RF windows. The details of the RFQ development including some design features and fabrication methods will be given in this paper.

The superconducting synchrotron Nuclotron allows one to accelerate proton and deuteron beams up to 13.5 GeV/c. The beam depolarization occurs at the crossing of spin resonances. For deuterons, the vertical polarization is preserved almost to the maximum momentum. Tens of spin resonances are crossing during the proton acceleration. The proton polarization will be preserved by a solenoidal 5% snake up to 3.4 GeV/c at the field ramp rate of 1 T/s. It is planned to use a partial 50% snake to eliminate the resonant depolarization of the proton beam in the total momentum range of the accelerator. The results of simulations and experimental data are presented.

At the present time the activities on creation of the new heavy-ion isochronous cyclotron DC280 are carried out at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The isochronous cyclotron DC-280 will produce accelerated beam of ions A/Z= 4 - 7 with a smooth variation of the beam energy W= 4 ' 8 MeV/n. The variation of energy is provided by the wide range of the magnetic field levels from 0.64T till 1.32T and usage of the 11 radial and 4 pairs of harmonic correcting coils. In the work the results of calculations and final measurements of the magnetic field are presented. The magnetic field of cyclotron DC-280 is formed in a good conformity with results of computer modeling.

Long-range beam-beam (LRBB) interactions can be a source of emittance growth and beam losses in the LHC during physics and will become even more relevant with the smaller '* and higher bunch intensities foreseen for the High Luminosity LHC upgrade (HL-LHC), in particular if operated without crab cavities. Both beam losses and emittance growth could be mitigated by compensat-ing the non-linear LRBB kick with a correctly placed current carrying wire. Such a compensation scheme is currently being studied in the LHC through a demonstration test using current-bearing wires embedded into col-limator jaws, installed either side of the high luminosity interaction regions. For HL-LHC two options are considered, a current-bearing wire as for the demonstrator, or electron lenses, as the ideal distance between the particle beam and compensating current may be too small to allow the use of solid materials. This paper reports on the ongoing activities for both options, covering the progress of the wire-in-jaw collimators, the foreseen LRBB experiments at the LHC, and first considerations for the design of the electron lenses to ultimately replace material wires for HL-LHC.

The new accelerator complex Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is now under development and construction at JINR, Dubna. This complex is assumed to operate using two injectors: modernized old Alvarez-type linac LU-20 as the injector of light polarized ions and a new Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator HILAc - injector of heavy ions beams. The new heavy ion linac accelerate ions with q/A values above 0.16 to 3.2 MeV/u is under commissioning. The main components are 4-Rod-RFQ and two IH drift tube cavities is operated at 100.6 MHz. Main results of the HILAc commissioning with carbon beam from the laser ion source are discussed.

The new accelerator complex Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is now under development and construction at JINR, Dubna. This complex is assumed to operate using two injectors: the Alvarez-type linac LU-20 as injector of light ions, polarized protons and deuterons and a new linac HILAc - injector of heavy ions beams. Old DC for-injector of the LU-20, which operated from 1974, is replaced by the new RFQ accelerator, which was commissioned in spring 2016. The first Nuclotron technological run with new fore-injector was performed in June 2016. Beams of D+ and H2+ were successfully injected and accelerated in the Nuclotron ring. Main results of the RFQ commissioning and the first Nuclotron run with new for-injector is discussed in this paper.

To those who work in the accelerator field, it is obvious that there are many applications of accelerators beyond particle physics. Yet the public remains largely unaware of the far reaching uses of accelerators, or the scientific and engineering challenges that lay behind them. A recent project Particle Accelerators for Humanity has addressed this gap by creating a series of video resources, based on a programme of live events, short films and a specially commissioned animation. The project captured the dedication and diversity of those who design, operate and work with accelerators and highlights the varied ways in which their work is impacting on our lives. Here we overview the project and the resources, available under Creative Commons license, and discuss the impact of the project so far. We encourage the accelerator community to use the resources in their teaching and public engagement activities.

The RFQ accelerator for ESS-Bilbao is presented. This device will complete ESS-Bilbao injection chain after the ion source and LEBT. Design, carried out by ESS-Bilbao team, was finished in 2015. Machining has started in 2016. The RFQ is a 4-vane structure, aimed to accelerate protons from 45 keV to 3.0 MeV and operating at 352.2 MHz. It has a total length of about 3.1 meters, divided in 4 segments. Segments themselves are formed by 2 major and 2 minor vanes, assembled together by using polymeric vacuum gaskets instead of brazing or other welding system. In this paper the design is presented, including the beam dynamics, RF cavity design, field flatness and frequency tuning. Cooling and thermo-mechanical design is also described. Mechanical design, including vacuum strategy and test models, is also briefly described (there is a dedicated poster on this). The first segment fabrication is scheduled to finish before the end of 2016, so vacuum and low power RF tests results would also be included in the presented paper.

Starting operations in 2019, the European Spallation Source will be a long pulsed neutron source powered by a 5 MW proton beam impinging on a rotating tungsten target. This study describes the results of shielding calculations performed to determine necessary shielding configuration during various steps of first stage beam commissioning of the ESS Linac. The first stage commissioning is divided in four steps with different beam energy, up to maximum 74 MeV. The commissioning beam dump shielding assessment is presented for each step of first stage commissioning and different beam parameters (energies, repetition rates, pulse lengths and currents).

DESIREE, the double electrostatic storage rings in Stockholm has been running since 2011(?). In the cold (13 K) environment with an excellent vacuum, very long storage times in both rings have been achieved, which has enabled the preparation of beams in a single quantum state. The status of DESIREE is presented with particular emphasis on measurements of stored beam currents in the sub-nA range. We also discuss the ongoing work towards stochastic cooling of very slow beams.

In the framework of the CERN Neutrino Platform project, extensions to the existing SPS North Area H2 and H4 secondary beam lines, able to provide low-energy charged particles in the momentum range of 0.4 to 12 GeV, have been designed. The parameters of these very low energy beam lines, the expected beam composition as seen by the experiments as well as an outlook on their expected performance are summarized in this paper. Results from Monte-Carlo simulations, important for the optimization of the future instrumentation of the beam lines (serving both the purpose of beam tuning and the experiments' needs for particle identification and momentum measurements), are presented.

LINAC5: A Quasi-Alvarez LINAC for BioLEIR

LINAC5 is a new linac proposed for the acceleration of light ions with Q/A = 1/3 to 1/4 for medical applications within the BioLEIR (Low Energy Ion Ring) design study at CERN. We propose a novel quasi-Alvarez drift-tube linac (DTL) accelerating structure design for LINAC5, which can reduce the length of a more conventional DTL structure, yet allows better beam focussing control and flexibility than the inter-digital H (IH) structures typically used for modern ion acceleration. We present the main sections of the linac with total length 12 m, including a 202 MHz radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) a matching medium energy beam transport (MEBT) and a 405 MHz quasi-Alvarez accelerating section with an output energy of 4.2 MeV/u. Permanent magnet quadrupoles are proposed for use in the quasi-Alvarez structure to improve the compactness of the design and increase the efficiency. Lattice design considerations, multi-particle beam dynamics simulations and RFQ and radio frequency (RF) cavity designs are presented.

The proposed SPS beam dump facility (BDF) is a fixed-target facility foreseen to be situated at the North Area of the SPS. Beam dump in this context implies a target aimed at absorbing the majority of incident protons and containing most of the cascade generated by the primary beam interaction. The aim is a general purpose fixed target facility, which in the initial phase is aimed at the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment. Feasibility studies are ongoing at CERN to address the key challenges of the facility. These challenges include: slow resonant extraction from the SPS; a target that has the two-fold objective of producing charged mesons as well as stopping the primary proton beam; and radiation protection considerations related to primary proton beam with a power of around 355 kW. The aim of the project is to complete the key technical feasibility studies in time for the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) update foreseen in 2020. This is in conjunction with the recommendation by the CERN Research Board to the SHiP experiment to prepare a comprehensive design study as input to the ESPP.

This paper describes the role of civil engineering in the optimisation of the design of CERN's Future Circular Collider (FCC). The civil engineering team at CERN have employed a bespoke, interactive, geological tool to consider the suitability of multiple layout options for the FCC, situated in the Geneva Basin, in particular quasi-circular options with circumferences in the order of 100 km. The tool has been used to provide feedback on potential lattice designs that are assessed based on criteria such as geological risk, shaft depth and the environmental sensitivities of access and experimental sites. This paper presents the process and some results of the impact of civil engineering on the design of the FCC, in particular on the layout, location, and structural requirements, and also how the optimised design has been used as the basis for a cost and schedule study.

The LHC performance during the proton-lead run in 2016 fully relied on a permanent monitoring and systematic improvement of the beam quality in all the injectors. The beam production and characteristics are explained in this paper, together with the improvements realized during the run from the source up to the flat top of the LHC. Transmission studies from one accelerator to the next as well as beam quality evolution studies during the cycle at each accelerator, have been carried out and are summarized in this paper. In 2016, the LHC had to deliver the beams to the experiments at two different energies, 4 Z TeV and 6.5 Z TeV. The properties of the beams at these two energies are also presented

High power proton machines consume a large amount of energy. Thus, the energy efficiency of grid to beam power conversion is particularly important for the overall power consumption of such facilities. In this study, we analyse the energy efficiency of PSI's cyclotron-based HIPA facility, which presently delivers a maximum of 1.4 MW beam power. The total power consumption of the entire facility is 12.5 MW at 2.2 mA beam current (1.3 MW). Main power consumers are: RF systems, electromagnets, water cooling and auxiliary systems including infrastructure, each consuming 5.3 MW, 3.6 MW, 1.65 MW and 1.95 MW, respectively. HIPA's grid to beam efficiency is 18.3% when considering only those parts of any subsystems (RF components, magnets, cooling, and auxiliary systems), which are minimally required to produce a full 1.3 MW beam. The dependency of individual subsystems on beam power was also studied. These findings serve as a basis for further optimizations of the HIPA facility and give a reference of the efficiency estimate for the cyclotron-based high power machines.

In this paper we present the latest results regarding the tuning study of the baseline design of the CLIC Final Focus System. In previous studies, 90% of the machines reach 90% of the nominal luminosity, when considering beam position monitor errors and transverse misalignments of magnets for a single beam case. In the present study, roll misalignments and strength errors are also included for both e- and e+ beamlines, making the study a more realistic one. First, second and third order knobs are implemented in the tuning procedure to target the most relevant beam size aberrations. In order to minimise the total number of luminosity measurements a simultaneous scan of various knobs has been developed to cope with the non-fully orthogonality of the knobs. The obtained results for single and double beam studies are presented.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a flagship research facility currently under construction in Lund, Sweden. It is driven by a 2 GeV linac, accelerating a 62.5 mA proton beam at a 4% duty cycle. With an average beam power of 5 MW, when completed the ESS linac will become the world's most powerful. In this paper we summarise the latest beam commissioning plans from the ion source to the target, highlighting the individual phases, the beam dynamics challenges as well as the scheduling strategy.

The production of radioisotopes using a thin internal target and recycled beam within a compact FFAG design has been studied. Radioisotopes have a wide range of uses in medicine, and recent disruption to the supply chain has seen a renewed effort to find alternative isotopes and production methods. The FFAG design features separate sector magnets with non-scaling, non-linear field gradients which are optimized with magnet geometry to achieve isochronisity at the level of 0.3%, sufficient for Continuous Wave (CW) operation. Simulations have demonstrated that beam currents of up to 10mA can comfortably be achieved with this design. To further improve production efficiency a thin internal target, where the beam passes through the target and is recirculated, may be used. This setup ensures that production takes place within a narrow energy range, potentially increasing production rates and reducing impurities.

Antimatter experiments are at the cutting edge of science. They are, however, very difficult to realize and have been limited by the performance of the only existing facility in the world, the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) at CERN. The Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring (ELENA) will be a critical upgrade to this unique facility and commissioned from autumn 2016. This will significantly enhance the beam quality and enable new experiments. To fully exploit the discovery potential of this facility, advances are urgently required in numerical tools that can adequately model beam transport, life time and interaction, beam diagnostics tools and detectors to characterize the beam's properties, as well as in novel experiments that exploit the enhanced beam quality that ELENA will provide. AVA is a new European research and training initiative between universities, research centers and industry that will carry out R&D into ELENA and related facilities. This contribution gives an overview of the AVA research programme across its three scientific work packages.

In order to minimize the emittance at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), we measure and correct the orbit, dispersion, and transverse coupling of the beam.* However, this method is limited by finite measurement resolution of the dispersion, and so a new procedure must be used to further reduce the emittance due to dispersion. In order to achieve this, we use a method based upon the theory of sloppy models.** We use a model of the accelerator to create the Hessian matrix which encodes the effects of various corrector magnets on the vertical emittance. A singular value decomposition of this matrix yields the magnet combinations which have the greatest effect on the emittance. We can then adjust these magnet ‘‘knobs'' sequentially in order to decrease the dispersion and the emittance. We present here comparisons of the effectiveness of this procedure in both experiment and simulation using a variety of CESR lattices. We also discuss techniques to minimize changes to parameters we have already corrected.

The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) at Fermilab is a program of upgrades to the injection complex. At its core is the design and construction of a CW-compatible, pulsed H− SRF linac. To validate the concept of the front-end of such machine, a test accelerator known as PIP-II Injector Test is under construction. It includes a 10 mA DC, 30 keV H− ion source, a 2 m-long Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a 2.1 MeV CW RFQ, followed by a Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) that feeds the first of 2 cryomodules increasing the beam energy to about 25 MeV, and a High Energy Beam Transport section (HEBT) that takes the beam to a dump. The ion source, LEBT, RFQ, and initial version of the MEBT have been built, installed, and commissioned. This report presents the overall status of the warm front end.

Recirculating superconducting proton linac has an advantage to reduce the number of cavities and the resulting accelerator construction/operation costs. Beam dynamics simulations were done recently in a double pass recirculating proton linac using a single bunch. For continuous wave (CW) operation, the high energy proton beam bunch during the second pass will catch up and collide with the low energy proton bunch at a number of locations inside the superconducting linac. In this paper, we report on the study of the space-charge effects during a collision on both beams through the rest of the linac.

The LANSCE Isotope Production Facility (IPF) utilizes a 100-MeV proton beam with average power of 23 kW for isotope production in the fields of medicine, nuclear physics, national security, environmental science and industry. Typical tolerable fractional beam loss in the 100-MeV beamline is approximately 4 x10-3. During 2015-2016 operation cycle, several improvements were made to minimize the beam losses. Adjustments to the ion source's extraction voltage resulted in the removal of tails in phase space. Beam based steering in low-energy and high-energy beamlines led to the reduction of beam emittance growth. Readjustment of the 100-MeV quadrupole transport resulted in the elimination of excessive beam envelope oscillations and removed significant parts of the beam halo at the target. Careful beam matching in the drift tube linac (DTL) provided high beam capture (75% - 80%) and minimized beam emittance growth in the DTL. After improvements, beam losses in the 100-MeV beamline were reduced by an order of magnitude and reached the fractional level of 5 x10-4.

Beam based steering is an important procedure to minimize beam emittance growth. Low energy 750 keV LANSCE proton beam transport line before injection into Drift Tube Linac (DTL) has a length of 10 m and uses 22 quadrupoles, 6 steering magnets, 2 bending magnets, combination of prebuncher and main buncher, beam deflector, and collimators. Matching of the beam with the structure includes providing beam waists at the entrance of RF cavities, and matched beam Twiss parameters at the entrance to DTL. Typical beam emittance growth was at the level of 2-2.5. Beam based steering procedure was implemented to minimize emittance growth in the beamline. It includes determination of beam offset and beam angle entering group of quadrupoles and subsequent correction of beam angle to minimize beam offset in quadrupoles. Implementation of the procedure resulted in significant reduction of emittance growth at the level of 10%.

SNS injector uses a four-vane 402.5MHz RFQ for accelerating the H− beam with 38mA peak current and 7% duty factor to 2.5MeV. The original RFQ, commissioned in 2002, has been able to support SNS operation up to the design average beam power of 1.4MW. However, several problems have developed over almost fifteen years of operation. A new RFQ with design changes addressing the known problems has been built and commissioned up to the design beam power at the new SNS Beam Test Facility (BTF). The BTF consists of a 65 keV H− ion source, a 2.5MeV RFQ, a beam line with advanced transverse and longitudinal beam diagnostics and a 6 kW beam dump. This presentation provides results of the RFQ commissioning and the BTF beam instrumentation commissioning. We also discuss progress of the ongoing multidimensional phase space characterization experiment and future beam dynamics study planned at the SNS BTF.

The goal of this experiment is to measure the full 6D phase space of a low energy, high intensity hadron beam. We use 4D emittance measurement techniques for the transverse plane combined with dispersion measurement and a beam shape monitor to provide the longitudinal phase space. The Beam Testing Facility (BTF) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), a 2.5 MeV functional duplicate front end of the SNS accelerator is being used to facilitate the measurement. Early 6D measurements will be presented.

Funding: Work performed at (or work supported by) Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is managed by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 for the U.S. Department of Energy.
The Proton Power Upgrade Project is underway at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and will double the proton beam power capability from 1.4 MW to 2.8 MW to provide increased neutron intensity at the first target station and to support future operation of the second target station. This will be accomplished by increasing the beam energy to 1.3 GeV and the beam current to 38 mA (average during the macro-pulse). Installation of 28 additional superconducting cavities and their associated technical systems will provide for the energy increase. Increased beam loading throughout the accelerator will be accommodated primarily through the use of existing margin in the RF systems and the installation of 700 kW klystrons to power the new superconducting cavities. Upgrades of a few existing RF stations may also be needed. The injection and extraction regions of the accumulator ring will be upgraded, a ring to second target station tunnel stub will be constructed, and a 2 MW target will be developed for the first target station. The project anticipates attainment of Critical Decision 1 in 2017 to ratify the project conceptual design and cost range.

Beam halo is a big challenge for high intensity accelerators. Knowledge of the mechanisms of halo formation could help to prevent it. The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Beam Test Facility (BTF) is a functional duplicate of the SNS front end with enhanced diagnostics capable of accelerating 50 mA H− or protons to 2.5 MeV. To explore halo development in both matched and mismatched beams, a dedicated FODO lattice is being designed as an extension to the BTF. The FODO lattice will be 3.5 meters in length and is comprised of 16 quadrupole magnets, with dedicating matching magnets. Simulations of the design lattice show halo can be seen clearly in the phase space density plot when beam is mismatched. Details of the FODO design will be presented in the paper.

Imperfection and vertical intrinsic depolarizing resonances have been overcome by the two partial Siberian snakes in the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). The relatively weak but numerous horizontal resonances are overcome by a pair of horizontal tune jump quads. 70% proton polarization has been achieved for 2·1011 intensity. Further gain can come from maintaining smaller transverse emittance with same beam intensity. The main efforts now are to reduce the transverse emittance in the AGS and Booster, as well as robust jump quads timing generation scheme. This paper summarizes the operation results in the injectors.

Professional practice is essential to train an engineer. However, many activities are impossible to run at high school, especially if they require sophisticated equipment such as accelerators. A series of practical engineering courses is being set up at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to overcome these difficulties while educating students from the JINR Member States. A dedicated 'training' beamline of the Linac-200 electron accelerator is being constructed to practice the beam management and diagnostics, including the operation of standard beamline elements such as a bending dipole, quadrupoles, a sextupole and steerers. Various types of particle detectors can be used in the beam area as well in order to study the passage of electrons and photons through matter and to learn about the detector operation and properties. The practice at the beam will be accompanied by a series of hands-on trainings on radiation protection, vacuum and RF technology, electronics and metrology.

The next generation of particle accelerators will require the training of greater numbers of specialist accelerator physicists and engineers . These physicists and engineers should have a broad understanding of accelerator physics as well as the technology used in particle accelerators as well as a specialist in some area of accelerator science and technology . Such specialists can be trained by combining a University based PhD, in collaboration with national laboratory training with a broad taught accelerator lecture program. In order to have a faster start we decided to run an intensive two week school to replace the basic course at the Cockcroft Institute. At the same time we decided to investigate the use of problem based learning to simulate the way accelerator science tends to work in practice. In this exercise he students worked in groups of 5 to design a 3rd generation light source from scratch based on photon light specifications. In comparison to similar design exercises we stipulate that all students must do all parts and students are not allowed to specialise. A comparison with a standard lecture based education programme is discussed in this paper.
