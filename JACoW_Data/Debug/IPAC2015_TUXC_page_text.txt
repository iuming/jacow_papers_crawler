Developments of novel insertion devices (IDs) for storage rings (SR) and free-electron lasers (FELs) have remained quite active in recent years. The next generation of synchrotron radiation facilities, such as the already constructed or proposed storage rings at MAX-Lab, LNLS, ESRF, APS and SPring-8, provide strong motivation for continued improvements in IDs design and performance. Existing and newly built FEL facilities around the world also contribute important aspects of IDs fabrication: fast production of high quantity and high quality undulators that could be promptly installed in the FEL tunnels. Research institutions along with scientifically-oriented industries develop multiple approaches for the design and fabrication of single, unique IDs as well as a large quantity of standardized devices. A wide spectrum of existing and novel IDs for storage rings and FELs permits tailoring of ID performance to sometimes very specific experimental requirements. Currently, designers of light sources as well as users-experimentalists can choose from a variety of novel IDs that include undulators with wide spectrum coverage and relatively uniform flux, devices with controlled polarization properties, and electromagnetic undulators with fast polarization switching. Many of these undulators exploit new engineering solutions for their mechanical systems that make these devices quite compact and less expensive. The progress in the development of superconducting undulators has been quite noticeable in recent years. Once their construction is industrialized, these undulators could become the devices of choice for the next generation of storage rings and FELs.

We review some of the present engineering challenges associated with the design and construction of ultra-low emittance storage rings, the 4th generation storage rings (4GSR). The field is experiencing a growing interest since MAX-IV, followed by Sirius, started to build storage rings based on multi-bend-achromat (MBA) lattices. It was the recent progress in accelerator technology that allowed these facilities to base their designs on this kind of lattice. Although the challenges are starting to be overcome, many issues are still open and a lot of R&D is required until the 4GSR achieve optimal performance.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a 3-GeV third-generation synchrotron light source located in Hsinchu, Taiwan. After ground breaking on February 7, 2010 and five years of construction and hardware developments, commissioning of the beam began on December 12, 2014. The booster ring reached the design energy of 3 GeV on December 16. Beam transferred to the storage ring and first accumulation at 3 GeV produced the first synchrotron light on December 31. This report presents results and experience of the TPS commissioning.
