For future experiments with the HADES and CBM detectors at FAIR in Darmstadt, a radiation hard and fast beam detector is required. The beam detector has to perform precise T0 measurements (σT0 < 50 ps) and should offer beam monitoring capabilities. These tasks can be fulfilled by utilizing single-crystal Chemical Vapor Deposition (scCVD) diamond based detectors. For research and development of such detectors, a test set-up is currently installed at the Superconducting Darmstadt Electron Linear Accelerator (S-DALINAC) of TU Darmstadt. In this contribution the concept and the performance of a prototype beam monitoring system will be discussed. Furthermore the preparatory work of the test set-up at the S-DALINAC will be addressed.

The longitudinal current profile and slice emittance are important bunch parameters for the operation of an X-ray free-electron laser. At the European XFEL, dedicated diagnostic sections equipped with transverse deflecting RF structures (TDS) have been installed for the control and optimisation of these parameters. Travelling-wave TDS in combination with fast kicker magnets and off-axis screens allow for the study of individual bunches without affecting the other bunches in the super-conducting linear accelerator which can generate bunch trains of up to 2700 bunches at 4.5 MHz within 600 microsecond RF pulses at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The measurement of the slice emittance is realised in a static F0D0 lattice equipped with four individual screen stations. Variations of the longitudinal bunch profile or slice emittance along the bunch train may lead to degraded FEL performance for parts of the train which reduces the effective available number of bunches for FEL operation. By gradually adjusting the timing, individual bunches along the bunch train can be measured in order to optimise the overall beam parameters for all bunches in the train.

Using laser driven plasma wakefield accelerators, the synchronization between electron bunch and the ultrashort laser is crucial to obtain an stable acceleration. In order to minimize the electron bunch arrival-time jitter, the development of a new shot to shot feedback system with a time resolution of less than §I{1}{\femto\second} is planned. As a first step, stable Terahertz (THz) pulses should be performed by optical rectification of high energy femtosecond laser pulses in a nonlinear crystal. It is planed that the generated THz pulses will energy modulate the electron bunches shot to shot before the plasma to achieve the time resolution of 1fs. The selection of the nonlinear material is a critical aspect for the development of laser driven THz sources. In this contribution we investigate systematically the influence of the optical properties, and in particular adsorption coeffient, of lithium niobate crystal on the conversion efficiency of the generation of THz pulses.

To improve the injection process into the BESSY II storage ring and allow for high injection efficiencies in all operational modes, one needs to know the development of the bunch length during acceleration in the booster synchrotron up to the extraction point. It will become even more important for the future BESSY VSR upgrade when high efficiency injection into much shorter RF buckets needs to be guaranteed. Measurements of bunch phase and energy during injection in the storage ring are presented. Studies of the bunch length evolution during the energy ramp of the booster are described. Results are compared with numerical simulations and discussed.

For improving the sensitivity of electro-optic sampling (EOS), several techniques are used. Operation of the set of polarizing elements "close to extinction" is a technique used routinely for obtaining high responsivity (i.e., a large output signal for a given input electric field). This technique is widely used for monitoring electron bunches in linear accelerators and FELs. We show that a simple modification of these EOS systems enables to increase further the SNR, by cancelling out the laser noise. The idea is to introduce a set of Brewster plates, following the idea Ahmed, Savolainen and Hamm [1] in the EOS path, and performing balanced detection. We present detailed tests of this type of upgrade on the PhLAM-SOLEIL EOS system, destined to studies of THz CSR pulse dynamics [2].

In recent years the synchrotron radiation program at SPEAR3 has moved increasingly toward laser/x-ray pump-probe experiments which utilize a single timing ‘probe' bunch isolated by 50ns dark space ahead and behind the bunch. In order to quantify bunch purity in the region near the timing bunch, time-correlated single-photon counting is used. In this paper we investigate methods to optimize data acquisition speed and improve measurement resolution in the region near the timing bunch through data analysis and fast signal gating. Integration of the measured data into the EPICS database is reported.

The development of future free electron lasers (FELs) requires reliable time-resolved measurement of variable ultra-short electron-bunchs characteristics. A possible technique is to streak the bunch in the transverse direction by means of time-dependent external fields. In this paper we explore the possible use of self-generated electromagnetic fields *. A passive deflector, consisting of a dielectric-lined waveguide, is used to produce wakefields that impart a time-dependent transverse kick to the relativistic electron bunch passing off-axis. We investigate the technique and its performances and explore its possible application at the Fermilab Accelerator Science & Technology (FAST) facility.

In recent years several Bunch Shape Monitors were designed for new modern ion linacs, such as Linac4 CERN, Proton and CW-linac FAIR GSI, FRIB MSU, ESS ERIC. Each of these accelerators has its own requirements for a phase resolution, mechanical design and operating conditions of the monitor. An overview of the most interesting design and operation features of different monitors is presented. Some results of laboratory tests and on-site beam measurements are discussed.

Bunch Shape Monitor was developed and tested in INR RAS for The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams to fulfil the requirements of a half a degree phase resolution for 80.5 MHz FRIB operating frequency. The configuration of the λ/4-type RF-deflector based on the parallel wire lines with the shorting jumper and capacitive plates was selected. Special dual correcting magnet is foreseen to compensate a possible influence of external magnetic fields. Peculiarities of the design and development process are described. Results of laboratory tests are presented.

The Bunch Arrival-Time Monitor for SwissFEL (BAM) is based on the concept, which was successfully tested at the SwissFEL Test Facility [1]. During the gap between the SITF decommissioning and the start of SwissFEL, all key components underwent design improvement. In this paper, we report on these new developments, including the mechanical design of the BAM-Pickup and RF-front end, the electro-optical front end (BAM-Box), the data acquisition front end, the new expert- and user applications. We have developed concepts and tested hardware for Bunch-ID stamping of signals, relevant for the extraction of the arrival-time information. Presently two complete systems are installed and being commissioned at SwissFEL - one in the injector gun and one between the two bunch compressors. We report on the ongoing first commissioning results.

THz streaking with split ring resonators (SRR) promise ultra-high (sub-femtosecond) temporal resolution even for relativistic electron bunches. A proof-of-principle experiment in collaboration between the University of Bern, the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is currently prepared at the FLUTE facility (Ferninfrarot Linac und Test Experiment) at KIT. Most of the critical components have been designed, tested and set-up in the 7 MeV diagnostics part of FLUTE. In this contribution we will present an update on the experimental set-up and report on SRR configurations which have been optimized for highest THz deflection, while simultaneously accounting for the restrictions of the manufacturing process. Test measurements characterizing the SRR samples and the THz source, which has been matched to the FLUTE gun laser, will also be presented.

The reference distribution for the SwissFEL accelerator is based on ultra-stable Libera Sync 3 fiber-optic links operating at 3 GHz with <2.4fs added timing jitter. While s-band injector RF stations are directly supplied with these actively stabilized reference signals at 2.9988GHz, the same 3 GHz optical links are used to transmit reference signals at 2.856GHz (half c-band frequency) to the c-band LINACs, combined with a frequency doubler-amplifier at the link end. A novel zero AM/PM-conversion frequency-doubler and an amplitude-/phase-controlled power amplifier have been implemented in a compact 1HU 19inch unit. Key design concepts and measurement results will be presented. It will be shown that this inexpensive doubler-amplifier system adds only insignificant jitter and drift to the transmitted reference signals. As the same actively stabilized 3GHz links can be used for s- and c- band RF stations, development of a more expensive 6GHz fiber-optic link could be avoided. A higher quantity of the same link type can thus be manufactured and the number of spares is reduced as only one link type is utilized for the SwissFEL injector and LINAC RF reference signals.

Shanghai Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (SXFEL) is a fourth-generation light source which could provide coherent X-rays for various scientific researches. One of the key issues of its operation is the measurement of bunch arrival time which is important for the synchronization of a bunch and seeded laser. The measurement utilized a newly designed beam arrival time monitor (BAM) which contains two cavities at a different frequency. Thus a new way, dual-cavities mixing method, is applied in this experiment to evaluate the beam arrival time resolution. In this paper, we presented the scheme and different measured resolution of various measurement methods and evaluated the stability of the new monitor.
