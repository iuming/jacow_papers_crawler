The potential for higher operating temperatures and increased accelerating gradient has attracted SRF researchers to Nb3Sn coatings on niobium for nearly 50 years. The two-step tin vapor diffusion: nucleation followed by deposition appears to be a promising technique to prepare Nb3Sn coatings on interior cavity surface. We have undertaken a fundamental materials study of the nucleation and deposition steps. Nucleation was accomplished within parameter ranges: 300 - 500 °C, 1 - 5 hrs duration, 5 mg - 1 g SnCl2 and 1 g Sn. The resulting deposit consists of (< 10%) coverage of tin particles, as determined by SEM/EDS, while XPS and SAM discovered extra tin film between these particles. Preliminary results by EBSD show no evident effect of substrate crystallography on the crystallography of the final coating. Substantial topography was found to develop during the coating growth.

Quality factor of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities is degraded whenever magnetic flux is trapped in the cavity walls during the cooldown. In this contribution we study how the trapped flux sensitivity, defined as the trapped flux surface resistance normalized for the amount of trapped flux, depends on the mean free path. A systematic study of a variety of 1.3 GHz cavities with different surface treatments (EP, 120 °C bake and different N-doping) is carried out. A bell shaped trend appears for the range of mean free path studied. Over-doped cavities fall at the maximum of this curve defining the largest values of sensitivity. In addition, we have studied the trend of the BCS surface resistance contribution as a function of mean free path, showing that N-doped cavities follow close to the theoretical minimum. Adding these results together we show that the 2/6 N-doping treatment gives the highest Q-factor values at 2 K and 16 MV/m, as long as the magnetic field fully trapped during the cavity cooldown is lower than 10 mG.
