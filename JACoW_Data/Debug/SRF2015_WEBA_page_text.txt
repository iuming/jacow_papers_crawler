As the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) project ramps into production, vendor relations, cavity quality, and schedule become critical to success. The driver linac will be constructed of 332 cavities housed in 48 cryomodules and designed with two cavity classes (quarter-wave and half-wave) and four different betas (0.041, 0.085, 0.29, and 0.53). The cavities will be supplied to FRIB from awarded industrial vendors. FRIB’s experience with SRF cavity fabrication will be presented including acceptance inspections, test results, technical issues, and mitigation strategies.

All SPIRAL2 cryomodules (twelve with one quarter wave resonator (QWR) at β=0.07 and seven with two QWRs at β=0.12) have been produced and qualified, and are now in installation phase on the LINAC at GANIL. After a general introduction on the LINAC, we will first remember and compare the different design choices taken for the two families of cryomodules. We will then present a summary of the techniques used for the preparation and integration of the cavities in the cryomodules, and compare the achieved performances with design parameters. At last, we describe the status of the LINAC installation as of end of August 2015.

We have designed, fabricated and tested two new half-wave resonators following the successful development of a series of niobium superconducting quarter-wave cavities. The half-wave resonators are optimized for β = 0.11 ions, operate at 162.5 MHz and are intended to provide up to 2 MV effective voltage for particles with the optimal velocity. Testing of the first two half-wave resonators is complete with both reaching accelerating voltages greater than 3.5 MV with low-field residual resistances of 1.7 and 2.3 nΩ respectively. The intention of this paper is to provide insight into how Argonne achieves low-residual resistances and high surface fields in low-beta cavities by describing the cavity design, fabrication, processing and testing.

Recently we proposed a new project aimed at intensity upgrade of uranium beams of RIKEN RIBF. In this new project, construction of a superconducting linac is planned replacing the injector cyclotron so called RRC. The RIKEN superconducting linac consists of 14 cryomodules each of which contains four quarter-wave-resonators (QWRs) in each. The QWR operates at an rf frequency of 73 MHz in the continuous wave mode with beta as low as 0.055-1.008. A coaxial probe-type RF fundamental power-coupler which transmits RF power of several kW will be utilized for beam loading of 1.3 kW/resonator at the maximum with Qext of several x106. Tuning of the resonant frequency will be realized with a mechanical tuner pressing the resonator wall in the direction parallel to the beam. This year, we started a development of a test cryomodule with SC-QWRs. In this paper, design studies for a SC-QWR and its cryomodule, e.g., QWR, coupler, and, tuner will be presented together with a construction schedule of the prototype. Prototyping of a superconducting cavity and its test cryomodule was funded by ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan).

A 56 MHz superconducting RF cavity has been designed, fabricated and installed in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The cavity operates at 4.4 K with a “quiet helium source” to isolate the cavity from environmental acoustic noise. The cavity is a beam driven quarter wave resonator. It is detuned and damped during injection and acceleration cycles and is brought to operation only at store energy. We have observed clear luminosity increase and bunch length reduction in the first operation of the cavity with Au + Au and Au + He3 collisions. The cavity voltage was limited by quenching in the Higher Order Mode coupler. This paper also discusses the cavity beam experiments with no higher order mode coupler in p + p and p + Au RHIC operation.
