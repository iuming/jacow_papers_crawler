Superconducting linear accelerator and many beam experimental devices for the future of basic science research in Korea are making and preparing installation in Sindong linac tunnel north side of Daejeon, Korea. The key component of superconducting linac is the superconducting cavity and RISP linac has four types of superconducting cavities - quarter-wave, half-wave, and single spoke resonator type-1 and 2. In this paper, we introduce about the initial RF/EM design of single spoke resonator type-2 (SSR2) superconducting (SC) cavity, and explain about mechanical design. After explanation, we analyze mechanical design parameters of SSR2 SC cavity using ANSYS 18.0 structural solver and RRR 300 pure-niobium and stainless steel material properties.

In the future a new superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) high intensity heavy ion Linac should provide ion beams with a max. beam energy above the coulomb barrier for the Super Heavy Element (SHE) program at GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung. As a first step a newly developed superconducting 15-gap Crossbar H-cavity (CH-cavity) operated at 217 MHz has been successfully tested with heavy ion beam up to the design beam energy of 1.85 MeV/u for the first time. The design energy gain of 3.5 MV within a length of less than 70 cm has been validated with heavy ion beams of up to 1.5 particle mueA. The measured beam parameters showed excellent beam quality, while a dedicated beam dynamics layout provides beam energy variation between 1.2 and 2.2 MeV/u. The beam commissioning is a milestone of the R&D work of Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) and GSI in collaboration with Goethe University Frankfurt (GUF) and the first step towards a sc heavy ion cw-Linac with variable beam energy. The next two CH-cavities have already tested under cryogenic conditions. The results of the first successful heavy ion beam acceleration with a superconducting CH-cavity will be presented.

An 81.25 MHz continuous wave (CW) radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator has been developed and fabricated for the Low Energy Accelerator Facility (LEAF) by the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). The operation frequency is 81.25 MHz and the inter-vane voltage is a constant of 70 kV. It took about 44 hours continuous conditioning to reach RF power of 75 kW which is 1.1 time of the maximum designed operation power, and the CW operation of He+ beam and N2+ beam had successfully accelerated to the designed energy of 0.5 MeV/u. Both the results of the high power test and the beam test will be presented in this paper.
