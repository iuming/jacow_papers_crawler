Development of Higher Harmonic Superconducting Cavity for Light Sources

A new bunch lengthening cryomodule using a single-cell "higher-harmonic" superconducting cavity (HHC) operating at the 4th harmonic (1408 MHz) of the main RF is under development at Argonne. The system will be used to improve the Touschek lifetime and increase the single-bunch current limit in the upgraded multibend achromat lattice of the Advanced Photon Source electron storage ring. The system will use a pair of moveable 20 kW (each) CW RF power couplers to adjust the loaded Q and extract power from the beam. This will provide the flexibility to adjust the impedance presented to the beam and run at various beam currents. Higher-order modes (HOMs) induced by the circulating electron beam will be extracted along the beam axis and damped using a pair of room temperature beam line absorbers. The prototyping of the cavity, power couplers and HOM absorbers are discussed.

In circular or ring-based particle colliders, crabbing cavities are used to increase the luminosity. The first superconducting crabbing cavity system was successfully implemented at KEKB electron-positron collider that have demonstrated the luminosity increase with overlapping bunches. Crabbing systems are an essential component in the future colliders with intense beams, such as the LHC high luminosity upgrade and proposed electron-ion colliders. Novel compact superconducting cavity designs with improved rf properties, at low operating frequencies have been prototyped successfully that can deliver high operating voltages. We present single cavity and multi-cell crabbing cavities proposed for future particle colliders and addresses the challenges in those cavity systems.

Nb3Sn coatings on superconducting RF cavities can substantially improve performance compared to niobium. Substantially improved cryogenic efficiency has been demonstrated, and theoretical predictions suggest substantially improved accelerating gradients are possible. A Nb3Sn SRF program has begun at Fermilab, beginning with the design and fabrication of a Nb3Sn coating system. In this contribution, we present the design, assembly, and commissioning efforts related to this system.
