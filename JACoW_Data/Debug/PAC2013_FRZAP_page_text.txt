As demonstrated by several presentations at this meeting, particle accelerators are now very widely used for a number of industrial applications. Many of the systems being employed have their origins in accelerators developed for basic science research, but now their production is a worldwide business conducted by more than 70 companies and institutes that collectively ship more than 1000 units per year. The industrial applications of these accelerators cover a broad range of business segments from low energy electron beam systems for welding, machining, and product irradiation to high energy cyclotrons and synchrotrons for radioisotope production and synchrotron radiation production. This talk is a review of the status of these business segments and the predicted growth in them. It will also cover the new accelerator technology under development that will be used by industry in the future.
