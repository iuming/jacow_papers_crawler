Computation has long been an important part of modeling and simulation in science and engineering. As technology advances, demand for high-fidelity modeling and simulation increases. This subsequently requires large-scale computation. Today's computation is often performed on computers that have thousands or even millions of processing units. There are challenges that must be overcome in order for these processing units to work cooperatively and effectively. We will discuss some of these challenges in this talk and in the context accelerator modeling and simulation.
