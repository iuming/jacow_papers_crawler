NICA (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility) is a new accelerator complex being assembled at JINR to search for the mixed phase of baryonic matter and to investigate the nature of nucleon/particle spin. The polarized proton beams will be operated at the energy range of 5-12.6 GeV, the beam intensity in each ring of 2.2x1013 and the luminosity of 1x1032 cm-2 s-1. The conception of formation of high intensive proton beams is discussed for two different schemes. In first scheme the protons are injected from Nuclotron to Collider at an energy of 2-2.5 GeV to provide the cooling and the storage at this energy and then they are accelerated up to energy of experiments. In the second scheme the cooling of protons is realized in one from accelerators of the injection chain and the protons are injected from Nuclotron to Collider at energy of experiments, where they are stored up required intensity.

NICA collider complex is under construction at JINR. The initial configuration of the collider will perform collisions of fully stripped heavy ions, 209 Bi and others, for a study of phase transition in the quark-gluon plasma in the energy range 1/4.5 GeV/u per beam. Commissioning of the collider injection chain has been recently started. The complex includes 2 linacs, 2 Booster synchrotrons (Booster and Nuclotron to support the beam injection to the collider), and 2 collider rings of 503 m circumference. The design luminosity is ~1027 1/(cm*s) at 4.5 GeV/u. The heavy ions are generated in the ESIS-type ion source with intensity ~10 9 /pulse. Then they are accelerated into the linac and Booster and directed to stripping target. Next, fully stripped ions are accelerated in the Nuclotron and injected into Collider. The electron and stochastic cooling are used in each of the collider rings to support beam accumulation and to prevent the emittance growth due to intrabeam scattering. Three RF systems are used for longitudinal phase space manipulations. An achievement of design luminosity requires overcoming many technological and beam physics problems which are discussed in this paper.

The dynamic of longitudinal motion in Barrier Bucket RF structure is considered. To preserve the stability of the proton beam during the acceleration to the experiment energy it is necessary to cross the transition energy and a rapid jump of transition energy is possible. The influence of the second-order slip factor is taking into account, as well as the space charge effect. The dynamic aperture is investigated for various gradients of focusing quadrupoles and corresponding working points which is necessary for transition crossing.

The idea of the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) search using the storage ring with polarized beam demands long Spin Coherence Time (SCT). It is the time during which the RMS spread of the orientation of spins of all particles in the bunch reaches one radian. Long SCT is needed to observe a coherent effect on polarization induced by the EDM. The possibility of getting a 1000 s SCT for deuterons has been shown experimentally at COoler SYnchrotron (COSY), accelerator at FZJ Jülich, Germany. Reaching high values of SCT for protons is more challenging due to a higher anomalous magnetic moment. Obtaining sufficient proton SCT is obligatory for planned EDM search experiments at COSY and the ProtoType EDM Ring (PTR). It has been shown that the second order momentum compaction factor (alpha1) has to be optimized along with chromaticities to get high SCT. Three families of sextupoles have to be used. The optimal values of chromaticities and alpha1 are discussed. The racetrack option of PTR is investigated.

A new experiment to measure electric dipole moments (EDMs) of elementary particles, based on the Frequency Domain method, has been proposed for implementation at the NICA facility (JINR, Russia). EDM experiments in general, being measurement-of-polarization experiments, require long spin-coherence times at around 1,000 seconds. The FD method involves a further complication (well paid off in orders of precision) of switching the polarity of the guiding field as part of its CW-CCW injection procedure. This latter procedure necessitates a calibration process, during which the beam polarization axis changes its orientation from the radial (used for the measurement) to the vertical (used for the calibration) direction. If this change occurs adiabatically, the beam particles’ spin-vectors follow the direction of the polarization axis, which undermines the calibration technique; however, concerns were raised as to whether violation of adiabaticity could damage spin-coherence.

The successful operation of large scale particle accelerators depends on the precise correction of unavoidable magnetic field or magnet alignment errors present in the machine. During the LHC Run 2, local linear coupling in the interaction regions (IR) was shown to have a significant impact on the beam size, making its proper handling a necessity for Run 3 and the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A new approach to accurately minimise the local IR linear coupling based on correlated external variables such as the |C-| had been proposed, which relies on the application of a rigid waist shift in order to create an asymmetry in the IR optics. In this contribution, preliminary corrections from the 2021 beam test and the early 2022 commissioning are presented, as well as first results of the new method’s experimental configuration tests in the LHC Run 3 commissioning.

Local interaction region (IR) linear coupling in the LHC has been shown to have a negative impact on beam size and luminosity, making its accurate correction for Run 3 and beyond a necessity. In view of determining corrections, supervised machine learning has been applied to the detection of linear coupling sources, showing promising results in simulations. An evaluation of different applied models is given, followed by the presentation of further possible application concepts for linear coupling corrections using machine learning.

A new scenario for the first operational run of the HL-LHC era (Run 4) has been recently developed to accommodate a period of performance ramp-up to achieve an annual integrated luminosity close to the nominal HL-LHC design. The operational scenario in terms of beam parameters and machine settings, as well as the different phases, are described here along with the impact of potential delays on key hardware components.

The correction of the local optics at the Interaction Regions of the LHC is crucial to ensure a good performance of the machine. This is even more important for the future LHC upgrade, HL-LHC, where the optics is more sensitive to magnetic errors. For that reason, it is important to explore alternative techniques for local optics corrections. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the Action Phase Jump method for optics correction in the LHC and the HL-LHC and explore ways to integrate this technique in regular operations.

The development of MAD-X was started more than 20 years ago and it still remains the main tool for single particle dynamics for both optics design, error studies as well as for operational model-based software at CERN. In this article, we outline some of the recent development of MAD-X and plans for the future. In particular, we focus on the development of the twiss module used to calculate optics functions in MAD-X which is based on first and second order matrices. These have traditionally been calculated as an expansion around the ideal orbit. In this paper, we describe explicitly how an expansion around the closed orbit can be employed instead, in order to get more precise results. We also describe the latest development of the beam-beam long range wire compensator in MAD-X, an element that has been implemented using the aforementioned approach.

The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will reach a nominal, levelled luminosity of §I{5e34}{\per\cm\square\per\second} and a stored energy of nearly §I{700}{MJ} in each of the two proton beams. The new large-aperture final focusing Nb3Sn quadrupole magnets in IR1 and IR5, which are essential to achieve the luminosity target, will be protected using the novel Coupling Loss Induced Quench (CLIQ) system. A spurious discharge of a CLIQ unit will impact the circulating beam through higher order multipolar field components that develop rapidly over a few turns. This paper reports on dedicated beam tracking studies performed to evaluate the criticality of this failure on the HL-LHC beam. Simulations for different machine and optics configurations show that the beam losses reach a critical level after only five machine turns following the spurious CLIQ trigger, which is much faster than assumed in previous simulations that did not consider the higher order multipolar fields. Machine protection requirements using a dedicated interlock to mitigate this failure are discussed.

In the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era, the bunch intensity will be increased to νm{2.2e11} protons, which is almost twice the nominal LHC intensity. The stored energy in each of the two beams will increase to §I{674}{MJ}. The HL-LHC will feature beams whose transverse halos are partially depleted by means of a hollow electron lens. The reduced stored energy in the beam tails will significantly change the development of losses caused by failures. This paper reports on beam tracking simulations evaluating the effect of a partially depleted halo on the criticality and detection of failures originating from the superconducting magnet protection systems. In addition, the effect of the transverse damper operating as a coherent excitation system leading to orbit excursions on a beam with a partially depleted halo is discussed. The results in terms of time-dependent beam losses are presented. The margins between the failure onset, its detection, and the time to reach critical loss levels, are discussed. The results are extrapolated to failure cases of different origins that induce similar beam loss dynamics.

The design and assessment of machine-protection systems for existing and future high-energy accelerators comprises the study of accidental beam impact on machine elements. In case of a direct impact of a large number of high-energy particle bunches in one location, the damage range in the material is significantly increased due to an effect known as hydrodynamic tunnelling. The effect is caused by the beam-induced reduction of the material density along the beam trajectory, which allows subsequent bunches to penetrate deeper into the target. The assessment of the damage range requires the sequential coupling of an energy-deposition code, like FLUKA, and a hydrodynamic code, like Autodyn. The paper presents the simulations performed for the impact of the nominal LHC beam at 7 TeV on a graphite target. It describes the optimisation of the simulation setup and the required coupling workflow. The resulting energy deposition and the evolution of the target density are discussed.

Beam-Based Reconstruction of the Shielded Quench-Heater Fields for the LHC Main Dipoles

Small orbit oscillations of the circulating particle beams have been observed immediately following quenches in the LHC’s superconducting main dipole magnets. Magnetic fields generated during the discharge into the quench heaters were identified as the cause. Since the resulting, shielded field inside the beam screen cannot be measured in-situ, the time evolution of the field has to be reconstructed from the measured beam excursions. In this paper, the field-reconstruction method using rotation in normalized phase space and the optimized fitting algorithm are described. The resulting rise times and magnetic field levels are presented for quench events that occurred during regular operation as well as for dedicated beam experiments. Finally, different approaches to model the shielding behavior of the beam screen are discussed.

The FCC-ee collider baseline foresees four different energy operation modes: Z, WW, H(ZH) and ttbar. An optional fifth mode, called s-channel Higgs production mode, could allow the measurement of the electron Yukawa coupling, in dedicated runs at 125 GeV centre-of-mass energy, provided that the centre-of-mass energy spread, can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude (5-10 MeV). The use of a special collision technique: a monochromatization scheme is one way to accomplish it. There are several methods to implement a monochromatization scheme. One method, named transverse monochromatization scheme, consists of introducing a dispersion different from zero but opposite sign for the two colliding beams at the Interaction Point (IP); In this paper we will report about the first attempt to design a new optics to implement a transverse monochromatic scheme for the FCC-ee Higgs production totally compatible with the standard mode of operation without dispersion at the IP.

Two helical full snakes are used in both Blue and Yellow rings of RHIC collider, in order to preserve beam polarization during acceleration to collision energy and polarization lifetime at store. A snake in RHIC is comprised of four 2.4m long modules, powered by pair. During the startup of RHIC Run 22 in December 2021, two successive power dips have caused the 9 o’clock RHIC BlBrookhaven Science Associates, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC02-98CH10886 with the U.S. Department of Energy.ue ring snake to loose two of its four modules. In spite of this regrettable loss, it has been possible to maintain near 180deg snake precession, by proper powering of the remaining two modules, as well as, by re-tuning the 3 o’clock sister snake, vertical spin precession axis around the ring and spin tune 1/2. Determining these new settings, in order to salvage polarization with the handicapped Blue snake pair, has required series of numerical simulations, a brief overview is given here.

A tilt in the spin direction from the vertical has been observed for a number of years in the RHIC collider during store. This tilt has been extensively studied by scanning snake strengths, energies and orbital angles during the 2017 polarized proton run. Using a spin transport model, we attempt to model this spin tilt by fitting all the relevant data.

Novel plasma-based accelerators, as well as advanced, high-gradient beam-manipulation techniques’for example passive or active plasma lenses’require reliable and well-characterized plasma sources, each optimized for their individual task. A very efficient and proven way of producing plasmas for these applications is by directly discharging an electrical current through a confined gas volume. To host the development of such discharge-based plasma sources for advanced accelerators, the ATHENA Discharge deVelopment ANd Characterization Experiment (ADVANCE) laboratory has been established at DESY. In this contribution we introduce the laboratory, give a summary of available infrastructure and diagnostics, as well as a brief overview of current and planned scientific goals.

ILC is an electron-positron linear collider based on Superconducting linear accelerator. Linear collider is an only solution to realinze high energy electron-positron collision beyond the limit of synchrotron radiation energy loss by ring colliders. Beam current of injector of linear colliders is much larger than that of ring colliders because the beam is not reusable. Providing an enough amount of particles, especially positron is a technical issue. In this article, we present a design of electron driven positron source for ILC. After optimizations, the system design is established with an enough technical margin, e.g. avoiding potential damage on the production target.

In E-Driven positron source of ILC, the generated positron is captured by a standing wave cavity. Because the deceleration capture method is employed, the positron is off-crest over the linac. Because the beam-loading is expected to be more than 1A in a multi-bunch format, the compensation is essential to obtain uniform intensity over the pulse. A conventional method for the compensation controlling the timing doesn’t work because RF and Beam induced field are in different phase. In this manuscript, we discuss the compensation with the off-crest acceleration case. A simple phase modulation on the input RF is a solution.

Flat beam generation from angular momentum dominated beam with a phase-space rotation technique is an unique method to manipulate the phase-space distribution of beam. As an application, the asymmetric emittance beam generation for linear colliders is considered to compensate the Beamstrahlung effect at Interaction point. By using this technique, the asymmetric beam can be generated directly with the injector, instead of radiation damping with a huge damping ring. We present the result of a proof-of-principle experiment at KEK-STF.

The SuperKEKB accelerator is currently in operation in Tsukuba, Japan, with a planned long shutdown in 2026. Among the possible upgrades being considered during this period is the change to a polarized electron beam in the High Energy Ring. Such a change would require modifications in the source generation and transport, geometrical and lattice variations to provide spin rotation, and polarimetry. A Polarized SuperKEKB Working Group has been formed from members of the Belle II experiment and the SuperKEKB accelerator team to investigate the possibilities and challenges of these modifications. This presentation lays out the goals and motivations of polarizing the electron beam, considers the necessary changes to the existing accelerator and their feasibility and reports progress in investigations to this point.

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the next-generation nuclear science facility, is under the design at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The present RHIC rings will be reconfigured as the Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) for the EIC. Design of a stripline injection kicker for the HSR for beams with the rigidity of  ∼  81   T-m poses some technical challenges due to the expected shorter bunch spacing, heating due to higher peak current and the larger number of bunches, and the required higher pulsed voltage. Recently, we updated its mechanical design to optimize the characteristic and beam coupling impedances. In addition, we incorporated the impedance tuning capability by introducing the kicker aperture adjustment mechanism. Finally, we incorporated high voltage FID feedthroughs (FC26) to this kicker. This paper reports the design and optimization updates of the HSR injection kicker including the impedance tuning capability, optimization of both the characteristic and the beam coupling impedances, and finally the incorporation of a high voltage feedthrough design.

Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES-II) operation in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), aiming to explore the phase transition between quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadronic gas, exceeded the goal of a four-fold increase in the average luminosity over the range of five gold beam energies (9.8, 7.3, 5.75, 4.59 and 3.85 GeV/nucleon) compared to those achieved during Beam Energy Scan phase I (BES-I). We will present the achievements in BES-II together with a summary of the measures taken to improve RHIC performance in the presence of several beam dynamics effects, and details on improvements made during the operation at 3.85 GeV/nucleon in 2021.

The first priority of RHIC operation in 2021 was the Au+Au collisions at 3.85 GeV/nucleon, which is the lowest energy to complete the 3-year Beam Energy Scan II physics program, with RF-based electron cooling. In addition, RHIC also operated for several other physics programs including fixed target experiments, O+O at 100 GeV/nucleon, Au+Au at 8.65 GeV/nucleon, and d+Au at 100 GeV/nucleon. This report presents the operational experience and the results from RHIC operation in 2021. With Au+Au collisions at 3.85 GeV/nucleon reported in a separate report, this paper focuses on the operation conditions for the other programs mentioned above.

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will be built in the existing Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) tunnel with the addition of electron acceleration and storage rings. The two RHIC rings will be reconfigured as a single Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) for accelerating and storing ion beams. The proton beam energy will be raised from 255 to 275 GeV to achieve the desired center-of-mass energy range: 20’140 GeV. It is also mandatory to operate the HSR with a constant revolution frequency over a large energy range (41’275 GeV for protons) to synchronize with the Electron Storage Ring (ESR). These and other requirements/challenges dictate modifications to RHIC accelerators. This report gives an overview of the modifications to the RHIC straight sections together with their individual challenges.

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) presently under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory will collide polarized high energy electron beams with hadron beams with design luminosities up to 1×1034cm-2s-1 in the center mass energy range of 20-140 GeV. We simulated the planned electron-proton collision of flat beams with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) based Poisson solver in strong-strong beam-beam simulation. We observed a much larger proton emittance growth rate than that from weak-strong simulation. To understand the numerical noises further, we calculate the beam size growth rate of macro-particles as function of their initial longitudinal and transverse actions. This method is applied to both strong-strong and weak-strong simulations. The purpose of this study is to identify which group of macro-particles contributes most of the artificial emittance growth in strong-strong beam-beam simulation.

In this article, we evaluate the dynamic aperture of the Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) with symplectic element-by-element tracking. Crab cavities, nonlinear magnetic field errors, and weak-strong beam-beam interaction are included. We compared the dynamic aperture from head-on collision to crossing-angle collision and found the reason for the dynamic aperture drop. We also studied the field error tolerances for IR magnets and for some particular magnets.

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) presently under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory will collide polarized high energy electron beams with hadron beams, reaching luminosities up to 1×1034cm-2s-1 in center mass energy range of 20-140 GeV. We studied the planned electron-proton collisions using a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) based Poisson solver in strong-strong beam-beam simulation. We observed a much larger proton emittance growth rate than in weak-strong simulation. To understand the numerical noise and its impact on strong-strong simulation results, we carried out extensive studies to identify all possible causes for artificial emittance growth and quantify their contributions. In this article, we summarize our study activities and findings. This work will help us better understand the simulated emittance growth and the limits of the PIC based strong-strong beam-beam simulation.

I In previous and existing hadron storage rings, the horizontal and vertical emittances are normally the same or very close. For the Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the design proton transverse emittance ratio is 10:1. To maintain this large emittance ratio, we need to have an online fine decoupling system to prevent transverse emittance exchange. For this purpose, we carried out fine decoupling experiments in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and reviewed its previous operational data. Analytical prediction and numerical simulation are preformed to estimate how small the global coupling coefficient should be to maintain a 10:1 emittance ratio.

We simulated the planned electron-proton collision of flat beams with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) based Poisson solver in strong-strong beam-beam simulation. We observed a much larger proton emittance growth rate than that from weak-strong simulation. To better understand the emittance growth rate from the strong-strong simulation, we compare the beam-beam kicks between the PIC method and the analytical calculation and calculate the RMS variation in beam-beam kicks among 1000 sets of random Gaussian particle distributions. The impacts of macro-particle number, grid number, and bunch flatness are also studied.

The high luminosity electron ion collider (EIC) will provide great opportunities in nuclear physics study and is under active design. The coherent effects due to the beam-beam interaction of two colliding beams can cause beam size blow-up and degrade the luminosity in the EIC. In this paper, we report on the study of coherent beam-beam effects in the EIC design using self-consistent strong-strong simulations. These simulations show the coherent dipole and quadrupole mode instabilities in the tune working point scan and bunch intensity scan.

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will collide electrons with hadrons at center-of-mass energies up to 140 GeV (in the case of electron-proton collisions). A 3.8-kilometer electron storage ring is being designed, which will store electrons with a range of energies up to 18 GeV for collisions at one or two interaction points. At energies up to 10 GeV the arcs will be tuned to provide 60 degree phase advance per cell in both planes, whereas at top energy of 18 GeV a 90 degree phase advance per cell will be used, which largely compensates for the horizontal emittance increase with energy. The optics must be matched at three separate energies, and the different phase-advance requirements in both the arc cells and the straight sections make this challenging. Moreover, the spin rotators must fulfill requirements for polarization and spin matching at widely different energies while satisfying technical constraints. In this paper these challenges and proposed solutions are presented and discussed.

The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is under design at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The EIC aims at providing high luminosity and high polarization collisions for a large range of beam energies. Dynamic aperture (DA) of the EIC Electron Storage Ring (ESR) must be sufficiently large in both transverse and momentum dimensions. The latter is a challenge due to low-beta optics in up to two interaction regions (IR). We have developed an advanced technique for efficient non-linear chromaticity compensation compatible with the different ESR lattice configurations at different energies. The solution for the most challenging lattice with two IRs at 18 GeV is presented. The lattice is then evaluated with magnet errors, where the error tolerances are determined for reaching the desired DA.

While for most storage ring design activities it is sufficient to assume a Gaussian distribution of the beam particles, a more detailed prediction of the population in the transverse tails is necessary to predict the beam lifetime in a given aperture. Dominant processes that result in non-Gaussian distributions are the beam-beam interaction in a collider as well as beam-gas scattering. Simulations to determine the required apertures and vacuum levels in the EIC electron storage ring will be presented.

In recent years, high-gradient, symmetric focusing with active plasma lenses has regained significant interest due to the potential advantages in compactness and beam dynamics compared to conventional focusing elements. One potential application is the optical matching of highly divergent positrons from the undulator-based ILC positron source into the downstream accelerating structures. A collaboration between University Hamburg and DESY Hamburg has been established to develop a prototype design for this application. Here, we discuss beam dynamics simulation results, preliminary parameters of the lens prototype, and the current status of the prototype design.

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) project* has been approved by the Department of Energy to be built at the site of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The goal of the project is the collision of energetic (of many GeV/amu) ion species with electron bunches of energies up to 18 GeV. The EIC includes two electron rings, the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) which accelerates the electron beam up to 18 GeV, and the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) which stores the electron beam for collisions with hadron beam, both to be installed in the same tunnel as the Hadron Storage Ring (HSR). This paper discusses the layout and the beam optics of the injection/extraction beam lines the electron rings and the beam optics of the transfer line from the RCS to the ESR ring.

In the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) design, to avoid vertical orbit bumps in the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) at some crossing points with Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) to preserve the electron polarization, we plan to tilt the ESR plane by 200 ’rad with an axis connecting IP6 and IP8. In this article, we study the beam-beam interaction when two rings are not in the same plane. The Lorentz boost formula is derived and the required vertical crabbing strength is calculated to compensate the dynamic effect The strong-strong simulations are performed to validate the theory.

The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) uses crab cavities to restore the geometrical luminosity loss. Due to the space limitation, the detector solenoid cannot be compensated locally. This paper presents the lattice design to compensate the detector solenoid without interfering the crab cavities. The skew quadrupoles are employed to avoid additional crab cavities. The correction scheme is checked by beam-beam simulation.

A high-energy muon collider could be the most powerful and cost-effective collider approach in the multi-TeV regime, and a neutrino source based on decay of an intense muon beam would be ideal for measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters. Muon beams may be created through the decay of pions produced in the interaction of a proton beam with a target. The muons are subsequently accelerated and injected into a storage ring where they decay producing a beam of neutrinos, or collide with counter-rotating antimuons. Cooling of the muon beam would enable more muons to be accelerated resulting in a more intense neutrino source and higher collider luminosity. Ionization cooling is the novel technique by which it is proposed to cool the beam. The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment collaboration has constructed a section of an ionization cooling cell and used it to provide the first demonstration of ionization cooling. Here the observation of ionization cooling is described. The results of the further analysis of the data is presented, including studies in different magnet configurations and with more detailed understanding of the detector systematic uncertainty.

FCC-ee injector study foresees 3.5~nC electron and positron bunches with 200 Hz repetition and 2 bunches per linac pulse at 6~GeV extraction energy. Regarding the possible options of positron production, we retain both of the conventional amorphous target and the hybrid target options. The hybrid scheme uses an intense photon production by 6 GeV electrons impinging on a crystal oriented along a lattice axis. In such a way, it involves two targets: a crystal as a photon radiator and an amorphous target-converter. Therefore, to avoid early failure or damage of the target, the candidate materials for the crystal and conversion targets have started to be tested by using the intense electron beam at Mainzer Mikrotron in Germany by the end of 2021. By manipulating the beam intensity, focusing, and chopping, a Peak Energy Deposition Density in the tested targets could be achieved close to that generated by the electron/photon beam in the FCC-ee positron target. Radiation-damage studies of the crystal sample have been also performed allowing estimating the effect on the photon enhancement used in the hybrid positron source.

CERN accelerators underwent a period of long shutdown from the end of 2018 to 2020. During this time frame, significant hardware and software upgrades have been put in place to increase the performance of both proton and ion accelerator chains in the High Luminosity LHC era. In the context of the CERN lead ion chain, 2021 has been mainly devoted to restore the injectors’ performance and to successfully prove the slip-stacking technique in SPS. In this paper we summarise the key milestones of the ion beam commissioning and the achieved beam performance for the Linac 3 (including the source), LEIR and PS accelerators, together with an outlook on 2022 operation.

To date, no dedicated attempt has been made to correct skew-sextupole resonances in the LHC at injection. Recently this topic has gained interest however, following the investigation for the emittance growth generation during the LHC energy ramp, due to third order islands. The LHC is equipped with skew-sextupole correctors in the experimental insertions (MCSSX), intended for local compensation at top energy, and with several families of skew sextupole magnets in the arcs (MSS), which are intended for chromatic coupling compensation at top energy but are not optimally placed for resonance compensation. Simulation studies were performed in MAD-X and PTC to assess whether the MSS and MCSSX correctors could be used to compensate skew-sextupole RDTs in the LHC at injection via a response matrix approach, based on measured values at the LHC BPMs. It was found that compensation was viable, but at the cost of significantly increased corrector strength compared to chromatic coupling compensation.

Magnetic measurements revealed that the normal decapole (b5) errors of the recombination dipoles (D2) could have a systematic component of up to 11 units. Based on previous studies, it was predicted that the current corrections would not be able to compensate this, thereby leading to a degradation of the dynamic aperture by about 0.5 - 1 ’. On the other hand, the separation dipole D1 is expected to have a systematic b5 component of 6-7 units and its contribution to the resonance driving terms will partly compensate the effect of D2, due to the opposite field strength of the main component. Simulations were performed with the HL-LHC V1.4 lattice to test these concerns and to verify the compensation assumption. In addition, various normal decapole resonance driving terms were examined for correction, the results of which are presented in this contribution.

Amplitude detuning measurements in the LHC have shown that a significant amount of detuning is generated in Beam 1 via feed-down from decapole and dodecapole field errors in the triplets of the experiment insertion regions, while in Beam 2 this detuning is negligible. In this study, we investigate the cause of this behavior and we attempt to find corrections that use the feed-down from the nonlinear correctors in the insertion region for amplitude detuning.

A Flexible Nonlinear Resonance Driving Term Based Correction Algorithm with Feed-Down

The optics in the insertion regions of the LHC and its upgrade project the High Luminosity LHC are very sensitive to local magnetic errors, due to the extremely high beta-functions. In collision optics, the non-zero closed orbit in the same region leads to a "feed-down" of high-order errors to lower orders, causing additional effects detrimental to beam lifetime. An extension to the well-established method for correcting these errors by locally suppressing resonance driving terms has been undertaken, not only taking this feed-down into account, but also adding the possibility of utilizing it such that the powering of higher-order correctors will compensate for lower order errors. Existing correction schemes have also operated on the assumption of (anti-)symmetric beta-functions of the optics in the two rings. This assumption can fail for a multitude of reasons, such as inherently asymmetric optics and unevenly distributed errors. In this respect, an extension of this correction scheme has been developed, removing the need for symmetry by operating on the two separate optics of the beams simultaneously.

In this paper, we present the simulation and optimisation of the FCC-ee positron source, where a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) solenoid is used as the matching device to collect positrons from the target. The "conventional" target scheme is used which simply consists of amorphous tungsten. The target is placed inside the bore of the HTS solenoid to improve the accepted positron yield at the entrance of the damping ring and the location of the target is optimised. The latest recommended baseline beam parameters are used and presented. An optimisation of the ideal positron yield using the analytic SC solenoid on-axis field is also performed and shows that the design of the HTS solenoid is optimal as far as the accepted positron yield is concerned.

The international FCC study group published in 2019 a Conceptual Design Report for an electron-positron collider with a centre-of-mass energy from 90 to 365 GeV with a beam currents of up to 1.4 A per beam. The high beam current of this collider create challenging requirements on the injection chain and all aspects of the linac need to be carefully reconsidered and revisited, including the injection time structure. The entire beam dynamics studies for the full linac, damping ring and transfer lines are major activities of the injector complex design. A key point is that any increase of positron production and capture efficiency reduces the cost and complexity of the driver linac, the heat and radiation load of the converter system, and increases the operational margin. In this paper we will give an overview of the status of the injector complex design and introduce the new layout that has been proposed by the study group working in the context of the CHART collaboration. In this framework, furthermore, we also present the preliminary studies of the FCC-ee positron source highlighting the main requirements and constraints.

The interplay of beam-beam interaction, machine imperfections, and beam coupling impedance makes it difficult to predict the luminosity performance of SuperKEKB. Since 2020, the crab waist scheme was introduced to SuperKEKB to suppress beam-beam resonances. The coherent beam-beam head-tail instability and beam-beam driven synchro-betatron resonances due to large crossing angle can drive horizontal blowup, which cannot be suppressed by crab waist. The longitudinal impedance modulates the synchrotron motion and therefore affects beam-beam instability. In this paper, we compare simulations and measurements of luminosity and discuss the challenges and direction toward developing a predictable luminosity simulation model for SuperKEKB.

The Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) is planning to upgrade its photoinjector for the drive-beam accelerator. The main goal of the upgrade is to improve the beam brightness using a symmetrized RF-gun cavity. In the process, the photoinjector was reconfigured and some of the solenoid magnets redesigned. A challenging aspect of this optimization is that the injector should be able to produce bright low-charge (~1 nC) bunches while also being capable of operating at high-charge (~50 nC) bunches. This paper will discuss the optimization of the beam dynamics for the low- and high-charge cases and explore the performances of the proposed configuration using a model of the full AWA drive-beam beamline including 3D field maps for the external electromagnetic fields. The optimizations are performed with ASTRA and the DEAP toolbox and with OPAL.
