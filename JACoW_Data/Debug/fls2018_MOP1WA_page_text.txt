The LCLS-II XFEL will be based on a 4 GeV CW SRF linac and will produce x-ray pulses at 1 MHz over the spectral range of 200 to 5,00 eV. The rf gun will be installed and tested in early 2018; cryomodules are being produced at Fermilab and Jefferson lab and shipped to SLAC; undulator segments are being fabricated at LBNL and measured at SLAC. In parallel, a High Energy upgrade will be described which would extend the linac to 8 GeV and increase the spectral range to 12.8 keV.

A tunable femtosecond X-ray laser, PAL-XFEL have sub-20- fs timing jitter between XFEL pulses and optical laser pulses, which make this machine extremely useful for time-resolved experiments with high time resolution. We describe the effort made to minimize timing jitter of XFEL machine and to synchronize optical laser system to our low phase noise RF reference. Passively stabilized RF timing distribution system and phase-locked oscillators provide 1 fs level jitter, and carefully designed LLRF and modulator system provide 10-4 level energy stability of electron bunches. The electron bunch arrival jitter is measured less than 20 fs with a phase cavity. Cross correlation between XFEL and optical laser also showed less than 20 fs timing jitter.
