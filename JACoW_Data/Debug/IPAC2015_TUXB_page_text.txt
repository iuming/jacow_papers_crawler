This paper gives an overview of the opportunities and challenges of high-intensity, low-energy light-ion accelerators for neutron production. Applications of this technology range from the study of stellar nucleosynthesis and astrophysical phenomena to medical applications such as Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The paper includes details of the FRANZ facility, under development at Frankfurt University.

The UNIversal Linear Accelerator (UNILAC) at GSI serves as injector for all ion species from protons to uranium since four decades. Its 108 MHz Alvarez type DTL providing acceleration from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u has suffered from material fatigue. The DTL will be replaced by a completely new section with almost same design parameters, i.e. pulsed current of up to 15 mA of 238U28+ at 11.4 MeV/u. A dedicated terminal & LEBT for operation with 238U4+ is currently constructed. The uranium sources need to be upgraded in order to provide increased beam brilliances and for operation at 3 Hz. In parallel a 70 MeV / 70 mA proton linac based on H-mode cavities is under design and construction. This contribution will also give a brief summary of the overall status of the FAIR project.

700 kW Main Injector Operations for NOvA at FNAL
1286

Following a successful career as an antiproton storage and cooling ring, the Fermilab Recycler was repurposed as a proton stacker as part of the NOvA project, in order to increase the maximum NuMI beam power from 400 kW to 700 kW. Using the Recycler to prepare beam for acceleration in the Main Injector, we have been able to increase the beam power delivered to NuMI to a sustained weekly average in excess of 400 kW and a best hourly average of 482.8 kW. I discuss the commissioning progress to date, and describe the remaining steps along the way to achieving the 700 kW design goal.
