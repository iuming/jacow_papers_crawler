A new heavy ion linac as the injector for the Separated Sector Cyclotron (SSC), named SSC-Linac[1], is being under constructed at the national laboratory Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). The SSC-Linac mainly consists of a 4-rod RFQ and three IH-DTL cavities which can accelerate ion of A⁄q≤7from 3.73 keV/u to 1.025 MeV/u. Both of themoperating at 53.667MHz had been developed. In the commissioning, ions weresuccessfully accelerated to 0.295MeV/u by IH-DTL1. The beam commissioningof the IH-DTL2 which can accelerate the ion to 0.586MeV/u will come soon. In this paper, the recent R&D progress of the SSC-Linac including the development of key components and the beam commissioning results arepresented.

An interdigital H-mode drift tube linac (IH-DTL) will be constructed as a postinjector linac for the Heavy Ion Medical Machine (HIMM). Its resonant frequency, injec-tion and final energies are determined from beam dynamics and hardware parameters considerations of the entire machine to be 162.5MHz, 600keV/u and 4MeV/u, respectively. The beam duty cycle of the injector linac is less than 0.1% based on the injection requirements of the synchrotron. Beam dynamics and RF structure design and optimize of the IH-DTL has been finished. The maximum surface electric field is less than 2.0-times the Kilpatric limit for accelerating C4+ beam. This IH-DTL contains 42 accelerating gaps and two focusing quadrupole triplets. In order to examine the field distribution of the IH-DTL which reaches the length of 3.17m, an aluminum alloy 1:1 cold model cavity with 4 moveable tuners and 2 empty focusing magnet shell was constructed. The relative intertube-distance errors are less than ±50μm. The measurements show that the gap voltage values can match the CST-MWS simulating results within relative difference of ±3% by adjusting the 4 moveable tuners.

A Low Energy intense-highly-charged ion Accelerator Facility (LEAF), which mainly includes an ECR ion source, LEBT and an 81.25 MHz RFQ, was designed to produce and accelerate heavy ions, from helium to uranium with A/Q between 2 and 7, to the energy of 0.5 MeV/u. The typical beam intensity is designed up to 2 emA CW for the uranium beam. The facility has been successfully commissioned with He+ (A/Q=4) and N2+ (A/Q=7) beams and accelerated the beams in the CW regime to the designed energy of 0.5 MeV/u. Beam properties and transmission efficiencies were measured, indicating a good consistency with simulated data. After having briefly recalled the project scope and parameters, this paper describes the beam commissioning strategy and detailed commissioning results.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams tunes the beam power from 0 to 400KW by chopping the beam current with a beam chopper in the Low Energy Beam Transport. A chopper monitoring system is employed to verify proper chopper operation to avoid delivery of undesired high-powered beam and to inhibit beam for machine protection purposes. The system monitors the incoming beam gate time structure, the chopper switch high voltage pulses, the chopper electrode charge/discharge currents, and the status of machine protection system. It is designed to switch off the beam within tens of nanoseconds of a detected fault. Chal-lenges include a dynamic beam gate pulse structure with pulse lengths as short as 0.6 µs and high voltage power supply current pulses of ~25 ns. A high speed "integrate and hold circuit with reset", Field Program-mable Gate Array based digital control circuit and high speed ADC circuit were developed to fulfil the re-quired functions. Design approach, simulation, and test results with the beam are the focus of this paper.

The muon linac to accelerate muons 212 MeV is planned in order to measure the muon dipole moments precisely in the J-PARC. The muon acceleration with a RF accelerator hasn’t been demonstrated yet in the world. Therefore the muon acceleration test with the RFQ as the feasibility test of the muon linac was demonstrated at the Muon D line in the J-PARC MLF. Conventional muons are cooled with producing ultra-slow muons using the muonium production and the ionization laser for the muon linac. However these apparatuses couldn’t be used because of the limitation of the experimental area in the acceleration test. Therefore the conventional muon was converted to the negative muonium ion (Mu-) with less than 2 keV using the thin aluminum foil target as the easy cooling method. The Mu- was finally accelerated to 90 keV using the RFQ. The accelerated Mu- was selected with a diagnostic beam line and identified with the Time-Of-Flight measurement using a MCP detector. The result of the world’s first muon acceleration test with the RFQ will be reported in this presentation.

Heavy ion injector I-3 represents two-gap 2.5 MHz resonator with accelerating voltage 2x2 MV. It‘s used with laser ion source for acceleration of heavy ions in wide range of charge to mass ratio. As a result of modernization, injector structure will be supplemented by the second two-gap resonator, rf voltage will be increased to 3x4 MV and accelerated beam structure has to be improved by increasing accelerating frequency to 5 MHz. Design features of upgraded linac and peculiarity of beam dynamics for different types of ions are presented.

A small ISAC booster 3-gap structure at 11.78 MHz located in upstream of RFQ has been designed and installed for energy matching to RFQ. A sliding mode extremum seeking control for LLRF control was developed and implemented in operation. Six of DTL systems have been working in the control mode. Two of them had been commissioning and in operation one and half year reliably. RFQ, two more DTL system, HEBT rebuncher and DSB buncher system will be upgraded in the sliding mode control soon. Twenty ISAC-II SBC superconducting cavity RF power amplifiers were upgraded from YV-229 triode tube amplifier into solid state amplifier(SSA). The prototype and four SSAs have been commissioned in 2017 and in operation successfully. The rest of 16 SSA have been tested in RF lab and installed for operation at the mid of this year.

A window-type RFQ is designed and fabricated by Peking University. It is planed to accelerate 50mA deuteron cw beam to 1MeV. The 60kV intervane voltage is designed to decrease the risk of high voltage discharge since the RFQ works in cw mode. High power test shows that the intervane voltage is over 60kV when the Cavity power consumption is 48kW. The beam experiment was done and 1.8mA cw beam was obtained at exit of RFQ with over 90% transmission efficiency. This paper will present the cold model measurement, high power RF conditioning and beam experiment result.

An Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) is being developed at CERN for production of highly charged ions, for instance fully stripped 12C. The focus has so far been on the electron gun design, aiming for a high current compression, which results in a rapid ionisation process and thereby high repetition rate. Initial commissioning tests of such an electron gun, the so-called MEDeGUN, have already been performed and we are now in the process of designing a multi-purpose ion extraction and diagnostics line. The Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) line will transport the ions into the downstream Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) with a nominal energy of 15 keV/u. The 750 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate ions from 15 keV/u up to the final energy of 2.5 MeV/u. After the RFQ design was finalized and its acceptance calculated, the beam matching to the RFQ was studied, finding a set of parameters for the LEBT that maximize the transmission through the RFQ. Details of the RFQ design, of the LEBT matching procedure and its final results are illustrated in this paper.

Within the upgrade scheme of the injection complex of the NICA project and after a successful beam commissioning of a heavy ion linac, Bevatech GmbH will build a first part of a new light ion linac as an injector for the Nuclotron ring. The linac will provide a beam of polarised protons and light ions with a mass to charge ratio up to 3 and an energy of 7 MeV/u. The mandate of the Linac does not only include the hardware for the accelerating structures, focusing magnets and beam diagnostic devices, but also the LLRF control soft- and hardware based on the MicroTCA.4 standard in collaboration with the MicroTCA Technology Lab at DESY. An overview of the Linac is presented in this paper.

SPIRAL 2 (Caen, France) is a state of the art superconducting linear accelerator composed of 26 quarter wave accelerating cavities. Each cavity is plunged in a liquid helium bath at 4.4 K itself surrounded by a thermal shield at 70 K. In this paper, a dynamic model of the cryogenic systemof the LINAC is proposed. Thismodel simulates the dynamic behaviour of the 19 cryomodules and their respective valves box connected through the cryodistribution. Model accuracy is evaluated through a comparison between simulation and experimental data. Using the model we should be able to predict the behaviour of the cryogenic system for different beam operating conditions of the accelerator. The model also highlights the link between the cryogenic system and the cavity RF losses through a dynamic estimator of those RF losses in the cavity walls. The latter could be used as a rough estimator of the quality factor of a cavity.

The fabrication tolerances of RF components are essential for CLIC X-band accelerating structures to perform efficiently. On one hand, the capability of high power accelerating structures depends on the shape accuracy and the asperity of the inner surfaces, when microwaves pass through the cavity. On the other hand, surface flatness and dimensional tolerances are necessary to guarantee a correct assembly process. Hence, the discs that build up the structure require sub-micrometre specifications and, in order to meet all the needs, ultra-precision machining using single crystal diamond tools is mandatory. This paper shows the analysis of the metrology results of the fabrication of 118 discs (4 accelerating structures). Dimensional and form tolerances are studied following the production order to find drifts in the production and to predict the impact on the assembly process. Finally, process capability is evaluated.

The CLIC structures are designed for operating at X-Band, 2π/3 traveling wave mode with a loaded 100 MV/m gradient. Mechanical tolerances, at the submicron level, are required to satisfy the RF design constraints and beam dynamics and are reachable using ultra-precision diamond machining. However, inherent to the manufacturing process, there is a deviation from the nominal specifications and as a result; incorrect cavity dimensions produce a less efficient linac. Moreover, the assembly process increase the difference from the original geometry. As part of a cost and manufacturability optimization of the structures for mass production, this study aims to identify a correlation between frequency deviations and geometrical errors of the individual discs of the accelerating structures caused by the production process. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the most critical parameters. Cell frequency deviations have been monitored by bead pull measurements before and after bonding. Several accelerating structure prototypes have been tested to determine our assumptions and to assess if the assembly process preserves the tight tolerances achieved by machining.

Series Production of the Specific Waveguide Distribution for the European XFEL at DESY B.Yildirim, S.Choroba, V.Katalev, P.Morozov, Y.Nachtigal, E.Apostolov The European XFEL uses 100 accelerating cryomodules. One RF station with 10 MW klystron supplies four cryomodules, each with eight cavities, through a waveguide distribution system. The RF station operates at 1.3 GHz, 1.37 ms pulse width and 10 Hz repetition rate. The results of the cryomodule test have shown however different maximum gradients for each cavity. The maximum gradient has been measured between 11 MV/m and 31 MV/m, which requires the cavity power from 29 kW to 230 kW. To operate with the maximum energy for every cryomodule, it is necessary to supply individual power to the cavity. In this case the weakest cavity problem can be avoided. For this goal a specific waveguide distribution has been developed. 100 waveguide distributions have been successfully tailored, produced and tested at the Waveguide Assembly Test Facility (WATF) at DESY and finally assembled to the cryomodules. We present the series production of the specific waveguide distributions at the WATF.

For the European XFEL 102 accelerating modules were built and tested. Several accelerating modules had to be reworked due to different kinds of non-conformities. The extent of this rework varied greatly. At the end of production four accelerating modules could not be qualified in time before the tunnel installation was to be finished in September 2016. Meanwhile the cavity strings of two of these accelerating modules have been disassembled in the DESY clean room. The cavities have been retreated at DESY either by additional high pressure water rinsing or BCP flash chemical treatment. All cavities were vertically tested and 15 out of 16 were qualified for the reassembly of the cavity strings. One accelerating module will be reassembled completely and tested until the end of 2018; the other will follow in the first half of 2019. We report on retreatment procedures and performance of these cavities.

To investigate the feasibility of the continuous wave (cw) upgrade of the European XFEL (E-XFEL) DESY, on-going tests are performed on E-XFEL prototype and production cryomodules since 2011. For these studies, DESY’s Cryo-Module Test Bench (CMTB) has been equipped with a 105 kW cw operating IOT in addition to the 10MW pulsed klystron, making CMTB a very flexible test stand, enabling both cw and pulse operation. For these tests, E-XFEL-like LLRF electronics is used to stabilize amplitude and phase of the voltage Vector Sum (VS) of all 8 cavities of the cryomodule under test. The cryomodule most often tested is the pre-series XM-3, unique since it is housing one fine grain niobium and seven large grain niobium cavities. In autumn 2017, additional spacers were installed on all 8 input couplers to increase the maximum reachable loaded quality factor Ql beyond 2·107. With higher Ql, up to 6·107 for 6 cavities and 2.7·107 for 2 cavities, we have investigated the VS stability and SRF-performance of this cryomodule under various conditions of cooling down rate and operation temperature 1.65K, 1.8K and 2K, at gradients up to ca. 18MV/m. The results of these tests are presented in this paper.

In recent years, it has been pointed out that the maximum accelerating gradient of a superconducting RF cavity can be pushed up by coating the inner surface of the cavity with a multilayer thin-film structure that consists of alternating insulating and superconducting layers. In this structure, the principal parameter that limits the performance of the cavity is the critical magnetic field or effective Hc1 at which vortices start penetrating into the superconductor layer, and it is predicted to depend on the combination of the film thickness. We made samples that have NbN/SiO2 thin-film structure on pure Nb substrate with several thicknesses of NbN film deposited using DC magnetron sputtering method. Here, we report the measurement results of effective Hc1 of the NbN sample with a thickness of 200 nm by using the third-harmonic voltage method. In addition, we report the preliminary results to evaluate the dependence of the effective Hc1 on the thickness of the NbN film in the range 50 nm-200 nm.

The Center for Accelerator Science at Old Dominion University has built a half-wave coaxial cavity (*) to measure the surface resistance of niobium as a function of frequency, temperature, rf field, preparation techniques, over a wide range of frequencies of interest for particle accelerators. The characteristics of the half-wave coaxial cavity provide these information on a same surface. The preliminary results showed clearly the frequency dependence of residual surface resistance (**). After establishing baseline, we have conducted a study of low temperature baking effect on the surface resistance under controlled environment. This paper will describe the details of the test procedure, results and we will explore underlying physics of the phenomenon.

Superconducting cavities with two beam pipes had been proposed in the past for energy recovery linac applications. The relatively complex geometry of those cavities presented a serious challenge for fabrication and surface processing. Main concerns have now been overcome with the production and successful RF testing of a new elliptical twin-axis cavity proposed by Jefferson Lab and optimized by the Center for Accelerator Science at Old Dominion University in the frame of a DoE accelerator stewardship program. The cavity design provides uniform accelerating or decelerating fields for both beams. This paper describes the cavity design, fabrication experience, and the first cold RF test results and explores potential applications especially for Jefferson Lab s EIC (JLEIC).

The rf-dipole crabbing cavity planned for the LHC High Luminosity Upgrade is designed to deliver a transverse kick of 3.34 MV; crabbing the proton beam in the horizontal plane. The proton beams of the LHC machine operating at 7 TeV each sets high impedance thresholds on the crabbing cavity systems. The rf-dipole crabbing cavity is designed with a two higher order mode couplers to suppress those HOMs. The first prototype of the HOM couplers are fabricated at Jefferson Lab. This paper reports the cryogenic test results of the HOM couplers with the SPS prototype rf-dipole cavity.

Cryogenic tests of superconducting cavities yield an average surface resistance as a function of the peak surface magnetic field. An analytical formalism has been developed to extract the actual field dependence of the surface resistance from cavity tests and is applied to coaxial cavities and cavities of more complex geometries.

Field emission occurred in SRF cavity is the major limitation to operate at high gradient with stability. The plasma in-situ cleaning for the low beta HWR cavity was carried out to remove the hydrocarbons contaminants on the inner cavity surface. And the vertical test results indicated that the field emission effect was relieved with the increasing of the quench point and emission set-on point. Thus, oxygen active plasma processing can be an effective method to solve the field emission issues for the low beta HWR cavity.

Nucleation process is an important step that affects the quality of Nb3Sn films coated by vapor diffusion method. A uniform distribution of nucleation centers is essential to the uniformity of Nb3Sn films. In this paper we report several experimental phenomena on the Sn nucleation on Nb surface. Better nucleation in the downstream of the pumping direction was observed. Influence of SnCl2 partial pressure inhomogeneity was studied. Samples with higher SnCl2 partial pressure have denser nucleation, which means homogeneous SnCl2 pressure is a critical factor to the uniform nucleation. Less-nuclear zones, mainly distributed at cracks, grain boundaries and even some whole grain surfaces, were found on the surfaces of all samples. The less-nuclear zones may result in the low tin regions of the Nb3Sn cavities. The specific solution to the less-nuclear problem was proposed. These studies help to better understanding of the mechanism underlying the nucleation process and will be useful foundation for the follow-up Nb3Sn/Nb project at IMP.

A balloon variant of the single spoke resonator (SSR) has been designed, fabricated and tested. The cavity is the SSR1 prototype for the Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) in Korea. It is specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of multipacting barriers near the operating point. A systematic multipacting study leads to a novel geometry, a spherical cavity with re-entrant irises and a spoke. Other than eliminating multipacting around operational gradient, the balloon shape also provides competitive RF parameters and robust mechanical structure. Cryostat cold tests demonstrated cavity performance on each design aspect. The cold tests will be reported in this paper.

A significant issue in low beta resonators is medium field Q-slope (MFQS) at 4K. To study the MFQS and the field dependence of surface resistance in low beta resonators, a quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and a half-wave resonator (HWR) were designed to be tested at integer harmonic frequencies of 200MHz, and up to 1.2GHz. A series of chemistry and heat treatments are proposed to these cavities. A systemic study on the surface resistance of the coaxial resonators associating with post-processing, RF field, and frequency is in progress. The cavities were designed and fabricated. The cold test results will be discussed in this paper.

Bulk Niobium (Nb) SRF (superconducting radio frequency) cavities are currently the preferred method for acceleration of charged particles at accelerator facilities around the world. Since the SRF phenomena occurs within a shallow depth of 40 nm (for Nb), a proposed option has been to deposit a superconducting Nb thin film on the interior of a cavity made of a suitable alternative material such as copper or aluminum. While this approach has been attempted in the past using DC magnetron sputtering (DCMS), such cavities have never performed at the bulk Nb level. However, new energetic condensation techniques for film deposition offer the opportunity to create suitably thick Nb films with improved density, microstructure and adhesion compared to traditional DCMS. One such technique that has been developed somewhat recently is ’High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering’ (HiPIMS). Here we report early results from various thin film coatings carried out on 1.3 GHz Cu Cavities, a 1.5 GHz Nb cavity and small Cu coupon samples coated at Jefferson Lab using HiPIMS.

Jefferson Lab has implemented a bipolar pulsed electropolishing system for final chemical processing of niobium SRF cavities. This FARADAYIC bi-polar electropolishing (BPEP) has been applied to single cells, a 7-cell CEBAF C100 cavity, and to 9-cell TESLA-style cavities.* As a mechanistic characterization of the process emerges, the critical role played by the local current density during each cathodic pulse is becoming clear. This influences system and operational parameter refinement. We present current process parameters, removal characterization, and rf performance of the processed cavities. This is the fruit of collaborative work between Jefferson Lab and Faraday Technology, Inc. directed toward the routine commercialization and industrialization of niobium cavity processing. We also present supporting data from controlled-parameter coupon studies

Optimization of the dual axis asymmetric cavity was performed to minimize the ratio of the peak magnetic and electric fields values to the accelerating voltage, to increase the distance between operating and neighbouring modes as well as to reduce the manufacturing cost of the cavity. To reach the goals several solutions have been suggested bringing the ratios to the acceptable values and leading to simplification of the manufacturing of the structure.

The recent studies of laser annealing on niobium films on copper are reported. Annealing is normally used to deal with the surface, reducing defects and even chang-ing the microstructure of the coating film. Short pulse laser can produce a sharp step temperature field on the film thickness scale (μm), which anneals the surface without substrate heated. The laser annealing experi-ments of niobium thin film sample have been carried out, and according to SEM and FIB results, Nb films melted and recrystallization occurred. Grains growing up can be observed while the power density of laser pulse in-creased.

Although S-I-S (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) multilayered structure is expected to increase the maximum acceleration gradient of SRF cavities, in order for it to function in reality, it is necessary to develop a coating processing that can realize high purity and quality superconducting thin-films. We launched the co-sputtering system to create superconducting alloy thin-films such as Nb3Sn and to research how the characteristics of them change depending on the coating conditions. The deposition rate of two elements was optimized by adjusting each input power, so we successfully obtained an alloy thin-film having appropriate composition ratio. In addition, we developed another experimental equipment for coating on the inner surface of the 3GHz TESLA type small cavities. A cylindrical shape Nb in which some permanent magnets are inserted was adopted as the sputtering target. Glow discharge of the target was confirmed, and the inner-sputtering test was conducted. This presentation reports the specifications of the two sputtering apparatuses and the results of the coating test.

A single spoke resonator (SSR, β = 0.51 and f = 325 MHz) is being developed at Korea University. It is well-known that a traditional spoke cavity having flat or round end walls has broad multipacting ranges in acceleration gradient, sometimes including operation region. In general, quite long conditioning time is consumed to overcome such multipacting barriers. In this study, we introduce a balloon-shaped SSR superconducting cavity for the multipacting mitigation due to structural simplicity. The electromagnetic modeling of the SSR was made based on the RF parameter optimization. The simulation results show much narrower multipacting bandwidth, compared to those for the traditional spoke cavity. Mechanical analyses with stiffening structure at maximum allowable working pressures indicate acceptable stresses at the SSR cavity wall. In addition, the resonant frequency shifts due to fabrication and processing for cold tests are predicted and power coupling and tuning mechanism are also investigated.

We present design studies of a prototype RF input power coupler, which provides RF powers to 325MHz cavities up to 18.5 kW in CW mode. The prototype power coupler is a coaxial capacitive type with single ceramic window. In order to optimize the RF coupler design, we performed multi-physics simulations, including electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical analyses.

The accelerating gradient of the Nb superconducting RF cavity seems to reach the limit due to the RF critical magnetic field of the Nb material. To obtain more higher gradient, there has been proposed a method of increasing an RF critical magnetic field of the cavity inner surface by coating of multi-layer thin-film superconductor. It is needed to demonstrate improvement RF critical magnetic field of the RF cavity coated with multi-layer thin-film superconductor. To optimize thin-film superconductor, sample tests are required. A cavity for sample test is necessary to produce a strong RF magnetic field parallel to the surface of the sample for evaluating RF critical magnetic field. For such a cavity, we designed a mushroom shaped cavity made of Nb which is operated in cryogenic temperature. Input and pick up antenna coupler are also designed electrically and mechanically. The connection design of sample plate and cavity bottom plate in superconducting state is also designed. The Nb mushroom shaped cavity is under fabrication. Fabrication method and status are reported in this paper.

As the demand for more powerful, more efficient, and smaller superconducting RF accelerators continues to increase, both impurity doping and high-frequency cavities (> 1.3 GHz) have become hot topics for fundamental research because of their potential to significantly decrease surface losses and cost respectively. In this report, we present recent experimental and theoretical results on undoped and nitrogen-doped high-frequency cavities and on alternative doping agents in traditional 1.3 GHz cavities, with a focus on understanding the fundamental science of impurity doping.

Niobium-3 Tin (Nb3Sn) is a very promising alternative material for SRF accelerator cavities. The material can achieve higher quality factors, higher temperature operation and potentially higher accelerating gradients (~ 96 MV/m) compared to conventional niobium. This material is formed by vaporizing Sn in a high temperature vacuum furnace and letting the Sn absorb into a Nb substrate to form a 2-3 um Nb3Sn layer. Current Nb3Sn cavities produced at Cornell achieve Q ~ 1010 at 4.2 K and 17 MV/m. Here we present a summary of the current performance of Nb3Sn cavities at Cornell and recent progress in improving the accelerating gradient.

Low-temperature infusion has become a hot-topic in SRF researches recently. Past results show that low-temperature infusion can produce high quality factor at medium accelerating fields. Also, 75°C baking recently has been shown to improve accelerating gradients of SRF cavities. Hence these treatments are very promising for reducing cost of the ILC. In this work, we present latest results of low temperature infusion and baking, showing that these treatments can improve SRF cavities performance.

The quality factor of the nitrogen-doped SRF cavities for the LCLS-II project are strongly impacted by cool down speed. A sufficiently fast cool down speed can produce large thermal gradient across a cavity and sufficiently expel magnetic flux when the cavity wall passes from the normal-conducting to the superconducting state. However, instrumentation in LCLS-II production cryomodules has been kept at a minimum, and additional information during the cool down of the modules is therefore desirable. In this work, we study if and how RF data can be used during cavity cool-down to determine the transition speeds of the individual cavities in the LCLS-II linac.

Acid free electropolishing would be safer to use and friendlier to the environment. A collaboration, sup-ported by the DOE SBIR Phase-II program, between Faraday Technology Inc. and Cornell University focused on salt-based bipolar electropolishing (BEP). In this paper, we present the latest salt-based BEP results. The superconducting performance of a single-cell 1.3GHz cavity has been carefully analyzed, showing that salt-based BEP is promising, but still has large room for improvement.

CEPC will use 650 MHz cavities for the collider and 1.3 GHz cavities for the Booster. Each booster cryomod-ule contains eight 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavities, which is simi-lar as LCLS-II, E-XFEL and ILC. Each collider cryo-module contains six 650 MHz 2-cell cavities, which is totally new. Therefore, the pre-study mainly focuses on the 650 MHz 2-cell cavity. N-doping and vertical tests of 650 MHz 1-cell and 2-cell cavities have been carried out at IHEP, which have achieved good results. A test cryomodule, which consists of two 650 MHz 2-cell cavities, has also begun as the first step to the full-scale cryomodule.

Nitrogen doping experiments in single-cell and 3-cell niobium cavities were carried out at KEK. After annealing at 800 deg C for 3 hours, pure nitrogen gas with a pressure of 3 Pa for 20 minutes and 3 minutes were introduced for doping in a furnace in J-PARC, respectively. Removing surface in 5 um and 20 um by electropolishing were performed prior to the vertical tests, respectively. Increases of a quality factor at 2K and reduction of the BCS resistance with respect to an accelerating gradient were observed in both cavities.

Superconducting thin film is the promising technology to increase the performance of SRF cavities. The lower critical field Hc1, which is one of the important physical parameters characterizing a superconducting material, will be enhanced by coating Nb with thin film superconductor such as NbN. To investigate the Hc1, we developed the Hc1 measurement system using the third harmonic response of applied AC magnetic field. The measurement system consists of helium cryostat with two of GM refrigerators, sample Cu stage, solenoid coil Cu mount, solenoid coil, temperature sensors, and liquid helium level meter. AC magnetic field is produced by a coil which is driven by function generator and power amplifier at around 1 kHz. In order to control the temperature of the sample, we installed heaters and thermal anchors which could be moved by the motor. By this temperature control the sample state can be easily transferred from Meissner state to mixed state. So that the measurement is repeated for various applied magnetic field, and the transition curve can be made. In this report, measurement result of the bulk Nb sample and NbN-SiO2 multilayer thin film sample will be discussed.

Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing niobium 9-cell cavity vertical electropolishing (VEP) technologies with Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. Conventional 9-cell cavity VEP had a serious problem, which was asymmetry of removal thickness distribution. Usually removal thickness of upper side became larger than lower side in case of both in-cell and inter-cell. So far, as one solution, we proposed bubble diffusion prevention method and proved it was effective for uniform removal. This time, as other new solution, we tried cavity flip upside down and Ninja cathode masking VEP methods. In this article we will report the purpose, intention and VEP experiment result of these methods.

Vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique have been successfully developed for 1.3 GHz niobium (Nb) single cell cavity to achieve a smooth surface with uniform removal and better RF performance as achieved after horizontal EP (HEP) process. VEP parameters for 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavities are being studied using a nine-cell coupon cavity and our unique Ninja cathode. The investigated VEP parameters heretofore were applied on a 1.3 GHz Tesla shape nine-cell superconducting RF cavity for bulk removal of 100 µm followed by fine removal of 20 and 10 µm. The interior surface was found to be smooth and shiny after the VEP process. Our recently developed dual flow technique, in which the EP acid is flown separately in the Ninja cathode housing and cavity, yielded lower asymmetry in removal along the cavity length. The cavity was tested in a vertical cryostat after the final VEP process. The cavity achieved 28.3 MV/m at Q0 value of 6.7x109. The cavity performance was almost the same as in the baseline vertical test performed after the HEP process.

Recently new techniques such as Nitrogen-doping and Nitrogen-infusion have been developed to improve performance of SRF (Superconducting RF) cavities. We purchased a new vacuum furnace, which is key to realize these techniques. Cleanness of the furnace is most important issue. The furnace has a cryo-pump and whole of vacuum system is oil-free system. Target vacuum level after cooling down is 1x10-6 Pa. Heater, reflectors and support table were made from Molybdenum to avoid contamination during heat treatment. Metal gaskets are used for all vacuum seals, except big doors. Maximum operation temperature is 1150 degree C. Size is around 1 m diameter and 2m long for a 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavity. Entrance of furnace is covered by a clean booth. The furnace was fabricated, assembled at KEK COI building and commissioned this year. After several burning runs, target vacuum pressure was achieved after cooling down to room temperature. Design of the furnace and performance during commissioning runs are presented.

Nitrogen infusion (N-infusion) is new surface treatment technique for niobium SRF (Superconducting RF) cavities. After cooling down from 800 degree C heat treatment, a vacuum furnace and cavities are kept 120 degree C, 48 hours with about 3 Pa Nitrogen. Improvement of Q-value and accelerating gradient is expected. We used J-PARC furnace, since N-infusion procedure requires clean vacuum furnace. It has a cryo-pump and turbo molecular pumps and its vacuum system is oil-free system. Six times of N-infusion tests were carried out, while changing vacuum condition, N-infusion temperature, Nitrogen pressure, niobium material and so on. Niobium caps were mounted on cavities to avoid contaminations on inner surfaces. Some of trials were successful and vertical test results showed improvement of Q-values and accelerating gradient. However, some of them were not. Most of bad cases showed degradation of Q-values above 5 MV/m. Details of heat treatment procedure including N-infusion and vertical test results are shown in this presentation.

The nitrogen infusion is the new surface treatment technique for improving the RF loss and the maximum accelerating gradient of superconducting cavity. In this process, it is important to be carried out continuously both the 800 C annealing in vacuum and 120 C nitrogen infusion without exposure to the atmosphere. The annealing serves activation process by removing the oxide layer. The in-situ nitrogen infusion system was prepared to investigate whether nitrogen infusion effect or something changes happen in the case of applying nitrogen infusion technique without removing the oxide layer. It can only introduce nitrogen into a cavity during 120 C low temperature baking and transport a cavity to the vertical test system without exposure to the atmosphere. We tried to infuse nitrogen to a single cell by keeping 120 C and 48 hours with 3 Pa nitrogen. The cavity was annealed in another furnace and applied high pressure rinsing before nitrogen infusion. The vertical test result was same Q as the normal 120 C baking without nitrogen. It suggests that oxide layer prevents infusion of nitrogen. In this poster, the in-situ nitrogen infusion system and vertical test results will be reported.

KEK has been investigating the better conditions of the heat treatment in nitrogen, which are called as nitrogen doping and nitrogen infusion. We have tried to understand the high gradient performance of the cavity from the analyses of samples which were prepared in the same conditions for the cavity. The main tools are D-SIMS for the depth profile of the elemental concentration, XPS for composition analysis and SQUID magnetometry for the critical DC magnetic field measurement. The difference in the depth profiles of the nitrogen, carbon and oxygen between the heat treatment conditions was observed in vacuum and furnace temperature of nitrogen infusion by D-SIMS and XPS. Such a difference correlates with the vortex penetration field measured by SQUID. In particular, that of nitrogen doping sample was greatly degraded, while that of nitrogen infusion sample was slightly improved. The tendency is similar to the RF high gradient test results. Details of the sample analysis are shown in this presentation.

Superconducting RF gun can realize high acceleration voltage and high beam repetition. KEK has been developing the 1.3 GHz elliptical type 1.5 cell superconducting RF gun to investigate fundamental performance. A surface cleaning method and tools are developed by using KEK SRFGUN #1 and high surface peak gradient 75 MV/m was achieved without field emission. SRFGUN #2 which equips the helium jacket and can be operated with electron beam was designed based on the SRFGUN #1. It can be operated with transmit type photocathode which include superconducting transparent material. The cathode plug is cooled by thermal conducting from the 2 K helium jacket and photocathode will be kept around 2K to maintain superconductivity. Bulk niobium photocathode plug and substrate will used for the fundamental performance test. In parallel, the photocathode deposition chamber for multi-alkali photocathode will be prepared.

A novel electro-chemical technique to produce Nb3Sn films on Nb substrates was developed and optimized at Fermilab. The Nb3Sn phase is obtained in a two-electrode cell, by electrodeposition from aqueous solutions of Sn layers and Cu intermediate layers onto Nb substrates. Subsequent thermal treatments in inert atmosphere are realized at a maximum temperature of 700°C to obtain the Nb3Sn superconducting phase. Several superconduct-ing Nb3Sn films were obtained on Nb substrates by study-ing and optimizing most parameters of the electro-plating process. Samples were characterized at Fermilab, NIMS, KEK and JLAB, including EPMA analyses, DC and in-ductive tests of critical temperature Tc0, and lower critical field Hc1(4.2 K) by SQUID. In parallel to sample devel-opment and fabrication at FNAL, at JLAB and KEK effort was put into etching and electro-polishing techniques adequate to remove the Cu and bronze phases from the samples’ outer surface. This is necessary prior to meas-urements at JLAB of the surface impedance of flat sam-ples in a setup that make use of an RF host cavity.

In 1926, H. Busch formulated a theorem for one single charged particle moving along a region with longitudinal magnetic field. The theorem relates particle angular momentum to the amount of field lines being enclosed by the particle cyclotron motion. Recently it has been extended to accelerated particle beams [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 21 014201 (2018)]. This contribution sketches this extension and applies the extended theorem to successfully performed emittance manipulations with electron and ion beams.

Negative hydrogen ion (H−) beam dynamics in J-PARC Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) has been investigated by numerical modeling which calculates particle transport with effect of space charge and collision processes. Understandings of H− beam transport in LEBT is important for high transmission rate from Ion Source (IS) to Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) in J-PARC in higher beam current in future. In 2017, 45 mA beam current of H− has been extracted from IS in J-PARC user operation which has been increased from 30 mA in last 2 years. The beam current is planned to be increased to 50 mA in the next upgrade. As the beam current increase, IS/LEBT commissioning becomes more difficult because of the higher space charge (SC). Especially in J-PARC, vacuum pressure is around 10-5 Pa by 15 mmf orifice located in the center of LEBT. The orifice prevents residual gas injection from IS to LEBT/RFQ and thus produces stronger SC effect. In the presentation, numerical results are compared with actual results from J-PARC Linac beam commissioning. A comparison of the results shows that location of the 15 mmf orifice results in two peaks of RFQ transmission rate against SOL currents.

After the successful measurements with a 0.8 m prototype a 3.3 m Ladder-RFQ is under construction at IAP, Goethe University Frankfurt. It is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the p-Linac at FAIR. Along the acceleration section modulation parameter, aperture and synchronous phase all course (quasi-)linear, which differentiates this design approach from other designs developed at IAP. The ratio of transversal vane curvature radius to mid-cell radial aperture as well as the vane radius itself are constant, which favors a flat voltage distribution along the RFQ. This was verified by implantation of the modulated vane geometry into MWS-CST RF field simulations. The development of adequate beam dynamics was done in close collaboration with the IAP resonator design team. The Los Alamos RFQGen-code was used for the RFQ design and the beam dynamics simulations.

For future experiments with heavy ions near the coulomb barrier within the super-heavy element (SHE) research project a multi-stage R&D program of GSI/HIM and IAP is currently in progress. It aims for developing a supercon-ducting (sc) continuous wave (CW) LINAC with multiple CH cavities as key components downstream the High Charge State Injector (HLI) at GSI. The LINAC design is challenging due to the requirement of intense beams in CW mode up to a mass-to-charge ratio of 6, while covering a broad output energy range from 3.5 to 7.3 MeV/u with unchanged minimum energy spread. Testing of the first CH-cavity in 2016 demonstrated a promising maximum accelerating gradient of Ea = 9.6 MV/m; the worldwide first beam test with this sc multi-gap CH-cavity in 2017 was a milestone in the R&D work of GSI/HIM and IAP. In the light of experience gained in this research so far, the beam dynamics layout for the entire LINAC has recently been updated and optimized.

The Gamma Beam System at the ELI-NP (Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics) currently being constructed in Magurele/Bucharest, Romania will be a high-brilliance advanced source of gamma rays based on laser Compton back-scattering. For a successful operation of the GBS a high brightness low emittance electron beam is of crucial importance. The warm RF linac is designed in two stages - one with the beam up to 300 MeV, and another one about 720 MeV. The S-band photo-injector is combined with a C-band linac. The beam is transported by transfer lines to the interaction points. In this paper we report the results of computer simulations of the electron beam transport in the low energy linac and transfer line up to the low energy interaction point (IP1). The simulation model makes it possible to predict the beam parameters to be recuperated in case of failure of any magnetic or accelerating elements as well as it enables to determine the optimal parameters of replaced components. It will be used for the development of the Gamma Beam System in the future.

PAL-XFEL is a hard x-ray (HX) and soft x-ray (SX) FEL machine to generate 2.5 - 15 keV FEL in the HX line and 0.28 - 1.2 keV FEL in the SX line. The HX line consists of an e-gun, a laser heater, S-band accelerators, an X-band linearizer, three bunch compressors (BC), and a dog-leg line. PAL-XFEL maintains the stable operation and FEL delivery with more than 98% availability due to machine stabilities including RF modules. In order to investigate the stable operation, we measure the diagnostics response for bunch charge monitors, energy beam position monitors, bunch length monitors, and a FEL intensity with a photon beam position monitor by RF parameters - RF amplitude and phase for an e-gun, accelerators, and a linearizer. In this paper, we present mainly corresponding RF parameters for e-beam and FEL jitters by this measurement and matrix analysis.

High-power klystrons for particle accelerators employ high-perveance electron guns which are usually focused by Solenoid magnets. The electron beam should be optically matched to the downstream magnetic field to prevent the beam from scalloping. The task usually requires a series of computer simulations with many design parameters, and therefore requires extensive(sometimes exhaustive) efforts if not aided by a priori experiences. In order to alleviate the difficulties we have developed a matching procedure which is systematic and reliable. In this article we describe the procedure with an example design of a 400-kV 500-A electron beam with radius 8 - 11 mm.

This analyze argue that BBU instability both in separate cavities and in Linacs or ERLs is going due to the consequence of fundamental property of dipole modes. ’Head-tail’ bunch instability has also the same nature. New BBU instability testing methods are described and analytically proved in the article.

The Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) will be an electron accelerator allowing operation in energy-recovery linac (ERL) mode, where beam energy is recovered by decelerating the beam in linac cryomodules and transferring kinetic energy to the RF. The ERL mode provides the opportunity to operate experiments at peak energy with thin targets, combining high luminosities typical for storage rings and high beam brightness typical for linacs. The MESA Internal Gas Target Experiment (MAGIX) aims to operate jet targets at high luminosities with different gases up to Xenon. As scattering effects in the beam rise with the atomic number, investigations on the impact of the target on beam dynamics and beam losses are required for machine safety. The goal of this work is to understand target induced halo, track halo particles through downstream sections and protect the machine with a suitable collimation system and shielding from direct and indirect damage through beam losses and radiation. The present status of the investigations is presented.

Excitation of millimeter wavelength cavity structure In this work excitation of W-band structure is studied. The structure consists of cylindrical cavities with the operating frequency of about 96 GHz. We plan to excite the structure by short bunches from the photocathode RF gun. In order to choose structure geometry and beam duration, we performed estimations and simulations; induced voltage was also estimated. Taking into account feasible parameters of the photocathode RF gun such as beam size and emittance, we studied exciting beam transverse dynamics to define its other characteristics (energy and charge). To lead the beam from the whole structure, focusing is needed. After estimation of required magnetic field, we considered possibility of focusing with help of permanent magnets.

The three-electrode electron gun and C-band accelerating structure are optimised to produce a therapeutic electron beam with an energy of 6 MeV and a dose rate of 10 Gy/min and a beam with an energy of 2.5 MeV to obtain a portal image. The beam size at the bremsstrahlung target in both modes does not exceed 2 mm. The total length of the accelerating system with the electron gun does not exceed 330 mm. The accelerating structure is fed by RF power from a multibeam klystron at a frequency of 5,712 MHz with a maximum pulsed power of 3.5 MW.

Transverse slice emittance is one of the most important properties of high-brightness electron beams for freeelectron lasers (FELs). The photo injector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) develops high-brightness electron sources for modern FELs. With a 23 MeV, 1 nC beam at PITZ the experimental slice emittance characterization with the quadrupole scan technique is complicated by strong space charge effects. Combining the slit scan technique with a transverse deflecting cavity (TDS) allows for timeresolved emittance measurements of such a space-chargedominated beam. The first proof-of-principle results of slice emittance measurements at PITZ based on the ’TDS + slit scan’-technique are presented in this paper.

The Hybrid single cavity(HSC), which is designed for 20 mA beam acceleration, is a new HSC Type Injector for Cancer Therapy. Its designed particle, resonant frequency, injection and final energies are designed from beam-optics considerations of the entire system to be C6+, 100MHz, 20keV/u and 0.6MeV/u. In order to achieve these requirements, keeping the Maximum surface electric field to less than 1.9-times the Kilpatrick limit, the RFQ becomes about 1.2 m long and the DTL is about 2.5 m long. The total efficiency of transmission is more than 80%.

It is difficult to measure beam profiles and monitor the beam during beam supply for high intensity high power accelerators. Based on the button pick-ups, the mathematical principle of a rotating BPM is proposed. SVD method is used to reconstruct the beam in x-y real space, and the basic parameters used in beam reconstruction are argued. The beam distribution in x-y real space is reconstructed well and compared to the reference beam. The beam reconstruction is sensitive to the electrode radius. The meshing and the grid numbers in the solution window have an import effect on the beam reconstruction.

In the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research a Test Stand with an electron beam generated by the linear accelerator LINAC-200 with the energy up to 200 MeV is being constructed to investigate properties of accelerating and semiconducting structures for advanced detectors, a radiation resistance of detectors based on gallium arsenide semiconductor, to study a free electron laser and to do other applied for work. The technical characteristics of the LINAC-200 accelerator make it possible to create an advanced system of test beams for scientific and methodological studies of detectors on its basis. Four accelerating stations with maximum beam energy up to 200 MeV are put into operation. The work is being carried out for experiments with electron test beams with energy up to 800 MeV. This work presents the calculation results of the magnetic field of the focusing solenoidal system and electron beam dynamics in accelerating stations. In addition, the results on the formation of the electron beam with optimal parameters to be captured in further accelerating sections.

As conventional RF accelerating schemes approach the physical limit of accelerating gradient, the accelerator community is increasingly looking at novel accelerating techniques to overcome these limitations. Moving from the RF to the THz frequency range, higher acceleration gradients of high energy beams can be achieved in compact structures. Beam dynamics studies are crucial as part of the design of novel accelerating structures to maximise the output beam current as well as the accelerating gradient. In this paper we present beam dynamics simulations through dielectric lined waveguide structures using novel techniques to simulate broadband signals for particle tracking studies in RF-Track. The beam parameters through the structure are optimised and we study the dynamics of general broadband accelerating structures.

The China Spallation Neutron Source(CSNS) accelera-tor systems is designed to deliver a 1.6GeV, 100kW pro-ton beam to a solid metal target for neutron scattering research. It consists of a 50keV H− Ion Source, a 3MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), an 80MeV Drift Tube Linac (DTL), and a 1.6GeV Rapid-cycling Synchro-tron (RCS). The DTL consists of four tanks. In 2017, three of four tanks have been commissioned successfully, and beam has been accelerated to 61MeV with nearly 100% transmission. However, in July 2017, one quadrupole contained in the drift tube was found fault, the beam transmission decreased to 80%. A new lattice has been designed and the 100% transmission has recovered. In January 2018, the last tank of the DTL has been commissioned and accelerated the H− beam to the design energy of 80MeV for the first time. The commissioning progress and the measurement results before and after lattice adjustment will be presented.

The research concerns ion dynamics in linear accelerators with drift tubes (DTL). Permanent quadrupole magnets are placed inside some of the drift tubes. Frequency of the field is 432 MHz. Electromagnetic fields and particle dynamics in the cavity are calculated using Comsol Multiphysics software. The input energy of the beam is 6 MeV, output 10 MeV. Initial beam is assumed to come from Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator (RFQ). The considered parameters are drift tubes radii, cavity diameter, gradient of the magnetic field from quadrupoles inside drift tubes and focusing lattice. Effectiveness is estimated by the emittance growth.

The IPM linac is an 8 MeV (up gradable to 11 MeV) electron linear accelerator under development at Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The design and construction of the linac is nearly finished and it is in the commissioning stage. The commissioning is planned in several phase of different energy ranging from 50 keV to 8 MeV. At each phase appropriate diagnostics is required in order to investigate the linac performance. A diagnostics box including a scintillator view screen, a dipole magnet, and a focusing solenoid is designed to diagnose the beam longitudinal and transverse parameters in wide range of energy. These parameters are the beam transverse profile, size, position, emittance and the energy spectrum.

The output beam of a high-power linear accelerator, used for industrial purposes, is irradiated on products and scanning them. In order to improve the dosimetry of radiation which products received and to prevent loss of the attacked- beams to the edge of products, the exact evaluation of scanning length is necessary . One of the other challenges of the scanning beam is the lack of uniformity in dosimetry of received radiation . The scanning beam does not collide in parallel to the products, which is also a challenge to accelerator efficiency. To improve dosimetry of received radiation, the use of trajectory correction magnets is suggested. These magnets correct the beams that do not scan in parallel. Also, using the Monte Carlo code, the dosing rate of received radiation to products is simulated and compared in two non-uniform and uniform modes (corrected by trajectory correction magnets.

Linac4, the new CERN H− injector to the Proton Synchrotron Booster, has been commissioned and has delivered a beam intensity and quality calculated to be sufficient to produce the standard beams for LHC and the high intensity beams for ISOLDE when connected. The beam current is nevertheless half of what is foreseen and the problem has been identified at the low energy end, between the extraction and the matching to the RFQ. The Linac4 test stand is being used to address this issue by testing different extraction geometries and different plasma generators. A fast method to access the current in the RFQ acceptance has been put in place. This paper reports the results of the measurements obtained so far.

HEPS (High Energy Photon Source) is a planned ultra-bright and extremely low emittance synchrotron light source which will contain about 2500 magnets. The magnet related data including design, measurements, tests, and operation are typically scattered in various storages which can be hard to access for high-level purposes. For such a large number of magnets, it is very important to have essential magnet information systematically stored in relational databases for efficient management and applications. This paper outlines the conceptual and the functional design for the HEPS magnet database and its associated applications, mainly for design of the database schema and application software architecture. This database is developed with MySQL. To provide a better view and access function of magnet related data, a web-based management platform has been developed for data uploading, querying and data managing.

Implementation of the Beam Loading Compensation Algorithm in the LLRF  System of the European XFEL

In the European XFEL, a maximum number of 2700 electron bunches per RF pulse with beam currents up to 4.5mA can be accelerated. Such large beam currents can cause a significant drop of the accelerating gradients, which results in large energy changes across the macro-pulse. But, the electron bunch energies should not deviate from the nominal energy to guarantee stable and reproducible generation of photon pulses for the European XFEL users. To overcome this issue, the Low Level RF system (LLRF) compensates in real-time the beam perturbation using a Beam Loading Compensation algorithm (BLC) minimizing the transient gradient variations. The algorithm takes the charge information obtained from beam diagnostic systems e.g. Beam Position Monitors (BPM) and information from the timing system. The BLC is a part of the LLRF controller implemented in the FPGA. The article presents the implementation of the algorithm in the FPGA and shows the results achieved with the BLC in the European XFEL.
