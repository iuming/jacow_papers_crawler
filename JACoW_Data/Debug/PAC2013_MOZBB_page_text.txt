The Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) currently in construction at Fermilab will enable a broad range of beam-based experiments to study fundamental limitations to beam intensity and to develop transformative approaches to particle-beam generation, acceleration and manipulation*. ASTA incorporates a superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) linac coupled to a photoinjector and small-circumference storage ring capable of storing electrons or protons. This report describes the facility, its capabilities, and provide an overview of enabled research thrusts.
