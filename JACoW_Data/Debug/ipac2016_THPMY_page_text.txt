Conceptual design report for the SPring-8 upgrade project (SPring-8-II) was published in November of 2014. Vacuum system for the targeted storage ring should handle some fateful boundary conditions, such as miniaturization of vacuum chamber and increase in number of photon absorbers resulting from the multi-bend achromat configuration. Furthermore, reuse of the existing tunnel brings the severe packing factor issue of vacuum components and the time constraints issue of one-year blackout. Considering the above circumstances, a concept of 12-m long vacuum chamber with welded integral structure was proposed to omit in-situ baking. The 12-m long chamber will be evacuated to ultra-high vacuum by ex-situ baking followed by NEG activation, and moved to the tunnel with special thin gate valves at both ends. Recently, the chamber material has been changed from aluminum alloy to stainless steel (SS) from the viewpoints of elimination of aluminum-SS transition space, beam vibration suppression, and superior outgassing property. Trial production of SS chamber is proceeding to establish appropriate manufacturing processes, while focusing on the accuracy of dimension and magnetic permeability.

A ferrite has been well known as an effective material for absorbing electromagnetic waves. Various types of the ferrite blocks have been actually used in accelerator fields as the higher-order modes (HOMs) absorbers in the vacuum beam pipes. However, one of difficulties in using the ferrite is to bond it to the beam pipes with a sufficient adhesive force, and to assure the contact with a high thermal conductivity in vacuum. The brazing or Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) is not so easy owing to a low thermal expansion rate and a relatively low tensile strength of the ferrite. We established a method of fabricating a ferrite block bonded to copper by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The ferrite powders are directly sintered on a copper block in the SPS process together with some metals to relax the thermal stress between them. The sintered ferrite-copper block can be brazed or welded to other metal blocks, or directly on the beam pipes. Here reported are R&D results of the fabrication method, and some experimental results on the properties of the ferrite-copper block.

The vacuum requirement of the RISP heavy ion accel-erator facility has been derived that meets the beam loss requirement and the vacuum system design is carried out using the 3D Molflow+ code verifying the vacuum re-quirement. We used realistic outgassing values of the materials of the vacuum chambers and beam pipes. We are designing detailed vacuum system specification and configuration including pumps, gate valves, and vacuum gauges along with the interlock system and differential pumping stations.

RF fingers are used as transition elements in beam vacuum line interconnections to ensure the continuity of the vacuum system wall within acceptable beam stability requirements. The RF fingers must absorb and compensate longitudinal, angular and transversal misalignments due to both thermal effects, during bake-out or cooldown processes, and mechanical movements during assembly, alignment, commissioning and operation phases. The new RF bridge concept is based on a deformable thin-walled structure in copper beryllium, which fulfils the above requirements without the need of sliding contacts. Mechanical tests have been carried out to characterize the response and the lifetime of such a component under different loading conditions. In addition, finite element models have been used to estimate the behaviour. The influence of different material grades and heat treatments on the reliability is presented. The paper includes a detailed analysis of the prototyping and testing phases that have led to a final design of the system, qualified on a dedicated test bench, for the collimator vacuum modules of LHC.

Amorphous carbon (a-C) coating is the baseline electron multipacting mitigation strategy proposed for the Inner Triplets (IT) in the High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). As of 2014, the COLD bore EXperiment (COLDEX) is qualifying the performance of a-C coating at cryogenic temperature in a LHC type cryogenic vacuum system. In this paper, the experimental results following a cryogenic vacuum characterization of a-C coating in the 5 to 150 K temperature range are reviewed. We discuss the dynamic pressure rise, gas composition, dissipated heat load and electron activity observed within an accumulated beam time of 9 Ah. The results of dedicated experiments including pre-adsorption of different gas species (H2, CO) on the a-C coating are discussed. Based of phenomenological modeling, up-to-date secondary emission input parameters for a-C coatings are retrieved for electron cloud build-up simulations. Finally, first implications for the HL-LHC ITs design are drawn.

In April 2015, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has entered its second operational period that will last for 3 years with expected end of the operations at the beginning of 2019. Afterward, the LHC will undergo a long shutdown (LS2) for upgrade and maintenance. The four LHC experiments, ATLAS, ALICE, CMS and LHCb, will experience an important upgrade too. From the design point of view, the LS2 experimental beam vacuum upgrade requires multi-disciplinary approach: based on the geometrical envelope defined by experiment, the vacuum chambers size and shape must be optimized. This included Monte Carlo pressure profile simulations and vacuum stability studies in order to meet the specific pressure requests in the interaction region. Together with vacuum studies the structural analysis are performed in order to optimise chambers thickness and position of the operational and maintenance supports. The material selection for vacuum chambers in the experimental area follows the CERN ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle. This paper gives an overview of the LS2 experimental vacuum sectors upgrades. The most extensive design studies, done for the two experiments CMS and ALICE are discussed in detail.

In high intensity particle accelerators, RF contact fingers are commonly used to carry the beam induced image current. In addition, they reduce beam impedance by shielding the outer bellows required to compensate mechanical displacements between components. In order to assess the resulting beam impedance from a specific bellow/RF finger configuration, RF measurements are routinely carried out. During these measurements, it was observed that cavity modes in the volume between the fingers and the bellow undulation arise. These resonances occur at significantly higher frequencies than the expected frequency range of interest. Due to their broadband nature, the tails of the imaginary part of these resonances reach into the lower frequency range of interest where it contributes to the beam coupling impedance of the device. For proper evaluation of this contribution, a time domain delay technique in TDT (time domain transmissiometry) was used in order to overcome shortcomings that arise if the classical coaxial wire method is applied to these structures. We present the theory of our method and discuss it in view of the data measured on deformable fingers that were studied for the LHC.

The LHC successfully returned to operation in April, 2015 after almost 2 years of Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) for various upgrade and consolidation programs. During 2015 operation, the LHC operated for more than 1000 fills. The 2015 LHC proton physics ended with 2244 bunches per beam circulating with 25 ns bunch spacing at top energy of 6.5 TeV. This paper summarizes the dynamic vacuum observations in different locations along the LHC during dedicated fills as well as during physics runs with both 50 ns and 25 ns bunch spacing. The causes for the dynamic pressure rises are investigated and are presented. A clear beam conditioning effect is observed, as well as a so-called de-conditioning effect. Furthermore, for the experimental areas, the dynamic pressure evolution is also presented.

Due to high total power and power density in Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) of EPU48 (Elliptical Polarized Undulator) in double minimum sector, we fabricate a new Aluminum vacuum chamber to increase sufficient room for synchrotron radiation to pass through without damage the storage ring chamber. A new method of in-site replacement of bending chamber is also presented, the result of this replacement procedure shows that it is very cost-effective as well as good UHV vacuum quality.

The TPS beam-position monitor has two feedthroughs in one flange structure. The hermetic seal was formed with laser-beam welding (LBW). Nd-YAG LBW was adopted to weld a button electrode with a feedthrough; CO2 LBW served for a feedthrough and a flange, Fig. 1. A robotic arm was used for Nd-YAG LBW so that it could accomplish the complicated geometry of the welded joint. Although the CO2 laser was not coordinated with a robotic arm, fixtures were made to implement a circular welded joint the same as welding the feedthrough into a flange. For not only Nd-YAG but also CO2 LBW, the cover gas is the major key that avoids oxidation from atmospheric oxygen and maintains shiny weld beads. Taguchi methods were exploited to find the appropriate parameters for the Nd-YAG pulsed laser, for instance, the laser power, pulse-filling time, frequency etc.. This paper presents the process and details of laser-beam welding of two types for a beam-position monitor.

The non-evaporable (NEG) Ti-Zr-V films were coated on the different vacuum-chamber materials, including the extruded aluminum samples (Al), the extruded seamless stainless steel samples (S.S.), CuCrZr alloys, and oxygen-free copper (OFC) plates. The NEG films were fabricated by using the direct current (DC) sputtering method. The secondary electron microscopy images showed that the morphology of NEG films was different on these various substrates. The thermal analysis (TA) presented that exothermic reaction happened by heating the samples.

The booster ring of Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is designed to provide full energy injection 3 GeV ramped up from 150 MeV with a small beam emittance. It is a synchrotron accelerator of circumference 496.8 m. The vacuum chamber through the magnets is made of thin stainless-steel tube extruded to an elliptical cross section of inner diameters 35 mm and 20 mm, and thickness 0.7 mm. The other chambers have standard 35CF round tube. The vacuum system was baked in the first installation. Because the residual stress of the stainless-steel elliptical tubing caused the magnetic field to become unstable, all elliptical tubing was removed for annealing to proceed, and reinstalled without baking. The ultimate pressure and data for the residual gas are shown as follows.

Secondary electron emission is a limiting factor for a performance of many instruments ranging from small gauges and detectors to waveguides and charged particle accelerators. There have been several methods of reducing this effect, e.g. the method of using a material with a low Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) or thin film coating with such a low SEY material. This paper describes the effect of SEY mitigation with graphene coatings on aluminium substrate. The maximum SEY (dmax) was decreased from 2.4 for bare aluminium to 1.4 with a graphene coating. Measurements were taken using an electron gun and a Faraday cup, the electron energies varied between 80 eV and 1 keV with a bias of -18 V on the sample. Other biases of -3, -5, -9, -25, -50 and -75 V were also tested however there was no effect on the SEY.

In this work physical vapour deposition magnetron sputtering has been employed to deposit metallic thin films onto Cu, Mo and Si substrates. The use of metallic thin films offers several advantages: (i) metal photocathodes present a fast response time and a relative insensitivity to the vacuum environment (ii) metallic thin films when prepared and transferred in vacuum can offer smoother and cleaner cathode surfaces. The photocathodes developed here will ultimately be used to drive NCRF guns such as that used in VELA and the proposed CLARA light source test facility. The samples grown on Si substrates were used to investigate the morphology and thickness of the film. The samples grown onto Cu and Mo substrates were analysed and tested as photocathodes in a surface characterisation chamber, where X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to determine surface chemistry and a Kelvin probe apparatus used to determine work function. QE measurements were enabled using a 266 nm UV laser.

The APS-Upgrade project is using SynRad and MolFlow+ to evaluate the vacuum system design for the future 6 GeV, 200 mA APS-Upgrade storage ring. The goal of this work is to explore PSD outgassing predictions from the two programs in order to build confidence in pressure calculations for the APS-U storage ring vacuum system. A study is performed on calibrating PSD measurements for aluminum vacuum chambers and then applying them to APS-U vacuum system calculations. The study reveals that a PSD measurement may not reveal a single unique behavior for a vacuum material and that multiple sources should be considered for vacuum calculations.

The TDI is a beam intercepting device installed on the two injection lines of the LHC. Its function is to protect the superconducting machine elements during injection in the case of a malfunction of the injection kickers. The TDIS, which will replace the TDI, is foreseen to be installed for high luminosity operation. Due to the higher bunch intensities and smaller beam emittances expected, and following the operational experiences of the TDI, a complete revision of the design of the jaws must be performed, with a main focus on the material selection. Furthermore, the new TDIS will also improve the TDI reliability by means of a robust design of the jaw positioning mechanism, the efficiency of the cooling circuit and by reducing its impedance. A simplified installation procedure and maintenance will also be an important requirement for the new design. This paper introduces the main characteristics of the TDI as LHC injection protection device, showing the needs and requirements for its upgrade. It also discusses the thermo-mechanical simulations that are supporting and guiding the design phase and the material selection, and describes the modifications to be implemented, so far, for this new device.

A linac in KOMAC (Korea Multi-Purpose Accelerator Complex) is providing users with 100-MeV proton beam for various applications. A new target room (TR102) for low dose of radiation beam will be constructed in 2016. The beam dump is an important part of this beam line and must be designed to stop 100 MeV beams with a maximum power of 10 kW. Incepting the waste of beam increases the temperature of the beam dump, which can make a structural problem. Therefore, the material of it should be robust under the high temperature and the radioactive circumstance. To ensure safety, thermo-mechanical analyses have been performed for a few materials using a finite element code. The beam dump will be fabricated based on the analysis results.

The HRMT27-Rodtarg- experiment used the HiRadMat facility at CERN to impact intense 440 GeV proton beams onto thin rods -8 mm diameter, 140 length- made of high-density materials such as Ir, W, Ta, Mo among others. The purpose of the experiment has been to reduce uncertainties on the CERN antiproton target material response and assess the material selection for its future redesign. The experiment was designed to recreate the extreme conditions reached in the named target, estimated on an increase of temperature above 2000 °C in less than 0.5 μs and a subsequent compressive-to-tensile pressure wave of several GPa. The goals of the experiment were to validate the hydrocode calculations used for the prediction of the antiproton target response and to identify limits and failure mechanisms of the materials of interest. In order to accomplishing these objectives, the experiment counted on extensive online optical instrumentation pointing at the rod surfaces. Online results suggest that most of the targets suffer important internal damage even from conditions seven times lower than the reached in the AD-target. Tantalum targets clearly showed the best dynamic response.

In 2005 a high temperature vacuum furnace was put into operation at the Institute for Nuclear Physics at the Technische Universität Darmstadt. It has been designed for firing pure Niobium at temperatures of up to 1870 C. Until now several Nb cavities have been heat treated at 850 C with a proven record of success. The current focus of research in improving the superconductive characteristics of accelerator cavities is on new materials such as Nb3Sn or NbN or on the doping of Nb surfaces with nitrogen, so called N2-Doping. The surface preparations generally take place at temperatures of not more than 1000 C. To study phenomena that occur at higher temperatures, like the formation of delta-phase NbN at 1300 to 1700 C, it is planned to refurbish the UHV furnace and use it for corresponding studies. We will report on the design of a new annealing pot and a sample holder and give a review on our first experiences with the upgraded furnace.

Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) has finished construction of a 1,110m long 10GeV X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) linear accelerator building in FY2015. In order to secure high-sensitive of XFEL accelerating devices, more advanced and well proven technologies were adopted in the design of the building. These are the ground improvement underneath the tunnel and tunnel structure itself against the possible ground deformation, air conditioning system to maintain the temperature and humidity in the tolerable ranges and architectural zoning. In this paper we describe the features of design and construction of the XFEL accelerator building.

Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) started operation of an X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) based on 10GeV linear accelerator in FY2015. For accurate temperature control of the various XFEL accelerator devices, a low-conductivity water (LCW) cooling system were installed. The LCW pump station generates LCW controlling the temperature variation within ±0.1°C. The LCW is supplied to klystrons including modulators and various control devices. On the other hand, the precision temperature controlled water to minimize temperature variation down to ±0.02°C. This water is supplied to accelerating columns, wave guide and SLED. Therefore, this paper shows the design, construction and operation of the LCW cooling system.

The TDC2/TCC2 consolidation is a good example showing how the complexity of interventions in high radiation areas has increased over the last five years. Due to its duration, its dispersion, the diversity of the teams involved, the fixed deadlines, the risks and external constraints, this worksite prefigures large scale-interventions in the LHC during long shutdown 2 (LS2) and even more LS3. The paper describes the three main project phases: preparation, execution (including monitoring and control) and closure emphasizing the indispensable steps in each stage. It also explains why integrating scope, schedule and dose into a single baseline is of prime importance and shows how to manage and monitor the radiation safety performance of the various interventions throughout the execution phase. Eventually, some recommendations are formulated in order to better accommodate the design of high radiation areas to their operation and maintenance constraints.

The recently completed Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is one of the brightest synchrotron X-ray sources in the world. It will offer 500 mA beam current at 3 GeV for all kinds of different subject experiments and novel scientific ideas. This facility will be the most inspiring trigger to Taiwan's scientific research in the twenty-first century. In order to make sure this giant machine operate properly, the utility system plays a very important role. Not only for the giant machine, the utility system also takes responsibility for providing a cozy environment for all staff. Furthermore, the requirements of air condition in some critical areas are very strict even to ± 0.1°C temperature accuracy. All of it cost a large amount of energy to satisfy everyone's demand. According to the annual budget report of NSRRC, the total charge of electricity and water was more than 80 million N.T. dollars per year before TPS project, and increased by nearly twice after TPS inauguration. Since the government budget is limited, the whole utility system must be operated under more economic ways to use energy more efficiently.

It has been studied and verified that thermal effect is one of the most critical mechanical factors affecting the beam stability. There are many accelerators have controlled the global air temperature variation in the storage ring tunnel within ±0.1C during stable beam operation in the world. However, some transient events, such as unexpected beam loss or beam trip will clearly affect air temperature variation. Moreover, machine shutdown will change the air conditioning status radically. It will also take time to reach a stable air temperature after machine shutdown. This paper presents effects on the air temperature by those transient events and improvement schemes.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the vibration level and spectrum for TPS deionized water pumps. The utility systems started to operate from the beginning of 2014, some of deionized water pumps produced higher vibration level and noise during operation. The possibly reason could be not appropriated installation and commission test. In order to figure out the status of these deionized water pumps, the vibration analysis become needed. After vibration test, the booster(BO) and copper(CU) deionized water pump systems generate higher vibration level. According to the vibration test results, the pump is repair and maintain. Although there is some problems for TPS deionized water pumps, the vibration test is still one important way to maintain utility systems. The utility systems could prevent malfunction through regular vibration inspection.

National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan currently operates two synchrotrons, the Taiwan Light Source (TLS) and Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). The former one has been operated for more than 22 years, while the latter is in commissioning phase. We target of the beam current on 500 mA. Thus, the power consumption increases higher than ever. Currently, the contract power capacities of the TLS and TPS with the Taiwan Power Company (TPC) are 5.5MW and 7.5MW, respectively. The ultimate power consumption of the TPS is estimated about 12.5MW. To cope with increasing power requirement, we have conducting several power saving schemes for years. This paper presents our latest power schemes, which include installation of power saving fan for the cooling tower, adjustment of supply air temperature according to the atmosphere enthalpy, replacement of old air conditioning unit (AHU), power consumption control by the operation of chillers, and power factor improvement.

For monitoring effectively the real time status of NSRRC's electric power system, an electric power quality monitoring system has been set up to measure the power quality of high voltage feeders, which includes the voltage/current phase, the variation of frequency, voltage sags and swells. The measured result will be analyzed and used to further improve the performance of power system. Furthermore, a partial discharge monitoring system was also installed to monitor the phenomena of electric discharges. Using the ultra high frequency discharge sensor, the magnitude and the pulse-per-second of discharge are measured and analysed. It allows the electrical engineers to diagnose the degradation of insulation of the electric equipment beforehand to reduce the power failure.

Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a 3GeV synchrotron accelerator and is built next to the present Taiwan Light Source (TLS) [1]. The stability of electron beam is pro-vided by Low-level RF control system for keeping Gap voltage and phase to be constant[2]. The Gap voltage for accelerating electron beam is provided by KEKB super-conducting cavity. During routine operation of the super-conducting cavity, water cooling system is necessary for stabilize the accessory components of the cavity to avoid damage or abnormal of the system. This article would introduce the realization and integration of the water quality monitoring and cooling system for TPS supercon-ducting cavity input coupler and high order mode damper (CPL/HOM). Brief description is shown in first section. The detail architecture and function of the designed signal monitoring system will be discussed in 2nd section. The 3rd section will have further description of interlocks for system protection. The final section would summarize the water quality monitoring and cooling system in this article.

The Advanced Wakefield Experiment at CERN (AWAKE) requires two particle beams and a high power laser pulse to arrive simultaneously in a rubidium plasma cell. A proton bunch from the SPS extracted about once every 30 seconds must be synchronised with the AWAKE laser and the electron beam pulsing at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The latter is directly generated using a photocathode triggered by part of the laser light, but the exact time of arrival in the plasma cell still depends on the phase of the RF in the accelerating structure. Each beam requires RF signals at characteristic frequencies: 6 GHz, 88.2 MHz and 10 Hz for the synchronisation of the laser pulse, 400.8 MHz and 8.7 kHz for the SPS, as well as 3 GHz to drive the accelerating structure of the electron beam. A low-level RF system has been designed to generate all signals derived from a common reference. Additionally precision triggers, synchronous with the arrival of the beams, will be distributed to beam instrumentation equipment. To suppress delay drifts of the several kilometer long optical fibres between AWAKE and the SPS RF systems, a compensated fibre link is being developed.

The electrum beam of the repetition rate of 50 Hz double-bunch is requested for injector linac of SuperKEKB. By development of the Yb-doped laser system, more than 5.0 nC and 3.0 nC electron beam with single-bunch has been generated in the 5 Hz and 25 Hz respectively. Also more than 1.0 nC electron with double-bunch has been obtained in 25 Hz. The Yb-doped laser system is already for commissioning for the linac. Next, a new laser system is development to improve the stability and reliability. The laser system starts with a 50 MHz Yb-doped fiber oscillator with the all normal dispersion (ANDi) structure. A transmission grating pair stretcher was employed to expend pulse to ~30 ps and separate the pulse to two parts with the center wavelength of 1030 nm and 1064 nm. Then the two kinds of pulses can be amplified by Yb:YAG and Nd:YAG crystals respectively. The weak pulses were amplified by the Yb-doped fiber amplifier, and reduced repetition rate by a semiconductor optics amplifier (SOA) pulse picker. To obtain the mJ-class pulse energy, a Yb:YAG thin-disk regenerative solid-state amplifier and a Nd:YAG rod regenerative solid-state amplifier were employed.

The LA3NET consortium has developed advanced laser applications for particle accelerators within an international research and training network. It brought together research centers, universities, and industry partners to carry out collaborative research into all the above areas and jointly train the next generation of researchers. This contribution presents selected research highlights from the LA3NET network. It shows how enhanced ionization schemes can provide better ion beams for radioactive beam facilities, and how RF photo injectors can produce high brightness electron beams. It also presents results from studies into ultra-compact, fiber optics-based electron accelerators and new radiation sources based on laser accelerated beams. Finally, it summarizes how electro-optical techniques, laser velocimeters, and laser emittance meters can all help characterize beams with better time and spatial resolution in non-invasive ways.

The planned LCLS-II FEL has an average beam power of up to 1.2 MW and a repetition rate of up to 1 MHz, both of which entail serious challenges for beam halo collimation. This paper summarizes the efforts to assess the proposed collimation system. The undulator section is specifically focused on due to its high loss sensitivity (maximal 12 mW). This proceedings concentrate on field emissions of the gun. Different dark current distribution, linac configurations and simulation programs were used to increase assurance of the results. Filled phase-space tracking further supplemented an independent prove of the collimation system effectiveness and expands to include beam-halo originating from different sources than the gun.
