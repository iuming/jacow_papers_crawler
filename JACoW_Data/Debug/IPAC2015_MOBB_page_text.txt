The MedAustron accelerator, located in Wiener Neustadt (Austria), will deliver clinical beams of protons (60-250 MeV) and carbon ions (120-400 MeV/n) to three ion beam therapy irradiation rooms (IR). Clinical beams and proton beams up to 800 MeV will be provided in a fourth IR, dedicated to non-clinical research. A slow-extracted proton beam of maximum clinical energy has been delivered for the first time in IR3 in October 2014, thus providing the technical proof-of-principle of the accelerator chain. The recent related beam commissioning efforts included setting up of the multi-turn injection into the synchrotron at 7 MeV, the acceleration on first harmonic up to 250 MeV, the slow extraction on the third integer resonance with a betatron core and the matching of the High Energy Beam Transfer line. The accelerator optimization phase leading to IR3 medical commissioning of proton beams is ongoing. The main characteristics of the MedAustron accelerator system will be presented, along with the results obtained during the commissioning process.

The construction of the new Center-of-Innovation (COI) buiding started at KEK from 2014 for the studies of mass-production of Superconducting-RF accelerators in collaboration with industries. The COI buiding is sitting next to the existing KEK-STF building and will include various Superconducting-RF facilities like clean-room for cavity-string assembly, cryomodule-assembly facility, cryogenic system, vertical-test facility, cryomodule-test facility, input-coupler processing facility, cavity Electro-Polishing (EP) facility, and control-room/office-rooms in the dimension of 80 m x 30 m. The purpose of this new SRF facilities is to establish a close collaboration between SRF researchers and industries in order to prepare for the upcoming large-scale future SRF project, like ILC. This article reports the fabricaion of four TESLA-shape 9-cell cavities for the commisioning of these new facilities. Details of the fabrication of these four cavities will be presented.

Photonuclear reactions with bremsstrahlung photon beams from electron linacs can generate radioisotopes of critical interest. An SRF Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) provides a path to a more diverse and reliable domestic supply of short-lived, high-value, high-demand isotopes in a more compact footprint and at a lower cost than those produced by conventional reactor or ion accelerator methods. Use of an ERL enables increased energy efficiency of the complex through energy recovery of the “waste” electron beam, high electron currents for high production yields, and reduced neutron production and shielding activation at beam dump components. Simulation studies using G4Beamline/GEANT4 and MCNP6 through MuSim, as well as other simulation codes, will design an ERL-based isotope production facility utilizing bremsstrahlung photon beams from an electron linac. Balancing the isotope production parameters versus energy recovery requirements will inform a choice of isotope production target for future experiments.
