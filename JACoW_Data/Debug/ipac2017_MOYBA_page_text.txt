Superconducting magnets and RF cavities are widely used in accelerators, and future accelerator projects heavily rely on this technology. There may be several questions on the future of the SC technology, concerning the feasibility of very high field dipoles (~15 T or more), possible technology evolution(s) with new materials, operation at higher temperature, and final sustainability of the technology in terms of helium procurement. The talk will cover a brief history/achievements and some interesting (future) developments, partly or fully answering these question.
