To search for the optimum structure of the ECR ion source, we studied the effect of the main parameters (magnetic field, etc) of RIKEN SC-ECRIS on the beam intensity for various heavy ions (Ar~U) with 18 and 28GHz. In the systematic studies, we observed that the beam intensity is strongly dependent on these parameters. For examples, optimum value of Bmin for maximizing the beam intensity was dependent on the microwave frequency (~0.8Becr (18GHz), 0.6~0.65Becr (28GHz)) and gas pressure. We found that the optimum value of Br to maximize then beam intensity is strongly dependent on Bmin in a certain condition. Based on these studies, even though we used the magnetic field lower than the ordinary "High-B mode", we obtained more than 200euA of U35+ at lower RF power. We could dramatically reduce the consumption rate of metal U form ~8.6 to ~2.8mg/h to produce 150euA of U35+. In this contribution, we present the effect of main parameters on the beam intensities for various heavy ions and mechanisms in detail. We show how to optimize the performance to obtain the intense U beam. Based on these studies, we also describe the optimum structure for higher microwave frequency.

A 28 GHz superconducting ECR ion source has been built for the KBSI heavy ion accelerator facility in the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI SC-ECRIS). Our main goal this facility is on the generation of the high current fast neutron by using the heavy ion interaction with light target. The KBSI SC-ECRIS has been designed for optimum operation at 28 GHz. The nominal design fields of the axial magnets are 3.6 T at injection and 2.2 T at extraction; the nominal radial design field strength at the plasma chamber wall is 2 T. The superconducting magnet system with the liquid helium re-condensing cryostat, the 10 kW high power microwave system were completed in June 2013. In August 2014, the first plasma was ignited from the SC-ECRIS. In this time, we will briefly present the design of the KBSI SC-ECR ion source and its beam analyzing system. Then, results of first beam extraction at KBSI SC-ECR ion source will be described.

In March 2014, a Laser Ion Source (LIS) was commissioned which delivers high brightness low charge state heavy ions for the hadron accelerator complex in Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Since then, the LIS has provided many heavy ion species successfully. The induced low charge state (mostly singly charged) beams are injected to the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) where ions are then highly ionized to fit to the following accelerator's Q/M acceptance, like Au32+. Recently we upgraded the LIS to be able to provide two different beams into EBIS on a pulse-to-pulse basis . Now the LIS is simultaneously providing beams for both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). In the conference we present details of the LIS including effect of plasma confinement solenoid.
