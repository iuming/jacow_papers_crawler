This invited talk describes a new concept of nonlinear dynamics that expands the classic work of Li and Yorke "Period Three Implies Chaos" to certain categories of symplectic maps. The theoretical classification of this type of chaos in accelerator systems may lead to the development of new control and feedback methods as seen similarly in fluid dynamics, and advance to experimental investigation at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator at Fermilab.
