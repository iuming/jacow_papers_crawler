The regular INR DTL RF system operation began in 1992. By this point three new type of vacuum tube, designed purposely for INR linear accelerator, were manufactured at OKB "Swetlana" in the amount sufficient for RF system operation during 20 years. Among them were two vacuum tubes for final RF power amplifier - GI-54A and RF driver - GI-51A and also vacuum tube for powerful anode modulator - GMI-44A. In the late 80s manufacture of these vacuum tubes was stopped and since 1990 designing of new vacuum tube for RF output power amplifier instead of GI-54A was started. The new vacuum tube GI-71A with output RF power up to 3 MW in pulse, plate power dissipation up to 120 kW and power gain about 10 was simpler and less expensive in comparison with GI-54A. The transition to new vacuum tube began in 1999 and finished in 2014. Successful testing of GI-57A as RF driver, fulfilled in 2008, opened the possibility of replacement GI-51A. As for GMI-44A replacement there are no analogues, produced in Russian federation, and, as it turned out, the only option was GI-71A again. Below some problems, connected with the vacuum tubes replacement, as well as main results of twenty years DTL RF system operation are considered.

In frames of Russian in-kind contribution to Europe-an XFEL, INR in cooperation with DESY is responsible for Transverse Deflecting Systems (TDS) for special beam diagnostic in the XFEL linac. Three TDS have been developed: TDS INJ in the Injector, TDS BC1 in the Accelerator tunnel after Bunch Compressor 1 and TDS BC1 after Bunch Compressor 2. Each system in-cludes S-band disk-loaded deflecting structure (DLS), waveguide system, klystron, pulse transformer, modu-lator and control system. TDS INJ has been built, as-sembled in the Injector building and tested. It is used to monitor the bunch length, longitudinal phase space and slice emittance now. Exceptionally small, exceed-ing expectations, slice emittance of electron bunch was measured using TDS INJ during the XFEL Injector commissioning. Three structures for TDS BC1 and TDS BC2 as well as the waveguide systems have been built, tested and TDS BC2 part installed in the XFEL tunnel.
