The Heavy Ion Laboratory of the University of Warsaw (HIL) is a user facility operating a Kmax=160 isochronous heavy ion cyclotron, unique in central Europe. Two ECR ion sources, a homemade 10 GHz and a commercial (supernanogan Pantechnik) 14.5 GHz, supply ions to the machine. In the center of the machine a "spiral" type inflector bends the ion beams into the median plane. The current system allows ions from He up to Xe to be accelerated with energies up to 10 A MeV. The research program of HIL includes nuclear physics, solid state physics, medical radioisotope production, biology and detector testing. In 2012 HIL launched a new facility - the Radiopharmaceuticals Production and Research Center (RPRC). This is a fully GMP compliant production center of radiopharmaceuticals for PET. It operates a General Electric PETtrace 840 cyclotron and a complete production line of FDG. An external beam line with target station"*", designed and constructed by the Laboratory, allows metallic and powdered samples to be irradiated, extending medical isotope research with proton and deuteron beams.
* Construction of this station was funded by the National Centre for Research and Development, Agreement No PBS1/A9/2/2012.
