Superconducting Cavities for Quantum Computers
 


 

A.S. Romanenko
                       Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA

 


 

Superconducting quantum systems are currently at the leading edge of quantum information science (QIS), including quantum computing, as well as fundamental quantum physics experiments and particle physics search experiments. So far though the 3D superconducting cavities which were used in the field of QIS, had quality factors Q ~108, providing one of the primary limitations for the achievable useful quantum superposition (aka coherence) times. In this talk I will overview how the superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity expertise in accelerators can bring the field of QIS ahead by several orders of magnitude in coherence times, as well discuss the emerging Quantum Technology effort at Fermilab and the first record achievements in this area.

FRCHC2
Possibilities for Future Synchrotron Radiation Sources
1000


 

M.-E. Couprie
                       SOLEIL, Gif-sur-Yvette, France

 


 

The landscape of present accelerator based light sources is drawn. The photon beam brightness increases opens new areas of user applications, both with the arrival of low emittance rings getting closer to diffraction limit and the advent of X-ray Free Electron Lasers, providing agility in terms of performance (two colors, attosecond pulse…). Finally, the path towards light sources using alternate accelerator schemes, such as plasma acceleration is discussed.

SHINE: Addressing the Tc-99 Shortage with Accelerator Technology
 


 

G.R. Piefer
                       SHINE Medical Technologies, Monona, Wisconsin, USA

 


 

SHINE is developing a solution to the domestic storage of Tc-99, an important radioisotope used in medical imaging. The talk will describe the uses as well as the production and distribution of Tc-99. It will then describe SHINE’s technical solution as well as some of the insights gained from starting a small company based on accelerator technology.
