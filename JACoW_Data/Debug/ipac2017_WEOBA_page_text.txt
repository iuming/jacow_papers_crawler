High performance collimation systems are required for current and proposed high energy hadron accelerators in order to protect superconducting magnets and experiments. In order to ensure that the collimation system designs are sufficient and will operate as expected, precision simulation tools are required. This paper discusses the current status of existing collimation system tools, and performs a comparison between codes in order to ensure that the simulated interaction physics between a proton and a collimator jaw is accurate.

Collimation with hollow electron beams is currently one of the most promising concepts for active halo control in the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). To ensure the successful operation of the hollow beam collimator the unwanted effects on the beam core, which might arise from the operation with a pulsed electron beam, must be minimized. This paper gives a summary of the effect of hollow electron lenses on the beam core in terms of sources, provides estimates for HL-LHC and discusses the possible mitigation methods.

We are studying a new scheme to produce very low emittance muon beams using a positron beam of about 45 GeV interacting on electrons on target. This is a challenging and innovative scheme that needs a full design study. One of the innovative topics to be investigated is the behaviour of the positron beam stored in a low emittance ring with a thin target, that is directly inserted in the ring chamber to produce muons. Muons will be immediately collected at the exit of the target and transported to two mu+ and mu- accumulator rings. We focus in this paper on the simulation of the e+ beam interacting with the target, its degradation in the 6-D phase space and the optimization of the e+ ring design mainly to maximize the energy acceptance. We will investigate the performances of this scheme, ring optics plus target system, comparing different multi-turn simulations.
