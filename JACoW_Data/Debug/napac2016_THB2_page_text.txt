High-power accelerators and new radiation detection technologies are being brought together to advance the state of the art in cargo inspection at the nation's ports. This presentation will discuss recent developments in the use of high-power accelerators, both normal-conducting and superconducting, to build effective, non-intrusive, cargo inspection facilities.

Radioisotopes play important roles in numerous areas ranging from medical treatments to national security and basic research. Radionuclide production technology for medical applications has been pursued since the early 1900s both commercially and in nuclear science centers. Many medical isotopes are now in routine production and are used in day-to-day medical procedures. Despite these advancements, research is accelerating around the world to improve the existing production methodologies as well as to develop novel radionuclides for new medical applications. Electron linear accelerators (linacs) are unique sources of radioisotopes. Even though the basic technology has been around for decades, only recently have electron linacs capable of producing photons with sufficient energy and flux for radioisotope production become available. Housed in Argonne National Laboratory's building 211 is a newly upgraded 50 MeV/30-kW electron linear accelerator, capable of producing a wide range of radioisotopes. This talk will focus on the work being performed for the production of the medical isotopes 99Mo (99Mo/99mTc generator), 67Cu, and 47Sc.

25 years ago, Brookhaven Accelerator Test Facility (ATF), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of High-Energy Physics (HEP), pioneered a concept of a proposal-driven user facility for advanced accelerator research using lasers and electron beams. Since then, the ATF became an internationally recognized destination for researchers to benefit from free access to unique equipment not affordable otherwise to individual institutions and businesses. We will show by examples how collaborative user research achieves high productivity when supported by the ATF's capabilities. Researchers from academia, industry and national laboratories coming to ATF successfully investigate wide range of topics. Recently endorsed as an Office of Science National User Facility and a flagship in Accelerator Stewardship, ATF continues broadening its user community. DOE is now planning a considerable expansion of the ATF's capabilities via simultaneously upgrading the parameters of the e-beam and laser.
