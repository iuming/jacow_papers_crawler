In the present analysis we study the weakly nonlinear interaction between trains of electromagnetic pulses and space-charge fields in laser-plasma systems. We direct the analysis to regimes evolving with the co-moving coordinate of the beam frame, but do not make any assumptions on paraxial or underdense approximate conditions. The model thus constructed allows us to investigate regimes where transverse and longitudinal length scales of the pulses are comparable. Resonant and nonresonant regimes of space-charge wave excitation are analyzed. In both cases, with aid of analytical estimates and numerical simulations, we examine how far trains of electromagnetic pulses can travel before being affected by the destructive transverse effects.

A self-modulated proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment is being designed at CERN and will occur within 3-5 years. Uncompressed 20GeV lepton bunches currently available at SLAC-FACET could be used to test key physics of the CERN experiment (e.g. self-modulation instability (SMI), SMI seeding, ion motion, hosing, differences between electrons (e-) and positrons (e+), etc)*. The E-209 collaboration was formed to carry SMI experiments at SLAC-FACET. Here we show through full-scale Osiris simulations that electron self-modulation grows and saturates in less than 10cm. Wakefield excitation in the blowout regime leads to acceleration gradients in excess of 20GeV/m. The self-modulated e- bunch then sustains stable wakefields over meter-long plasmas. As a result, 7(12)GeV e- energy gain(loss) could be observed. In the blowout regime, most of the wakefield phase defocuses e+. Thus, uncompressed e+ bunches drive lower acceleration gradients, but still in excess of 10GeV/m, over 1m of plasma. We will discuss the experimental setup, diagnostics to measure SMI (e.g. CTR, energy spectrometer, OTR, etc) and expected results. First experimental results may also be available.

The use of electromagnetic structures to couple energy to a charged particle beam is well known. These structures are usually driven by an external source of electromagnetic energy and the structure distributes that energy is such a way as being favorable to accelerate charged particles. Photonic crystals typically consist of periodic arrays of metal and/or dielectric structures spaced on a scale comparable to the wavelength of interest, have been investigated for use both as sources of microwave radiation and particle accelerators. In this case we consider driving a photonic crystal structure using a repetitive sequence of charge bunches driven from a photo-injector to resonantly excite the structure to produce an acceleration field to accelerate a suitably-delayed witness charge bunch to high energy. We examine the generation of the acceleration field as well as spurious modes. The dynamics of the witness bunch are examined to determine the longitudinal dynamics of the bunch and the energy spectra.

We study the long-term evolution of plasma wakefields over multiple plasma-electron periods and few plasma-ion periods, much less than a recombination time. The evolution and relaxation of such a wakefield-perturbed plasma over these timescales has important implications on the upper limits of repetition-rates in plasma colliders. Intense fields in relativistic lasers (or intense beams) create highly non-linear space-charge wakefields by transferring energy to the plasma electrons. Synchronized charged-particle beams may be accelerated with acceleration/focusing gradients of tens of GeV/m. However, wakefields leave behind a plasma, not in equilibrium, with a relaxation time of multiple plasma-electron periods. Ion motion, over ion timescales, caused by energy transfer from the driven plasma-electrons to the plasma-ions can create interesting plasma states. Eventually, during this long-term evolution the dynamics of plasma de-coheres, thermalizing into random motion (2nd law of thermodynamics), dissipating energy away from the wakefields. Wakefield-drivers interacting with such a relativistically hot-plasma lead to plasma wakefields that differ from the wakefields in a cold-plasma.

Recently the question has arisen of whether dielectric charging might become a significant limiting effect on the performance of the dielectric wakefield undulator, leading either to deflection of the beam by the static electric field generated, or to catastrophic breakdown of the structure. In experiments to date this has not been problematic with appropriate choice of dielectric material. However, given the high repetition rate that would be required, the device would be subjected to essentially a dc bombardment from the beam halo and thus be vulnerable to these effects because there is no time between machine pulses for discharge of the dielectric. We have begun reexamining this problem, emphasizing the expected charging rate and charge distribution in a thin walled dielectric device and the physics of conductivity and discharge phenomena in a dielectric medium. Simulations of the charging process and halo formation will be presented. We will review early work on beam-induced charging of dielectric structures and also results from deep charging of satellite components by cosmic rays. Ageing and induced conductivity under large radiation doses are also investigated.

We present the current and planned accelerator physics program at accelerator education program at ASTA (Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator). It will enable a broad range of beam-based experiments to study fundamental limitations to beam intensity and to develop transformative approaches to particle-beam generation, acceleration and manipulation. ASTA incorporates a superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) linac coupled to a photoinjector and small-circumference storage ring capable of storing electrons or protons. ASTA will establish a unique resource for R&D towards Energy Frontier facilities and a test-bed for SRF accelerators and high-brightness beam applications. The unique features of ASTA include: (1) a high repetition-rate, (2) one of the highest peak and average brightness within the U.S., (3)a GeV-scale beam energy, (4) an extremely stable beam, (5) the availability of SRF and high-quality beams together, and (6) a storage ring capable of supporting a broad range of ring-based advanced beam dynamics experiments. These unique features will foster a broad program in advanced accelerator R&D and accelerator education which cannot be carried out elsewhere.

Operation, upgrade and development of accelerators for Intensity Frontier face formidable challenges in order to satisfy both the near-term and long-term Particle Physics program. The near-term program continuing throughout this decade includes the long-baseline neutrino experiments and a muon program focused on precision/rare processes. It requires: a) double the beam power capability of the Booster; b) double the beam power capability of the Main Injector; and c)build-out the muon campus infrastructure and capability based on the 8 GeV proton source. We discuss key issues and R&D required for the Intensity Frontier accelerators.

For development of high gradient RF-accelerators, RF waveguides and cavities have been designed with Photonic Band Gap (PBG) and fishnet-metamaterial structures. The designed structures are comprised of a periodically corrugated channel sandwiched between two photonic crystal slabs with alternating high to low dielectric constants and a multi-cell cavity-resonator designed with fishnet-metamaterial apertures. The structural designs are intended to only allow an operating-mode or -band within a narrow frequency range to propagate. The simulation analysis shows that trapped non-PBG modes are effectively suppressed down to ~ - 14.3 dB/cm, while PBG modes propagated with ~ 2 dB of insertion loss, corresponding to ~1.14 dB/cm attenuation. The preliminary modeling analysis on the fishnet-embedded cavity shows noticeable improvement of Q-factor and field gradient of the operating mode (TM010) compared to those of PBG-cavities. It is planned to test the fabricated Ka-band PBG-waveguide and S-band fishnet cavity structures with a microwave test bench/8510C Network Analyzer and 5.5 MW S-band klystron respectively.

The density of charge carriers in solids, 4 ~ 5 orders of magnitude higher than those in gaseous plasma, can in principle create an accelerating field gradient up to 10 – 31.6 TeV/m. This extremely high acceleration gradient can offer various opportunities in accelerator community for future HEP collider in Energy Frontier. It was suggested that particles are accelerated along major crystallographic directions. The ions and photons are readily confined in the atomic tunnel of an angstrom-scale aperture, so called the channeling effect, which can accelerate heavy particles like muons from an x-ray laser or electrons from a drive beam. Carbon-based nanostructures have great potential with a wide range of flexibility and superior physical strength, which can be applied to channeling acceleration. The ASTA in Fermilab is currently designed with 1 ps electron bunch with 1 ms duration and 5 Hz PRR at 50 – 300 MeV, which is properly fit for the channeling acceleration test. This paper will present current activity on crystal accelerator research, including acceleration concepts with crystals and nanotubes, and discuss feasible experiments with the ASTA and beyond.

The Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment (NDCX-II) is a new induction accelerator facility designed to facilitate user experiments in high energy density laboratory physics, intense beam physics, and materials processing and testing with intense, pulsed ion beams. The facility has completed the initial commissioning phase of its injector, 27-cell solenoid transport lattice, induction accelerator modules and non-neutral pulse compression section. Space-charge-dominated Li+ beams carrying 20-50 nC have been generated from the 133 kV pulsed, ~1.0 microsecond (FWHM), 65-mA injector, and compressed to 20-30 ns with 0.75-1.3 A peak currents and amplification factors of 10-20. We report results of non- neutral beam compression and transport studies to generate variable ion beam fluences on to solid targets. We also report on studies of dose rate effects in pulsed ion implantation and on the recombination dynamics of radiation induced defects in semiconductors using the NDCX-II Li+ beam.

We demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct in three dimensions the electron trajectories inside the channel of the laser-wakefield accelerator from the angular dependence of the Betatron x-ray spectrum by using an image plate-based spectrometer with differential filtering. The experiments were performed at LLNL using the 200 TW Callisto laser system. Experimental results are benchmarked against a code that solves the equation of motion of electrons oscillating in the plasma wake and by calculating the corresponding x-ray radiation spectrum and profile. This combined single-shot, simultaneous spectral and spatial x-ray analysis allows for a 3D reconstruction of electron trajectories in the plasma with micrometer resolution.

Dielectric Wakefield Accelerator (DWA) holds the promise as an upgrade for the X-ray free electron laser of the proposed Los Alamos Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes signature facility. Our proof-of-concept DWA experiment aims to produce an acceleration gradient > 100 MV/m with < 0.1% induced beam energy spread. We design a 2.5ps double-triangular drive bunch and a trapezoidal witness bunch through the use of an electron beam mask followed by an Emittance Exchanger (EEX). To understand the DWA performance under transient dynamics, non-perfect EEX and other non-ideal effects, we use the Particle-In-Cell codes Merlin and LSP in 2D cylindrical and 3D geometries, respectively, to model our design. The benchmark shows good agreements with analytic theory on the longitudinal wakefield and the transformer ratio. Our simulations also indicate that longitudinal electric profile is highly insensitive to beam energy, radial distribution and emittance. We have investigated the transverse uniformity of the accelerating field and the effects of beam misalignment with radial beam offset. Full-scale simulation results for the planned experiment will be presented and discussed.

Dielectric wakefield accelerators (DWA) can produce high accelerating gradients and are planned to be used as afterburners for the accelerators of future free electron lasers (FELs) such as X-ray FEL of the proposed Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes (MaRIE) experimental facility at LANL. With a double triangular drive bunch DWAs can produce a high transformer ratio. Also, by slightly customizing the time shape of the accelerated bunch it is possible to achieve high gradient uniformity along the accelerated bunch resulting in low induced energy spread. We plan to test a DWA which would incorporate all those benefits. We are going to obtain a desired current profile of the main and drive bunches from a single large-charge beam using one of the known pulse shaping techniques employing a mask.* ** *** We will report our recent beam shaping experiments at BNL for a transformer ratio test. We used a 58 MeV energy chirped electron beam and a single dogleg with a beam mask inserted in a region where the beam transverse size was dominated by the correlated energy chirp. Both measurement results and Elegant simulation data will be presented.

We designed an experiment to conduct a thorough investigation of higher order mode spectrum in a room-temperature traveling-wave photonic band gap (PBG) accelerating structure at 11.7 GHz. It has been long recognized that PBG structures have great potential in reducing long-range wakefields in accelerators. The first ever demonstration of acceleration in room-temperature PBG structures was conducted at MIT in 2005. Since then, the importance of that device has been recognized by many research institutions. However, the full experimental characterization of the wakefield spectrum in a beam test has not been performed to date. The Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) test facility at the Argonne National Laboratory represents a perfect site where this evaluation could be conducted with a single high charge electron bunch and with a train of bunches. We present the design of the accelerating structure that will be tested at AWA in the near future. We will also present the results of fabrication and tuning of PBG cells and other components and the initial cold-testing of the traveling-wave accelerating structure. We will discuss the plan for the wakefield experiment.

An increase of intensity and brightness of proton beam by means of charge exchange injection and devices developed for this experiment are considered. First observation of e-p instability, explanation and damping by feed back are discussed. Discovery of “cesiation effect” leading to multiple increase of negative ion emission from gas discharges and development of surface-plasma sources for intense high brightness negative ion beams production are considered. By these developments were prepared a possibility for production of stable “superintense” circulating beam with intensity and brightness fare above space charge limit. A beam brightness booster (BBB) for significant increase of accumulated beam brightness is discussed. New opportunity for simplification of the superintense beam production is promised by developing of nonlinear close to integrable focusing system with broad spread of betatron tune and the broad bend feed back system for e-p instability suppression. Effects of ionization cooling can be used for suppression of the beam particle scattering in the stripping target

Particle acceleration in dielectric laser-driven micro-structures, recently demonstrated at SLAC*, holds the promise of providing low-cost compact accelerators for a wide variety of uses. Laser-driven undulators based upon this concept could attain very short (mm to sub-mm) periods with multi-Tesla field strengths. And since dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) operate optimally with optical-scale electron bunch formats, radiation production with high repetition rate (10s of MHz) attosecond-scale pulses is a natural combination. We present preliminary analysis of the harmonic field structure for a periodic undulator based on this concept.

Plasma wakefield studies are normally conducted as single-shot experiments. Here, single-shot means that the plasma returns to its original state before the next bunch passes through the plasma. The time scale for the plasma to return to equilibrium is 10-100 ns, which is comparable to the bunch separation in proposed linear colliders. The SLAC linac typically delivers beam at a rate of 10 Hz to FACET but can be operated in a manner that delivers two electron bunches per RF pulse. We explore operation modes with beam separations as small 5.6 ns so that high repetition rate plasma wakefield acceleration can be studied at FACET.

A photonic band gap (PBG) lattice in dielectric fiber can provide high gradient acceleration in the optical regime, where the accelerating mode is obtained from the presence of a single defect in the lattice. In this paper, we will investigate two aspects of the PBG for acceleration. First, the excitation of the accelerating mode can be achieved by directing high-power lasers from free space. Simulation using ACE3P has demonstrated that, by appropriately shaping the end of the PBG fiber, power can be coupled into the fiber using a simple laser configuration. Second, the wakefield generated by the transit of a beam through a PBG fiber will be simulated using ACE3P. The free-space, outgoing radiation spectrum and distribution of the wakefield will be evaluated and corroborated with measurements from a commercial fiber.

Rapid progress in the development of laser technology and in the sophistication of semiconductor manufacturing has enabled the realization of the first dielectric laser-driven particle accelerator (DLA) on a chip *. Since the accelerating channel in DLA structures typically have dimensions in the 1 micron range, the ability to precisely control particle position within these structures will be critical for operation. A number of beam deflection and focusing schemes have been devised, but without the ability to measure the position of the particle beam to nanometer accuracy, these schemes will be extremely difficult to implement. We present a new concept for a beam position monitor with the unique ability to map particle beam position to a measurable wavelength. Coupled with an optical spectrograph, this beam position monitor is capable of sub-nanometer resolution. We describe one possible design of this device, and present the current status of the structure fabrication and experimental demonstration.

Laser driven dielectric accelerators possess advantages in their greatly reduced dimensions and costs, larger breakdown threshold, and higher accelerating gradient *. Several resonant or waveguide based structures have been proposed * ** ***. Electron acceleration with 250 MV/m gradient has been demonstrated using a silica grating structure ***. We describe a new structure of silica rod array for laser driven acceleration. The structure consists of two rows of equally spaced circular or elliptical rods, with a gap between the rows as the particle channel. Similar to the grating, the periodic arrangement of the rods along the channel provides phase reset of the EM fields and thus required phase synchronicity for acceleration. Resonances among rods enhance the near E-field in the channel to achieve high gradient. The structure has been optimized dimensionally in simulations, and exhibited quite uniform net acceleration in the gap region. One advantage of this structure is that the rods are fabricated on one single substrate, therefore positioned and aligned with lithographic level precision. Prototype samples have been fabricated **** for potential laser acceleration experiments.

Laser driven ion acceleration has been the focus of considerable research efforts since multi-MeV energies were first demonstrated. Most experiments use solid state laser pulses focused onto thin foil targets. However, recent progress in CO2 laser technology allows for the creation of intense pulses at λ ~10μm. The longer wavelength permits the use of low density targets. In these conditions ion acceleration is primarily driven by a shock wave due to the radiation pressure of the laser. This acceleration mode has the advantage of producing narrow energy spectra while scaling well with pulse intensity. New improvements to the CO2 laser at the Accelerator Test Facility allow for the unique production of single picoseconds-scale pulses with 1TW peak power. We report on the interaction of an intense CO2 laser pulse with overdense hydrogen and helium gas jets. Using a two pulse optical probe, we are able to obtain real-time density profiles at different times during the interaction, allowing for the characterization of shock wave velocities and peak density conditions. Ion energy spectra are measured using a Thomson spectrometer and scintillating screen.

Plasma accelerators driven by ultra-relativistic electron beams have demonstrated greater than 50 GeV/m acceleration gradients over a distance of a meter though the accelerated particles typically have had a 100% energy spread when a single drive bunch was used. However, it is known that by locally producing electrons via ionization within the beam-driven plasma wake, they can become trapped and accelerated so that high-energy, mono-energetic electron bunches can be produced. We propose a technique to help identify these bunches of electrons at the 10’s of pC level arising from the ionization injection of Ar electrons that may otherwise be lost or overlooked as part of the discrete betatron-focusing maxima or the maxima inherent the chromaticity of the imaging electron spectrometer.

In plasma based accelerators (LWFA and PWFA), the methods of injecting high qual- ity electron bunches into the accelerating wakeﬁeld is of utmost importance for various applications. Ionization injection has received much recent attention in experiments, in theory, and in simulation. Here we use 3D OSIRIS simulations to investigate generating high quality electron beams generated through ionization injection. This includes the study of two-stage ionization injected LWFA in the self-guided regime. The ﬁrst, i.e., injection, stage is a mixture of 99.5% He and 0.5% N gasses, while the second, i.,e., acceleration stage is entirely composed of He. Laser intensities from 100TW to 1 PW will be modeled. In the 500TW case, energies greater than 3 GeV with 5% energy spread were observed.

CO2 laser-plasma interaction provides a unique parameter space for particle acceleration in a gas jet plasma taking place at a critical plasma density ncr~ 1019 cm-3 and even at higher densities (3-10 ncr). Here we report the latest results of our study of electron acceleration in a wide range of plasma densities 1-10 ncr using a multi-TW CO2 laser system at the UCLA Neptune Laboratory. To gain insight into plasma density profile evolution during ~ 100 ps long CO2 laser-plasma interaction, we used laser interferometry with two 1 ps, 532 nm probe pulses separated by 5-100 ps. Electron beams recorded in our experiment had a divergence smaller than 15mrad and good shot-to-shot reproducibility. The knowledge of spatial distribution of accelerated electron beam transported through the overdense gas plasma is critically important for minimizing laser beam filamentation and for understanding influence of other laser-plasma instabilities. This should allow for optimization of CO2 laser driven shock wave acceleration of low-divergence monoenergetic ion beams*. The results on correlation between electron and ion acceleration in a hydrogen plasma will also be discussed.

The results of the LLNL/UCLA inverse free electron laser (IFEL) experiment are presented. A 500 mJ 120 fs Ti:Saph laser pulse interacts with a short electron beam in a planar undulator tapered both in magnetic field strength and period to accelerate the electron beam. The tapering of the undulator maintains resonant energy exchange between the laser and electron beam while the electron beam's energy increases. We observe an energy modulation from 77 MeV to 120 MeV. Through use of simulations that are consistent with the observed data, we report a peak acceleration gradient of at least 180 MeV/m.

CO2 laser-driven ion acceleration has been used to generate monoenergetic, MeV ion beams from a gas jet plasma*. Studies have been limited to single shot experiments even though optimization of the laser-plasma interaction may only be possible at a high repetition rate. Use of a gas jet is advantageous because it offers debris free interactions at a density around the critical plasma density for 10 μm pulses(1019 cm-3) and can be retuned for different ion species. At the UCLA Neptune Laboratory we have upgraded our laser system to run at a high repetition rate. We have demonstrated the amplification of 20 GW, 3 ps, laser pulses at 1 Hz. Final amplification is achieved in a 1atm CO2 laser where the bandwidth for ps pulse amplification is provided via field broadening from the laser pulse itself. However, peak powers on the order of 0.2 TW are required for producing 3 MeV proton beams. An increase in our peak power by a factor of 10 is possible through nonlinear chirping and broadening of these pulses in a gas filled hollow waveguide followed by pulse compression. Here we present our strategy for obtaining 300 mJ, 300 fs CO2 laser pulses for driving a 1-10 Hz laboratory ion source.

We present a new curve-fitting method based on asymptotically fitting source size contributions to the measured electron spectrum that is capable of determining the maximum energy of a dispersed electron beam from a laser wakefield accelerator regardless of its transverse size. This method is applied to experimental spectra obtained in the characterization of a new injector stage to show that Direct Laser Acceleration may be an additional acceleration mechanism in laser wakefield accelerators where the laser pulse is long enough to overlap the trapped electrons.

Evidence of beam loading due to distributed injection in Plasma Wakefield Accelerator experiments carried out at the FACET facility at SLAC during the year 2012 is presented. The source of the injected charge is tunnel ionization of Rb+ inside the wake, which occurs along the length of the interaction at each minima of envelope betatron oscillation. Rb was used specifically to mitigate the problem of head erosion, which limited the energy gain in earlier experiments using Li that were carried out at FFTB in SLAC. In the present experiment however, electrons produced via secondary ionization of Rb were injected in the wake and led to a severe depletion of the accelerating wake, i.e. beam loading, which is observed as a reduction of mean, i.e. measured, transformer ratio. This ‘‘dark current" limitation on the maximum achievable accelerating gradient is also pertinent to other heavier ions that are potential candidates for high-gradient PWFA.

Simulation of laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) in the Lorentz boosted frame, in which the laser and plasma spatial scales are comparable, can lead to computational time speed-ups to several orders of magnitude. In these simulation the relativistic drifting plasma inevitably induces a high frequency numerical instability. To reduce this numerical instability, we developed an­ EM-PIC code, UPIC-EMMA, based on the components of UCLA PIC framework (UPIC) which uses a spectral solver to advance the electromagnetic field in the Fourier space. With a low pass or "ring" filter implemented in the spectral solver, the numerical instability can be eliminated. In this paper we describe the new code, UPIC-EMMA, and present results from the code of LWFA simulation in the Lorentz boosted frame. These include the modeling cases where there are no self-trapped electrons, and modeling the self-trapped regime. Detailed comparison among Lorentz boosted frame results and lab frame results obtained from OSIRIS are given. We have used UPIC-EMMA to study LWFA in the self-guided regime to 100 GeV and good agreement was found with analytical scaling.

We demonstrate experimentally for the first time the self-modulation seeding of a relativistic electron bunch in a plasma. The long (~3.2 ps) bunch available at BNL ATF drives wakefields with periods one to one sixth of the bunch length in plasmas of a 1015 to 1016 cm-3 density range, which is observed as a periodic modulation of the bunch correlated energy spectrum after the 2 cm long plasma. OSIRIS* simulations show that electron bunches with a square temporal current profile seed effectively the wakefield and the development of the transverse modulation instability. Although the self-modulation instability (SMI) does not grow significantly over the 2cm-long plasma with a 50 pC bunch, simulations show that the SMI of the 1 nC bunch grows significantly and reaches saturation over the 2 cm propagation distance. We further examine the possibility of measuring the energy spectrum experimentally to confirm the development of SMI. Initial results show that due to dephasing between the bunch particles and the wakefields, the actual energy gain/loss by drive bunch particles is much lower than expected.
