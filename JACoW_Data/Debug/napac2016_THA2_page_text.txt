At the energies envisioned for the FCC-ee the synchrotron radiation produces not only closed orbit effects but also some dynamics effects including strong "beta-synchrotron" coupling due to radiation in the final focus quadrupoles. Past experience with LEP and other machines as well as the implications for the new wave of circular electron collider proposals will be discussed.

Permanent magnets have long been major components in accelerator-based light sources, particularly as a part of insertion devices. However, their use as main lattice magnets (dipoles, quadrupoles) has been so far somewhat limited. The present trend towards small magnet apertures, exemplified by various multibend achromat designs currently under commissioning or design/construction opens up the discussion once more on the large-scale use of permanent magnets as a means to achieve extremely high gradients in future diffraction-limited storage rings. This paper will review the current R&D programs on the use of permanent magnets in the lattice of high brightness storage rings.

The new electromagnetic and mechanical designs of the S-band 1.4 cell photoinjector are discussed. A novel fabrication method is adopted to replace the brazing process with a clamping technique achieving lower breakdown probability. The photoinjector is designed to operate at a 120 MV/m gradient and an optimal injection phase of 70 degrees to improve the extraction field by a factor of 1.9 compared to standard 1.6 cell designs with the same peak field. New geometries and features are implemented to improve beam quality for the demand of high brightness beam applications.

A multi-frequency copper prototype cavity with 5 odd harmonic modes (from 95.26 MHz to 857.34 MHz) is fabricated and bench measured at JLab. This quarter wavelength resonator (QWR) based deflecting cavity is an half scale prototype of the five-mode cavity (from 47.63 MHz to 428.67 MHz) in the QWRs group developed for the ultrafast harmonic RF kicker in the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC, formerly MEIC). With this prototype cavity, several RF measurements are performed and the results show good agreement with the simulation results.
