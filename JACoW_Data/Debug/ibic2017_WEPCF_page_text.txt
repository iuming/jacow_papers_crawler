The measurement of beam charge is a fundamental re-quirement to all particle accelerators facility. In this paper, using the TM010 mode of the cavity BPM to measure the beam charge will be introduced. The data processing methods including harmonic analysis, time domain analysis and principle component analysis (PCA) are used and compared in evaluating the resolution of the beam charge. On the basis of this, the results of the evaluation at a ultra-low charge are also given and indicates the superiority of the cavity probe in the measurement of lower beam charge. In addition, the use of double-cavity mixing method to measure the beam charge will be proposed as well.

Harmonic method is very useful when we try to obtain the bunch length, while its resolution is always influenced by many factors. In this paper, the relations between resolution and working frequencies of two cavities are given by mathematical deduction. The laws of resolution change caused by some decisive factors such as beam position, working frequency, electromagnetic mode and probe position are obtained through simulation on computer. An improved measurement method utilizing TM020 mode is presented based on the theory above. The simulation results show that the improved method can enhance the resolution capability of the bunch length monitor and these analyses can provide references for the design of cavity bunch length monitor.

The UA9 experiment at CERN-SPS investigates the manipulation of high energy hadron beams using bent silicon crystals since 2009. Monitoring and characterization of channeled beams in the high energy accelerators environment ideally requires in-vacuum and radiation hard detectors. For this purpose the Cherenkov detector for proton Flux Measurement (CpFM) was designed and developed. It features a fused silica bar in the beam pipe vacuum which intercepts charged particles and generates Cherenkov light. In this contribution the SE-CpFM (Slow Extraction CpFM) detector is described in detail. It has been installed in early 2016 in the TT20 extraction line of SPS to study the feasibility of the crystal-assisted extraction from the SPS. Before the installation the detector has been fully characterized in 2015, during the UA9 data taking in the H8-SPS extraction line with 180 GeV pions. The single particle detection efficiency and the photoelectron yield per proton have been estimated and are shown in this contribution.

Low Energy RHIC electron Cooling (LEReC) is planned during a 7.7 - 20 GeV/n run with Au+79 starting in 2019 (200 GeV/n center-of-mass typical), to explore the existence and location of the QCD critical point. An electron accelerator for LEReC is being constructed to provide a beam to cool both the blue & yellow RHIC ion beams by co-propagating a 10 - 50 mA electron beam of 1.6 - 2.7 MeV. For effective cooling of the ion beam, the electron and ion beam energies must be matched with 10-4 accuracy. As the energy of the RHIC ion beam can be known to <1×10-4, the absolute energy of the electron beam must also be measured to 10-4 accuracy. A 180° bend transport magnet will be used as an energy spectrometer for the electron beam providing fields in the range of 180 - 325 gauss. A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) gaussmeter has been customized to measure the field in the magnet (to as low as 143 gauss) with an accuracy of 50 milligauss and a noise floor of < 20 milligauss. The concept of the magnetic spectrometer and details and commissioning performance of the NMR instrument are presented in this paper.

The APS Upgrade storage ring multi-bend acromat lattice uses 1000 individually-powered multi-pole magnets operating at current levels to ~260A. Requirements for power-supply stability, repeatability and reproducibility are of the order of 10 ppm. MBA SR q u a d m a g n e t a n d Q - b e n d dipole magnet current regulation will require a higher level of accuracy, precision, stability, and independent control than existing APS systems. In order to meet these requirements, the upgrade will include the installation of 1000 new unipolar power supplies. To monitor and ensure the performance of the power supplies, an independent precision current measurement system is under development, based on a commercially available DCCT sensor. An in-situ calibration system is also required that will maintain the ensemble accuracy of the measurement system and magnet-to-magnet relative calibration by providing precise known calibration current to each of the 1000 DCCTs distributed around the 1100-meter ring. R&D on the in-situ cross-calibration scheme is being performed using a network of 6-8 full-spec DCCTs. This paper discusses the proposed approach, and results and lessons from the R&D program.

New versions of Cryogenic Current Comparator (CCC) sensors with eXtended Dimensions (CCC-XD) for beam line diameters up to 150 mm (necessary for the planned new Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) have been realized. These non-destructive charged particle beam monitoring systems are able to measure intensities in the nA-range with a white noise level below 5 pA/sqrt(Hz). The systems are sensitive from DC to several hundred kHz and can be linked-up in a traceable way with national and international ampere-standards. In its present design, the base body consists of a highly-permeable, nano-crystalline core optimized for low-temperatures (ready for superfluid He-II applications) and a niobium shielding/pickup-coil unit. The flexible SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) - cartridge allows for application tuning. Three cartridge versions (direct, balanced and enhanced) will be presented, discussed and results of electrical laboratory measurements of the noise behaviour and the frequency response will be given.

Accelerator-driven system (ADS) is discussed as one of the efficient device to transmute long-lived nuclides. For the efficient transmutation of the minor actinide (MA), precise prediction of neutronics of ADS is indispensable. The Transmutation Physics Experimental Facility (TEF-P) aimed at obtaining experimental data for the accuracy improvement of neutronics evaluation of MA-loaded ADS. The critical assembly installed in TEF-P operates below 500 W to prevent the excessive radio activation of assembly. For the separation of low power beam from J-PARC intense proton accelerator, the meticulous low power beam extraction method from high power proton beam is required. The laser charge exchange method (LCE) is originally developed to measure the proton beam profile and can be applied to the beam separation device for TEF-P. The LCE device consists of bright Nd:YAG-laser and laser transport system with beam position controllers. To demonstrate the charge exchange of the negative proton beam, a preliminary LCE experiment was conducted using a negative proton linac with energy of 3 MeV at RFQ test stand in J-PARC. In this paper, preliminary results of LCE tests are presented.

An air parallel-plate ion chamber, which acts as a dose monitor for the beam delivery system in Huazhong University of Science and Technology Proton Therapy Facility(HUST-PTF), is designed as a redundant twin ionization chamber in order to meet the security requirements. In this paper, the characteristics of the designed ionization chamber are studied by using Boag theory and Monte Carlo simulation. Geant4 and SRIM are applied to simulate the energy loss and gain of 70-230MeV proton beam in parallel-plate ionization chamber. The influences of different sensitive regions and different gases on the performance of proton beam are discussed, moreover the structure of ionization chamber is optimized. According to the theory of Boag, the collection efficiencies of ionization chamber under different bias are calculated. The results show that the secondary particle collection efficiency of ionization chamber can reach above 99% when the air gap of ionization chamber is 5mm and bias voltage is above 100V. By the calculated gain of the ionization chamber, the output current of the detector can reach the order of 10nA when the proton beam intensity is 0.1nA.
