For the beam intensity and overall stability improvement of INR linac replacement of the first four section cavity of the main part is required. The present cavity is realized as the Disks and Washers (DAW) structure. The new cavity should not lose to the present one in electro dynamical parameters with minimal modifications in the rest linac systems. As the possible structures for the first cavity replacement both proven in exploitation structures and promising developments were considered. The analysis of electro dynamical parameters, coupled RF heating, mechanical processes and manufacturing analysis were performed for the considered structures. For further development the Cut Disk Structure (CDS) option is proposed as the structure with satisfying RF parameters and having the smallest transverse dimensions in comparison with analogues. For the production simplification with minimal losses in electro dynamical parameters an unification of the main geometrical parameters for the four sections cells was performed. The possibility of multipaction in the cavity is considered and an option for its damping is proposed. The manufacturing tolerances for the structure are estimated.

Development of parallel-coupled accelerating structure (PCS), creation of RF linier accelerator based on PCS is new and rapidly developing field of accelerator technology. Compared with conventional accelerating structures with serial communication - the standard traveling and standing waves structures, the PCS has a lot of features and advantages. There are many problems in the development of RF linear accelerators: breakdowns at high power levels, the destruction of the structure due to overheating, the excitation of higher-order mode, the decline of field strength along the structure, transients, beam loading, beam focusing, multipactor, radiation accelerator cleanliness, etc. PCS - the best accelerating structure for solving these problems.

New data on the development and experimental investigation of the RF accelerator based on the 9-cavities parallel-coupled accelerating structure that is equipped with a high-frequency grid-controlled electron gun are presented. Accelerating structure, injection system and focusing system are improved. Previously observed second emission resonant discharge - multipactor is suppressed by increasing the field amplitude in the structure first cavity and using the protector. The parameters of the accelerated beam close to the design ones, i.e. electron energy up to 8 MeV, capture to the acceleration mode up to 100%, were received. Capture is provided by the RF electron focusing of the microwave field structure with usage of the magnetic focusing system based on permanent magnets and RF grid control in the electron gun.

RF breakdown is the main gradient limitation for RF accelerator. It is believed that all the known ways to increase the accelerating gradient have been already investigated. These are increase in the frequency of the accelerating field, reduction in the pulse duration, the optimization of cavities form, selection of operating surface materials, preparation and training of accelerating structures. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of increasing the accelerating gradient due to the circuit design, i.e., the use of the parallel-coupled accelerating structure.

Electron linear accelerators with an energy of 10 MeV are widely used for industrial purposes. This article presents the electron dynamic calculations and the design of linac with a standing wave (SW) buncher based on the biperiodic accelerating structure and a constant impedance backward traveling wave (BTW) accelerating section after it. In such accelerator, all unused RF power coming out from BTW section is used in SW section to improve the linac efficiency. Thus no RF load is needed. Also, a beam is experiencing an RF focusing in the SW buncher. Solenoid focusing field influence on the beam dynamics in the TW section was studied.

Nowadays a hadron therapy is one of the modern methods of a cancer treatment. For that purpose it is required that a proton beam, accelerated up to 250 MeV, penetrates on a depth about of 30 cm. It is known that linac, cyclotron and synchrotron can be used as a sources of proton/ion beams. The main linac advantages are a high beam quality and a possibility of beam energy variation but, on the other hand, initial low-energy part of a linac is markedly expensive. Production of mentioned beams is possible on the base of a concept called CYCLINAC, when a commercial cyclotron is used as an injector, in which protons are accelerated up to 20-30 MeV, for main linac. Matching the beam from a cyclotron with a linac input is the main problem of this concept. It is caused by difference of operating frequencies of cyclotron and linear accelerator as well as a high phase size of a bunch from the cyclotron. It is proposed to use the system of independently phased bunchers for beam matching. Solenoids are proposed to use for a limitation of transverse emittance growth. The BEAMDULAC-CYCLINAC program is developed for simulation of the self-consistent dynamics of proton beams in a matching channel. Results of beam dynamics simulation for CYCLINAC will be presented and discussed.

Due to cavity losses in multi pass free electron laser (FEL), generation starts in it from definite threshold of driving electron beam current. Depending on generation wave range the threshold current strikes from fraction of ampere to dozens of amperes. In order to rich laser saturation, from hundreds to thousands electron bunches are required. Simple estimations give the value from units up to tens joules of bunches train energy in order to rich FEL saturation for infrared wave range (approximately 20 - 25 MeV of bunches energy and 3 A of pick current, bunch length being 1 cm). A beam with parameters mentioned might be obtained in rf superconducting linac operating in stored energy mode. The advantage of such approach is simplified linac power supply since dozens watts cw rf generator is required only to rich necessary accelerating voltage. At the same time the energy spread arising from beam loading may be compensated by additional cavities exited at shifted frequencies. In this paper Maxwell equations are used for beam-cavity interaction analysis. The bunch energy loss or the same the voltage induced by radiating bunch is expressed in terms of cavity external parameters. The detailed analysis of beam energy spread compensation is carried out followed by an example showing the reality of FEL schema suggested.

This report is devoted to a numerical method of solution of the RFQ structure optimization problem. The problem is considered as a control theory problem. Control functions representing geometry of the electrodes and a quality functional describing the beam are introduced. To solve the problem numerically these control functions are parametrized. The presented method is based on the computation of the derivatives of the first and the second order of the quality functional on the parameters. Results of investigation of efficiency of the method relatively to a method including computation of the derivatives only of the first order are presented.

A Simple Model for Electromagnetic Field in RFQ Channel

Numerical solution of the RFQ structure optimization problem requires a great amount of computation. Each consecutive step of the numerical optimization includes modification of geometry of the channel and computation of electromagnetic field for modified geometry. Therefore, a simple model describing the field in the channel is needed for the optimization. Such model is proposed in this report. It differs from the commonly used traditional model of the field, which can be applied when profiles of the vanes are described by the harmonic functions of the longitudinal coordinate. Our model is more general and can be applied for arbitrary profiles of the vanes.

Some aspects of acceleration of protons and deuterons in single RFQ are considered. Usually vane voltage for protons must be two times less than vane voltage for deuterons. If space charge is significant vane voltage for protons can be too small to reach high efficiency of bunching and focusing of protons beam. It is shown that a rising of voltage up to nominal value for deuterons leads to increasing of capture and transmission for protons. Another problem is concerned with a choice of radial matching section parameters, which are optimal for both beams (proton and deuterons) simultaneously. Methods of optimization are discussed. Analysis of particles dynamics is illustrated by calculation's results.

In current work a task of modelling of dynamic of charged particles in RFQ structures in BDO RFQ program complex is considered. Following models are realized in program complex: dynamic model of particles in equivalent running wave, dynamic model of particles in the envelops and model of 3D dynamic in standing wave. Parameters export between the models is carried out. For Coulomb interaction of charged particles different models of method of large particles are carried out as well as methods based on analytic approach of Coulomb field of the beam and estimation of the Coulomb field by net method. A possibility of results comparison with Coulomb field of particles by different methods is foreseen in this program complex. User graphic interface allows to choose a model, to enter and modify the parameters, to review calculation results.

Nowadays project RISP is developed in IBS, Daejeon. One of the main project devices is graphite targets system meant for production of rare isotopes by means of the in-flight fragmentation (IF) technique. The power inside the target system deposited by the primary beam with energy of 200 MeV/u is estimated to be around 100 kW. The target represents rotating multi-slice graphite disc cooled by thermal radiation. Necessary step of the target development is integrated test of target prototype under high power electron beam modelling real energy deposit into target. This test is planned to be held in BINP, Novosibirsk, with the use of ELV-6 accelerator. This paper presents the design of experimental facility as well as experimental program of test. Specifications of electron beam (energy close to 800 keV, size ~ 1mm, total power 30-40 kW) are discussed. Parameters and design of basic devices and systems of facility are described.

Mitigation of beam halos and emittance growth that arise as a consequence of strong nonlinear space charge forces in high intensity proton linacs is a challenging task. Here we present a systematic study of the role of non-linear space-charge forces on the beam dynamics through a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), using a fully 3-D particle-in-cell code TRACEWIN, with different initial beam distributions (Gaussian, Parabolic, Conical, 4-D water-bag and Annular) that carry different degrees of space-charge non-linearity but with equivalent rms beam parameters. Single particle dynamics was studied in order to trace the mechanism of halo formation and beam loss. We find that the lesser the degree of the space-charge non-linearity the better the beam performance, and from this point of view annular beams are best.

On Stabilization of Systems of Linear Equations with Linear Increasing Time Delay by Observation

Differential-difference equations with time delay are often used in mathematical models describing the dynamics of beams of the charged particles. For example linear equation of the second order with a constant time delay describes in the smoothed approach dynamics of a beam of the charged particles in synchrotrons with a feedback system. However the time delay cannot always be considered constant. The time proportional delay can occur at acceleration of beams of the charged particles in the cyclotron. It should be noted that such time delay is unbounded and well known approaches are not applicable for stability analysis such systems. The stabilizing control for the system of linear equations could be constructed by the information on a state vector of the system. Sometimes the state vector is unknown but we know some linear combinations of its components. Then there is a problem on construction of the stabilizing control with incomplete information. In this paper we investigate a possibility of stabilization of system of linear equations with time proportional delay by the linear observation. Using the sufficient conditions of asymptotic stability of system of linear equations with linear increasing delay we obtain some conditions of existence of the asymptotic evaluation system of the original system. Then we use the asymptotic evaluation system for the construction of the stabilizing control and derive the sufficient conditions for the existence of such control.

New high-energy frontier project FCC is now under development at CERN. It is planed that all three modes as ee, hh and eh will be available for FCC. New injection system for FCC-ee is planned to consist of new ~ 2 GeV electron linac and electron-positron converter. Two possible layouts for further beam acceleration are discussed. The high-energy 14 GeV linac is the first layout and the booster synchrotron is the second one. Pre-injector linac design will have two regimes: ~250 pC bunches for injection and ~6 nC bunches for e−/e+ conversion. In the second case we will have extreme parameters: bunch charge up to 6 nC in 10 ps, up to 10 bunches per pulse and the pulse repetition rate up to 100 Hz. Such beam parameters lead to significant design difficulties caused by very high influence of Coulomb field in the near-cathode region and high peak beam loading. First results of beam dynamics simulation in FCC-ee injection linac and near-cathode dynamics problems are discussed in the report.

The new concept of microwave interference switches is reported. Interference switch is based on series of H-plane T-junctions (cascade switch) in the view of decreasing switched power at Off state and comprises irises in both its own input and output arms. At On state the irises act as a transmission resonator localizing the nodes of the standing wave at the junctions. Such distribution is expected to decrease the plasma losses. It was shown with a simulation that the cascade switch with additional irises increases the efficiency of the active microwave compressors. The simulation was made with CST studio and COMSOL.

Design of the input/output couplers for Interdigital H-mode (IH) proton accelerating structures operating in travelling wave regime has a range of tasks to be solved. Most of the difficulties are caused by low working frequency band which is far below the cutoff frequency of the cylindrical waveguide. To get an appropriate coupling with the slow-wave structure a coaxial coupler design is considered. Reduction of reflected harmonic and coupler matching is performed by end-cell geometry modification. Two types of accelerating structure: classical IH-structure and modified compact version are considered. Both have 433MHz operating frequency. Results of the main electrodynamic characteristics, end-cell optimization and thermal heating for different power levels are presented.

1 MW CW 23 MHz RF system of the TRIUMF's 520 MeV Cyclotron has been in operation for over 40 years. Continuous development of the RF power amplifiers, the waveguide system and the measurement and protection devices provides reliable operation and improves the performance of the RF System. In this article, operation and maintenance procedures of this RF system are analysed and recent as well as future upgrades are being analysed and discussed. In particular, we discuss the improvements of the transmission line's VSWR monitor and its effect on the protection of the RF system against RF breakdowns and sparks. We discuss the new version of the input circuit that was installed, tested and is currently used in the final stage of RF power amplifier. We analyse various schematics and configurations of the Intermediate Power Amplifier (IPA) to be deployed in the future.

The Cut Disk Structure (CDS) is recommended for replacement of the first cavity of the main part of INR linac. For the cavity work stability there should be no multipactor at operating regime. CDS structure was first set on exploitation at DESY PITZ electron linac. For this cavity according to the analytical estimation multipaction should appear at the operating power level in coupling cells, but it was not approved by the numerical simulation with both accelerating and coupling modes excitation for RF energy transfer along the cavity. The multipactor appears only with the secondaty emission yield (SEY) growth which could happen if the inner surface of the cavity is polluted. The results of multipactor investigation in CDS PITZ were used as reference for the CDS structure for the first cavity of the main part of INR linac. The analytical estimation and numerical simulation of multipactor in CDS INR structure shows the appearance of the discharge in coupling cells with the OFC copper SEY for the operating regime of the cavity. An option for the multipactor damping with the forced excitation of oscillations in coupling cell with voltage higher than upper multipactor limit was considered.

The definition of manufacturing tolerances is one of the stages of accelerating structure construction. In case of proton linacs the value of accelerating field homogeneity is a critical parameter. It depends both on cells frequencies perturbations and the coupling coefficient perturbations. These values could be obtained using the numerical simulations of the characteristic electromagnetic oscillations in the cell. There is the method that allows the reduction of the simulations time and to avoid separate simulations for each geometrical parameter of the structure. This method was improved and extended for the pi/2-wave, pi-wave and travelling wave structures. Several examples of the method application, including the structure for the first cavity of the main part of INR linac, are presented.

For 20 years modulator vacuum tube GMI-44A successfully operated in DTL RF system of INR Linac. The vacuum tube had been designed and manufactured at OKB "Swetlana" in the 70s-80s of the last century. The quantity of manufactured tubes - about 80, had allowed the accelerator operating till now. Manufacture of the tubes was stopped In the mid 80s. Attempts of the GMI-44A manufacture restoration or repair were unsuccessful ones. As it turned out, the only decision in the circumstances was using of 200 MHz powerful pulse triode GI-71A as modulator tube. The vacuum tubes GI-71A were installed for the last ten years in all output RF power amplifiers (PA) of INR Linac instead of RF pulse triode GI-54A. In the paper some problems appearing after modulator vacuum tube replacement are discussed.

Several variants of a low-energy storage ring for Thomson scattering X-ray source were considered in *. The most promising variant "C" of the ring with small dimensions and large dynamic aperture has also large momentum compaction factor, which would lead to too long bunches with RF cavity operating at 714 MHz, so shorter wavelength must be used. In this paper we present results of optimization of S-band double-cells cavity with parasitic mode damping by chokes similar to **. Interaction of the bunch circulating in the ring with cavity parasitic modes is simulated.

The proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration is a recently proposed technique promising a GeV/m rate of acceleration to a TeV-scale energy in a single plasma stage. In order to excite high-amplitude plasma wakefields a long proton bunch from a synchrotron should be broken into a sequence of sub-mm long micro-bunches which can drive the plasma oscillations resonantly. We suggest a novel approach to produce the required train of micro-bunches using collinear wakefield acceleration in a dielectric-loaded structures. First the energy modulation is introduced into the proton beam with the help of the mm-wavelength dielectric accelerating structure. Then the energy modulation is transformed into the longitudinal micro-bunching using proton beamline with magnetic dipoles. Beam dynamics simulations were used to find the appropriate parameters of the dielectric accelerating structure, driving electron bunch and the beam focusing system.

Dielectric waveguide structures are a basis for development of new generation of accelerators on the basis of a wakefield method of the charged particle acceleration, beam manipulation, and also free electron lasers. A self-coordinated dynamics of relativistic particle beams in a single layer cylindrical waveguide with dielectric filling is investigated. The computer code is developed based on mathematical expressions for the analysis of the radial dynamics. The possibility of modeling interaction of different types of particles in a bunch is realized. Influence of both own wake fields and external fields of focusing and deflection systems on bunch dynamics are analyzed.

Dielectric lined waveguides are under extensive study as accelerating structures that can be excited by electron beams. Rectangular dielectric structures are used both in proof of principle experiments for new accelerating schemes and for studying the electronic properties of the structure loading material. Some of the materials used for the waveguide loading of accelerating structures possess significant anisotropic properties. General solutions for the fields generated by a relativistic electron beam propagating in a rectangular dielectric waveguide have been derived using the mode expansion method for the transverse operators of the Helmholtz equation. An expression for the combined Cherenkov and Coulomb fields obtained in terms of a superposition of LSM and LSE-modes of rectangular waveguide with anisotropic dielectric loading has been obtained. Numerical modeling of the longitudinal and transverse (deflecting) wakefields has been carried out. It is shown that the dielectric anisotropy influences to excitation parameters of the dielectric-lined waveguide with the anisotropic loading.

Graphene has attracted great interest ever since due to its excellent performance in chemical and physical properties. For the aspect of modern accelerator technology, high beam power and stability are two main concerns. In this paper we will give a preliminary study on graphene coated RF cavities and show some potential advantages related to the graphene coat. Especially for the high electrical conductivity of graphene, it is possible to achieve a CW operation which is comparable to a superconducting machine. Another important character is the low multipacting, which would greatly reduce RF breakdown and improve the stability of the whole system.

Recently we have reported on axisymmetric dielectric concentrator for Cherenkov radiation that focuses almost the whole radiation in the vicinity of the given point (focus) located on the trajectory of the charge*. Particularly, we have shown that this structure can increase the field up to two orders of magnitude. In this report we continue investigation of this concentrating target and analyse in more detail the field near the focal point depending on parameters of the target.

According to microelectronic production leaders the lithography based on the free electron laser (FEL) could become the main technology for the elements mass production with scale to 5 nm in the nearest future. One of the main problem is the absence of the working FEL with required parameters. The feasibility study of those FEL based on superconducting energy-recovery linac (ERL) was made in Budker INP. The ERL average current is limited by longitudinal and transverse instabilities, caused by interaction between electron beam and its induced fields in the superconducting cavities. The estimations of the threshold currents and ERL parameters were made.

It is well known that the coherent effect occur when charged particles in a bunch radiate in phase. This is accompanied by a quadratic increase in the radiation intensity and significantly influences the radiation spectrum. The coherent radiation is characterized by a form factor, which is the coefficient mainly depending on the ratio of bunch dimensions to the observed radiation wave length. The form factors will be different for the synchrotron and transition radiation because of their different nature of radiation. Now electron accelerators that produced beams with a sub-picosecond bunch length and a picosecond distance between them already exist. Through the appearance of interference between radiation from such a sequence of bunches, the total intensity is no longer equal to the sum of radiation from each bunches. For this reason, it is essential to determine the form factor of an arbitrary electron bunch sequence. Herein the uniform bunch distribution will be the special case. In this report we describe an approach to obtaining the form factor of the arbitrary bunch sequence.

X-ray Free Electron Lasers open new revolutionary opportunities for investigations in materials science, chemistry, biology and other areas. However, due to high cost of construction and maintain, the access to these facilities for wide scientific community is quite limited. This motivates search for schemes of compact bright x-ray sources. The size of X-ray Free Electron Lasers is dictated by basic properties of undulator radiation: to produce x-rays with Angstrom wavelength from cm period undulator one needs electrons with energy in GeV range. If one considers the radiation mechanisms accompanying the propagation of electron beam through a crystal structure (channeling radiation, parametric x-ray radiation, Cherenkov radiation near K-edge), one can see that to get photons in x-ray range one needs electrons with energy of tens to hundreds MeV. One of the ways to get bright x-ray source based on crystal-assisted radiation mechanisms is to run the electrons in coherent radiation regime based on self amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). In the present contribution we will discuss under which conditions the SASE can start in the case of crystal-assisted radiation mechanisms. To investigate the initial stage of SASE process we use the first-order perturbation theory that enables to describe the collective beam response as effective susceptibility. Based on this approach we will analyze which experimental geometry would promising for the SASE process onset.

We investigate the radiation from a charged particle rotating around/inside a cylindrical grating. The expressions are derived for the electric and magnetic fields and for the angular density of the spectral-angular distribution of the radiation intensity. Two types of the radiation processes are realized: synchrotron and Smith-Purcell radiations. Their relative contributions to the total radiation intensity are discussed in various asymptotic regions of the parameters describing the diffraction grating and for large harmonics. The region of the parameters is specified for which the interference effects between the synchrotron and Smith-Purcell radiation is essential.

The development of the permanent-magnet variable-period undulator (VPU) is aimed at improving the parameters of the Novosibirsk free electron laser (FEL). The key features of this design are the possibility of increasing the number of poles for shorter periods with constant undulator length and wider radiation wavelength tuning range as compared with conventional undulators. As the idea of the permanent-magnet VPU has not been properly tested yet, there are several issues to be solved before THE manufacture of the device. Two short prototypes of the VPU were made for the purpose of testing solutions to existing problems. We present here the results of mechanical and magnetic measurements of the undulator prototypes and compare the characteristics of the prototypes with those predicted by simulations.

A computer code for simulation of spatial distributions of electromagnetic radiation power, which is generated by a relativistic electron beam in the external arbitrary magnetic field, is written. The calculations can be carried out, taking the real distributions of insertion device magnetic field into account as well as the real geometry of setup. The spatial distributions of power, generated by the electron beam in the superconducting 7.5 Tesla wiggler, which is installed in the Siberia-2 storage ring (Moscow, NRC Kurchatov Institute), are calculated. The electron beam emittance effects were also taken into account. The numerical results were compared with the correspondent distributions, obtained by means of the approximate analytical expressions.

In this contribution we present an analysis of electron trajectories in the three dimensional magnetic field from a planar undulator. The electron trajectory is influenced by the focusing properties of the undulator field. In the European XFEL case, long segmented undulators (21 segments for the SASE3 beamline to 35 for SASE1 and SASE2) are planned to be installed, with quadrupole lenses between different segments. These focusing properties should be taken into account in simulations of spontaneous radiation, which constitutes the background signal of the FEL. The ideal magnetic field of an undulator can be described, in agreement with Maxwell equations, by a sinusoidal vertical magnetic field on the undulator axis, and by horizontal and longitudinal field components that appear out of axis. Exploiting this description for the ideal case, an experimentally measured magnetic field are accounted for by solving the differential equations of motion solved by means of a perturbation theory approach, and the corresponding expressions for the electrons velocities and trajectories are derived. The electrons trajectories for the experimentally measured magnetic field where also simulated numerically. To that aim, a computer code was written, which relies on the Runge-Kutta algorithm. The analytical and numerical methods could then be compared, showing a good agreement.

The Iranian light source facility (ILSF) is a new 3 GeV synchrotron radiation laboratory in the design stage. As the main radiation source, the ILSF storage ring is based on a five-bend achromat lattice providing an ultralow emittance of 0.27 nmrad. The radiated beam critical energy from 0.56 T storage ring (SR) dipole magnet is limited to 3.35 KeV. To overcome the limitation of hard X-ray region above 20 KeV, three-pole wigglers will be used to provide improved photon flux in both the soft and the hard X-ray region. The suggested three-pole wiggler (3PW) with the length of 250 mm and the peak field about 1.4 T is placed beside the central dipole magnet in the SR lattice to utilize high energy (~30 KeV) synchrotron radiation at ILSF. In this article, the physical design efforts for the 3PW will be described and its radiation source is compared with the main SR dipole magnet.

The production of metal ion beams by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion sources using the MIVOC (Metal Ions from Volatile Compounds) method is described. The method is based on the use of metal compounds which have high vapor pressure at room temperature, e.g., C2B10H12, Fe(C5H5)2, etc. Intense ion beams of B and Fe were produced using this method at the FLNR JINR cyclotrons. Experiments on the production of cobalt, chromium, vanadium, germanium, and hafnium ion beams were performed at the test bench of ECR ion sources. Main efforts were put into production and acceleration of 50Ti ion beams at the U-400 cyclotron. The experiments on the production of Ti ion beams were performed at the test bench using natural and enriched compounds of titanium (CH3)5C5Ti(CH3)3. All these efforts allowed the production of accelerated titanium and chromium ion beams at the U-400 cyclotron.

Design of the high-current ion injector for ions with z/A<=0.5 is described. The system consists of the laser-plasma generator based on a repetition rate laser with peak power 100MW/1Hz, a vacuum target chamber with optical focusing system with variable relative apertutre, a beam extraction system and the I-4 ion RFQ accelerator of ITEP. Characteristics of ion component of plasma produced by pulses of the CO2 laser were studied, when irradiating a solid carbon target using long-focus objective at power density of 1.5·1011 W/cm2. This work is of considerable interest in a wide area of applications of accelerated particle beams, including fundamental studies of state of matter in particle colliders (NICA project at JINR), radiation damage simulation and hadron therapy for cancer treatment. The goal of this work is to investigate characteristics of ions in expanding laser plasma. Their energy distribution is important for extracting an ion beam and its further acceleration. Time-of-flight technique using a high resolution energy analyzer allowed to explore dynamics of the plasma expansion by determining the time when ions with specified charge and energy leave plasma plume relative to the incident laser pulse. This research is valuable for adapting an intensive beam from laser ion source to the accelerator, improving acceleration efficency and rising the amount of accelerated particles.

The source of H-minus ions for the injection in LU-30 accelerator is being constructed at IHEP. A three-dimensional (3D)simulation code IBSimu has been utilized for modeling of the transport and matching system of beam from the H-minus ion source into RFQ. A magnetic low energy beam transport (LEBT) line consisting of two solenoids and LEBT consisting of six magnetic quadrupole lenses were analyzed. The particle data from the 50 mA 100 keV ion beam extraction system simulations were taken as the starting data for the LEBT simulations. The main objective of the project was to achieve the required Twiss parameters and to minimize emittance growth at RFQ entrance. The LEBT consisting of two solenoids is more convenient in adjustment and as simulation results have shown this system offers more acceptable beam characteristics at the match point in comparison with LEBT composed of quadrupole lenses.

The considered source of triode type produces intense radial converging electron beam for irradiation of cylindrical targets. As an electron emitter an explosive plasma cathode is used. The role of initial transverse velocities of electrons, defocusing effect of the controlling grid, the beam self-magnetic field, electron and ion emission from the controlling grid, backscattering of electrons and ion flow from the target is analyzed. Conditions for achieving required electron beam parameters (the electron kinetic energy - 120 keV, the beam energy density on the target 40 J/cm2 on a maximum possible length of the target surface) were determined.

The problems of the trajectories constructing for field electrons and emission images simulation are considered. As an approximation of the emitter shape an explicitly and implicitly defined surfaces are selected. Hyperboloidal, ellipsoidal and paraboloidal models are studied. Also an equipotential surface of the charged sphere-on-orthogonal-cone system is used. A simple solution of the field distribution problem is allowed to formulate the Cauchy problem for the motion equations. The shape of the anode (the projector microscope screen) can be selected in any desired form. Achieving a screen by electrons is performed with dense output technique in numerical approach to the solution. The distribution of the work function on the cathode surface is obtained. The trajectories for the projection of the field emission activity as the image are used.

In this work an axisymmetric diode electron-optical system based on a field emitter is simulated. The field emitter in the form of a thin filament of finite length is located on the flat substrate with the dielectric layer. The anode is a plane. The electrostatic potential distribution was found in an analytical form - in the form of Fourier-Bessel series in the whole area of the system under investigation. The coefficients of Fourier-Bessel series are the solution of the system of linear equations with constant coefficients.

To provide electron bunches with exceptionally high brightness, RF gun cavity should operate with the extreme electric and magnetic fields. The RF probe is required for the mostly reliable and precise measurements of the RF field phase and amplitude directly from the cavity. The implementation of an RF probe in the cavity design generates a set of coupled problems, which is analyzed and compared for different operating frequencies and different RF pulse length. Both general dependencies and particularities are considered. Some recommendations for practical choice of the RF probe are presented.

Today the materials for cathodes with high current density and long work time usable in particle accelerators' electron guns are in demand. A perspective method for creating such cathodes is implanting alkaline and alkaline earth metals into carbon structures in order to lower the work function*. In our research, the goal was to refine the technology for creating a composite, in which graphite and emission active elements form an intercalated compound**, where molecular layers of graphite alternate with molecular layers of barium, strontium and calcium, and these materials' oxides are concentrated inside interlayer caverns. To achieve this, a mixture of fine grained pyrolytic graphite and triple carbonate of alkaline earth metals (Ba, Sr, Ca) CO3 is pressed together without binder compound at different pressure. The specimens 2x1x1 mm are obtained in result. A composite material is obtained as a result of this research, and the work range of processing pressures allowing to create cathodes from such a material, is determined.

Pyroelectric crystals, such as LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 being under influence of temperature gradient produce electric field up to 106 kV/cm. It was experimentally confirmed that the crystal installed in the chamber with residual gas pressure about 1 mTorr can be used for generation of X-Rays*, electrons** and neutrons***. The unique property to generate high potential without external high voltage power supply can be used to develop compact electron and ion accelerators with particles energies up to several hundred keV for different applications. We have developed the laboratory experimental setup for exciting d-d nuclear fusion by pyroelectric crystal LiTaO3. The setup allows to provide and control the neutrons generated during d-d nuclear fusion. It is shown that the neutrons with energy 2.45 MeV can be generated starting from a level of electric potential generated by pyroelectric crystal about 30 kV, in contrast to the typical neutron tubes which need the applied outer high voltage level about 100 kV. The results of the neutrons observation and possible construction of the pyroelectric neutron generator are presented.
