ATLAS (the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System) is a super conducting heavy ion accelerator which can accelerate nearly all stable, and some unstable, isotopes between protons and uranium with a charge to mass range of 1/1 to 1/7. The maximum energy ranges of these accelerated ions are 7-17 MeV per nucleon with intensities ranging from a few thousand ions/second to microampere currents. On average ATLAS delivers a different ion species and energy each week to one of six target areas. ATLAS currently operates 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, and at least 40 weeks per year. Topics discussed will be how we handle day to day operation of the facility including start up, reusing old accelerator configurations for new experiments (scaling), tuning for in-flight produced radioactive beams, troubleshooting problems, and maintenance.

At the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (ATLAS) we are integrating TRACK, three dimensional particle tracking software that numerically integrates the equations of motion, into the accelerator control system. ATLAS delivers a variety of ions (1 ' 238 AMU) at various energies (1 ' 15 MeV/u) to multiple targets. By comparing simulated and observed performance, model driven operations will improve the understanding of the facility, reduce tune times, and improve the beam quality for these diverse operating conditions. This paper will describe the work to interface TRACK with the real-time accelerator control system, and the results of simulations used to characterize and configure the accelerator.

ATLAS, the world's first accelerator to use RF superconductivity for ion acceleration, has undergone a major facility upgrade with the goals of significantly increased stable-beam current for experiments and improved transmission for all beams. The dominant components of the upgrade are a) new CW-RFQ to replace the first three low β resonators, b) a new cryostat of seven β=0.077 quarter-wave resonators demonstrating world-record accelerating fields, c) an improved cryogenics system, and d) the retirement of the original tandem injector. This latest upgrade followed closely on the earlier development of a cryostat of β=0.144 quarter-wave resonators. This reconfigured ATLAS system has been in operation for over one year. This paper will discuss the on-line performance achieved for the redesigned system, plans for further improvement, and long term facility plans for new performance capabilities. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Physics, under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357. This research used resources of ANL's ATLAS facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility.
