High harmonic generation (HHG) is a well-established technology to produce attosecond pulses in VUV wavelengths. So far HHG sources have been driven by femtosecond solid-state lasers not FELs, because it has been believed that FELs have no ability to provide carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) stabilized few-cycle pulses essential to the HHG. Here, we propose a scheme to CEP stabilized few-cycle pulses from a FEL oscillator. Operated at a mid-infrared wavelength, the proposed method is able to drive a HHG photon source to produce isolated attosecond pulses at photon energies above 1 keV with a repetition > 10 MHz. The FEL-HHG photon source will open a door to full-scale experiments of attosecond X-ray pulses and push ultrafast laser science to the zeptosecond regime [1].

We suggest an efficient XFELO having a new non-stationary out-coupling scheme. It consisted of two undulator sections located in sequence with a free space gap in-between. The first section is a conventional uniform undulator, the second one is a tapered undulator. At start time point X-ray radiation is basically produced by the uniform section. Mirrors of XFELO's optical resonator are calculated so that diffraction Q-factor reaches the highest value, i.e losses asre near to zero. As X-ray power increases the tapered undulator begins to bring more contribution in radiation power. Finally, at a new steady state regime all power is being produced by the tapered section. Because mirrors were optimized for Gaussian wavebeam to be produced in the first section, in the final steady state regime a portion of X-ray power will be out-coupled missing partly the mirrors.

FEL is a cutting-edge tool for generating high brilliant, wavelength adjustable radiation. FEL oscillators (FELO) is one of FEL's operation mode. A novel simplified theoretical model for fast simulation and optimization of FELO is proposed. Instead of utilizing conventional macro particles tracking, i.e., GENESIS and OPC codes, the theoretical model takes advantage of low-gain theory to calculate single-pass gain analytically and it is able to considerably reduce calculation time, i.e., from several days to a few minutes. In addition, it is useful for simulating new FELO scheme such as gain cascading.
