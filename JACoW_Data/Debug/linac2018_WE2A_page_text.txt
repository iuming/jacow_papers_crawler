FRIB is now moving to commissioning interleaved with installation. The ECR, low energy transport and RFQ have been commissioned with beam By the time of the conference the 4K cryogenic system and first three beta 0.041 QWR cryomodules will be commissioned with first cold acceleration. The talk would focus on the hardware and beam performance.

Operational Enhancements for the LANSCE Isotope Production Facility

Isotopes produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) are saving lives, advancing cutting-edge research, and helping to address national security questions. For the past two years LANL’s Accelerator Operations & Technology Division has executed a $6.4M improvement project for the Isotope Production Facility. The goals were to reduce the programmatic risk and enhance facility reliability while at the same time pursuing opportunities to increase general isotope production capacity. This has led to some exciting innovations. In this paper we will discuss the engineering designs for an upgraded beam raster system, a new beam diagnostics capabilities and our new collimator, which is both adjustable and ’active’ (beam current and temperature measurements). We will report on results obtained and lessons learned from the commissioning phase and initial production run.

An upgrade project of the RIKEN Heavy-Ion Linac, RILAC, is under going, which aims at the further investigation of the super-heavy elements and production of radioactive isotopes for medical applications. In this project, a new superconducting ECR ion source and superconducting RF (SRF) booster linac are being developed and constructed. The SRF linac consists of 10 quarter-wavelength resonator operated at 73 MHz, that are contained in three cryomodules. The construction status, including the first vertical test results, will be given in this paper.
