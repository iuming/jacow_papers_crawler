Within the EU H2020 project HITRIplus for the development of cancer therapy with heavy ions a linac was designed. It is evolving from the concept of the 4 European cancer therapy centers applying light ions up to carbon. The new linac will in its simpliest version allow C4+ - beam injection into synchrotrons at 5 A MeV, with high beam transmission and allowing currents up to 5 mA alpha - particles. An advanced ECR - ion source will inject into an RFQ - IH-DTL combination. The DTL concept allows upgraded versions for A/q - values up to two and with beam energies of 7.1 A MeV from IH - tank2 and 10 A MeV from IH-tank3. The higher beam injection energies for light ions allow a relaxed synchrotron operation at lowest magnetic field levels. A main argument for the DTL extensions however is an additional linac function as radioisotope facility driver. The 7.1 A MeV are especially defined for the clean production of 211At, which may play a future role in cancer therapy. The linac will allow for high duty factors - up to 10%, to fulfil the needs for efficient radioisotope production. Solid state amplifiers with matched design RF power levels (up to 600 kW for IH3) will be used.

The TOP-IMPLART (Intensity Modulated Proton Linear Accelerator for Radio Therapy) proton linac, is a RF pulsed linac, designed for protontherapy consisting of a low frequency (425 MHz) 7 MeV injector followed by a sequence of accelerating modules operating at 3 GHz under construction, assembly and test at the ENEA Frascati Research Center. The accelerator features also a vertical low energy (3-7 MeV) line for irradiation of samples in horizontal position. The segment currently completed includes 8 SCDTL modules up to 71 MeV grouped in two sections each one powered by a 10 MW klystron driven by a SCANDINOVA K100 modulator with a variable pulse length (1-5 us) at a repetition frequency of 25 Hz. The output current can be varied up to 30 uA. The beam is mainly used for radiobiology experiments and dosimetry systems tests, but the flexibility in beam characteristics makes it suitable also for applications different from protontherapy, as the irradiation of electronics components to verify their behavior in the space environment. In this work, the current status of the accelerator and beam characteristics measurements are presented with an overview of the experiments carried on it.

Given the asymmetry in the stem configuration of an IH-DTL structure, an electric dipole component is always present between drift tubes, and it is especially significant for reduced dimensions in high-frequency regimes. Here we study the effect of different modifications of the drift tubes geometry of a 750 MHz IH-DTL to eliminate the impact of the dipole component in the transverse beam dynamics. Tracking simulations through a single cell are also performed to assess the outcomes in particle’s trajectory offset and angle.

High frequency structures generally translate to high efficiency performances thanks to reduced surfaces of the inner cavity. Two round-profiles geometry and some variations of two important parameters of a 750 MHz IH-DTL are proposed in this paper in order to improve shunt impedance performance regarding an existing solution with flat-walled cavity developed by CERN. The proposed designs are shaped such that they guarantee an easy connection of RF and vacuum auxiliaries. Electromagnetic simulations are checked with CST Microwave Studio.

The CERN spinoff company ADAM owned by Advanced Oncotherapy plc (AVO-ADAM) is completing the construction and testing of its first LIGHT (Linac for Image-Guided Hadron Therapy) system. Each LIGHT machine is composed by 20 accelerating modules: one 750 MHz RFQ, four 3 GHz Side-Coupled Drift Tube Linac (SCDTL) and 15 3 GHz Coupled-Cavity Linac (CCL). The company aims at delivering several similar LIGHT machines in the next years. A prerequisite to achieve such goal is the capability to complete the RF conditioning of the accelerating modules in a systematic and automatic way, with minimal inputs from RF engineers. In the past years ADAM developed an automatic conditioning system capable of increasing the main conditioning parameters ’ RF power, pulse width, repetition rate ’ while controlling the cavity breakdown rate and vacuum level. The system has been so far tested on about twenty accelerating structures with different brazing methodologies and RF accelerating voltages, proving its robustness. This paper discusses the ADAM automatic conditioning system design and its implementation.

The LIGHT (Linac for Image-Guided Hadron Therapy) machine is designed to accelerate a proton beam up to 230 MeV to treat deep seated tumours. The machine consists of three different kinds of accelerators: RFQ (Radio-Frequency Quadrupole), SCDTL (Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac) and CCL (Coupled Cavity Linac). These accelerating structures are fed with RF power at 750 MHz (RFQ) and 3 GHz (SCDTLs and CCLs). This power is delivered to the accelerating structure via the high power RF transmission network (RF network). In addition, the RF network needs to offer other functionalities, like protection of the high RF power feeding stations, power splitting, phase and amplitude control and monitoring. The maximum power handling of the RF network corresponds to a peak RF power of 8 MW and an average RF power of 9 kW. It functions either in Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) conditions at an ultimate operating pressure of 10-7 mbar, or under pressurized gas. The above listed requirements involve different challenges. In this contribution we exhibit the main aspects to be considered based on AVO experience during the commissioning of the RF network units.

The LIGHT (Linac for Image-Guided Hadron Therapy) project was initiated to develop a modular proton accelerator delivering beam with energies up to 230 MeV for cancer therapy. The machine consists of three different kinds of accelerating structures: RFQ (Radio-Frequency Quadrupole), SCDTL (Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac) and CCL (Coupled Cavity Linac). These accelerating structures operate at 750 MHz (RFQ) and 3 GHz (SCDTL, CCL). The accelerator RF signals are generated, distributed, and controlled by a Low-Level RF (LLRF) system. The LIGHT LLRF system is based on a commercially available solution from Instrumentation Technologies with project specific customization. This LLRF system features high amplitude and phase stability, monitoring of the RF signals from the RF network and the accelerating structures at 200 Hz, RF pulse shaping over real-time interface integrated, RF breakdown detection, and thermal resonance frequency correction feedback. The LLRF system control is integrated in a Front-End Controller (FEC) which connects it to the LIGHT control system. In this contribution we present the main features of the AVO LLRF system, its operation and performance.

An accelerator-based boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has been studied intensively in recent years as one of the new cancer therapies after many clinical research with nuclear reactors. In the iBNCT project, the accelerator configuration consists of an RFQ and a DTL which have proven achievements in J-PARC. Meanwhile, a high duty factor is required to have a sufficient thermal neutron flux needed by BNCT treatments. After a failure of the klystron power supply occurred in Feb. 2019, beam operation was resumed in May 2020. To date, an average current of about 2 mA with the beam repetition rate of 75 Hz has been achieved with stable operation. Irradiation tests with cells and mice are ongoing together with characteristic measurements of the neutron beam. In parallel with that, we have been gradually improving the accelerator cooling-water system for further stability. In this contribution, the present status and prospects of the iBNCT accelerator are reported.

Proton Therapy (PT) was first proposed in the 1940s. Application of this knowledge was largely led over the next fifty years by accelerator laboratories, but now also by commercial companies. Availability of PT is increasing but is limited by three factors: facility size, prompt/induced radiation, and treatment cost. Compact cyclotrons/synchro cyclotrons for single-room facilities have reduced space requirements. linacs can avoid high radiation levels. Yet treatment costs have remained stubbornly high, driven largely by maintenance and staffing costs over the typical 20-30 year facility lifetime. Current technology cannot simultaneously reduce these three factors. By using a long linac, the Alceli approach sacrifices size limitations, to gain massive improvements in treatment cost and radiation levels. Quadrupling the length of a linac results in a sixteen-fold reduction in RF power per cavity. Along with other innovations in our design, this leads to a modular warm linac with distributed solid-state RF amplification, easy and cheap to manufacture and maintain, requiring no water cooling, and a treatment cost of 1/10th of current facilities, making PT much more affordable.

Additive manufacturing ("AM" or "3D printing") has become a powerful tool for rapid prototyping and manufacturing of complex geometries. A 433 MHz IH-DTL cavity has been constructed to act as a proof of concept for additive manufacturing of linac components. In this case, the internal drift tube structure has been produced from 1.4404 stainless steel using AM. We present the concept of the cavity as well as first results of vacuum testing, materials testing and low level rf measurements. Vacuum levels sufficient for linac operation have been reached with the AM linac structure.

The demand for neutrons of various types for research is growing day by day worldwide. To meet the growing demand the Jülich High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) is in development. It is based on a high power linear proton accelerator with an end energy of 70 MeV and a proton beam current of 100 mA. The main part of the accelerator consists of about 45 CH-type cavities. As the current beam dynamic layout is still work in progress the number of cavities can change for the final design. For this beam dynamic layout the design of the CH-type cavities was optimized to handle the high accelerating gradient. The results of the performance of the CH-type cavities will be presented in this paper.

Various types of cavity structures are typically used in hadron linacs, depending on the energy range of the beam particle. This is especially the case in a normal-conducting linac, because the cavity’s acceleration efficiency varies with the velocity of the synchronous particle. For low-energy proton acceleration, while Alvarez drift-tube linacs (DTLs) are the most prevalent, TE-mode accelerating structures, which could also be called H-mode structures, are also widely used immediately after an initial radiofrequency quadrupole linac (RFQ). At present, the representative structures of TE modes are interdigital H-mode (IH) DTL and crossbar H-mode (CH) DTL, which are based on the TE11-mode pillbox cavity and TE21-mode pillbox cavity, respectively. In this presentation, acceleration efficiency of TE-mode structures including higher-order TE-modes such as TE31 and TE41 was comparatively reviewed with Alvarez DTL. This study shows that IH-DTL and CH-DTL have a larger shunt impedance than Alvarez DTL for proton acceleration below 10 MeV, and furthermore for the TEm1-mode structures, the rotational symmetry of the electric field improves with increasing angular index m.

The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has proposed an accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS) to efficiently reduce high-level radioactive waste generated at nuclear power plants. One of the challenging R&D aspects of ADS is the reliability of the accelerator. In preparation for the full-scale design of the CW proton linac for the JAEA-ADS, we are now prototyping a low-beta (around 0.2) single spoke cavity. Since there is no experience in Japan in manufacturing a superconducting spoke cavity, prototyping and performance testing of the cavity is essential to ensure the feasibility of the JAEA-ADS linac. In the Japanese fiscal year 2021, we have started welding cavity parts together. By preliminarily examining the electron beam welding conditions, each press-formed niobium part was joined with a smooth welding bead. The current status of the spoke cavity prototyping for the JAEA-ADS linac is presented.

The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Linac has been in operation for 52 years. the Linac delivers H− ions at 400 MeV and injects protons by charge exchange into the Booster synchrotron. Despite its age, the Linac is the most stable accelerator in the FNAL complex, reliably sending 22 mA in daily operations. We will discuss the status of the operation, beam studies, and plans.

Increasing energy of proton beam at LANSCE from 800 MeV to 3 GeV improves radiography resolution ~10 times. We propose accomplishing this energy boost with a compact cost-effective linac based on normal conducting high-gradient (HG) RF accelerating structures. Such an unusual proton linac is feasible for proton radiography (pRad), which operates with very short beam (and RF) pulses. For a compact pRad booster at LANSCE, we have developed a multi-stage design: a short L-band section to capture and compress the 800-MeV proton beam from the existing linac followed by the main HG linac based on S- and C-band cavities, and finally, by an L-band de-buncher*. Here we present details of development, including EM and thermal-stress analysis, of proton HG structures with distributed RF coupling for the pRad booster. A short test structure is designed specifically for measurements at the LANL C-band RF Test Stand.

CST Modeling of the LANSCE Coupled-Cavity Linac

The 800-MeV proton linac at LANSCE consists of a drift-tube linac, which brings the beam to 100 MeV, followed by 44 modules of a coupled-cavity linac (CCL). Each CCL module contains multiple tanks, and it is fed by a single 805-MHz klystron. CCL tanks are multi-cell blocks of identical re-entrant side-coupled cavities, which are followed by drifts with magnetic quadrupole doublets. Bridge couplers - special cavities displaced from the beam axis - electromagnetically couple CCL tanks over such drifts within a module. We have developed 3D CST models of CCL tanks. The models are used to calculate electromagnetic fields in the tanks. Beam dynamics is modelled in CST for bunch trains with realistic beam distributions using the calculated RF fields and quadrupole magnetic fields. Beam dynamics results are crosschecked with other multi-particle codes and applied to evaluate effects of CCL misalignments.

We are studying feasibility of a compact neutron source with a lithium-ion beam driver. The neutron source com-prises a laser ion source, an RFQ linac, and an IH-DTL. Recently, we demonstrated 35-mA 7Li3+ ion beam acceler-ation by an RFQ linac with a laser ion source. Based on the result, we performed beam dynamic design of an IH-DTL to accelerate the lithium-ion beam to the energy required for the neutron production, 14 MeV. To obtain a realistic field distribution, we made a rough model of the IH-DTL cavity with Microwave studio. It was confirmed with GPT 3D beam simulation that 1.7-m and 200-kW IH-DTL with two triplets can accelerate 30-mA 7Li3+ beam.

Several RF Superconductive LINAC projects are underway in different laboratories around the world, with various objectives such as research in physics, irradiation tests, production of radioisotopes for medical purposes. Superconducting operation of the accelerating cavities requires them to be maintained at cryogenic temperatures (2K - 4K) by the use of cryogenic fluids. This requires a complete cryogenic control system, including sensors, actuators, local controllers and PLCs. We describe the process by which the preliminary design of the cryogenic control system for the accelerator’s cryomodules and valve boxes may be built. It starts with the functional and performance requirements of the system, followed by the definition of use cases and the study of the necessary cryogenic instrumentation. This leads to a preliminary design of the architecture of the cryogenic control system using Siemens hardware, as well as cryogenic sequences describing standard phases of operation of the LINAC. We also discuss how to take advantage of the modularity of cryomodules for control system implementation and some recent developments in PLC simulation.

A new superconducting (SC) continuous wave (CW) linac, providing high efficient heavy ion acceleration above the coulomb barrier, is going to be built at GSI to fulfill the upcoming demands in the research field of super heavy element (SHE) synthesis. The so called HELIAC (HElmholtz LInear ACcelerator) delivers ion beams in the energy range of 3.5 MeV/u and 7.3 MeV/u with a mass to charge ratio (A/z) of up to 6. Superconducting multi-gap crossbar-H-mode (CH) cavities with a resonance frequency of 217 MHz are used for beam acceleration. In addition, SC single spoke buncher cavities should ensure longitudinal beam matching to the corresponding CH sections. Therefore, the first 217 MHz single spoke cavity with beta 0.07 has been developed at HIM/GSI and built at an industrial partner. In this paper the design of the cavity and first RF measurements during manufacturing are presented.

The conservation of quality factor under relativistic motion is applied to the superconducting cavity as well as the heartbeat of mammal. The quality factor of the superconducting cavity is conserved under relativistic motion. The frequency of the cavity decreases and the decay time increases as the velocity and acceleration are increased. The quality factor of the superconducting cavity is comparable with the total heartbeat of the mammal. The quality factor for the heartbeat of the mammal representing the total number of heartbeat is also conserved under relativistic motion. Therefore, the heart rate is inversely proportional to the life expectancy under relativistic motion.

The Accelerator Science and Technology Centre (ASTeC) is responsible for delivering 88 High Beta (HB) cavities as part of the European Spallation Source (ESS) facility in Sweden. The bulk Niobium Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities operate at 704 MHz. They have been fabricated in industry and are currently being tested at Daresbury Laboratory and Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY). They will then be delivered to Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA) Saclay, France for integration into cryomodules. To date 50 cavities have been conditioned and evaluated and 36 cavities have been delivered to CEA. This paper discusses the experiences and testing of the cavities performed to date at both sites
