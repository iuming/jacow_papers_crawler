A beam profiler called UniBEaM is based on passing 200 micron cerium-doped optical fibers through a charged particle beam and measuring the scintillation light. In order to characterize UniBEaM over its entire kinetic energy range: keV to GeV; current range: pA to mA; and particle type range: light ions to heavy ions, and electrons, an Early Adopter Programme (EAP) was established to test UniBEaM's performance. EAPs: Australia National University (ANU) and Michigan Ion Beam La-boratory (MIBL) report on their use of UniBEaM at their facilities.

A new generation of beam wire scanner (BWS), for transversal beam profile monitoring, is under development on the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade project at CERN. Two pre-series prototypes have been built and installed in the Super Proton Synchrotron and Proton Synchrotron Booster, to assess the performance of the upgraded BWS concept. This contribution shows the outcome of the measurement campaigns carried out on the first BWS prototypes, both in the laboratory and with proton beams. An evaluation of a high dynamic range acquisition system for the measurement of the secondary showers produced by the beam-wire interaction is also presented.

FAST is a facility at Fermilab that consists of a photoinjector, two superconducting capture cavities, one superconducting ILC-style cryomodule, and a small ring for studying non-linear, integrable beam optics called IOTA. This paper discusses the layout for the optical transport system that provides optical radiation to an externally located streak camera for bunch length measurements, and THz radiation to a Martin-Puplett interferometer, also for bunch length measurements. It accepts radiation from two synchrotron radiation ports in a chicane bunch compressor and a diffraction/transition radiation screen downstream of the compressor. It also has the potential to access a transition radiation screen after the spectrometer magnet for measurements of energy-time correlations. Initial results from both the streak camera and Martin-Puplett will be presented.

The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) Facility will attempt to demonstrate novel techniques for high current accelerators. An electron beam of 150 MeV/c momentum and a proton beam of 70 MeV/c momentum will be used for a number of experiments, including nonlinear focusing integrable optics, space charge compensation, and optical stochastic cooling. The low energy proton beam will provide a space charge dominated regime with which to investigate Hamiltonian diffusion and chaos. A non-invasive beam instrumentation device is needed to study emittance evolution and halo formation without destroying the beam. A supersonic gas jet curtain can be injected perpendicular to the proton beam, which will preserve the integrity of the beam and provide a two-dimensional turn-by-turn profile measurement. Currently, IOTA and the gas jet monitor are being built and commissioned at Fermilab.

Measured IPM profiles can be significantly distorted due to displacement of residual ions or electrons by interaction with beam fields for high intensity or high energy beams. It is thus difficult to deduce the characteristics of the actual beam profile from the measurements. Neural network with multilayer perceptron (MLP)architecture is applied to reconstruct the actual beam profile from the measurement data. The MLP is trained using the IPM simulation tool developed under the IPMSim collaboration. The first results are presented in this contribution.

Simulating the electron and ion tracking in Ionization Profile Monitors is an important tool for specifying and designing new monitors. It is also essential for understanding the effects related to the ionization process, guiding field non-uniformities and influence of the beam fields which may lead to a distortion of measured profiles. Existing simulation codes are often tuned to the specific needs of a laboratory, are not well documented and lack a practical user interface. This work presents a generic simulation tool which combines the features of existing codes in order to provide a common standard for IPM simulations. The modular structure of the application allows for exchanging the computational modules depending on the use case and makes it extensible to new use cases. By this means simulations of Beam Induced Fluorescence monitors based on supersonic gas jets have been realized. The application and all involved methods have been tested and benchmarked against existing results. The code is well documented and includes a graphical user interface. It is publicly available as a git repository and as a Python package.

A hollow electron lens is presently under study as a possible addition to the collimation system for the high luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC), while an electron lens system is also proposed for space charge compensation in the SIS-18 synchrotron for the high intensities at the future FAIR facility. For effective operation, a precise alignment is necessary between the high energy hadron beam and the low energy electron beam. In order to achieve this, a beam diagnostics setup based on an intersecting gas sheet and the observation of beam-induced fluorescence is under development. In this contribution we give an account of the design and performance of the optical detection system and report on recent preparatory experiments performed using a laboratory gas curtain Setup.

The incoherent depth-of-field due to the instantaneous opening angle of dipole SR emission can influence horizontal beam size measurements. In particular, for double-slit spatial interferometry, the opening angle introduces an intensity imbalance across the two slits that reduces interference contrast and therefore increases the apparent beam size. To investigate this effect, the instantaneous horizontal opening of the SR light must be known. Schwinger's theory gives the vertical opening angle and the qualitative theory of K.J. Kim gives an estimate for horizontal opening angle. An extension of Schwinger's theory to the horizontal plane by one of the authors leads to the same Bessel function distribution as the vertical plane using integration by parts. Neglecting the cubic phase term in the exponent, the expression agrees with Kim's diffraction theory. Using this result to correct for incoherent depth-of-field effects in double-slit measurements at the Australian Synchrotron, ATF and SPEAR3, the measured horizontal beam size is in good agreement with design values.

Analysis of Mie Scattering Noise of Objective Lens in Coronagraph for Halo Measurement

In beam halo measurements by means of a coronagraph viewing visible SR light, the theoretical image contrast is dominated by leakage of the diffracted fringe pattern from the Lyot stop. On other hand, the noise background in an actual coronagraph also contains light scattered from imperfections in the first objective lens. Most of this light is due to Mie-scattering from dig imperfections on the surface of objective which can reduce the image contrast to the 10-3 range for a lens with 60/40 scratch and dig figures. By introducing a high-quality objective lens into the system the theoretical value of 10-5-10-6 image contrast can be recovered for the Lyot coronagraph. In this paper, Mie-scattering due to dig imperfections is analyzed theoretically and results from measurements of the Mie scattering are presented.

For a high power hadron accelerator facilities such as spallation neutron source in J-PARC (JSNS) and material test facility for ADS called TEF-T, the beam profile monitor is essential. To diagnostic property of the proton beam introduced to the target, a multi-wire profile monitor (MWPM) was utilized, by which one -dimensional profile can be obtained. Since the nonlinear optics is employed to decrease peak current density at the target, two-dimensional information is required. To obtain a two-dimensional profile, we have been developing a new profile monitor based on the luminescence material. Since degradation of luminescence is concerned, which is observed at the SNS monitor system, an experiment was performed by using Al2O3 doped Cr material irradiated with Ar ion beam having the energy of 150 MeV at cyclotron facility in TIARA. During irradiation, degradation of the light yield of luminance was observed. For the development of the monitor less degradation of luminescence, other materials such as Y2O3 irradiation is planned.

During TPS operation, the stability of beam size measurement with the synchrotron radiation interferometer (SRI) does not compare well with the older SRI at the TLS. Ground vibrations appear to transmit to the SRI optics. This paper describes how to reduce the effect of vibration and improve the system stability to improve the stability of the SRI beam size measurement dramatically. To enhance the SRI sensitivity, an intensity imbalance method is incorporated and its results are discussed.

Beam profile determination at high intensity hadron accelerators implies the usage of non-invasive methods. The transverse profile of the beam is monitored via detecting the ionization products produced by the collision of proton with residual gas in the vacuum pipe. High voltage electrodes are used for producing guide electrical field and MCP for amplify the signal. The screen and CCD system are used for position detection. An ionization profile monitor is designed and manufactured. It has been installed on the ADS injector I. The signal intensity of ionization products matches the theory's expectation. Experiments result shows that it is a useful tool to measure the profile of proton beam.

The Spallation Neutron Source sends a 1 GeV proton beam to a mercury filled target to generate neutrons. The Target Imaging System (TIS) provides an image of this proton beam on the target to help center the beam and determine the peak density. Most of the TIS optical path is installed together with the proton beam window, which is replaced every two to three years. Using the next-to-be-installed proton beam window and a mock-up of the target and the beam pipe to the target, we have studied imperfections in the optical path to estimate their effect on the TIS measurements. In this paper, we show the effect of geometric distortion and light reflections, as well as the difference in the performance of two optical fiber bundles with different resolutions and contrasts.

Several wire-scanners - 19 out of 22 - are presently installed in SwissFEL, the hard X-ray FEL facility under commissioning at Paul Scherrer Institut (www.psi.ch). Thanks to a wire-fork designed to be equipped with two different pairs of scanning wires (5 um tungsten and 12.5 um Al(99):Si(1)), high resolution measurements of the beam profile - and emittance - and, alternatively, a minimally-invasive beam monitoring during FEL operations can be performed. First experimental results of the SwissFEL wire-scanner commissioning will be presented as well as a summary of the prototyping design and characterization.

The ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, begins with an injector line that accelerates an H− ion beam to 70 MeV. The beam then travels through a High Energy Drift Space (HEDS) before passing through an electron stripping foil upon injection into a proton synchrotron, which provides acceleration up to 800 MeV. During machine setup, beam profile measurements in the HEDS are taken using scanning wire monitors, which drive a single pair of measuring wires, one per plane, through the beam aperture using an analogue servo motor. Many of these monitors have been in operation since ISIS was commissioned in 1984 and as such are coming to the end of their operational lifetimes, meaning a new suite of monitors is required. A prototype monitor has been developed along with new electronics and a control system to test the operation of a new drive mechanism based around a stepper motor and resolver, providing increased precision and reliability. This paper discusses the development of a new multi-wire monitor design, and the associated upgrade to the electronics and control system.

The superconducting CW linac presently being commissioned at TRIUMF will accelerate up to 10mA of electrons to the energy of 30 - 50 MeV. Thus, beam powers up to 0.5 MW are eventually expected. To support high beam power operation modes, a Fast Wire Scanner (FWS) capable of velocities up to 3 m/s over a 70mm range was developed. A stepper motor driven helical cam allows for a long stroke enabling two orthogonal wires to scan both axes in one scan. The radiation produced when the wires pass through the beam is detected by a BGO scintillator coupled to a photomultiplier (PMT), while wire position is measured with a precision linear potentiometer. A Struck SIS3302 VME transient recorder, synchronized to the beam pulses, simultaneously captures both signals to produce the beam profiles in the EPICS control system. The design of the FWS and initial beam measurements will be presented.

The correlations between vertical and longitudinal planes at the Radio Frequency Deflector (RFD) entrance can be introduced by misalignments of accelerating sections or quadrupoles upstream of the RFD. These correlations are undesired effects and they can affect the RFD based bunch length measurements in high-brightness electron LINAC. In this paper, an RFD based measurement technique for vertical and longitudinal planes is proposed. The basic idea is to obtain information about the correlations between vertical and longitudinal planes from vertical spot size measurements varying the RFD phase, because they add contributions on this quantity. In particular, considering a small RFD phase range centred in 0 or π rad, the correlations between the particle longitudinal positions and the vertical plane are constant with the deflecting voltage phase, on the contrary, the correlations between the particle energies and the vertical plane vary linearly with the deflecting voltage phase. The simulations are carried out by means of ELEctron Generation ANd Tracking (ELEGANT) code in the case of the Gamma Beam System (GBS) at the Extreme Light Infrastructure-Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP).

Double-silt synchrotron radiation interferometer is a common and useful tool to measure transverse beam size around the world. In order to satisfy the requirement of high speed measurement and improve the accuracy of BSM (beam size monitor), multi-silt interferometers have been designed and tested at SSRF. Multi-silt mask pattern has characteristics of high flux throughput and high SNR of the interferogram, which is very useful at high-speed beam size measurement. This technique has a relative complex algorithm to deconvolve the result image and figure out the beam size. Principle of the multi-silt SR interferometer, mask design and experiment will be present detailed in this paper.
