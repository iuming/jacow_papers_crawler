Stable operation of a modern high current storage rings requires attention to the sources of coupling impedance. Methods ranging from EM modeling to bench and beam measurements are routinely used to characterize accelerator components. The beam-based method presented here complements existing approaches, and allows precise measurements and identification of narrowband resonances in structures such as RF cavities or in-vacuum undulators. We combine the well-established approach of characterizing eigenvalues of coupled-bunch instabilities with modern high-throughput data acquisition tools and automatic analysis methods. By sequentially exciting low-amplitude oscillation of individual modes below the instability threshold and observing open-loop damping, we automatically map the eigenvalues of all even-fill eigenmodes. Repeating the measurements while changing operating conditions, such as cavity temperatures or undulator gaps, provides a detailed mapping of the impedance source. These measurements are used to extract impedance parameters as well as to optimize accelerator settings. Experimental results from the Advanced Photon Source and other accelerators illustrate the technique.

Characterization of a vacuum chamber impedance is necessary to estimate stability conditions of a particle beam motion, to find a limit of the beam intensity and characteristic times of single-bunch and multi-bunch instabilities. For a new accelerator project, minimization of the impedance is now the mandatory requirement for the vacuum chamber design. For an accelerator in operation, the impedance can be measured experimentally using various beam-based techniques. The beam-impedance interaction manifests itself in measurable beam parameters, such as betatron tunes, closed orbit, growth rates of instabilities, bunch length and synchronous phase. The beam-based techniques developed for measurement of the longitudinal and transverse impedance are discussed, including theoretical basics and experimental results.

FACET-II, the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests II, is a new accelerator R&D test facility to be constructed at SLAC. It will provide high-energy, high-density electron and positron beams to advance the development of beam driven plasma wakefield acceleration and support a broad range of experiments. The FACET-II beams are expected to have 10 GeV energy, contain 2 nC of charge, have a transverse normalized emittance of 7 microns, be compressed to about 1 micron long and focused to about 6 micron wide at the interaction point. The nominal peak current is 20 kA and is expected to fluctuate up to 200 kA. Most experiments desire complete knowledge of the incoming beam parameters on a pulse-to-pulse basis. However, the extreme beam densities and strong fields of the beam current will destroy any diagnostics intercepting the beam in a single shot and impose unique challenges for beam diagnostics. Moreover, non-intercepting diagnostics are desirable to provide feedback for machine setup and characterization. We need to look beyond conventional diagnostics to seek new solutions for measurements of the high charge, small beam size, short bunch length, and low emittance.
