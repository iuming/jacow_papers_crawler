Electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion sources are widely used in heavy ion accelerators for their advantages in producing high quality intense beams of highly charged ions. However, it exists challenges in the design of the Q/A selection systems for mixed high intensity ion beams to reach sufficient Q/A resolution while controlling the beam emittance growth. Moreover, as the emittance of beam from ECR ion sources is coupled, the matching of phase space to post accelerator, for a wide range of ion beam species with different intensities, should be carefully studied. In this paper, the simulation and experimental results of the Q/A selection system at the LECR4 platform are shown. The formation of hollow cross section heavy ion beam at the end of the Q/A selector is revealed. A reasonable interpretation has been proposed, a modified design of the Q/A selection system has been committed for HIRFL-SSC linac injector. The features of the new design including beam simulations and experiment results are also presented.

As a part of the HL-LHC upgrade significant R&D has taken place on compact superconducting crab cavities. Their implementation in high energy proton collider will be the first of its kind including the initial phase of technology validation in the SPS. This paper will primarily focus on the recent progress on the cavity and cryomodule developments and some of the main challenges. A few aspects related to the impact of crab cavities on the LHC beams are also addressed.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) will apply a fast beam scanning system to redistribute the proton beam transversely across the spallation target surface. The system operates at sweep frequencies of tens of kHz and efficiently evens out the time-averaged beam intensity within a nominal beam footprint, thus reducing the level of beam-induced material damage. A modular design approach divides the raster action in each direction across 4 independent magnet-supply systems to distribute the magnetic load, ease the peak output power per modulator, and in general reduce the impact of single points of failure. The state of the magnet design and power supply topology will be discussed.
