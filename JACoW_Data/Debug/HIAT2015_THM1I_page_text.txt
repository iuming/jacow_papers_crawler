As an indispensible device to produce intense highly charged ion beams, ECR ion source has evolved into the 4th generation. Knowledge from the development of the 3rd generation ECR ion sources could provide valuable reference for the next generation machine design and fabrication, however there are still many challenges with regards to several key technical issues and physics approaches. This paper will review what we have learned from the state of the art ECR ion sources, and then critical aspects concerning the higher performance next generation ECR ion sources development will be discussed.
