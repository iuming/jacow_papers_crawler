The output from leading-edge scientific simulations running on parallel supercomputers is so voluminous and complex that advanced visualization techniques are necessary to interpret the calculated results. Even though visualization technology has progressed significantly in recent years, we are barely capable of exploiting petascale data to its full extent, and exascale datasets are on the horizon. In this talk, I will present plausible approaches to data visualization and analysis problems often found in computational studies in accelerator physics and plasma physics.
