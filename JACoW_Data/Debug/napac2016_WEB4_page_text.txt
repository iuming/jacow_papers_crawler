Protection against the effects of a magnet quench is a crucial challenge for superconducting accelerators. In order to avoid overheating and damage, the energy stored in the quenching magnets needs to be quickly and uniformly distributed in the winding pack while maintaining a safe voltage distribution among components. The recently-developed Coupling-Loss-Induced Quench (CLIQ) system is an advantageous alternative to traditional quench protection systems based on quench heaters. CLIQ utilizes inter-filament coupling loss as an effective intra-wire heat deposition mechanism, which by principle is faster than thermal diffusion. Being based on simple and robust electrical components, CLIQ reduces the risk of failure and electrical breakdown. However, its integration in an accelerator magnet circuit requires careful consideration of several interdependent systems, including powering, electrical distribution and cryogenics. We review the principles of the CLIQ method, the validation tests carried out in accelerator magnets so far, its planned use in the high luminosity LHC, and the general outlook for application to future accelerators.

This paper describes a new beam-based method of cavity energy gain calibration based on varying the cavity phase. This method can be fully automated and allows a larger range of momentum excursions during measurement than previous calibration approaches. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a calibration precision of 2-3% could be realistically achieved using this method. During the commissioning of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility's (CEBAF) energy upgrade to 12 GeV, 876 measurements were performed on 375 of the 400 linac cavities in Fall 2015 and applied December 2015. Linac optics appears to be closer to design as a result. The resulting ensemble proved to be 2% over the value needed to get the desired energy in the arcs. Continued offline analysis of the data has allowed for error analysis and better understanding of the process.

A high power solid-state RF amplifier system has been developed and tested. The modular scalable architecture of the system allows to build megawatt-range compact, robust, cost effective RF amplifiers/generators with high plug efficiency. Using a special designed technology of RF power on-board combination for several LDMOS transistors and very compact high power RF combiners, the amplifier with output power of 100 kW and duty cycle of 5% has been fit into a single 19" cabinet. The system has been tested at the output power up to 104 kW with 3.5 ms pulses. The overview of the technologies, the design of the machine, and its main subsystems is given in this talk. The test results and the market perspectives are also presented.
