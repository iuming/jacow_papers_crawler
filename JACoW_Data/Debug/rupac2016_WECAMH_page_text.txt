In this article some problems of optimizing the output beam of particles from the circular accelerator are discussed. In particular, we consider some problems of matching the booster, Nuclotron and collider in the NICA project. The main attention is paid to the matching of the extraction beam systems. The proposed approach allows providing qualitative and quantitative analysis of the impact of various factors of the corresponding control systems.

The paper presents the new mechanism are explained the increase in lifetime, intensity and compression positron cloud by using a rotating electric field (Rotating Wall) and other control parameters in the Penning-Malmberg-Surko Trap at the LEPTA Facility*,**. The application of the mechanism in a traps of another type, as well as the prospects for the use of bunches of positrons of positron annihilation spectroscopy. The theoretical basis and experimental results of are presented.

Present report refers to the problem of the study of charged particle dynamics in the Penning-Malmberg-Surko trap. Various models of particle dynamics describing the magnetron and cyclotron motions are considered. Representation of the solutions in the form of a series is used for the magnetron motion. The problems of the stability of the magnetron motion are investigated.

The 2 MeV electron cooling system at COSY-Jülich started operation in 2013. The cooling process was observed in the wide energy range of the electron beam from 100 keV to 1.26 MeV. Vertical, horizontal and longitudinal cooling was obtained with bunched and coasting proton beam. This report deals with electron cooling experiments at COSY with proton beam at energy 1.66 and 2.3 GeV. The proton beam was cooled at different regimes: RF on and off, barrier bucket RF, and cluster target on and off.

Design problem of APF accelerator for ensurance enough high quality of output beam is considered. As we know, this problem is not easy because we have to achieve stability of longitudinal and transversal motions simultaneously. One of the first significant results in this subject were obtained by V. V. Kushin. In this work the problems of optimizations of intense ion beam are considered. The optimazation approaches for some beam characteristics improving (acceleration and transmission rates) are considered. Obtained results are confirmed by particle in cell simulations.
