The ESS linac is currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, and once completed it will deliver an unprecedented 5 MW of average power. The ion source and LEBT commissioning starts in 2018 and will continue with the RFQ, MEBT and the first DTL tank next year and up to the end of the fourth DTL tank in 2020. This paper will summarize the commissioning plans for the normal conducting linac with focus on the ion source and LEBT and application development for both commissioning and operation.

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is an accelerator-based science facility. CSNS is designed to accelerate proton beam pulses to 1.6 GeV kinetic energy, striking a solid metal target to produce spallation neutrons. CSNS has two major accelerator systems, a linear accelerator (80 MeV Linac) and a 1.6 GeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). The Beam commissioning of CSNS has been commissioned recently. Beam had been accelerated to 61 MeV at CSNS/Linac on April 24, 2017, and 1.6 GeV acceleration at CSNS/RCS was successfully accomplished on July 7, 2017 with the injection energy of 61 MeV. Beam had been accelerated to 80 MeV at CSNS/Linac on January 6, 2018, and 1.6 GeV acceleration at CSNS/RCS was successfully accomplished on January 18, 2018 with the injection energy of 80 MeV. The initial machine parameter tuning and various beam studies were completed. In this paper, the commissioning experiences are introduced.

As part of the Nova upgrades in 2012, the Recycler was repurposed as proton stacker for the Main Injector with the aim to deliver 700 kW. Since January 2017, this design power has been run routinely. The steps taken to commission the Recycler and run at 700 kW operationally will be discussed as well as plans for future running.
