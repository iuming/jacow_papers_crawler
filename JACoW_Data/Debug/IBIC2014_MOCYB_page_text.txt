Non-Destructive Vertical Halo Monitor on the ESRF’s 6GeV Electron Beam

The population density along the electron’s beam vertical profile at far distance from the central core (i.e. the far-away tails or “halo”) is now quantitatively measurable by the use of bending magnet X-rays. An available beamport is equipped with two specifically adapted absorbers, an Aluminium UHV window, an X-ray light blocker, an X-ray imager, and a few motorizations. The simple and inexpensive set-up (much resembling that of an X-ray pinhole camera system for emittance measurements in Light Sources, but much shorter in length) allows the recording of images of the electron density profile over the 0.5 to 6mm distance range from the core. Results, obtained under various manipulations on the electron beam to vary either Touchek or residual Gas scattering and thereby the Halo levels, will be presented, to fully demonstrate that this Halo monitor is exploring those realms of the beam where other diagnostics can not reach .

A compact energy-recovery linac (cERL) was constructed at KEK as a test accelerator for the ERL-based light source. Standard beam monitors such as beam position monitors (BPMs), screen monitors (SCMs), and beam loss monitors (BLMs) have been developed for the cERL and used in its commissioning. For the main BPMs, we adopted the stripline type, the time response of which is improved by using a glass-sealed feedthrough. The SCMs are equipped with two types of screens and an RF shield for wake-field suppression. Optical fibers with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), covering the entire cERL circumference, are used as the BLM. CsI scintillators with large-cathode PMTs are also prepared for detecting local beam loss. The design and some initial commissioning results of these standard monitors are described in this paper.

This paper describes a longitudinal H− beam profile scanner that utilizes laser light to detach convoy electrons and an MCP to collect and measure these electrons. The scanner is located in MEBT with H− energy of 2.5MeV and an RF frequency 402.5MHz. The picosecond pulsed laser runs at 80.5MHz in sync with the accelerator RF. The laser beam is delivered to the beam line through a 30m optical fiber. The pulse width after the fiber transmission measures about 10ps. Scanning the laser phase effectively allows measurements to move along ion bunch longitudinal position. We are able to reliably measure production beam bunch length with this method. The biggest problem we have encountered is background signal from electrons being stripped by vacuum. Several techniques of signal detection are discussed.

Robert E. (Bob) Shafer, a leader in the field of beam instrumentation, died on November 11, 2012. His distinguished career spanned decades at major U.S. facilities, including Fermi National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory. He taught a course on Beam Position Monitoring at the U.S. Particle Accelerator School. His text for that course is a seminal paper on the subject. Bob was one of the founding members of the Beam Instrumentation Workshop, a predecessor of IBIC.
