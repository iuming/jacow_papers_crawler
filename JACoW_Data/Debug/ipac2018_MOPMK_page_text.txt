As part of the FCC study, the design of the High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) is addressed. A proposed layout for the interaction region for the containing the radio frequency (RF) cavities and various beam instrumentation will be discussed. The higher energy requires more RF cavities, which strongly restricts the space available for optics and instrumentation. Another challenge arises because the beam rigidity increases whilst the LHC geometry has to be conserved. To this end, next generation dipoles have to be used in order to achieve sufficient beam to beam separation. A design that provides enough beam stay clear (BSC) in all the magnets will be presented. The design introduces an additional quadrupole on either side of the RF region to be used for phase advance adjustments that can increase the dynamic aperture.

One possible future hadron collider design investigated in the framework of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study is the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC). Using the 16 T dipoles developed for the FCC-hh the center of mass energy of the LHC is set to increase to 27 TeV. To achieve this set energy goal, a new optics design is required, taking into account the constraint from the LHC tunnel geometry. In this paper, two different lattices for the HE-LHC are presented. Initial considerations take into account the physical aperture at the proposed injection energy as well as the energy reach of these lattices. The dynamic aperture at the injection energies is determined using latest evaluations of the field quality of the main dipoles.

The international Future Circular Collider (FCC) study comprises the development of a new scientific structure in a tunnel of 100 km. This will allow the installation of a proton collider with a centre of mass energy of 100 TeV, called FCC-hh. An alternative design of the final focus triplet for the FCC-hh has been developed in parallel to the alternative one, and adapted to the constraint of a free length (L*) of 40 m. We discuss in this paper the energy deposition issues as well as the luminosity evolution for two different optics choices: round and flat beams.

The High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) project is studying the feasibility of a new proton-proton collider with a beam energy of 13.5 TeV. The nominal optics features a β* of 0.25 m and crab-cavities. Here we present a flat-beam optics that can be used with a non-zero crossing angle, in the absence of crab cavities. This is followed by energy deposition studies for the superconducting quadrupoles and dipole separators. The total dose in these magnets coming from the collision debris is evaluated.

The High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) is one option for a next generation hadron collider explored in the FCC-hh program. The core concept of the HE-LHC is to install FCC-hh technology magnets in the LHC tunnel. The higher beam rigidity and the increased radiation debris, however, impose severe challenges on the design of the triplet for the low beta insertions. In order to achieve 25 cm β* optics and survive a lifetime integrated luminosity of 10 ab-1 a new longer triplet was designed that provides sufficient shielding and enough beam stay clear. This triplet has been designed using complimentary radiation studies to optimise the shielding that will also be presented. The optics for the rest of the interaction region had to be adjusted in order to host this more rigid beam and longer triplet whilst leaving enough room for crab cavities. Moreover, the effects non-linear errors in this triplet have on the dynamic aperture will be outlined.

The sizes of the beta functions in the final focus triplet of a synchrotron collider have a great impact on the chromaticity and dynamic aperture of the machine. These beta functions are proportional to the square of the length of the final drift so it is desirable to keep it as short as possible whilst leaving enough room for the experiment. In the latest design of the FCC-hh this drift was reduced from 45 m to 40 m. In the following an alternative final focus for this new design will be presented. The effects this change has on the interaction region will examined and discussed.

Crab crossing scheme is essential collision scheme to achieve high luminosity for the future electron-ion collider (EIC). The bunch length effect of the ion beam cannot be ignored even when cooling is present compared with the wavelength of the crab cavity, therefore, the nonlinear dependence of the crabbing kick may present a challenge to the beam dynamics of the ion beam, hence an impact to the luminosity lifetime. In this paper, we present the result of numerical beam dynamics studies of the crab crossing scheme. The result indicates that there is a special coupling resonance in the nonlinear relation of the crab crossing scheme of the EIC, which dominates the luminosity degradation. And we will discuss the possible remedies for such resonance.

VEPP-5 Injection Complex (IC) is designed to supply BINP RAS colliders with high energy electron and positron beams. Recently constructed K-500 beam transfer line connects IC to both VEPP-4M and VEPP-2000 colliders. IC two collider operation was successfully performed in 2016. Nowadays, research on improvement of IC productivity is carried out, in particular 10.94 MHz RF cavity instead of 700 MHz one was installed and a new electron gun installation is expected to be this summer. Moreover, longitudinal beam profile measurements in IC damping ring using a streak-camera were carried out. Operation experience of IC and results of longitudinal beam profile measurements are reported.

In the frame of the electron-positron collider FCC-ee, an estimation of the electron cloud build up in the machine will be discussed in this paper. A preliminary evaluation of the heat load in the arc components and interaction region magnets will be presented, together with possible mitigation strategies.

In this work, transverse and longitudinal resistive-wall impedances for beam pipes in the experiment, injection, extraction and RF systems insertion regions of the Future Hadron-Hadron Collider (FCC-hh) are computed based on contributions from different given cross sections of the surrounding (elliptical) chamber parts along the beam path, their temperature-dependent conductivities, and optical functions. An emphasis is placed on the behaviour of transverse impedance in the main experimental regions (A and G), where maximum beta values of 104 to 105 m occur in dependence of the operation mode respectively lattice configuration. Main contributions to the transverse and longitudinal impedance budget are identified, and possibilities of reducing them are discussed.

Jefferson Lab is in the process of designing an electron-ion collider with unprecedented luminosity at a 65 GeV center-of-mass energy. This luminosity relies on ion cooling in both the booster and the storage ring of the accelerator complex. The cooling in the booster will use a conventional DC cooler similar to the one at COSY. The high-energy storage ring, operating at a momentum of up to 100 GeV/nucleon, requires novel use of bunched-beam cooling. We will present a new design for a Circulator Cooler Ring for bunched-beam electron cooling. This requires the generation and transport of very high-charge magnetized bunches, acceleration of the bunches in an energy recovery linac, and transfer of these bunches to a circulating ring that passes the bunches 11 times through the proton or ion beam inside cooling solenoids. This design requires the suppression of the effects of space charge and coherent synchrotron radiation using shielding and RF compensation.

Crab crossing is an integral part of the Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) design to achieve high luminosity while meeting the detection and physics pro-gram requirements. The crab crossing scheme provides a head-on beam-beam collision for beams with a nonzero crossing angle. Simulations of crabbing dynamics currently do not include beam-beam effects. We describe a framework for accurate simulation of beam-beam effects on crabbing dynamics by applying a numerical calculation of the Bassetti-Erskine analytic solution to symplectic particle tracking codes. The numerical calculation is benchmarked against the analytic solution by calculating the luminosity reduction for several colliding beam scenarios. Benchmarking results show good agreement be-tween the numerical calculation and analytic solution, paving the way for implementation of the beam-beam kick to Elegant tracking simulations.

Non-uniform bunch fill patterns in storage rings, driven by the need to provide gaps for beam aborting and ion clearing cause a large beam loading change in the RF cavities. The induced turn-periodic transient in the cavity voltage modulates longitudinal beam properties along the train, such as synchronous position and bunch length. In the EIC design, due to the asymmetric bunch train structure between the electron and the ion beam, such modulation results in shifting collision point and leads to reduced luminosity. We have carried out the beam based experiments at BEPC-II and ALS using bunch-by-bunch diagnostic capabilities of the coupled-bunch feedback systems to study this transient effect. A modulated bunch filling pattern with higher charge density around the gap has been demonstrated to be effective in partially compensating this transient modulation. Details of the experimental setups and the data analysis will be presented to this conference.
