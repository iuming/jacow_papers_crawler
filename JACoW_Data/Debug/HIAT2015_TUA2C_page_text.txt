The GANIL SPIRAL 2 Project is based on the construction of a superconducting ion CW LINAC (up to 5 mA - 40 MeV deuteron and 33 MeV proton beams, up to 1 mA - 14.5 MeV/u heavy ion beams) with two experimental areas named S3 ('Super Separator Spectrometer' for very heavy and super heavy element production) and NFS ('Neutron For Science'), The building studies as well as the accelerator and experimental equipment integration started in 2009. The ground breaking started at the end of 2010. The integration task of the different equipments into the buildings is managed by a trade-oriented integration unit gathering the accelerator integration team, the building prime contractor and a dedicated contracting assistant. All work packages are synthesized at the same time using 3D models. 3D tools are used to carry out integration, synthesis, process connections and the preparation of the future assembly. Since 2014, the buildings and process connections are received and the accelerator installation is well advanced. This contribution will describe these 3D tools, the building construction, the process connection status and our experience feedback.

At LNL INFN is under construction a Rare Isotope Facility called "Selective Production of Exotic Species" (SPES) based on a 35-70 MeV proton cyclotron, able to deliver two beams with a total current up to 0.75 mA, an ISOL fission target station and an existing ALPI superconducting accelerator as a post accelerator (up to 10 MeV/u for A/q=7). After an overview of the whole facility, the paper will cover notably: the high-resolution mass separator, the CW RFQ (80 MHz, 727 keV/u, internal bunching), the low energy transfer line and the post accelerator. The problems that have been solved during the design phase are partly common to all RIB facilities, like the necessity to have an high selectivity and high transmission for a beam of a very low intensity, plus the specific challenges related to the use of ALPI (with a reduced longitudinal acceptance) and related to the specific lay out. At present the design phase has been finalized, and the procurement procedure for the charge breeder, the transfer lines and the RFQ are in an advanced state.

The SPES project at Laboratori di Legnaro of INFN (Italy) is concentrating on the production of neutron-rich radioactive nuclei by the Uranium fission at a rate of 1013 fission/s. The emphasis to neutron-rich isotopes is justified by the fact that this vast territory has been little explored in the last years. The Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) will be produced by ISOL technique using the 40 MeV proton-induced fission on a Direct Target of UCx. The most critical element of the SPES project is the Multi-Foil Direct Target. Up to day the proposed target represents an innovation in term of capability to sustain the primary beam power of about 8kW. The reaction products are extracted from the target by thermal process, ionized and injected into the re-accelerator stage. During the talk will be presented the recent developments on the fabrication, characterization, and on-line testing of carbide targets. In addition, developments related to the ion-source activities using the surface, plasma and laser ion sources technique it will be reported. Finally, will be shown the experimental test results on target remote handling.
