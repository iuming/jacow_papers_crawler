Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs) based on optical fibres have been under development for many years as an alternative solution to commonly used methods, such as ionisation chambers. Optical BLMs (oBLMs) maintain standard BLM functionality but can also be used for machine and personal protection. They can be implemented over the entire beam line providing excellent position and time resolution, while being insensitive to radiation induced damage. This contribution describes how oBLMs can also assist in the characterisation of RF cavities during commissioning and operation. It first presents the design principle of highly compact monitors and the underpinning theory for particle loss detection, before discussing data obtained in experimental tests at the electron accelerator CLARA. It then shows how a 4-channel oBLM can be applied for efficient cavity monitoring. Finally, the results are put into a broader context underlying the application potential in accelerators and light sources.

The strategy for machine protection and quench prevention of the super-conducting elements of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is heavily reliant on its beam loss monitoring system. This is one of the most complex and large-scale beam instrumentation systems deployed anywhere in the world. In order to augment the system's dependability and verify the correct connection of each of the approximately 4000 detectors distributed around the 27 km LHC ring to its assigned channel in the electronic system, a mobile irradiation instrument has been designed and built. This instrument can be easily and safely transported along the LHC tunnel and imitate a localised beam loss at each BLM detector. This paper describes the concept of the instrument, its engineering design, the safety measures included and recent upgrades. Possible future improvements of the device are also considered.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) to be under construction in Lund, Sweden, will provide a highest average intensity beam from a 5 MW superconducting proton linear accelerator to produce spallation neutrons. A serious problem for high current accelerators is the high density of the beam, which is able to destroy the equipment, to make a quench of super conductive magnets. Loss of even a small fraction of this intense beam would result in high radiation and destruction of the equipment. The Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) system must be sensitive to different level of losses in different accelerator locations. The main ESS beam loss detector type is ionization chamber (icBLM). The detector is originally designed for CERN LHC and 4250 monitors were produced in 2006-2008, now widely used in almost all accelerators at CERN, in IHEP (Protvino, Russia). In 2014-2017 a new production of 830 icBLM was performed to replenish spares for LHC and to make series for ESS, GSI. The requirements, design, testing and layout for ESS accelerator are presented

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is available to users since March 2016. A beam trip diagnostic system is used as an important tool to analyze the cause of beam trip events since the beginning of 2017. The main function of the system is to record relevant signals when the stored beam is suddenly lost. In the past few months, some useful features have been added, such as capturing trigger signals for pulsers, power line voltage, and auto generated beam trip reports. A detailed system architecture, implementation and progress will be summarized in this report.

In the J-PARC RCS, a large fraction of our effort has been concentrated on reducing and managing beam losses to achieve 1MW high power proton beam operation. Standard beam loss monitor (BLM), which is installed outside of the magnet in every cell of beam optics and detect the beam loss at wide area in each cell, is insufficient to investigate finer beam loss mechanism in the ring. Thus we developed new scintillation type BLM to detect the beam loss at spot area on the vacuum chamber inside the magnet. The new BLM has separating structure a photomultiplier (PMT) from a plastic scintillator and connecting with optical fibres. Because small plastic scintillator is installed on the vacuum chamber directly, it has capability to have high sensitivity for localized spot area beam loss. On the other hand, the PMT can precisely be operated without being affected by magnetic field by keeping the PMT from the magnet. In this presentation, we report the detail of the performance of the new BLM.

A heavy ion accelerator called RAON is being constructed in Korea to produce various rare isotopes for the Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP). This facility is designed to use both In-flight Fragment (IF) and Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) techniques in order to provide a wide variety of RI beams for nuclear physics experiment. One of the biggest challenges in operating such a high beam power facility (~400 kW) is to monitor beam loss accurately and to execute the machine protection system reasonably quickly whenever necessary. In this work, we report the conceptual design of the RAON beam loss monitoring system together with the initial test results of the prototype detectors. Monte Carlo simulations using MCNPX code have been performed to generate radiation dose maps for 1 W/m losses of proton, Oxygen, and Uranium beams. The required machine protection time has been estimated from the yield time of the stainless steel beam line components including the beam grazing angle dependence. Types of the detectors have been determined based on the radiation levels of the gammas and neutrons, and the minimum sensitivity and response time requirements.
