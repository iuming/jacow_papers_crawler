The hard X-ray free electron laser at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL-XFEL) successfully completed the commissioning of SASE and started user operation in late 2016. Since then, the facility has demonstrated excellent stability with very small timing jitter of about 20 fs, and commissioned the self-seeding system over a wide range of photon energies, etc. The talk will provide an overview of the last three years at the PAL-XFEL, including some detailed experimental results, as well as future prospects for the laboratory.

Stable and Brilliant Self-Seeded XFEL at SACLA

A new self-seeding experiment on the hard x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) is in progress at the XFEL facility, SACLA. Self-seeding of a hard x-ray FEL has been demonstrated at SLAC and SACLA using a transmission type scheme with a single crystal. However, the gain of the spectral brightness is limited in the transmission type scheme. Therefore, a reflection type self-seeding system with a pair of channel-cut crystals has been developed at SACLA and self-seeding experiments have been performed. Adoption of a channel-cut crystal is critically important to minimize the delay of the seed laser from the electron bunch. Preliminary results showed much higher spectral brightness and much better stability than the transmission scheme. This talk presents the design of the reflection type scheme and the performance of the self- seeded XFEL obtained at SACLA.

The MAX IV facility in Lund, Sweden, consists of three electron accelerators and their respective synchrotron radiation beamlines: a 3 GeV ring, which is the first implementation worldwide of a multi-bend achromat lattice, a 1.5 GeV ring optimized for soft X-Rays and UV radiation production and a 3 GeV linear accelerator that acts as a full-energy injector into both rings and provides electron pulses as short as 100 fs that produce X-rays by spontaneous emission in the undulators of the short-pulse facility (SPF). In this paper, we review the latest achieved accelerator performance and operational results.
