Schottky signal analysis is a non-invasive beam measurement method based on the observation of the electromagnetic properties of individual beam particles. It allows the determination of important parameters such as momentum spread, synchrotron tune, coherent and incoherent betatron tune, and chromaticity for coasting and bunched beams at hadron synchrotrons. It is a popular diagnostic at low energy ion storage rings as well as implemented for bunched beams in high energy synchrotrons such as LHC. In this tutorial, the underlying physics for the observables will be described together with the basic mathematics. Recent results for high intensity beam will be discussed. The detector technology, based on capacitive pick-ups, traveling wave structures, or cavities is addressed, as well as the associated rf electronics to extract this weak, beam induced Schottky signal. Applications ranging from the daily operational usage up to dedicated machine physics investigations on a very wide range of beam parameters will be discussed.

The European Spallation Source, now under construction in Lund, Sweden, aims to be the world's most powerful pulsed neutron scattering facility. Driving the neutron source is a 5-MW superconducting proton linear accelerator operating at 4% beam duty factor and 14-Hz repetition rate. Nineteen partner institutions from across Europe are working with the Accelerator Division in Lund to design and construct the linac. The suite of beam instrumentation consists of over 20 unique system types delivered by over 20 partners and collaborators. Although the organizational complexity presents challenges, it also provides the vast capabilities required to achieve the technical goals. At this time, the beam instrumentation team is in transition, completing the design phase while scaling up to the deployment phase. Commissioning of the ion source has commenced in Catania, preparations for installation on the Lund site are ramping up, and basic R&D on target instrumentation continues. Beam commissioning results from the systems immediately following the ion source will be presented, along with technical highlights and status of the many remaining instrumentation systems.

SESAME Storage Ring is a 2.5 GeV Synchrotron Light Source in Allan, Jordan. The commissioning of the Storage Ring has been done in spring 2017. The storage ring is equipped with 64 BPMs whereas 48 connected to Libera-Brilliance+, three fluorescent screens, one FCT, one DCCT, four BLMs, two Bunch by Bunch kickers and one Synchrotron Radiation Monitor. This paper gives an over-view of the Diagnostics elements and our experience dur-ing the commissioning.
