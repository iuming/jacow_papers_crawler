Precise diagnostic instruments for coherent X-ray pulses will be presented. In SACLA XFEL beamline, a high-resolution single-shot spectrometer (*), a timing monitor between XFEL beams and optical laser pulses (**), etc. have been　developed and utilized for user experiments. The resolution of the spectrometer was confirmed to be 14 meV and a spectral spike of ~ 100 meV width was measured. The XFEL pulse duration was estimated to be 4.5 - 31 fs from this spectrometer depending on the bunch compression condition (*). The time jitter between an XFEL and an optical laser was appropriately measured to be ~ 100 fs STD by using the timing monitor (**). The design and performance of other beamline instruments will be also presented.
