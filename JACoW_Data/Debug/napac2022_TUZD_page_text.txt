The Future Circular electron-positron Collider (FCC-ee) is aimed at studying the Z and W bosons, the Higgs, and top quark with extremely high luminosity and good energy efficiency. Responding to a request from the 2020 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, in 2021 the CERN Council has launched the FCC Feasibility Study to examine the detailed implementation of such a collider. This FCC Feasibility Study will be completed by the end of 2025 and its results be presented to the next Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics expected in 2026/27.

The recently formed International Muon Collider Collaboration aims to complete the R&D and design work required to deliver a Conceptual Design Report for a multi-TeV muon collider facility within the next decade. An overview of the planned research program, identifying the most challenging R&D questions, a discussion of the design approach, and the potential of such a machine for high energy physics research will be presented.

With seven operational colliders in the world and two under construction, the international particle physics community not only actively explores options for the next facilities for detailed studies of the Higgs/electroweak physics and beyond-the-LHC energy frontier, but seeks a clear picture of the limits of the colliding beams method. In this paper, we try to consolidate various recent efforts in identifying physics limits of colliders in conjunction with societal sustainability, and share our thoughts about the perspective of reaching the ultimate quantum limit.

The U.S. Particle Physics Community Planning Exercise, "Snowmass 2021", is nearing completion. This process provides input for the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), which will develop a ~10 year scientific vision for the future of the U.S. high energy physics program. High energy particle colliders are the most promising tools to test the Standard Model and have been on the discovery forefront for the past 50 years. A future collider may also enable exploration of e.g., new particles and interactions, physics beyond the SM and dark matter. Several future multi-TeV collider concepts were considered during Snowmass. A range of issues were discussed, including: their physics reach, their level of maturity, the potential machine routes, timelines, R&D requirements, and common issues for these very high energy machines such as energy efficiency and cost. We will compare future collider concepts (1-100 TeV center-of-mass energy range (or beyond)) based on their physics potential, technology R&D required, and potential timelines. The aim is to explore possible strategies towards a next-generation multi-TeV collider to enable discoveries at the energy frontier.

Electron cooling of ion beams employing rf-accelerated electron bunches was successfully used for the RHIC physics program in 2020 and 2021 and was essential in achieving the required luminosity goals. This presentation will summarize experience and challenges with electron cooling of colliding ion beams in RHIC. We also outline ongoing studies using rf-based electron cooler LEReC.

DarkSRF: Using Accelerator Technology to Search for a Dark Photon

Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities have long been used to accelerate beams of charged particles. But their extremely high quality factors >1010 make them useful in high sensitivity searches for physics beyond the standard model. DarkSRF is a ’light-shining-through-the-wall’ (LSW) experiment in which two SRF cavities are tuned to the same frequency and only one is powered. RF power appearing in the unpowered cavity could be a sign of conversion of photons from the powered cavity into dark photons, and then conversion back into photons. In this contribution, we overview the concept, experimental apparatus, and first results.
