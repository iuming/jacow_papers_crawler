Heavy ion linac requires ion source to deliver high-intensity and highly-charged heavy ion beams in order to achieve higher beam intensity and better cost-effective performance. The 3rd generation highly-charged ECR ion sources with microwave frequency 24-28 GHz and NbTi superconducting magnet have been operating in a few laboratories worldwide, which are able to provide heavy ion beams such as 129Xe30+ of 300 euA, 238U33+ of 400 euA. To further improve beam intensity for higher charge state heavy ion beams, a 4th generation ECR ion source named as FECR (the First fourth generation ECR ion source) with frequency 45 GHz and Nb3Sn superconducting magnet is being developed at IMP. The FECR Nb3Sn magnet is being assembled and it is expected the first beam commissioning results could be presented. Recent research and development on the 3rd and 4th generation ECR ion sources for heavy ions will be reviewed, and future directions will be discussed in this talk.

Run 2 of the Advanced Plasma Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE) at CERN

After successful completion of Run 1 of the Advanced Plasma Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE) at CERN, the experiment started Run 2 in 2021. The goals of AWAKE Run 2 are to accelerate electrons in proton-beam-driven plasma wakefields to high energies with gradients of up to 1 GV/m while preserving the electron beam normalized emittance at the 10 um level, and to demonstrate the acceleration of electrons in scalable plasma sources to 50-100 GeV. The first milestone towards these final goals is to demonstrate electron seeding of the self-modulation of the entire proton bunch. This was achieved in the 2021 run and some highlight results are shown. In the next phases of AWAKE Run 2, a new X-band electron source will provide a 150 MeV, 200 fs, 100 pC electron beam, to be accelerated in the plasma wakefields.

Nanoparticle Assisted Laser-Wakefield Acceleration of Electron Beams to 10 Gev at the Texas Petawatt Laser

We report peak electron energies beyond 10 GeV from a proof-of-principle experiment of laser wakefield electron acceleration with a Petawatt-class laser in a 10 cm long gas cell filled with helium mixed with aluminum nanoparticles. Compared with other wakefield acceleration schemes, our scheme is straightforward since it requires only a gas cell and a source of nanoparticles for electron injection. No external guiding or heating mechanisms are employed. The nanoparticle-assisted laser wakefield acceleration can control all the electron beam parameters: charge, energy spread, energy, emittance, and the number of bunches in the beam. Bunch charges are on the order of a few nanocoulomb for the whole beam and in the 100pC range in the high energy part, an order of magnitude increase over previous results at >5 GeV. We demonstrate shots with percent-level narrow energy spread at multi-GeV energies as well as varying numbers of electron bunches. This new method therefore shows great potential to support the further development of laser-plasma-based electron acceleration.

The muon linac project for the precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments, which is currently one of the hottest issues of the elementary particle physics, is in progress at J-PARC. The muons from the J-PARC muon facility are once cooled to room temperature, then accelerated up to 212 MeV with a normalized emittance of 1.5 pi mm mrad and a momentum spread of 0.1%. Four types of accelerating structures are adopted to obtain the efficient acceleration with a wide beta range from 0.01 to 0.94. The project is moving into the construction phase. They already demonstrated the re-acceleration scheme of the decelerated muons using a 324-MHz RFQ in 2017. The high-power test of the 324-MHz Interdigital H-mode (IH) DTL using a prototype cavity will be performed in 2021. The fabrication of the first module of 14 modules of the 1296-MHz Disk and Washer (DAW) CCL will be done to confirm the production process. Moreover, the final design of the travelling wave accelerating structure for the high beta region is also proceeding. In this presentation, the recent progress toward the realization of the world first muon linac will be presented.

A New Paradigm for Ultra-Low Emittance Muon Beam Generation Based on E.R.L.

One of the challenges of future muon colliders is the production of muon beams carrying high phase-space densities. In particular, the muon beam normalized transverse emittance is a relevant figure of merit to meet luminosity requests. A typical issue impacting the achieved transverse emittance in muon collider schemes so far considered is the phase space dilution caused by Coulomb interaction of primary particles propagating into the target where muons are generated. In this study we present a new scheme for muon beam generation occurring in vacuum by interactions of electron and photon beams.
