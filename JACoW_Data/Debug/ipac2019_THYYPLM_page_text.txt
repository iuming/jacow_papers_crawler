Recent experimental efforts have shown strongly tapered undulator interactions to be the most efficient means for exchanging energy between relativistic electron beams and electro-magnetic fields. The Rubicon Inverse Free Electron Laser (IFEL) accelerator demonstrated up to 100 MeV/m acceleration gradients, producing high quality mono-energetic beams. In separate experiments, it was also shown that this acceleration could occur at high rep-rates, and the accelerated beams could be used to produce X-rays through Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS). The Nocibur experiment demonstrated the reverse process, converting 30% of the energy in a relativistic electron beam to coherent radiation. Combining these concepts, we present here a novel scheme where a laser, re-circulated in an optical cavity drives an IFEL interaction, accelerating a 200 MeV beam up to 1 GeV, at which point an ICS interaction can be used to produce gamma rays. This is followed by a Nocibur-like interaction, decelerating the beam below it’s initial energy, replenishing the laser energy absorbed in the acceleration stage as well as compensating for cavity losses.

Operating a storage ring close to a horizontal resonance and manipulating the transverse non-linear beam dynamics can generate stable Transverse Resonance Island Buckets (TRIBs), which give a 2nd stable orbit in the ring. Both orbits can be populated with different electron bunch filling patterns and provide two different radiation sources to the user community. Such a machine setting has been established at BESSY II and was tested under realistic user conditions in a first ’TRIBs/Two Orbit User Test Week’ in February 2018. Results and user feedback will be discussed in this contribution.

Next-generation, high-performance storage ring light sources based on multibend achromat optics will require on-axis injection because of the extremely small dynamic aperture. Injectors will need to supply full-current bunch replacement in the ring with high single-bunch charge for swap-out. For upgrades of existing light sources, such as the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U), it is economical to retain the existing injector infrastructure and make appropriate improvements. The challenges to these improvements include achieving high single-bunch charge in the presence of instabilities, beam loading, charge stability and reliability. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for the injector upgrades chosen for APS-U, as well as backup and potential alternate schemes. To date, we have achieved single-bunch charge from the injectors that doubles the original design value, and have a goal to achieve about three times the original design value.
