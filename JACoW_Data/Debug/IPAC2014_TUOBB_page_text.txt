Enormous progress in compact plasma accelerators has been demonstrated over the recent years in various experiments. These experiments rely on high power, pulsed lasers or short electron bunches to excite ultra-strong wakefields in plasmas. Accelerating gradients have reached several 10 GV/m up to 100 GV/m and the absolute energy gain of electron beams is in the regime of several GeV to 30 GeV. The principle and potential of plasma accelerators has been proven impressively and performance parameters are steadily improving. It is noted that particle accelerators are powerful tools that are ultimately justified by their applications in science, medicine or industry. The demonstration of useable beam quality and a realistic use case remains to be achieved for plasma accelerators. The accelerator physics challenges to arrive at this goal are analyzed and discussed.

We present here the results of measurements made showing ~1 GV/m accelerating fields using a hollow dielectric-lined waveguide. The results are comprised of measurement of the energy loss of a high charge (~3 nC) ultrashort (~200 fs), ultra relativistic (20 GeV) beam and concomitant auto-correlation interferometeric techniques to obtain the frequency content of simultaneously generated coherent Cherenkov radiation (CCR). Experiments were conducted at the Facility for Advanced aCcelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) at the SLAC National Laboratory using metal-coated sub-millimeter diameter, ten-centimeter long fused silica tubes. We present simulation and theoretical results in support of the conclusions reached through experiment. These results build on previous work to provide a path towards high gradient accelerating structures for use in compact accelerator schemes, future linear colliders and free-electron lasers.

Recent progress of plasma based acceleration at Tsinghua University will be presented. On the theory and simulation part, several ideas on how to obtain high quality electron beams with extremely high brightness through wakefield acceleration will be discussed in details, including two recently published works based on ionization injection method(PRL 111, 015003, 2013; PRL 112, 035003, 2014); On the experiment part, our recent results of high quality 20-30MeV electron beams with very low energy spread, with minimal absolute energy spread of 0.18MeV RMS and relative energy spread 0.8% RMS, will be presented.
