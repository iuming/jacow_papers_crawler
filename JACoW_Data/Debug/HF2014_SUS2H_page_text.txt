We had four sessions of optics in the Higgs Workshop 2014, Beijing. The first section was dedicated to the overall consideration of optics in circular Higgs factory (CHF), and the existing designs from IHEP and CERN. The second one focused on single-particle beam dynamics, in particular dynamic aperture in SuperKEKB and CHF. The third session was a joined one together the working group 3: interaction region (IR) and machine detector interface. The topic was final focus system (FFS) and local chromatic compensation. Three approaches by IHEP, CERN, and BINP were presented. In the final session we had a discussion of beamstralung, beam-beam interaction, and IR magnets.

This is a brief summary of the talks and issues that came up in Working Group 3 (IR and MDI). There were several excellent presentations and several issues were raised regarding the CEPC design and the FCC-ee design.

This report summarizes presentations and discussions that took place during two sessions of the Working Group 5 (WG5) of the HF2014 workshop. In WG5 we reviewed Superconducting RF (SRF) systems of FCC-ee and CEPC and considered SRF structures, peripheral components and other issues relevant to the future circular colliders. In particular, we discussed the validity of cavity parameters and cavity design (frequency, voltage, input RF power, coupling, and HOM damping scheme), high power couplers, HOM dampers, frequency tuners, operating experience and other issues. As the result of WG5, we have come up with a list of important issues that have to be addressed in future studies.
