The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is a versatile collider which can provide many different species at large energy range in collisions. So far, it has collisions of Au+Au, Cu+Cu, U+U, d+Au, Cu+Au, p+Au and polarized protons at various energies. The polarized proton collisions are unique in the world. The luminosity has been increased by steady intensity improvements from injectors, special beam pipe coating, stochastic cooling and electron lens as well as smaller beta functions. The special magnets Siberian snakes and spin rotators are critical for the polarized proton program. For further explorations on the properties of the state of Quark Gluon Plasma(QGP) and the structure of nucleons, an Electron Ion Collider(EIC) is needed. At BNL, we are working on designs for such a facility, utilizing the existing harden accelerator chain, to create a new e-RHIC. This paper will summarize the RHIC operation status and outline the eRHIC choices, one based on re-circulating SRF linac, and the other is based on a new electron storage ring. The performance potential and design challenges of both approaches will be presented.

The establishment of petawatt-class laser devices is expected to obtain super-intense laser with a focusing intensity greater than 1022W / cm2 in the laboratory, push the laser-matter interaction to a high degree of relativity and non-linearity, and even trigger quantum electrodynamic effects. In this report, a novel all-optical scheme for overdense electron-positron pair production by two counter-propagating lasers irradiating the double-cone target with near-critical density plasmas at only 1022W/cm2 is proposed. In this scheme, bright gama-rays are generated by radiation-trapped electrons oscillating in the laser fields. The dense gama-photons then collide with the focused counter-propagating lasers to initiate the multi-photon Breit-Wheeler process. It is indicated by PIC-QED simulations that a high-yield (1011) overdense (1022/cm-3) GeV positron beam may be obtained by using 10 PW scale lasers. Such a bright pair source has many practical applications and could be basis for future compact high-luminosity electron positron colliders.

Electron bunch train, consisting of a large number of equally spaced electron microbunches, have been considered to be applied in advanced accelerators and beam-based high power, narrow-band radiation in terahertz (THz) spectral range. In this paper, we will talk about the theoretical and experimental efforts conducted in Tsinghua University to generate electron bunch trains, including nonlinear space charging oscillation and laser-induced slice energy spread modulation. We will also talk about the applications in THz radiation of the electron bunch trains.

Using a Bessel Light Beam as an Ultra-short Period Helical Undulator

An undulator is a critical component to produce synchrotron radiation and free electron laser. When a Bessel light beam carrying the orbit angular momentum co-propagates with an electron beam bunch, a net transverse deflection force will be subjected to the latter one. As a result of dephasing effect, the deflection force will oscillate and act as an undulator. For such a laser based undulator, the period length can reach sub-millimeter level, which will greatly reduce the electron energy for the required X-ray production.
