The beam injector for the SPring-8 storage ring (SR) was switched from the booster synchrotron to the SACLA linac, a driver for X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). The low-emittance beam from SACLA (~100 pm rad, 8 GeV) is delivered to the SR through a 600m-long beam transport line. This low-emittance beam can be applied to the new low-emittance storage ring after the SPring-8 upgrade planed in the coming years. The shutdown of the booster synchrotron and 1-GeV linac saves energy consumption and operation cost. To provide the electron beam injected to the SR on demand for the top-up injection during the XFEL operation, the SACLA linac must be synchronized to the desired bucket of the SR, the beam energy and route must be switched shot-to-shot, and the XFEL performance must not be degraded. We developed a precise synchronization system, on-demand beam route and parameter switching system, a pulsed magnet for the switchyard, isolated bunch purification system, etc. In this presentation, we will show the design and performance of each component for the beam injection and the results from beam commissioning of the accelerator and transport line.

The evolution and maturation of user applications at low-emittance light sources is driving new, more stringent requirements for electron beam stability in the source points. Long high-spatial-resolution, nano-focus, and high-energy-resolution beamlines demand that the beam orbit and envelope in their insertion devices are stabilized to a small degree of the beam size. At the same time, the capabilities of modern electronics have been advancing rapidly in the past decade, enabling revolutionary developments in broad-bandwidth feedback systems for every dimension of beam dynamics. In addition, synergies between modern beamline and accelerator controls have opened up a pathway to develop and test the first fully integrated feedback system that can counteract drifts and vibrations, allowing us to meet these tight stability requirements. In this presentation we will discuss the stability requirements for premier instruments at NSLS-II and summarize our recent developments in this area.

Higher-harmonic rf cavities (HHC) are employed in several storage-ring light sources to lengthen the bunches and increase Touschek lifetime; their use is gaining further popularity in the new-generation machines as stronger intra-beam particle scattering is the unavoidable price to pay for higher brightness. Historically, HHCs were first introduced as a way to control certain collective instabilities. While often dubbed as "Landau cavities" (with reference to the damping potentially associated with the HHC-induced synchrotron-oscillation frequency spread), their effect on beam stability is, in fact, not necessarily always beneficial. Whether the HHCs help stabilize a beam, aggravate existing instabilities, or introduce new ones, is a complicated matter that depends on various circumstances. With focus on normal-conducting passive HHCs this talk will present some recent progress and revisit some older results on instability collective-mode theory illustrating aspects of the complex impact that HHCs have on beam dynamics. We will also review some open problems, making the case for the need of further theory development beyond conventional mode analysis.

A 4 GeV 1.3 GHz superconducting linac is being constructed at SLAC as part of the X-ray free electron laser project (LCLS-II). The first 3-meter of the electron source that includes a normal conducting 185.7MHz CW RF gun, 2-cell 1.3 GHz CW RF buncher, and a loadlock system for cathode changes was designed and built by LBNL based on their experience with similar one for advanced photo-injector experiment program. The electron beam is designed to operate at a high repetition rate, up to 1 MHz. Since summer of 2018 we started LCLS-II injector source commissioning immediately after the major installation completion. This paper presents major commissioning results including achievements of ultra-high vacuum, RF processing to CW nominal power, dark current characterization and mitigation, and high-brightness electron beam measurements.

The highest extraction efficiency (9.4%) of a free electron laser (FEL) oscillator has been achieved at the mid-infrared FEL facility of Kyoto University*. Because of the interaction between the electron beam and FEL electromagnetic field, a maximum electron energy decrease of 16% was observed. The measured energy decrease was consistent with the measured FEL spectrum. An FEL micro-pulse energy of approximately 100 micro-J with micro-pulse duration of 150 fs was observed. This result is an important milestone for the high-extraction-efficiency FEL oscillator and will contribute to the strong-field physics of atoms and molecules.

With the FLASH2020+ upgrade, one of the beamlines of the free-electron laser FLASH at DESY will be based on the Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) seeding scheme and provide high-repetition-rate, coherent radiation down to 4 nm. To reach this wavelength, it is necessary to imprint intricate structures on the longitudinal phase space of the electron bunch at a very high harmonic of the seed laser wavelength, making the scheme potentially vulnerable to beam instabilities. Part of the beamline is a strong chicane, which is necessary to create the dispersion required by EEHG. Resulting effects such as Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) can be very detrimental for the bunching process and have to be taken into account already in the design of the beamline to ensure optimum FEL performance. We investigate and propose possible mitigation solutions to such instabilities in the FLASH2020+ parameter range.

A cavity-based hard x-ray free-electron laser (CBXFEL) could produce fully coherent pulses with a bandwidth several orders of magnitude below the intrinsic bandwidth of SASE. A cavity-based FEL is not a new concept - the first FEL was an oscillator operating at 3.4 um - but single-pass amplification of spontaneous radiation was the fastest path to gigawatt x-ray powers. One unproven component of a CBXFEL is a stable, high reflectivity cavity. To address this deficit we present ring-down measurements in a 20 m round-trip cold cavity operating at 9.8 keV. The cavity is composed of four strain-relief-cut diamond 400 Bragg mirrors and a transmission grating for in/out-coupling. It is a testbed for alignment protocols and component performance under realistic experimental conditions like source instability, optics imperfections, and thermal drift.
