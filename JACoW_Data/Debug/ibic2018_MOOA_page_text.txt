Noise is a random signal that affects the performance of all electronic and/or optical devices. Although the sources of different kinds of noise have their backgrounds in physics, engineers dealing with noise use different methods and units to specify noise. The intention of this tutorial is to describe the main effects of noise in electronics up to optical frequencies while providing links between the physics and engineering worlds. In particular, noise is considered harmful while degrading the signal-to-noise ratio or broadening the spectrum of signal sources. On the other hand, noise can be itself a useful signal. Finally, artificially generated signals that exhibit many properties of random natural noise are sometimes required.
