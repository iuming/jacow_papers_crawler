The “Linac Coherent Light Source–II” Project, initiated in September 2010, has gone through a radical transformation beginning in August 2013. In its new form, LCLS-II will construct a 4 GeV CW superconducting linac in the first kilometre of the existing linac tunnel. A new undulator, optimized as a soft x-ray (200-1,300 eV) source, will receive electrons from the new SC linac. The existing undulator system will be replaced with a new variable gap device, which will receive electrons from either the new SC linac (providing 1-5 keV photons) or the copper linac presently used by LCLS (providing 1-25 keV x-rays). First light from the new facility is expected in September 2019.

FLASH, the Free Electron Laser User Facility at DESY (Hamburg, Germany), delivers high brilliance XUV and soft X-ray FEL radiation to photon experiments. After a shutdown to connect the second undulator beamline FLASH2 to the FLASH linac, re-commissioning of FLASH started in autumn 2013. The year 2014 is dedicated to FLASH1 user experiments. The commissioning of the FLASH2 beamline takes place in 2014 in parallel to FLASH1 operation.

Backward Compton scattering (BCS) of X-ray photons emitted by undulator and reflected back by a single crystal from the electron beam can produce a quasi-monochromatic gamma-ray beam up to an energy very close to the electron beam energy. The SPring-8 beam diagnostics beamline (BL05SS) is used to inject a reflected undulator X-ray radiation against 8 GeV stored electron beam and to extract a quasi-monochromatic 8 GeV gamma-ray produced by BCS. BL05SS has conditions to do a pilot experiment to obtain the gamma-ray beam using BCS of X-ray photons from existing undulator. Experimental setup including a Bragg mirror system is now under construction. Preliminary reflectivity measurement of a silicon Bragg mirror using around 10keV photons has been done. Status of the experimental preparation and the future outlook is presented.
