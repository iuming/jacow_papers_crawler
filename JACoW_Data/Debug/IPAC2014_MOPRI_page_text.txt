Radioactive Ion Beams of SPIRAL2 project will be produced in the ECR ion source using the Helium as supporting gas. RIB transported in the transfer lines have a multi-component structure and total current of the beams is defined by Helium ions. The total power of Helium component may reach 300 W. The focusing force acting on the ions in the transfer beam line is strongly dependent on mass-to-charge ratio (this is valid for magnetic optical elements). For this reason supporting gas ions will be lost at initial part of the beam line between ECR ion source and analyzing magnet. The Helium beam losses and induced heating power density at the wall of vacuum tube in RIB transfer line of SPIRAL2 during transportation of Ar, Xe and U ion beam are evaluated in this report.

In order to produce positrons, intensive pulsed electron beam is used to strike on a tungsten target. The energy deposition is distributed non-uniformly over the target, leading to a mechanical stress. As a result of large thermal gradient, the target could be potentially damaged. To avoid the target destruction, the peak energy deposition density (PEDD) in the target should be well below the critical limit (35J/g) based on the SLAC operational experience. With an expected primary electron spot size on the target of the SuperKEKB positron source, the PEDD will exceeds the limit. We will introduce a beam spoiler to enlarge the spot size by multiple scattering in thin beam screen and aluminum plate. It reduces the PEDD down to half of the limit. This paper describes the design of the spoiler and the beam screen system used in the positron beam commissioning of the SuperKEKB positron source started in 2014.

In order to keep high luminosity beam collision condition at SuperKEKB, low emittance electron/positron injection and flexible pulse-to-pulse switching of these beam modes are essential requirements. While a primary electron beam strikes on a target to generate positrons, an injection electron beam passes through a small hole besides the target. Since the injection electron orbit should be on axis to avoid emittance growth, the target and the flux concentrator for positron focusing have a few millimeters offset from the axis. This offset positron generation gives significant degradation in the positron yield. In this paper, we will discuss positron yield improvement by proper orientation of the cut-in slit of the flux concentrator which yields un-symmetric field distribution and primary electron incident point. With particle tracking simulation taking three dimensional field distribution into account, an ideal positron trajectory giving optimum yield was found.

The KEKB positron source is under the upgrade for SuperKEKB. The previous positron production target and capture section have been removed and the new system is constructed at a location forty meters upstream to have sufficient energy margin for beam injection to the newly introduced damping ring. A flux concentrator is introduced in the new capture section to make an adiabatic matching system. Large aperture (30mm in diameter) S-band accelerating structures are introduced in the capture section and in the subsequent accelerator module to enlarge the transverse phase space acceptance. The beam focusing system of quadrupoles is also upgraded for a comparable beam acceptance to that of the capture section. This paper reports on the status of the SuperKEKB positron source construction and the preliminary positron beam commissioning.

AWAKE, an Advanced Wakefield Experiment is launched at CERN to verify the proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration concept. Proton bunches at 400 GeV/c will be extracted from the CERN SPS and sent along a 750m long proton line to the plasma cell, a Rubidium vapour source, where the proton beam drives wakefields reaching accelerating gradients at the order of gigavolt per meter. A high power laser pulse will co-propagate within the proton bunch creating the plasma by ionizing the (initially) neutral gas. An electron beam will be injected into the plasma cell to probe the accelerating wakefield. The AWAKE experiment will be installed in the CNGS facility. First proton beam to the plasma cell is expected by end 2016. The design of the experimental area and the integration of the new beam-lines as well as the experimental equipment will be shown. The needed modifications of the infrastructure in the facility will be presented.

The baseline design of the ILC (International Linear Collider) positron source requires the production of an intense flux of gamma rays. In this paper we present an investigation of using the gamma ray beam of the ILC for additional applications, including nuclear physics. As a result of changing the collimator shape, as well as the parameters of the undulator magnets, we obtained spectra from numerical simulations using the HUSR/GSR software package. We present results from simulations and a discussion of possible future investigations in this paper.

The production process of pions which then decay into muons, yields a muon beam with large transverse and longitudinal emittances. Such beam requires phase space manipulation to reduce the total 6D emittance before it could go through any acceleration stage. The design of the muon beam manipulation is based on Neutrino Factory front end design. In this study we report on a multi objective - multivariable global optimization of the front end using parallel genetic algorithm. The parallel optimization algorithm and the optimization strategy will be discussed and the optimized results will be presented as well.

A compact 2.45 GHz microwave ion source based low energy ion been facility has been developed for performing various experiments in material science and for studies related to plasma physics. The design of the compact microwave source is based on a tunable permanent magnet configuration and is powered by a 2 kW magnetron [1,2]. The double walled, water cooled stainless steel plasma chamber and ridge waveguide have been fabricated using the latest ‘LaserCUSING’ technique. The electron energy distribution functions have been measured in a similar low frequency ion source and validated by model calculations [1]. Extraction of the beam can also be performed at very low voltages in the order of hundreds of volts with high intensities by nullifying the space charge effects with the secondary electrons. The facility will be used for ion implantation, phase formation, surface etching and pattering experiments. The design aspects of the microwave ion source and low energy beam transport system will be presented.

Laser ion source capable of generating high intensity ions is best for the ion source of RI beam facilities. A great deal of effort has been made on particle number as DPIS. Only few attempts have so far been made at generating highly charged ions. One of previous research has reported that Au+53 ions are produced by PALS laser. "Nonlinear process" mechanisms such as resonance absorption and self-focusing were used for this. However, these methods have limitation due to low repetition rate of the laser. Nd (λ=1064nm, E<1.2J, t~10ns) and Yb laser(λ=1030nm, E<10J, t~500fs) systems is possible to operate at 10 - 50Hz repetition rate. This double pulse laser system, with attainable laser intensity up to about 1017[W/cm2], was used to generate highly charged ions of solid target. First, the Nd laser creates a plasma plume. Next, the Yb laser reheats plasma plume by high intensity pulse at delay time of nanosecond. The properties of ions were investigated mainly on the base of time-of-flight method.

KEK Digital Accelerator (DA) is a small scale induction synchrotron and operated at 10Hz and recently has succeeded to accelerate gaseous ions*. There is a strong demand of fully striped carbon ions because the DA is regarded as the second generation of cancer therapy driver, which does not require an injector and electron stripper. We need a novel carbon ion source providing C6+ beams, which are directly injected into the DA and accelerated up to required energy. For this purpose, a laser ablation ion source(LAIS) is promising**. To obtain high yield C6+ ions from ablation plasma, the laser irradiation condition has been evaluated and relationship between beam properties of charge spectrum, intensity, and temperature, and carbon target materials were examined. Two laser systems, long pulse (6 ns) and short pulse (170 ps), were employed to irradiate a graphite and amorphous carbon target. The current densities and profile of the generated plasmas in time were measured and charge state distributions were analyzed. In addition we will report a full design integrating this LAIS, the extraction system, the longitudinal chopper system, and the low energy beam transport line.

We discuss the behavior of laser-ablation plasma spreading through a pulsed solenoidal field to minimize the beam emittance of laser-ablation ion source (LIS). LIS is expected to produce high-flux and low emittance ion beams from various solid materials in vacuum because of the high drift velocity and low temperature of the ablation plasma due to the adiabatic expansion. However, the ion flux level from the ablation plasma into an extraction gap changes within a pulse and then the shape of the sheath boundary changes transiently. Then, the integrated emittance is larger than the stroboscopic emittance at a certain time slice. To prevent the transient effect, we tried to control the plasma flux with a pulsed solenoidal magnetic field. The field is expected to change the direction of the plasma flow like a lens. By changing the magnetic flux density according to the transient flux level of ablation plasma, we can expect to control the plasma flux at the extraction gap. To investigate the controllability of the plasma flow, we measured the plasma flux as a function of parameters of the pulsed magnetic field. We scanned ion probes along the beam.

This work presents the latest results of high current proton and deuteron beam production at SMIS 37 facility at the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP RAS). This facility creates and heats up the plasma by 37.5 GHz gyrotron radiation with power up to 100 kW in a simple mirror trap meeting the ECR condition. High microwave power and frequency allow sustaining plasma of significantly higher density (Ne up to 2·1013 cm-3) in comparison to conventional ECRISes or other microwave ion sources. The low ion temperature, on the order of a few eV, is beneficial to produce ion beams with low emittance. Latest experiments at SMIS 37 were performed using a single-aperture two-electrode extraction system. Various diameters of plasma electrode apertures i.e. 5 mm, 7 mm, 10 mm, were tested yielding proton and deuteron beams with currents up to 500 mA with RMS emittance lower than 0.2 π·mm·mrad at extraction voltages up to 45 kV. The maximum beam current density was measured to be 800 mA/cm2. A possibility of further improvement through the development of an advanced extraction system is discussed.

A double-frequency ECR ion source has been modelled numerically for high-efficiency ion production from protons to uranium. The simulations were targeted at optimizing magnetic confinement of the hot electrons through an iterative design of three solenoids and a dodecapole. In addition a plasma production model has been implemented in order to study ion species yield from neutral gases and their drift towards the cold plasma regions. Eventually, ion extraction and beam capture in the space-charge regime have been performed. Mechanical design studies approached the plasma chamber cooling and magnet coils refrigeration.

The Front End Test Stand (FETS) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) requires a 60 mA 2 ms 50 Hz Hminus beam. A Penning Surface Plasma Source is used to produce the beam. This paper gives the latest results obtained using a new 25 kV long pulse extraction power supply designed and built at RAL. Power supply performance, beam current and emittance are detailed.

A Penning-type negative hydrogen (H) ion source has been used reliably on the ISIS pulsed spallation neutron and muon facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK for almost 30 years. However a detailed study of the ion source plasma and extraction has never been undertaken. If these properties were known, the beam emittance and losses due to collimation could be reduced, and the lifetime increased. This paper summarises the progress made on installing a Vessel for Extraction and Source Plasma Analyses (VESPA) to fill the knowledge gap.

The relative concentration of cesium to hydrogen in the plasma of a H− magnetron source is an important parameter for reliable operations. If there is too much cesium, the surfaces of the source become contaminated with it and sparking occurs. If there is too little cesium then the plasma cannot be sustained. In order to monitor these two elements, a spectrometer has been built and installed on a test and operating source that looks at the plasma. It is hypothesized that the concentration of each element in the plasma is proportional to the intensity of their spectral lines.

Advanced Research Electron Accelerator Laboratory (AREAL) is a 20 MeV laser driven RF linear accelerator which is being constructed in the CANDLE institute. The construction of phase-1 is finished and at present the machine commissioning is in progress. In phase-1 a photocathode RF gun provides a 5 MeV small emittance electron beam with the 100 pC bunch charge and variable electron bunch length from 0.5 to 8 ps. Two main operation modes are foreseen for this phase – single and multibunch regimes to satisfy experimental demands. We report the status of linac, first experience and nearest machine run schedule. The brief review of the facility, main parameters, performance and first results are presented.

Future high brightness photoelectron sources delivering >100 mA average current call for a new generation of photocathodes. Materials which qualify for this purpose should exhibit low intrinsic emittance, long lifetime and high quantum efficiency at photon energies in the visible range of the spectrum to relax drive laser requirements. A combination of material science techniques are used to determine the influence of the growth parameters on structure and performance of photocathode materials . In-situ XRR, XRD and GiSAXS measurements were performed at the synchrotron radiation sources, NSLS and CHESS. The growth of K3Sb, a precursor material of one of the prime candidates CsK2Sb, was studied intensively to optimize this intermediate growth step in terms of quantum efficiency and roughness. Three methods, a “layer by layer” type and a “super-lattice type” were examined. K3Sb exists in two crystallographic phases, namely cubic and hexagonal. The cubic phase exhibits a higher quantum efficiency at 532 nm than the hexagonal phase and transforms more easily into CsK2Sb, tuning this phase is believed to be one of the key parameters in the CsK2Sb growth.

Alkali antimonide photocathodes with high quantum efficiency hold the promise of delivering electrons for high-brightness injectors. A drift type spectrometer (momentatron) was attached to the HZB preparation system to allow in-situ characterization within short time after fabrication and possibly identify correlations between growth process and cathode performance parameters.

Superconducting radio-frequency photoelectron injectors (SRF photoinjectors) are a promising electron source for high brightness accelerators with high average current and short pulse duration like FELs and ERLs. For the upcoming ERL project BERLinPro we want to test and commission different SRF photoinjectors and examine the beam performance of photocathode materials in an independent test facility. Therefore we designed GunLab to characterize the beam parameters from the SRF photoinjectors in a compact diagnostics beamline. In GunLab we want to investigate the complete 6 dimensional phase space as a function of drive laser and RF setup parameters. In this work we present the design and the estimated performance of GunLab.

The source of polarized electrons at the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC uses photo-emission from strained-layer superlattice-GaAs and bulk-GaAs photocathodes. This system is driven by either 3 GHz gain-switched diode lasers or a short-pulse Ti:Sapphire laser system. Highly polarized electrons are generated with laser light at 780 nm, while blue laser light is used for unpolarized high-current experiments. We present the existing pulsed laser systems and the planned developments for the diode laser system, including, e.g., impedance matching of the diode lasers, gain switching with short electrical pulses and pulsing with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. The pulsed operation is aimed at generating short electron bunches (< 50 ps) at the S-DALINAC with variable repetition rates from some MHz to 3 GHz.

By combining the code of ASTRA and elegant in a user-friendly interface, a simulation tool is developed for the ELBE SRF Gun II. The photoelectric emission and first acceleration to several MeV in the gun cavity are simulated by ASTRA with a 1D Model, where the space charge effect is considered. The dependence of the beam quality on key parameters is studied, and a compromised optimization for a 77 pC beam is used for further elegant simulation of the beam transport through a dogleg and ELBE Linacs. Proper settings of the magnets and RF phases are the main targets of improving the beam quality. Up to now the best simulation result is an electron bunch with the energy of 47 MeV, energy spread of 66 keV, bunch length of 0.35 ps and transverse emittance of 1.9 μm and 2.7 μm in the two perpendicular directions.

GaAs is the next photocathode material for the ELBE SRF gun, which has been successfully operated with Cs2Te photocathode in last years. GaAs photocathodes are advantageous because of their high quantum efficiency (QE) with visible light and the extensive experiences of their use in DC guns. Furthermore, GaAs photocathodes provide the possibility to realize a polarized SRF gun in the future. In this presentation we will introduce the new preparation system and the first results of the GaAs tests. The new transfer system under construction will be also presented.

The SRF gun has been successfully operated for the radiation source ELBE at HZDR. To achieve higher current and lower beam emittance, a new niobium cavity with superconducting solenoid and a new 13 MHz laser have been recently developed. For this reason, better photocathodes with high quantum efficiency are urgently in demand. In this work we improve the present Cs2Te preparation system for cleaner environment and more precise stoichiometric control than before. A new mask is designed to prevent cesium pollution of the cathode body. Instead of Kapton only alumina ceramics are used for isolation, and the cathode plugs are degassed at higher temperature. New evaporators are installed and tested to obtain an accurate deposition rate. Furthermore, the cathode transfer system is thoroughly cleaned for a better vacuum condition.

We present a general and efficient numerical algorithm for studying laser induced field emission from nanostructures. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD) method for solving the optical field profile, the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for capturing the electron dynamics and the Finite Element Method (FEM) for solving the static field distribution. The charge distribution is introduced to the time-domain method based on a modified Fowler-Nordheim field emission model, which accounts for the band-bending of the charge carriers at the emitter surface. This algorithm is capable of considering various effects in the emission process such as space-charge, Coulomb blockade and image charge. Simulation results are compared with experimental findings for optically driven electron emission from nanosharp Si-tips.

Electron diffraction is a tool for exploring structural dynamics of matter. The scattering cross section is orders of magnitude higher for electrons than for X-rays so that only a small number of electrons is required to achieve comparable results. However, the required electron beam quality is extraordinary. To study e. g. proteins a coherence length of 30 nm is required which translates into a transverse emittance of 5 nm at a spot size of 0.4mm. In addition short bunch lengths down to 10 fs and a temporal stability of the same order are required in order to study chemical reactions or phase transitions in pump probe type experiments. These are challenging parameters for an electron source, which demand improvements at many frontiers. Dark current degrades contrast of diffraction patterns in all experiments. Understanding dark-current generation and propagation can lead to better methods to decrease it. In this paper dark current studies that are performed at REGAE will be presented.

Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) structures may be subjected to electron multipacting (MP). The electrons emitted from one of the structure’s wall under certain conditions are accelerated by the RF field, thereby they may impact the wall again based on the field pattern in the structure. Accordingly the number of electrons increases exponentially caused by secondary electron emission*. The latter depends on the secondary emission coefficient of the surface material and the electron trajectory in the device under study**. This phenomenon limits the accelerating gradient in the cavity, moreover, it might cause an impair of RF components and distortion of the RF signal. Therefore, there should be an efficient countermeasure to suppress MP in order to boost the performance of the SRF gun. In this paper, three techniques of suppression of MP from the vicinity of the cathode, such as DC-bias, geometric modification and the microstructure of the cathode's surface, in the Rossendorf SRF gun are presented. The simulation has been done using CST Microwave Studio® and CST Particle Studio®***. Eventually, the efficient suppression method would be chosen for this particular case.

In order to develop highly brilliant, pulsed electron sources based on photo-induced field emission (PFE), which combines advantages of photo and field emission (FE), a new measurement system was constructed at BUW*. In an UHV system the electrons are extracted from a cold cathode by a mesh electrode under pulsed laser illumination (3.5 ns, 10 Hz, 0.5 – 5.9 eV, > 0.3 mJ) and so far analyzed by a CW-spectrometer. Quantum efficiency investigations of flat metal (Au, Ag of different surface orientations) and semiconductor crystals (n- and p-Si**, GaN) yielded the expected work functions and revealed first hints for PFE effects. However, the kinetic energy of the electrons could not be measured with the CW-spectrometer. In addition, the achievable electric field (< 20 MV/m) was limited by parasitic FE. Hence, the system is presently upgraded with a spectrometer (resolution < 3 meV) that can handle electron pulses and a dust reduced environment is installed at the load lock. First results acquired with the upgraded apparatus on PFE cathodes will be presented at the conference.

A cryocooled C-band photocathode RF gun operating at 20K is under design at Nihon University. The RF gun is of BNL-type 2.6-cell pillbox cavity with a resonant frequency of 5712 MHz. With high-purity Oxygen-free copper used as the cavity material, the quality factor of the cavity is expected to be approximately 60000 from theoretical prediction of the anomalous skin effect at low temperatures. Considering the cooling capacity, initial operation of the RF gun is assumed at a duty factor of 0.01%. The cavity elements designed for low-power test is in preparation for machining. The low-power test at room temperature is scheduled early spring in 2014 before assembled at KEK by means of diffusion bonding technique. Since it is intended for the basic understanding and measurements of low temperature RF properties, the cavity is not equipped with structures for the photocathode assembling or the RF input coupler. The cavity design and the results of RF properties measured at room temperature before diffusion bonding will be reported.

Multi-alkali photocathode has excellent features: high quantum efficiency, long lifetime, and excitation by visible light, for example green laser. The multi-alkali cathode is considered to be one of the best candidate of the high brightness electron source of the advanced electron accelerator such as ERL and FEL. We study conditions of multi-alkali evaporations, such as thicknesses, substrate temperature, and evaporation rate, and examine the cathode performances, such as quantum efficiency and extractable current density. Antimony (Sb), potassium (K), and cesium (Cs) are used in our evaporation system.

Electron source is one of the most important component in the advanced linac. There is a strong demand on the high performance cathode, such as small emittance, high brightness, and short pulse generation. NEA-GaAs photo-cathode is a unique technology which is capable for generating highly polarized and extremely low emittance beam. Quantum efficiency (QE) of the cathode is high in near IR region, so it is favor to generate a high current density beam. These advantages are originated to the Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) surface, but it is fragile so the operational lifetime is limited. A study on a robust NEA surface cathode is reported. According to the hetero-junction model, Cs-Te thin film deposited on GaAs forms a robust NEA surface. We performed the Cs-Te evaporation experiment on a clean GaAs cathode and measured QE spectra. We found that some sample showed a high quantum efficiency up to 900nm wavelength which strongly suggested a NEA surface formation.

We are developing a new RF gun for SuperKEKB. High-charge low-emittance electron and positron beams are required for SuperKEKB. We will generate 7.0 GeV electron beam at 5 nC 20 mm-mrad by J-linac. In this linac, a photo cathode S-band RF gun will be used as the electron beam source. For this reason, we are developing an advanced RF gun. New RF gun which has two side coupled standing wave field is developed. We call it quasi traveling wave side couple RF gun. This gun has a strong focusing field at the cathode and the acceleration field distribution also has a focusing effect. Beam commissioning has been started with the new RF gun. I will report the result of beam commissioning.

Spin polarized electron beam is essential for "International Linear Collider". In Nagoya University, transmission-type spin-polarized photocathodes have been developed, and the quantum efficiency of 0.5 % and the polarization of 90 % were achieved*,**. Recently, we succeeded in making the active layer several times thicker with keeping the spin polarization on the GaAs/GaAsP strain-compensated superlattice photocathode***. Increasing the thickness of the active layer is very advantageous for high quantum efficiency, but might be disadvantageous for pulse response. In order to investigate the pulse response, we have developed a pulse length measurement system by using an RF deflecting cavity. In the measurement, magnetic field induced on the beam axis kicks electron pulse transversely and the pulse length is projected to the transverse plane, which is measured by knife-edge method. The pump laser pulses are provided by a Ti:sapphire laser oscillator. By using a pulse stretcher, the pulse width of the pump laser can be changed in the range between 130 fs and 20 ps. In the poster session, we will describe the details of the measurement system and the most recent experimental results.

In UVSOR, the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) based on linear accelerator with high pulse repetition about 1MHz has been designed as a candidate for the next radiation sources. We thought a combination of superconducting RF cavity and photocathode is an optimal electron gun for the new accelerator. For this electron gun, we propose a back-illuminated multi-alkali* photocathode with transparent superconductor LiTi2O4**. The reason for using LiTi2O4 is to reflect RF by using feature of penetration depth of superconductor, which is defined from London equation. This feature protects optical components from RF damage. However, LiTi2O4 is a new material and properties are not clear. We have measured the basic properties of this photocathode, such as magnetic susceptibility measurement and photoelectron spectrometry, etc. In this conference, we will explain the detail of the concept and advantage of this cathode, and show the result measured about the basic properties of this photocathode focusing on the initial emittance measurement.

Pulse radiolysis, which utilizes a pump electron beam and a probe pulse, is a powerful tool that can be used for the time-resolved observation of ultrafast radiation-induced phenomena. Recently, double-decker pulse radiolysis* using visible probe pulses were demonstrated based on a photocathode RF gun driven by two UV pulses, which enabled synchronized pump electron beam and visible probe pulses. In this study, pulse radiolysis using terahertz (THz) probe pulses which were realized by the “double-decker” electron beams and dynamics of transient quasi-free electrons in semiconductors are presented.

We developed an iridium cerium cathode material made by new production method for multi-purpose electron source. For multi-purpose electron source, we focused on the Ir5Ce compound which has a high melting point (> 2100 K) and a low work function (2.57 eV). This material has some excellent properties as both a thermionic cathode and a photocathode. For example, Ir5Ce thermionic cathode can generate one-order higher electrical current than a LaB6 cathode at the same temperature. Another advantage is that an Ir5Ce thermionic cathode has a lifetime two orders longer than that of a LaB6 thermionic cathode under the same conditions. Moreover, we discovered that this material has a reasonably high quantum efficiency (2.70 × 10−3 @213nm at 1000°C) and long-lifetime (> LaB6) as a photocathode. Our research shows that Ir5Ce compound is optimum material for a thermionic cathode and photocathode. We focused on this good emission properties under the high temperature and we tried to develop a backside electron beam heating system and demonstrate a laser pre-pulse heating for a high current thermionic gun system or high charge photocathode gun.

Negative electron affinity (NEA) surface are formed by deposition of Cs atoms on p-GaAs, and the drastic increase in the electron emission is observed by the Yo-Yo method. It is necessary to remove oxide layers of GaAs surface for the NEA surface formation, therefore the thermal treatment was carried out prior to the NEA activation. We have discussed the quantum efficiency (QE) with different thermal history. GaAs surfaces cleaned with organic solvents were thermally treated with the temperature sequence of 773K, 823K, and 723K. The NEA activation was carried out at every temperature. The QE less than 1% was obtained with 773K of treatment temperature on the initial surface. Then the QE increased at 10% after treatment at higher 823K. Successive increase of the QE to 13% was observed with a reduced temperature treatment at 723K. The GaAs surfaces after the thermal treatment in the high temperature region with the NEA activation are different from the as-cleaned-GaAs surfaces probably in stoichiometry or morphology due to desorption of As and Ga atoms. The role of thermal treatment with NEA activation is the modification of surface properties important for elevating the QE.

We have been developing an Energy-Chirping-Cell attached RF electron gun (ECC-RF-Gun) for generating ultra-short electron bunches. ECC-RF-Gun has extra cell at the end of gun cavity in order to chirp the bunch energy. Such a bunch can be compressed by the velocity difference though the drift space. We have already installed it to our accelerator system and successfully observed a coherent synchrotron/transition radiation at 0.3THz. It is clear that the bunch length was short enough to generate 0.3THz, which corresponds to less than 500fs bunch length was achieved if we assume the gaussian shape. In this conference, the principle of ECC-RF-Gun, the recent results of bunch length measurement and future prospective will be presented.

Electron linear accelerators are used as x-ray generators for diagnosing the human body. In this paper conceptual design of electron beam for compact electron gun was calculated by using EGN2w and CST-Particle Studio codes. The structure of the electron gun was used for Pierce and diode type and the specification of electron beam was selected as 500 cGy/min. Specifications of designed electron gun were focused on current, beam size and normalized emittance.

RPC "Istok" has created a number of electron injectors with voltage of 20-60kV and cathode diameter of 6-15mm of diode and triode designs. Injectors use the impregnated cathodes; the injector design allows rapid replacement of cathode assemblies. Injectors have been widely used in linear electron accelerators in Russia and Ukraine, in particular, in the sterilization accelerator center of JSC "MRTI RAS", Moscow, in the accelerator of the Russian Eye and Plastic Surgery Centre, Ufa. Have been proposed new input energy windows on the E11 wave, providing significant levels of transmission of the pulse power at high average power levels. Have been created two types of windows at 10-cm range, in which the ceramic disk made of ecologically clean alumina ceramic with diameter of 103mm and thickness of 13mm is used. In the first type of windows the heat transfer is provided from the peripheral portion, and in the second type of window – both from peripheral and central portions of the ceramic disk. These windows are used in accelerator of FSUE "NIIEFA" (St.Petersburg), installed at Izhora mill for testing the welding seals of atomic reactors and in accelerator of JSC "MRTI RAS".

The high-charge PHIN photoinjector has originally been developed to study the feasibility of a photoinjector option for the drive beam of the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3) at CERN and is now being used to investigate the feasibility of a drive beam photoinjector for CLIC. In this paper recent R&D efforts to improve the parameters of the existing system towards CLIC requirements will be discussed. This includes studies of a feedback loop for intensity stabilization, the upgrade of the PHIN vacuum system and the planned upgrade of the driving laser system. For photocathode production and R&D a dedicated photoemission laboratory is available at CERN. To increase the production rate of photocathodes and the availability of the photoemission lab for other studies, an upgrade of the photocathode preparation system with a load-lock system is under study and will also be presented.

The baseline design of the SwissFEL injector foresees the "PSI Gun 1", a 2.6-cell RF photo-cathode gun operating at S-band frequency, as the electron source. In this paper a new design is presented where a 5.6-cell C-band gun could replace the PSI Gun 1 with no impact on the rest of the injector setup. A conservative maximum gradient of 135 MV/m at the cathode is assumed which drives the electron beam faster into the relativistic regime and therefore allows to tolerate larger charge densities. The presented solution also foresees a coaxial RF coupling from the cathode side in order to place the gun solenoid as near to the photo-cathode as possible, improving the emittance compensation. Astra simulations showed that the transverse beam brightness can be doubled before the first bunch compressor preserving the low transverse emittance value as compared to the current design for the S-band injector configuration of SwissFEL.

It has been suggested that the MeV beam generated from a laser-driven photo-cathode rf gun can be used for ultrafast electron diffraction (UED)*. The feasibility of operating the NSRRC photo-cathode rf gun system for ultrashort bunch generation is being investigated. The results of space-charge tracking calculations show that a low emittance, few hundred femtoseconds MeV beam with reasonable bunch charge can be generated for single shot UED experiments. In this report, a preliminary design of this UED system will be discussed.

The brightness of a photoelectron injector is fundamentally limited by the mean longitudinal and transverse energy distributions of the photoelectrons emitted from its photocathode, and the electron beam brightness is increased significantly if the mean values of these quantities are reduced. ASTeC have commissioned a Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS – an experimental facility designed to measure these transverse and longitudinal energy distributions) which can be used for III-V semiconductor, alkali antimonide/telluride and metal photocathode research*. GaAs photocathodes were activated in our photocathode preparation facility (PPF)**, then transferred to TESS under XHV conditions and progressively degraded through controlled exposure to oxygen. We present commissioning data and initial measurements showing the evolution of the transverse energy distribution of electrons from GaAs photocathodes as a function of their degradation state.

This work reports a study of various alternative metal samples as candidate materials for use as photocathodes in normally conducting RF guns. Clean surfaces were prepared using Argon ion bombardment and quantum efficiency measured using a 265 nm UV LED light source with a picoammeter for drain current monitoring. Surface composition was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and a Kelvin probe apparatus provided work function measurements. Data was taken both before and after annealing to 200°C, a temperature that is routinely achieved during RF gun vacuum baking. Ion bombardment typically leaves a very rough surface that can have a detrimental effect on beam emittance, so further work will focus on the use of Oxygen plasma cleaning of the best candidate alternative metals. An oxygen plasma treated Copper photocathode has been shown to produce an acceptable level of quantum efficiency in the VELA accelerator at Daresbury Laboratory.

AWAKE project, a proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration (PDPWA) experiment is approved by CERN. The PDPWA scheme consists of a seeding laser, a drive beam to establish the accelerating wakefields within the plasma cell; and a witness beam to be accelerated. The drive beam protons will be provided by the CERN's SPS. The plasma ionisation will be performed by a seeding laser and the drive beam protons to produce the accelerating wakefields. After establishing the wakefields, witness beam, namely, electron beam from a dedicated source should be injected into the plasma cell. The primary goal of this experiment is to demonstrate acceleration of a 5-15 MeV single bunch electron beam up to 1 GeV in a 10 m of plasma. This paper explores the possibility of an RF photocathode as the electron source for this PDPWA scheme based on the existing PHIN photoinjector at CERN. The modifications to the existing design, preliminary beam dynamics simulations in order to provide the required electron beam are presented in this paper.

The Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS) is an ASTeC experiment designed to measure the energy of electrons from different cathode materials. It is a dedicated test stand for future light sources. A full particle tracking code has been developed in the QUASAR Group, which simulates particle trajectories through TESS. Using this code it is possible to simulate different operational conditions of the experiment and cathode materials. The simulation results can then be benchmarked against experimental data to test the validity of the emission and beam transport model. Within this paper, results from simulation studies are presented and compared against experimental data as a collaboration within the Cockcroft Institute between ASTeC and the QUASAR Group for the case of measuring the longitudinal velocity distribution of electrons emitted from a gallium arsenide cathode using a grid structure as an energy filter.

Here we propose to use the APEX photo-gun as novel source for time-resolved electron diffraction studies. The electron source has been designed, built and successfully tested at LBNL. It combines a high accelerating field needed for bright beams, MeV electron energy essential for time resolution in gas-phase experiments and studies of bulk processes, together with continuous (CW) operations. Ultra-short electron pulses can be delivered with a maximum repetition rate of 186 MHz, enabling new science to be studied. We report the design of a dedicated electron diffraction beamline that fits in the space constraints of the APEX tunnel. Simulations of beam properties have been carried out with a genetic optimizer, showing 100 fs time resolution. Beam jitters in energy, time and position are currently being characterized, and a mitigation strategy via fast feedback loops is discussed.

The APEX electron source at LBNL combines high-repetition-rate and high beam brightness typical of photo-guns, delivering low emittance electron pulses at MHz frequency. Proving the high beam quality of the beam is an essential step for the success of the experiment. It would enable high repetition rate operations for brightness-hungry applications such as X-Ray FELs, and MHz ultrafast electron diffraction. A full 6D characterization of the beam phase space at the gun beam energy (750 keV) is foreseen in the first phase of the project. Diagnostics for low and high current measurements have been installed and tested, measuring the performances of different cathode materials in a RF environment with mA average current. A double-slit system allows the characterization of beam emittance at high charge and full current (mA). An rf deflecting cavity and a high precision spectrometer allow the characterization of the longitudinal phase space. Here we present the latest results at low and high repetition rate, discussing the tools and techniques used.

A high repetition rate, MHz, electron source is a key element in future FEL based light sources. The Advance Photo-injector Experiment (APEX) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) consists of a high repetition rate 186 MHz (VHF-band) CW electron gun, 1 MHz UV laser source and the diagnostic components necessary to quantify the gun’s performance. The gun design is based on well established, conventional RF cavity design, with a couple notable exceptions. The basis for the selection of this technology, novel design features, fabrication techniques and measured cavity performance are presented.

Quantum efficiencies (QE) and mean transverse energies (MTE) of GaAs photocathodes grown using various techniques: metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and atomic polishing have been compared and found to be identical. GaAs and GaInP based samples grown at Nagoya University were activated and measured in the Cornell ERL photoinjector. These were found to be in agreement with the samples measured at the ERL injector in KEK.

To create high current, long lasting electron sources capable of providing sub-ps bunches, new photocathode concepts are sought. Most recently, plasmonic nanostructured metal surfaces or flat metal surfaces activated by an ultrathin MgO are under great attention. We report on a photocathode design combining these two approaches. It consists of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized by 3 MgO monolayers (MLs). Ag NPs were synthesized by an aerosol method and MgO was grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The NPs geometry was tuned to obtain broadband >50% absorption in the entire blue range as evidenced by UV-vis. spectroscopy. The WF of 3 MgO MLs/Ag NPs multilayer was reduced by 1 eV compared to bare NPs, from 5 to 4 eV, as evidenced by UPS and Kelvin probe. Reduction by 1 eV is maximal for this pair of materials, and agrees well with experimental and theoretical findings. While the effect on WF is indeed significant, a special handling protocol for Ag before depositing MgO is a must. It would preserve a clean Ag surface with a WF of nearly 4 eV to achieve 3 eV upon ALD of MgO. This and other issues are under study to promote photocathode applications.

The first alkali antimonide photocathode was prepared and inserted into the BNL 704 MHz SRF gun. An excimer laser cleaning system was installed in a cathode deposition chamber and the cleaning technique developed previously was used in the first cathode preparation. We also demonstrated that oxidized cathode can be removed by exposing it to the same excimer laser. In this paper, we show the set up of the incorporated laser cleaning system and the QE enhancement of alkali antimony photocathode. The vacuum evolution at transport cart and QE measurement system are also discussed.

The next generation of x-ray light sources will need reliable, high quantum efficiency photocathodes. These cathodes will likely be from the alkali antimonide family, which currently holds the record for highest average current achieved from a photoinjector. In this work, we explore a new option for delivering these cathodes to a machine which requires them: use of sealed commercial vacuum tubes. Several sealed tubes have been introduced into a vacuum system and separated from their housing, exposing the active photocathode on a transport arm suitable for insertion into a photoinjector. The separation has been achieved without loss of QE. These cathodes are compared to those grown via traditional methods, both in terms of QE and in terms of crystalline structure, and found to be similar.

An ampere class 20 MeV superconducting Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) is presently under commissioning at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). This facility enables testing of concepts relevant for high-energy coherent electron cooling, electron-ion colliders, and high repetition rate Free-Electron Lasers. The ERL will be capable of providing electron beams with sufficient quality to produce high repetition rate THz and X-ray radiation. When completed the SRF photoinjector will provide 2 MeV energy and 300 mA average beam current. The injector for the R&D ERL was installed in 2012, this includes a 704MHz SRF gun* with multi-alkali photocathode, cryo-system upgrade and a novel emittance preservation zigzag-like low energy merger system. We describe the design and major components of the R&D ERL injector then report the first experimental results and experiences learned in the first stage of beam commissioning of the BNL R&D ERL.

Low energy neutrons can be accelerated or decelerated by the technique of AFP-NMR with RF in a gradient magnetic fields. The neutrons have magnetic moments, hence their potential energy are not cancelled before and after passage of magnetic fields and their kinetic energy change finally when their spins are flipped in the fields. Nowadays most measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) are carried out with ultra cold neutrons (UCN), whose kinetic energies are lower than about 300 neV, and with a small storage bottle to reduce the systematic errors. In such experiments highly dense UCNs are desired. The spallation neutron sources generate high-density neutrons at the target, however, the pulsed neutrons with spread velocities are diffused in guide tubes during long beam transport. It is necessary to concentrate UCN temporally upon the bottle by controlling their velocities for nEDM experiments at those facilities. We demonstrated such rebuncher and have been developed the advanced apparatus which makes it possible to handle broader energy range UCN. The design, measured specification of the new rebuncher is described in detail.

Efficient and versatile beam cooling (electron and stochastic cooling) has been an indispensable ingredient for beam preparation and physics experiments at the GSI accelerator complex. The hot secondary beams emerging from the production targets can hardly be used, unless they are cooled. Beam stacking of low-abundant species relies on cooling. Cooling enables high-precision experiments with stored beams, counteracts the heating during internal target operation and controls decelerated beams. New challenges lie ahead within the FAIR project like (i) the ongoing integration downstream of the ESR of the low-energy CRYRING with its electron cooler, (ii) the developments for the demanding CR stochastic cooling system, (iii) the stacking scenarios with RF and stochastic cooling in the HESR/RESR. The function and parameters of the existing and future beam cooling systems are summarized. We report on the latest hardware developments as well as on improvements of the controls and operation software. Recent highlights and results from beam manipulations with cooling at GSI are shown. In focus are those benchmarking experiments, where the concepts for the new FAIR systems are verified.

Angularly resolved far field radiation spectra computed from the Lienard Wiechert Potentials of accelerated electrons give information on the microscopic particle dynamics. We present recent results using our many-GPU, fully relativistic 3D3V particle-in-cell code PIConGPU for which we have developed fully synthetic radiation diagnostics that is capable of computing angularly-resolved radiation spectra of more than 1010 electrons for several hundred to a thousand wavelengths and directions in a single simulation in less than a day on large-scale supercomputers. With such a technique it is possible to use precision spectroscopic methods for understanding the dynamics of electron acceleration in scenarios where other diagnostics fail. We present studies on laser-driven wakefield acceleration and astrophysical jet dynamics to underline the power of this new technique.

The 2 MeV electron cooler was installed in the COSY ring in the spring 2013. The new system enables electron cooling in the whole energy range of COSY. The electron beam is guided by longitudinal magnetic field all the way from the electron gun to the collector. This well-proven optics scheme was chosen because of the wide electron energy range of 0.025-2 MeV. The electrostatic accelerator consists of 33 individual sections of identical design. Electrical power to each section is provided by a cascade transformer. Electron beam commissioning and first studies using proton and deuteron beams were carried out. Electron cooling of proton beam up to 1662 MeV kinetic energy was demonstrated. Maximum electron beam energy achieved so far amounted to 1.25 MeV. Voltage up to 1.4 MV was demonstrated. The cooler was operated with electron current up to 0.5 A. The paper provides insights into the recent progress in high energy electron cooling at COSY and perspectives for the HESR ring at FAIR.

Recently, the feature of ion beam injection, storage and acceleration assisted by a barrier bucket and cooling has been investigated in the High Energy Storage Ring HESR at the new facility FAIR which will be built at the GSI Darmstadt. A bare uranium beam is injected from the collector ring CR into the HESR at 740 MeV/u*. The simulation studies are now improved to include different injection schemes applying either the barrier cavity or the h = 1 cavity in the HESR. It is outlined how the new 2.5 MeV electron cooler at COSY Jülich or stochastic cooling can support the injection mechanism. The beam preparation for an internal target experiment with cooling is outlined. The acceleration of the ion beam is extended to 5 GeV/u under the mandatory condition of the available cavity voltages and the maximum magnetic field ramp rate in the HESR. The flexibility of the HESR ring lattice is utilized to avoid transition energy crossing during ramping up to 5 GeV/u and to adjust the rings’ frequency slip factor for optimal stochastic cooling. The cooling simulations include the beam-target interaction due to a hydrogen target.

For the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at FAIR, it is planned to install an electron cooling device with a beam current of 3 A and a beam energy of 8 MeV. A test set-up was built at Helmholtz-Insitut Mainz (HIM) to conduct a feasibility study. One of the main goals of the test set-up is to evaluate the gun design proposed by TSL (Uppsala) with respect to vacuum handling, electric and magnetic fields, and the resulting beam parameters. Another purpose of the set-up is to reduce recuperation losses to less than 10-5. To measure this quantity and to mitigate collection losses, a Wien filter has been designed and installed. Beam diagnostics will be carried out with a COSY-style beam position monitor. The latest progress of the project is presented.

To develop a 4 MeV relativistic electron cooling system for the HESR storage ring, which is part of the future GSI facility FAIR, is proposed to further boost the luminosity even with strong heating effects of high-density internal targets. In addition the upgrade to 8 MeV of the relativistic electron cooler is essential for the future Electron Nucleon Collider (ENC@FAIR) project. The basic feature of the design are the power for magnet field coils at accelerating and decelerating column is generated by turbines (one option under investigation in this research group) operated on SF6 gas under pressure

The 2 MeV electron cooling system for COSY-Julich was proposed to further boost the luminosity in presence of strong heating effects of high-density internal targets. The 2 MeV cooler is also well suited in the start up phase of the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at FAIR in Darmstadt. It can be used for beam cooling at injection energy and for testing new features of the high energy electron cooler for HESR. The COSY cooler is designed on the classic scheme of low energy coolers like cooler CSRm, CSRe, LEIR that was produced in BINP before. The electron beam is transported inside the longitudinal magnetic field along whole trajectory from an electron gun to a collector. This optic scheme is stimulated by the wide range of the working energies 0.025-2 MeV. The electrostatic accelerator consists of 33 individual unify section. Each section contains two HV power supply and power supply of the magnetic coils. The electrical power to each section is provided by a cascade transformer. This report describes the cooler design, diagnostics, control system and the result of the commissioning in BINP and FZJ at the different energies.

The FFAG (Fixed-Field Alternating-gradient) accelerator is a class of accelerators that comprises the best features of the cyclotron and the synchrotron, combining fixed magnetic fields with strong focusing gradients for optimal stable, low-loss operation. Here, a new type of medium-energy 1-GeV isochronous (CW) FFAG has been developed in a racetrack layout that supports two opposing synchrotron-like straights, permitting both high-gradient RF modules and efficient injection and extraction in a highly compact footprint. In this paper we present beam dynamic simulations for this compact racetrack FFAG, and compare the differences between an equivalent circular and a racetrack configuration. A comparison of the FFAG dynamics with the 800-MeV (Daeδalus) cyclotron is briefly presented.

The collimation system is key to the successful operation of the LHC. Measurements and simulations of the previous run at 4 TeV have shown that the system is ready for the next step, running at 7 TeV, but at the same time some sensitive cleaning locations have been identified. In particular the dispersion suppressors downstream of the betatron cleaning region in IR7 are sensitive to single diffractive scattered protons from the collimator jaws. These particles can lead to magnet quenching. The MERLIN C++ library has been developed to exploit the functionality of an object oriented code, with improved collective effects and scattering routines. New single diffractive and elastic scattering routines, based on a fit of existing experimental data with the Regge theory of soft interactions of high energy scattering, is implemented in MERLIN. In this paper we present the impact of the new single diffractive scattering physics on the cleaning inefficiency of the LHC collimation system for the Achromatic Telescope Squeezing (ATS) PreSqueeze optics scheme, for the HL-LHC project. The results are compared with the same loss map calculated using a SixTrack+K2 like scattering routine.

DAEδALUS* and IsoDAR** experiments needs large intense neutrino fluxes to investigate respectively the CP-Violation in the neutrino sector and the existence of sterile neutrino. DAEδALUS requires three neutrino sources driven by proton beams of ~800 MeV at powers of several megawatts placed at distances of 1.5, 8 and 20 km from the detector. Two cyclotrons working in cascade are chosen to deliver these high power beams. The first cyclotron accelerates the H2+ ions beam up to 60 MeV/amu. The beam is then extracted with an electrostatic deflector and reaccelerated up to 800 MeV/amu through a superconducting ring cyclotron. The acceleration of H2+ has two advantages: it reduces the space charge effect along the injection and acceleration inside the first cyclotron and allows the extraction of the beam from the last accelerator using a stripper foil. The injector cyclotron can be used in stand-alone mode to drive the IsoDAR experiment, which needs the accelerator placed near an underground neutrino detector. The design and the results of beam dynamic simulations will be shown. the results of preliminary injection and acceleration tests into a cyclotron test bench will be presented.

The NIRS-930 cyclotron of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) has been used for production of short-lived radio-pharmaceuticals for PET, research of physics, developments of particle detectors in space, and so on. The NIRS-930 has twelve trim coils for generation of the isochronous fields. Until recently, currents of the twelve trim coils had been adjusted only by monitoring the beam intensity. In order to exactly produce the isochronous fields, a phase probe has been installed in the NIRS-930. Recent results of beam tests using the phase probe will be presented in the present work.

Beam simulation using SNOP* code has been performed for the cyclotron NIRS-930 at NIRS in order to study beam dynamics in a cyclotron and to improve beam intensity. Each electric or magnetic field (main coil, trim coils, harmonic coils, magnetic channel, gradient corrector, grazer lens, dee electrode, inflector) were calculated by OPERA-3d, and simulated injection, acceleration, and extraction. The simulation of proton with 30 MeV extracting energy with harmonic 1 was already performed and well simulated RF phase and extraction efficiency**. Then we tried to apply SNOP to 18 MeV protons with harmonic 2. We first formed isochronous magnetic field with main and trim coils for simulating single particle. Next we optimized electric deflector and magnetic channel in order to maximize extracted particles simulating the bunch of particles. Beam loss of the simulation was compared to the experiment. And then we are optimizing position and rotation of inflector and position of puller to improve injection. We intend to apply optimized simulation parameter to actual cyclotron operation to improve beam intensity and quality.

Recent efforts concerning the RIBF accelerators in RIKEN have been directed towards achieving higher beam intensities of very heavy ions such as uranium and xenon. As presented in the last IPAC conference in 2013, the intensities of these ion beams have significantly improved due to the construction of a new injector, RILAC2, which is equipped with a 28-GHz superconducting ECR ion source, the development of a helium gas stripper, and upgrading of the bending power of the fRC. In this light, this paper presents the subsequent upgrade programs carried out in the last couple of years, such as developments of a new air stripper for xenon beams and a micro-oven for metallic ions. The current performance level of the RIBF accelerator complex, as well as a future plan to further increase the beam intensities, are also presented.

To date, Warsaw U200P cyclotron exploited a mirror inflector to route heavy ions extracted from ECR ion source (10 GHz, 11 kV) to the central region of the cyclotron. However, in such configuration very low transmission was reachable after many optimizations. Additionally, the new ECR ion source (14, 5 GHz, 14-24 kV) was installed, which offers energies far exceeding capabilities of the currently operated inflector and central region. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed a spiral inflector and redesigned central region of the cyclotron. It was a very challenging task, bearing in mind limited volume of central region in our compact machine, to carve these elements suitably for decent versatility of ion beams offered by Warsaw cyclotron. This project was executed in the collaboration with FLNR in Dubna, Russia. The cyclotron equipped with the new central region works in the "constant orbit" regime. Hereby we present the results of both computational simulations and measurements of the beam transmission in upgraded central region.

The DESIR facility will receive beams from the upgraded SPIRAL1 facility of GANIL (stable beam and target fragmentation), from the S3 Low Energy Branch (fusion-evaporation and deep-inelastic reactions) and from the SPIRAL2 production cave (n-induced fission of 238U, nucleon transfer and fusion-evaporation reactions). In order to deliver the RIB to the experimental set-ups installed in the DESIR hall, 110 meters of beam line have to be designed, originating from 3 different facilities. This paper will focus on the studies which have been done on these transfer lines: beam optics and errors calculations, quadrupoles, diagnostics and mechanical designs.

IMALION – which stands for IMplantation of ALuminum IONs – is a facility originally designed for applications in photovoltaics and other branches in semiconductor industry. The idea was to create and guide a milliampere beam of low charged metal ions so that targets with a width of 20 cm and more can be irradiated homogeneously with minimal differences in intensity and entrance angle of the incoming beam over the entire surface. In this poster, we outline the solutions which had to be found during the realization of the project. This concerns the production of a milliampere metal ion current in a newly designed electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source combined with an internal sputter magnetron device. Stable operation of the sputter magnetron under ECR magnetic mirror conditions has been proven by optical spectroscopy and Langmuir probe measurements. Furthermore, electrostatic and magnetic beamline elements developed for precision guiding of a low energy but high intensity beam as well as high intensity ion beam diagnostics are presented and ion beam transportation simulations are shown.

A CW-compatible, pulsed H− superconducting RF linac (a.k.a. PIP-II) is envisaged as a possible path for upgrading Fermilab’s injection complex [1]. To validate the concept of the front-end of such machine, a test accelerator (a.k.a. PXIE) [2] is under construction. The warm part of this accelerator comprises a 10 mA DC, 30 keV H− ion source, a 2m-long LEBT, a 2.1 MeV CW RFQ, and a MEBT that feeds the first cryomodule. In addition to operating in the nominal CW mode, the LEBT should be able to produce a pulsed beam for both PXIE commissioning and modelling of the front-end nominal operation in the pulsed mode. Concurrently, it needs to provide effective means of inhibiting beam as part of the overall machine protection system. A peculiar feature of the present LEBT design is the capability of using the ~1m-long section immediately preceding the RFQ in two regimes of beam transport dynamics: neutralized and space charge dominated. This paper introduces the PXIE LEBT, reports on the status of the ion source and LEBT installation, and presents the first beam measurements.

The FAIR synchrotron SIS100 which is under construction will provide heavy ion and proton beams of high intensity with fast and slow extraction. All extraction devices, including an internal emergency beam dump system, are installed within one straight section. This way, expected systematic beam loss is kept in a relatively small area of the synchrotron. In this area, it is rather challenging to protect components against high radiation fields, to keep XHV conditions, and to allow for maintenance of highly activated components to assure reliable beam operation. In this contribution, the technical measures to fulfill the requirements for the extraction straight section of SIS100 will be presented. These include remote controlled devices to move apart magnet yokes for the purpose of placing beam pipe heater; dedicated star-shaped vacuum chambers with integrated collimators and NEG-panels to reduce pressure bumps due to lost particles behind the electrostatic septa; a high-power multi-stage vertical extraction septum including a variable horizontal deflection.

A prototype Gabor lens has successfully been tested at the GSI High Current Test Injector (HOSTI)*. The experiments comprised the investigation of an emittance dominated and a space-charge dominated beam transport. In particular, the high-current measurements represent a necessary step towards evaluating the focusing performance of the lens and to gain experience in a real accelerator environment. Besides the evaluation of the technical feasibility, the behavior of the electron cloud was characterized by the parameter analysis of the confined non-neutral plasma during beam transport measurements as well as subsequently performed diagnostic experiments. This contribution will present experimental results as well as numerical studies on an improved Gabor lens design for the possible application at the GSI High Current Injector (HSI) in the context of an upgrade program for FAIR**.

The J-PARC main ring (MR) fast extraction (FX) system has two functions: to deliver a high power beam to the neutrino experimental facility and to dump the beam at any time in case of hardware failures. The present FX system consists of five bipolar kickers and eight bipolar septa. In order to raise the beam power to the design limit, both the beam intensity and the repetition rate will increase gradually. The FX system needs to be upgraded to satisfy the new requirements. The upgrade includes FX orbit optimization and new design of devices. Firstly, two high performance eddy current septa have been designed and fabricated. Then downstream high field septa are redesigned and using ceramic beam pipe to eliminate eddy current effects, which meets the requirement of high repetition rate operation. A new large physical aperture quadrupole is needed to accommodate high intensity beam. In order to evaluate the beam loss in the new system, realistic 3D beam tracking is studied.

The C-ADS project is building a test facility at the Institute of High Energy Physics. The design goal of the test facility is 10MeV beam energy with a continuous beam current of 10mA. To sustain the 100kW CW beam power at the beam dump, a beam distribution transform system is designed. The Step Field Magnets (SFMs) are used to transform the beam distribution from Gaussian to uniform. In this test stand, two sets of SFMs will be employed to manipulate the beam distribution. At the first commissioning stage, the bump dump line will be connected to the Medium Energy Beam Transport-1 (MEBT1) to test the beam manipulation scheme. The design and error analysis of this 3MeV beam dump line will be discussed in this paper.

This paper proposes a novel method for non-resonant slow extraction by using special anti-symmetric sextupole field in synchrotrons. The method has the potential in applications asking for stable slow extraction and in the halo collimation of very large machine such as LHC. Our studies show that the slow extraction by using anti-symmetric sextupole field has some advantages compared to the normal sextupole field which is the normal extraction method. One of them is that it can work at almost arbitrary tune, so that it can avoid the problem of the intensity variation caused by the ripples of magnet supplies. Studies by Hamiltonian theory and simulations which meet well show that the stable region only depends on the anti-symmetric sextupole field strength and the particles outside will be driven out in two directions which are similar to the second-order resonant extraction but with spiral steps as in the third-order resonance extraction. The beam can be extracted with a very stable intensity by gradually increasing the field strength. The multi-particle simulations by a self-made program have been carried out with a proton lattice designed for proton therapy.

The front-end system of RISP heavy-ion accelerator(RAON) consists of an electron cyclotron resonance ion source, a low energy beam transport line, a radio frequency quadrupole accelerator and a medium energy beam transport(MEBT) line. The MEBT system, which consists of quadrupole magnets, three normal-conducting re-bunchers and diagnostic devices, is installed between the RFQ accelerator and the superconducting linac(SCL). The three normal-conducting re-bunchers are used to minimize the growths of the longitudinal emittance and to manipulate the particle distribution on longitudinal phase space for beam transportation in SCL. Several combination of the number of cavities was examined, and the quarter wave resonator(QWR) type re-buncher was chosen for MEBT line in RAON. The QWR cavity has a frequency of 81.25 MHz, a maximum electric field of 2.53 MV/m on the cavity surface with an electric field of 1 MV/m on the beam axis, a geometrical beta factor of 0.032 and an effective length of 24 cm. In this presentation, I will present the results of baseline design for electro-magnetic field analysis and mechanical design for stress analysis, thermal stress analysis and cooling channel.

A proposal has been made to accelerate ion beams ranging from hydrogen to neon with magnetic rigidities up to 6.7 Tm for biomedical experiments at CERN using the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), in parallel to its continued operation for LHC and for SPS fixed target physics experiments. The feasibility of a new slow extraction system for LEIR based on the third integer resonance was studied with two possible resonance driving mechanisms: quadrupole-driven extraction and RF-knockout extraction. The extraction of fully stripped carbon ions (20-440 MeV/u kinetic energies) has been studied in detail. The requirement to keep the present performance of the machine for physics experiments imposes tight space constraints for the upgrade. The extraction scheme and the hardware requirements are described in this paper.

The Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) at CERN has been proposed to provide ion beams with magnetic rigidities up to 6.7 Tm for biomedical research, in parallel to its continued operation for LHC and SPS fixed target physics experiments. In the context of this project, two beamlines are proposed for transporting the extracted beam to future experimental end-stations: a vertical beamline for specific low-energy radiobiological research, and a horizontal beamline for radiobiology and medical physics experimentation. This study presents a first linear-optics design for the delivery of 1-5 mm FWHM pencil beams and 5 cm x 5 cm homogeneous broad beams to both endstations. High field uniformity is achieved by selection of the central part of a strongly defocused Gaussian beam, resulting in low beam utilisation.

A set of passive absorbers is located at the end of each of the 3 km long injection lines to protect the LHC in case of failures during the extraction process from the LHC’s last pre-injector or the beam transfer itself. In case of an erroneous extraction, the absorbers have to attenuate the beam to a safe level and be robust enough themselves to survive the impact. These requirements are difficult to fulfil with the very bright and intense beams produced by the LHC injectors for the high luminosity era. This paper revisits the requirements for the SPS-to-LHC transfer line collimation system and the adapted strategy to fulfill these for the LHC high luminosity operation. A possible solution for the new transfer line collimation system is presented.

The CERN Super Proton Synchrotron has to fulfil the demanding intensity specifications for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era, with a doubling of the presently achieved operational beam intensity. One of the main problems to be addressed is given by impedance-driven beam instabilities. About 40 % of the total measured SPS impedance is due to the kickers, of which the extraction kickers in two of the SPS straight sections are the largest systems. A potential upgrade is explored which would strongly reduce the number of extraction kickers required in the SPS, by performing non-local extraction. In this scenario LHC Beam 1 would be kicked by the extraction kicker in SPS Long Straight Section 4 (LSS4), normally only used for Beam 2, to be extracted in LSS6. The concept and the expected performance of such a scheme are presented along with detailed simulation results.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) Project, the collimators in the SPS-to-LHC transfer lines are presently under re-design, in order to cope with the unprecedented beam intensities and emittances required by the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Factors ruling the design phase are the robustness of the jaws on one side and, on the other side, the proton absorption and the emittance blow-up, essential for an effective protection of the equipment in the LHC injection regions and the LHC machine. In view of the new design, based on the one of the currently installed TCDI collimators and past investigations, the FLUKA Monte Carlo code is used to address these two factors. The present studies are intended to give essential feedback to the identification of viable solutions.

For a potential future CERN neutrino facility it is considered to extract a 100 GeV proton beam from the second long straight section in the SPS into the existing TT20 transfer line leading to the North Area. Two transfer line design options were developed simultaneously: early-branching from TT20 using existing, recuperated ‘experimental area’ DC dipoles and alternatively late-branching close to the target area, which requires superconducting magnets. This paper describes the feasibility of the two concepts in addition to the detailed study of the early-branching option. Optics and line geometry optimization are discussed and orbit correction is presented.

The LHC is filled from the last pre-injector, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), via two 3 km long transfer lines, TI 2 and TI 8. Over the LHC injection processes, a drift of the beam trajectories has been observed in TI 2 and TI 8, requiring regular correction of the trajectories, in order to ensure clean injection into the LHC. Investigations of the trajectory variations in the transfer lines showed that the main source of short term trajectory drifts are current variations of the SPS extraction septa (MSE). The stability of the power converters has been improved, but the variations are still present and further improvements are being investigated. The stability over a longer period of time cannot be explained by this source alone. The analysis of trajectory variations shows that there are also slow variations in the SPS closed orbit at extraction. A set of SPS orbit measurements has been saved and analysed. These observations will be used together with simulations and observed field errors to locate the second source of variations.

The Antiproton Decelerator (AD) complex at CERN will be extended by an extra low energy anti-proton ring (ELENA) further decelerating the anti-protons thus improving their trapping. The kinetic energy of 100 keV at ELENA extraction facilitates the use of electrostatic transfer lines to the experiments. The mechanical implementation of the electrostatic devices are presented with focus on their alignment, bakeout compatibility, ultra-high vacuum compatibility and polarity switching. Field optimisations for an electrostatic crossing device of three beam lines are shown.

The PS Booster extraction energy will be augmented from 1.4 to 2 GeV to reduce intensity limits due to space charge at the PS proton injection. For this upgrade the transfer line between PS Booster and PS will be modified for 2 GeV operation and pulse to pulse optics modulation for different beam types. Also the PS Booster measurement line will also be upgraded to 2 GeV and shall provide improved optics solutions for emittance measurements while reducing the loss levels recorded during operation. This paper describes the foreseen optics solutions for both transfer lines.

Realization of high efficiency laser stripping at the SNS accelerator needs good longitudinal overlap between H− bunch and laser pulse. The default H− bunch length at the interaction point is 5 times bigger than needed in order to achieve 90% stripping efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies of longitudinal H− bunch shortening are presented in this paper.

In the heavy ion synchrotron SIS18 at GSI an ion catcher system has been installed to provide low desorption surfaces for ionization beam loss to reduce dynamic vacuum effects. Medium charge state heavy ions can change their charge state in collission with residual gas molecules. Those ions are cought by the ion catcher system. The ion catcher blocks are mounted electrically insulated, such that it is possible, to directly measure the electrical current, induced by the incident ions. Changes in vacuum density during the acceleration cycle and also the energy dependent decrease of the cross sections for electron loss and electron capture can be measured by this system. Different ion catcher currents, measured during the operation with U28+, and their interpretation are presented. The measurement of ionization beam loss is a valuable tool to benchmark the dynamic vacuum simulations.

Heavy-ion impact induced gas desorption is the key process that drives beam intensity limiting dynamic vacuum losses. Minimizing this effect, by providing low desorption yield surfaces, is an important issue for maintaining a stable ultra high vacuum during operation with medium charge state heavy ions. For room temperature targets, investigation shows a scaling of the desorption yield with the beam's near-surface electronic energy loss, i.e. a decrease with increasing energy*,**. An optimized material for a room temperature ion-catcher has been found. But for the planned superconducting heavy-ion synchrotron SIS100 at the FAIR accelerator complex, the ion catcher system has to work in a cryogenic environment. Desorption measurements with the prototype cryocatcher for SIS100 showed an unexpected energy scaling***, which needs to be explained. Understanding this scaling might lead to a better suited choice of material, resulting in a lower desorption yield. An experimental setup for systematic examination of this scaling is presented. The cryogenic beam-induced desorption yield of several materials at different temperatures is examined.

The FAIR synchrotron SIS-100 will be operated with high-intensity proton and heavy-ion beams. The collimation system should prevent beam loss induced degradation of the vacuum, activation of the accelerator structure and magnet quenches. A conventional two-stage betatron collimation system is considered for the operation with protons and fully-stripped ions. Particle tracking and ion-collimator interaction simulations of the collimation system were performed. The angular and momentum distributions of the scattered halo particles were described using analytical models and numerical tools like ATIMA and FLUKA. MADX was used for the multi-pass tracking simulations. The results obtained for the collimation cleaning efficiency as a function of the ion species and beam energy together with the detailed beam losses distributions along the ring circumference are presented. This work highlights the main aspects of the collimation of fully-stripped ion beams in the intermediate energy range using conventional two-stage systems.

In the J-PARC RCS, the significant losses were observed at the branch of H0 dump line and the Beam Position Monitor which was put at the downstream of the H0 dump branch duct. These losses were caused by the large angle scattering of the injection and the circulating beam at the charge exchange foil. To realize high power operation, we have to mitigate these losses. So, we developed a new collimation system in the H0 branch duct and installed in October 2011. In order to optimize this system efficiently, we focused on the relative angle of collimator block from scattering particles. We developed the beam based angler regulation method by the simulation and achieved the sufficient mitigation of the loss at 181 MeV injection energy. Since the injection energy will be upgraded to 400 MeV in this year, we will start to estimate again the collimator performance by the upgraded simulation set. We present this system as one of the mitigation methods of the large angle foil scattering beam loss caused by the multi-turn charge-exchange injection.

In the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) 3-GeV rapid cycle synchrotron (RCS), transverse beam halo scraping for the injection beam is required to increase the output beam power. The transverse collimation system at the Linac-RCS beam transport line (L3BT) was utilized in a nominal beam operation because the area of the scraper section was contaminated when scrapers were working. In the summer-autumn period of 2013, we installed a new beam-halo scraper which had optimized scraper heads for mitigation of the radiation around the scraper system. In this poster, we report a preliminary result for a halo scraper at the L3BT.

The High-Power Proton-Synchrotron (HP-PS) will be delivering a 2 MW proton beam to a fixed target in order to produce neutrinos within the LAGUNA-LBNO project. A mechanical collimation system is essential to prevent lost particles from hitting the super-feric dipoles of the HP-PS ring and to also limit the equipment irradiation close to the beam. This paper presents how the efficiency of the HP-PS collimator system is optimised with respect to the change of the collimators’ thickness, material and beam halo size.

The installation in the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of two crystals in the horizontal and vertical planes was accomplished during the present LHC long shutdown (LS1) for crystal collimation studies. An appropriate layout was designed to demonstrate the principle feasibility of crystal collimation at the LHC. Extensive simulation campaigns were made to evaluate different crystal positions and parameters, in order to ensure that the main goals of these first feasibility tests in the LHC are within reach. In this paper, the final layout is presented. An overview of the considerations behind the design choices and the crystal parameters is given, and the expected performance of the system is discussed.

A routine has been implemented to simulate interactions of protons with bent crystals in the collimation version of \texttt{SixTrack}. This routine is optimized in view of producing high-statistics tracking simulations of collimation cleaning assisted by bent crystals. Fine tuning and comparisons with experimental data of coherent effects which a particle can experience in a bent crystal have been carried out. The data taken with 400 GeV beams at the CERN-SPS North Area in the framework of the UA9 experiment are used to benchmark the routine. Further checks on low probability interactions have been made, leading to significant improvements in the description of interactions with crystals. Comparisons with other simulations tools are used to increase our confidence in the scaling to higher energies.

The issue of activation of a Tungsten collimator by protons is considered for the incident energy of 12.2 MeV. Two different simulation approaches using the Monte Carlo programs MCNPX and FLUKA are applied to estimate the equivalent remanent dose rate after the irradiation of the collimator. The results of the numerical simulation are then compared to the measured dose levels of the collimator of the COMET cyclotron at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI).

The ISIS facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is a pulsed neutron and muon source, for materials and life science research. The 163 m circumference, 800 MeV, 50 Hz rapid cycling synchrotron accelerates up to 3·1013 protons per pulse. The maximum operating intensity of the synchrotron is limited by loss during acceleration, mainly due to the non-adiabatic longitudinal trapping process between 0 and 3 ms, corresponding to energies between 70 and 200 MeV. In order to minimise global machine activation and prevent component damage a beam collimation, or collector, system is installed in a five metre drift section in super-period one, to localise loss to this region. This paper summarises new results from modelling of the beam collectors using the FLUKA code [1, 2]. Understanding the current performance of the collectors is important for high intensity beam optimisation and may influence future injection upgrade plans. Residual dose rates are compared to film badge measurements, predicted energy deposition results are compared to the measured heat load on the collector cooling systems and an assessment is made of the distribution of particles exiting the collector straight.

In the Japanese Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS) of J-PARC, a mercury is utilized as a target material. Since a serious pitting erosion was found at the target vessel at SNS in ORNL and JSNS, a reduction of a peak current density is required. In order to decrease the peak, we have developed the beam optics based on a non linear using an octupole magnets. In a design calculation, it is found that the peak current density of 30 % can be reduced by introducing the octupole magnets. A status of the design and the experimental results will be reported.
