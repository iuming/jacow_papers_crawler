The XLEAP capabilities at the SLAC LCLS facility recently demonstrated the generation of attosecond X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) pulses*. This presents new challenges in beam measurements and diagnostics. In this talk I will discuss the production and measurement of XLEAP pulses with angular streaking using a circularly polarized laser**.

The PolariX TDS is a novel polarisable transverse-deflection structure operating in the x-band frequency regime, enabling temporal streaking of electron beams in any transverse plane with femtosecond resolution. With this feature it becomes possible to measure slice emittance in both x & y, tomographically reconstruct the 3D beam distribution, and record the beam’s phase space with all correlations up to 5D (x,x’,y,y’,t) ’ all using a single cavity. This functionality provides the opportunity to precisely characterise ultra-short beams at both conventional and novel facilities where beam quality and axial symmetry are essential for high-fidelity, high-gradient acceleration. The PolariX system was designed and manufactured by an international collaboration of scientists from CERN, DESY, and PSI. The prototype cavity has been installed and commissioned at the beam-driven plasma-wakefield facility FLASHForward at DESY with further cavities being installed at the FLASH2 (DESY), SwissFEL (PSI), and ARES (DESY) facilities. This presentation will introduce the collaborative foundation of the project with a focus on experimental results from commissioning with beam at FLASHForward, as well as first femtosecond-resolution measurements of plasma-accelerated beams (FLASHForward) and observations of free-electon lasing (FLASH2).

We demonstrate a novel technique to measure the longitudinal profile of an operational hydrogen ion (H−) beam in a non intrusive, real-time fashion. The measurement is conducted based on the photo-ionization of the ion beam with a phase modulated laser comb pico-second laser pulses with controllable temporal structure. The measurement technique has been applied to a 1-GeV, 1.4-MW H− beam at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) high energy beam transport (HEBT). A stroboscopic photo-graph of H− beamμbunch can be obtained by using a phase modulated laser comb. The entire measurement takes only 700 us.

Bunch-Resolved 2D Diagnostics - Streaking Combined with Interferometry

Due to the complexity of the filling pattern in the BESSY II electron-storage ring, bunch-resolved diagnostics are required for machine commissioning and to ensure the long-term quality and stability of operation. In addition, low-alpha operation and a possible VSR upgrade demand bunch-length measurements with picosecond resolution. Therefore, a dedicated beamline equipped with a fast streak camera was set up and successfully commissioned. Couplings between time- and space-coordinates also call for bunch-selective and correlated multi-parameter detection methods. Thus, the beamline and the streak camera have been made capable of direct beam-profile imaging and interferometry of the vertical beam size using the X-ray blocker baffle method *,**. The horizontal or vertical dimension can additionally be imaged with the streak camera and bunch-resolved 2D measurements are possible. Imaging the vertical direction, the characteristic dip in the center the interference pattern from pi-polarized synchrotron radiation can be observed and is used to extract bunch resolved information about the vertical beam size. The streak camera measurements are validated with direct imaging measurements from a regular CCD camera at the beamline and compared to model calculations. The results are converted into absolute values by a calibration with the BESSY II pinhole monitors.

Visualizing Femtosecond Dynamics with Ultrafast Electron Probes Through Terahertz Compression and Time-Stamping

Visualizing ultrafast dynamics at the atomic scale requires time-resolved pump-probe characterization with femtosecond temporal resolution. For single-shot ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) with fully relativistic electron bunch probes, existing techniques are limited by the achievable electron probe bunch length, charge, and timing jitter. We present the first experimental demonstration of pump-probe UED with THz-driven compression and time-stamping that enable UED probes with unprecedented temporal resolution. This technique utilizes two counter-propagating quasi-single-cycle THz pulses generated from two OH-1 organic crystals coupled into an optimized THz compressor structure. Ultrafast dynamics of photoexcited bismuth films show an improved temporal resolution from 178 fs down to 85 fs when the THz-compressed UED probes are used with no time-stamping correction. Furthermore, we use a novel time-stamping technique to reveal transient oscillations in the dynamical response of THz-excited single-crystal gold films previously inaccessible by standard UED, achieving a time-stamped temporal resolution down to 5 fs.

The experimental technique has been proposed and demonstrated by authors for measuring the temporal distribution and absolute bunch length of picosecond-level low-energy electron bunch generated by an electron gun using radial electric and azimuthal magnetic fields of an accelerating (TM01 mode) radio frequency cavity. In this scheme, an accelerating RF cavity provides a phase-dependent transverse kick to the electrons, resulting in the linear coupling of the trajectory angle with the longitudinal position inside the bunch like a transverse deflecting cavity. In this paper, we show a detailed estimation of various aspects of the the temporal resolution of this method with feasible parameters and deconvolution of the Gaussian distribution for accurate reconstruction of the temporal distribution.
