Status of JINR FLNR cyclotrons and plans of their modernization together with plans on creation of new facilities will be reported. At present, three cyclotrons: U400, U400M and IC100 and MT-25 microtron are under operation at the JINR FLNR. U400 and U400M are the basic FLNR facilities that both are under operation is about 12000 hours per year. The U400 (pole diameter of D=4 m) was designed to accelerate ions from B to Bi up to 19 MeV/u. U400 reconstruction is planned. The U400M cyclotron (D=4 m) is used to accelerate ions from Li to Xe up to 60 MeV/u. U400M modernization is planned. The IC100 accelerator (D=1m) is used for applied researches with Ar, Kr and Xe ions at energy of 1.2 MeV/u. Creation of the dedicated DC-130 cyclotron (D=2m) with ion energies of 4.5 and 2 MeV/u is planned on the base of U200 cyclotron. The Super Heavy Element Factory (SHE factory) is the new FLNR JINR project. The DC-280 cyclotron (D=4 m) is the basic facility of the SHE factory, which will accelerate ions with energies 4 - 8 MeV/u cyclotron at intensities up to 10 pmkA for ion masses over A=50. The main systems of the DC-280 were assembled and tested, the cyclotron is preparing for commissioning.

The main accelerators are concentrated in the accelerator department of PNPI. First of all this is the 1000 MeV synchrocyclotron (SC). It is widely used for fundamental research in the field of elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, and the physics of nuclear reactions, in solid state physics and in radiobiology. The role of the SC is also wide in a variety of applied research on radiation and nuclear tests, including specific medical research. Second of all this is the 80 MeV isochronous cyclotron C-80. It is intended for production of proton beams with energies ranging from 40 up to 80 MeV and the current of up to 100 mkA. The cyclotron is intended for production of a wide assortment of radioisotopes including radiation generators (Sr-Rb, Ge-Ga) for medicine, proton therapy of ophthalmic diseases, tests of radioelectronic components for radiation resistance and studies in the field of nuclear physics and radiation material science.
