Dechirper is a passive device composed of a vacuum chamber of two corrugated, metallic plates with an adjustable gap. By introducing a small offset in the dechirper with respect to the reference axis, one might generate transverse wakefields and use the dechirper as a deflector. Understanding the interactions between electron beams of various longitudinal shapes with the wakefields generated by the dechirper is important to assess the feasibility of the dechirper for use as a deflector. Recently, using a set of alpha-BBO crystals, shaping of laser pulses and electron bunches on the order of ps is tested at the Injector Test Facility (ITF) of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). Furthermore, we have investigated propagation of electron bunches of arbitrary longitudinal shapes through the dechirper. In the numerical simulations, we observed that the arbitrary electron beams were successful deflected except for lethal beam shape problems. Hence, in this work, we study optimization of the dechirper for electron bunches of arbitrary longitudinal shapes, using analytical theory and numerical simulations with the ASTRA and ELEGANT codes.

The coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) of a high brightness electron beam traversing a series of dipoles, such as transport arcs, may result in phase space degradation. On one hand, the CSR can perturb electron transverse motion in dispersive regions along the beamline, causing emittance growth. On the other hand, the CSR effect on the longitudinal beam dynamics could result in microbunching gain enhancement. For transport arcs, several schemes have been proposed* to suppress the CSR-induced emittance growth. Similarly, several scenarios have been introduced** to suppress CSR-induced microbunching gain, which however mostly aim for linac-based machines. In this paper we try to provide sufficient conditions for suppression of CSR-induced microbunching gain along a transport arc, analogous to*. Several example lattices are presented, with the relevant microbunching analyses carried out by our semi-analytical Vlasov solver***. The simulation results show that lattices satisfying the proposed conditions indeed have microbunching gain suppressed. We expect this analysis can shed light on lattice design approach that could suppress the CSR-induced microbunching gain.

Many current and future synchrotron light sources employ harmonic cavities to lengthen the electron bunches in order to reduce the emittance dilution caused by intrabeam scattering. In some cases, the harmonic cavities may be tuned to fulfill the flat potential condition. For this condition, a large increase in the threshold currents of transverse coupled-bunch instabilities has been predicted and recently, the physical content behind this stabilization has been better understood. With this in mind, an investigation is made into the effectiveness of harmonic cavities for different machines. Frequency domain computations employing Laclare's eigenvalue method have been used to investigate the influence of several machine parameters and the results are presented.
