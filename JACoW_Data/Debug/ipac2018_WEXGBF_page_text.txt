ESS is considering the use of MB-IOTs for parts of the high-beta linac. Two prototypes have been built by indus-try, namely L3 and CPI/Thales and have passed the factory acceptance test with excellent results. Both tubes will go through further extensive testing at CERN for ESS follow-ing delivery and a final decision on tube technology will be taken in April 2018. This invited talk presents the back-ground for the technical decision of IOTs vs klystrons, associated impact for ESS, and latest plans for industrial production of these IOTs for ESS.

Addressing a demand by Advanced Photon Source (APS) users for high-intensity circular polarized photon beams, development has begun at APS on circular polarising undulators. The first such device is currently being built for the APS storage ring. It is based on a superconducting magnet with a conventional double-helical coil structure. This helical superconducting undulator will be completed in 2017. In addition, the concept of a novel SuperConducting Arbitrarily Polarizing Emitter (SCAPE) has been suggested and is now under development. It consists of two pairs, both vertical and horizontal, of superconducting magnets assembled around a beam vacuum chamber. Such a device is capable of generating either planar or circular polarized photons, depending on which pair of magnets is energized. The SCAPE undulators could be attractive for the APS Upgrade and other fourth-generation storage rings with a multi-bend achromat lattice, as well as for FELs where utilization of round beam vacuum chambers becomes possible. This invited talk presents the status of work on the helical SCU, as well as a conceptual design of the SCAPE.

The RF system of the FRIB driver accelerator includes solid state amplifiers up to 18 kW operating at frequencies from 80.5 MHz to 322 MHz. Much higher power is required for the normal conducting RFQ, ~100 kW, and it is based on vacuum tubes. This invited talk presents the performance of solid state amplifiers and LLRF in off-line testing and on-line testing of the RFQ amplifier.
