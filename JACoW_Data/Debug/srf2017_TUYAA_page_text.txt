Theoretical results offer a potential explanation for the anti-Q-slope, the phenomenon of decreasing microwave surface resistance with increasing radiofrequency electromagnetic field strength. This effect has been observed in niobium doped with impurities, chiefly nitrogen, and has been put to use in the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) accelerator currently under construction. Our work, presented here, finds a strong link between the electron mean free path, the main measure of impurity doping, to the overheating of quasiparticles in the RF penetration layer. This is an important effect that adjusts the magnitude of the theoretical anti-Q-slope by providing a mechanism to counteract it and introduce a surface resistance that increases with field strength. We discuss our findings in a study of niobium cavities doped at high temperature (800-990 °C) as well as new analysis of low-temperature-doped cavities.

The radio-frequency surface resistance of niobium resonators is incredibly reduced when nitrogen impurities are dissolved as interstitial in the material, conferring ultra-high Q-factors at medium values of accelerating field. This effect has been observed in both high and low temperature nitrogen treatments. As a matter of fact, the peculiar anti Q-slope observed in nitrogen doped cavities, i.e. the decreasing of the Q-factor with the increasing of the radio-frequency field, come from the decreasing of the BCS surface resistance component as a function of the field. Such peculiar behavior has been considered consequence of the interstitial nitrogen present in the niobium lattice after the doping treatment. The study here presented show the field dependence of the BCS surface resistance surface of cavities with different resonant frequencies, such as: 650 MHz, 1.3 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.9 GHz, and processed with different state-of-the-art surface treatments. These findings show for the first time that the anti Q-slope might be seen at high frequency even for clean Niobium cavities, revealing useful suggestion on the physics underneath the anti Q-slope effect.

In the present study the radio-frequency complex response of trapped vortices in superconductors is calculated. The motion equation for a magnetic flux line is solved assuming a bi-dimensional and mean-free-path-dependent Lorentzian-shaped pinning potential. The resulting surface resistance shows the unprecedented bell-shaped trend as a function of the mean-free-path observed in our previous experimental work. We demonstrate that such bell-shaped trend of the surface resistance, as a function of the mean-free-path, may be described as the interplay of the two limiting regimes of the surface resistance, for low and large mean-free-path values: pinning and flux-flow regimes respectively. By tackling the frequency dependence of the surface resistance, we also demonstrate that the separation between pinning- and flux-flow-dominated regimes cannot be determined only by the depinning frequency. The dissipation regime can be indeed tuned either by acting on the frequency or on the mean-free-path value.
