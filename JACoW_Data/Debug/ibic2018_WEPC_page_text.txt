MedAustron is a synchrotron based medical accelerator facility for particle therapy providing protons and carbon ions with clinical energies from 60 MeV to 250 MeV and 120 MeV/n to 400 MeV/n respectively. The facility features four irradiation rooms, three of which are dedicated to clinical operation and a fourth one to non-clinical research. Commissioning of all fixed lines has been completed for protons, while the commissioning for carbon ions and a proton gantry is ongoing. For the commissioning of carbon ions, precise measurements of the transverse beam emittance in the synchrotron are of importance, to minimize beam losses and to correct for possible emittance variations due to the different clinically relevant beam intensities defined by a degrader at the end of the Linac. The transverse beam emittance in the MedAustron synchrotron is measured via scraping at non-dispersive regions of the ring. The analysis procedure as well as emittance reconstruction accuracy for simulated data will be described in this paper, together with measurement results from the carbon commissioning.

The S-DALINAC is a thrice-recirculating, superconducting linear electron accelerator at TU Darmstadt. It can provide beams of electrons with energies up to 130 MeV and currents of 20 µA. The accelerator performance was improved by an extension of the beam diagnostics, as this increases the reproducibility of the machine settings. Therefore, the installation of several beam profile measurement stations is planned, which should be operational down to a beam current of 100 nA, as this current is used for beam tuning. Combining these devices with a quadrupole scan also allows for emittance measurements. The beam profile measurements shall be done based on optical transition radiation (OTR), resulting from the penetration of relativistic electrons from vacuum into a metal target. The radiation can be detected using standard cameras that provide information on the two-dimensional particle distribution. This contribution will address the layout of the measurement stations and a first test measurement will be presented.

The European-XFEL (E-XFEL) is an X-ray Free Electron Laser facility located in Hamburg (Germany). The superconducting accelerator for up to 17.5 GeV electrons will provide photons simultaneously to several user stations. Currently 12 Wire Scanner units are used to image transverse beam profiles in the high energy sections. These scanners provide a slow scan mode which is currently used to measure beam emittance and beam halo distributions. When operating with long bunch trains (>100 bunches) also fast scans are planned to measure beam sizes in an almost nondestructive manner. Scattered electrons can be detected with regular Beam Loss Monitors (BLM) as well as dedicated wire scanner detectors. Latter are installed in different variants at certain positions in the machine. Further developments are ongoing to optimize the sensitivity of the detectors to be able to measure both, beam halo and beam cores within the same measurement with the same detector. This paper describes the current status of the system and examples of different slow scan measurements.

The Echo Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) experiment has been implemented on the FEL2 line of the FERMI FEL at Elettra (Italy). The main purpose is to validate the expected performance improvements at short wavelengths before a dedicated major upgrade is deployed. This paper describes the new diagnostics and the operational experience with them during the EEHG experiment. By means of a multi position vacuum vertical manipulator, different optical components are positioned on the electron and seed laser path. Both transverse and longitudinal measurements are performed. A YAG:Ce screen (e beam) and a terbium doped UV scintillator (laser) are imaged on a dedicated CMOS camera. For the temporal alignment, an OTR screen and a scattering surface are used to steer radiation from the e-beam and laser, onto a fast photodetector. Also coherent OTR radiation, due to micro-bunching, is acquired by means of a PbSe photodetector. Finally, for the normal EEHG operation, the laser beam is injected on the electron beam axis by means of a UV reflecting mirror. The results of the installed diagnostics commissioning are here presented.

A Beam Induced Fluorescence (BIF) monitor is being developed as an essential part of the monitor update toward MW beam power operation at the J-PARC neutrino beamline. By measuring the fluorescence light from proton-gas interactions, the BIF monitor will be used as a continuous and non-destructive diagnostic tool for monitoring the proton beam profile spill-by-spill, with position and width precision on the order of 200 µm. The main challenge lies in collecting a sufficient amount of fluorescence light for the beam profile reconstruction while controlling the beam-induced noise with the current beamline configuration. A study is presented with a particular focus on the optical system under development, which allows us to transport fluorescence light away from the high radiation environment near the proton beamline and detect the optical signal with a Multi-Pixel Photon-Counter-based fast readout.

Xi’an Proton Application Facility (XiPAF) is composed of a linac injector, a 230-MeV synchrotron and a high energy transport line. To study the beam dynamics along beamline, a double-slit emittance meter is used to measure beam phase space in the linac. To have knowledge of phase space upstream of the emittance meter, an inverse transport method is proposed in the presence of space charge. The design and preliminary test results of the emittance meter are shown in this paper.

A fast beam size diagnostic system has been developed at SSRF (Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility) storage ring for turn-by-turn and bunch-by-bunch beam transverse oscillation study. This system is based on visible synchrotron radiation direct imaging system. Currently, this system already has good experimental results. However, this system still has some limitations, the resolution is subject to the point spread function and the speed of online data processing is limited by the complex algorithm. We present a technique that applied machine learning tools to predict transverse oscillation.

A proton therapy facility based on a superconducting cyclotron is under construction in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). In order to achieve precise treatment or dose distribution, the beam current would vary from 0.4 nA to 500 nA, in which case conventional non-intercepting instruments would fail due to their low sensitivity. So we propose to use a retractable scintillating screen to measure beam position and beam profile. In this paper, a comprehensive description of our new designed screen monitor is presented, including the choice of material of the screen, optical calibration and simulation of radiation protection. According to the off-line test, the resolution of the screen monitor can reach 0.13 mm/pixel.

The beam diagnostics beamline BL7B using synchrotron radiation with 8.6 keV critical photon energy from bending magnet has been used to measure the electron-beam size and photon-beam profile on real-time basis. After the completion of the PLS-II, the Compound Refractive Lens (CRL) system was implemented in the optical hutch at BL7B to measure the electron-beam size from X-ray imaging. But we could not have a good image due to short focal length caused by limited space of the optical hutch. To solve this problem a Pinole Camera is implemented in the front-end of BL7B in return for the beamline extension. The progresses on the new x-ray imaging system is introduced in this presentation.

A new generation of fast wire scanners is being produced as part of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project at CERN. The LIU beam parameters imply that these wire scanners will need to operate with significantly brighter beams. This requires wires scanner systems with micron level accuracy and wires with a considerably increased tolerance to beam damage. This paper presents the method of selection of such wires in terms of material choice and geometry. It also reports on studies with novel materials with a potential to further extend the reach of wire scanners for high brightness beams.
