Permanent magnets can provide many opportunities for accelerators in terms of energy and cost savings, and could significantly simplify their infrastructure. The recent developments in tunability could considerably widen their range of applications. I will review the recent advancements in materials and designs, and will give a perspective on future areas of applications.
