The BIBA (Busan Ion Beam Accelerator) is a compact linear accelerator facility using the 28 GHz ECRIS at the KBSI (Korea Basic Science Institute). Our goal is to generate high current fast neutrons using the heavy ion interaction with a proton target. For a stable operation of the superconducting magnets, the performance of cryostat system is very essential at the 28 GHz ECRIS. However, the emitted x-ray from inner plasma chamber contributes to increase an extra heat load to the cryostat system by absorbing the cold mass of the superconducting magnet. Therefore, we have measured X-ray spectra from the 28 GHz ECR ion source and tried to improve the performance of the Cryostat System by a radiation shielding. In this paper, we will present the test results of X-ray emission on 28GHz KBSI ECRIS and improved cooling system performance.

Electron cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS) plasma has been constructed for producing synthesized ion beams in Osaka Univ.[1,2] We hope that it can become a universal source capable of producing ions with wide range mass/charge ration (m/q). We have been trying to produce endohedral fullerenes in the ECRIS. We have conducted initial experiments on production of them only in the second stage of ECRIS. We have been using iron vapor source by induction heating (IH) from the mirror end along to the geometrical axis, and C60 crucible from the side wall, respectively. We succeeded in realizing ECR plasma that fullerene and iron ions coexist on the single stage ECRIS, even by 1kV extraction voltage.[3] By these experimental series, the typical CSD suggests that there is possibility of slight formation of iron fullerenes compounds and iron endohedral fullerenes. We are continuing to investigate the experimental conditions that maximize spectrum corresponding to iron endohedral fullerenes. In this paper we describe preliminary experimental results of synthesizing iron-endohedral fullerene on the ECRIS.

We have begun searching for the new super-heavy element (SHE) with Z=119 at RIKEN Heavy Ion LINAC (RILAC). To overcome the small production cross section of vanadium (V) beam on the curium target, the project requires a very powerful V beam. In order to optimize the beam intensity of V with the charge state of 13+, we have investigated the effects of the amount of V vapor, the power of 18- and 28-GHz microwaves, and the strength of the mirror field. While no significant effect was seen by changing the mirror field Bext from 1.4 T to 1.6 T, the amount of V vapor and the microwave power strongly affected. Based on the correlation between the V-vapor and the microwave power, we obtained a 600-euA V(13+) beam with the V consumption rate of 24 mg/h and the microwave power of 2.9 kW in order to execute about 1-month SHE experiment. Furthermore, because such strong mirror field enhances the transverse beam emittance, it is important to control the emittance with small reduction of the intensity. We have successfully controlled the beam emittance by using three pairs of slits (triplet slits) in LEBT by eliminating the peripheral beam components in both of the x-x’ and y-y’ phase spaces.

We are aiming at producing various ion beams in ECRIS. In the case of producing multicharged ion beams, we try to enhance loss channel of low Z ions by means of adding pulse modulated microwaves to conventional gas mixing method.* Through these experiments, we explore the feasibility of selectively heating specific ions with pulse modulated microwaves and launching another low frequency RF waves. In gas mixing experiment, we use Helium as low Z gas for production of multicharged Ar and Xenon ion beams. These experiments are conducted by keeping the total pressure constant and changing the mixing ratio of Helium. The time scale of pulsed microwave is typically several to several hundreds of microseconds. We optimize the pulse period and duty ratio for producing multicharged ion beams. These effects are investigated to measure Charge State Distributions (CSDs). Also, we can measure the emittance using wire probe and multi slit attached to Ion Beam Irradiation System (IBIS). ** We estimate the normalized emittance from this measurement to determine index of ion temperature in the ECRIS. In this paper, we mainly describe the results of these active and additive methods at the ECRIS.

Electron cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS) has been constructed for producing synthesized ion beams in Osaka Univ.*,** Xe is used as fuel for ion propulsion engines on artificial satellites. There are problems of accumulated damages at irradiation and sputtering by low energy Xe ion from the engine. It is required to construct experimentally sputtering yield databases of ion beams in the low energy region from several hundred eV to 1keV, since there are not enough data of satellite component materials. Therefore, we are trying to investigate experimentally sputtering yield on materials by irradiating the low energy single species Xeq+ ion beams. However, there is a problem that if the low extraction voltage, the amount of beam currents is not enough to obtain ion beam flux for precise evaluation of sputtering yield data. Thus, we conduct to decelerate Xeq+ ion beams required low energy region after extracting at high voltage, e.g., 10kV. We measured the decelerated beam profile with x and y direction wire probes. As a result, we were able to estimate the dose of ion fluxes. We are going to conduct irradiation experiments on various materials.

Cyclotron instabilities in Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) plasmas are related to non-linear interaction between plasma waves and energetic electrons, resulting in strong microwave emission, a burst of energetic electrons escaping the plasma, and the periodic oscillations of the extracted beam currents. Precedent investigation of cyclotron instabilities has proved that Bmin/BECR can be treated as a magnetic field threshold. Recently, experiments with SECRAL-II ion source demonstrate that Bmin/BECR is not the only knob, and other field parameters have also been found to be related to cyclotron instabilities, such as mirror ratio and radial field. Namely, the trigger of cyclotron instability is a combination of many magnetic field parameters. This paper will give the experimental setup at IMP for cyclotron instability investigations and experimental observations will be presented.
