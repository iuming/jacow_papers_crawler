Development of the MARS-D ECR ion source, a 45 GHz next generation ECRIS using a NbTi MARS-magnet, has been continuously moving forward at LBNL. Recent stress analyses and other key components of the MARS-D ion source have been essentially finalized. This article presents and discusses the status of this new 45 GHz ECR ion source, such as the latest design features and the fabrication plan with funding available in the very near future.

Ion beam analysis is typically based on tandem accelerators and negative ions. The required 5-20 MeV energies for heavy ion time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis* (ToF-ERDA) can be achieved with a high charge state ion source and RFQ accelerator. We present a conceptual design of a ToF-ERDA facility based on a permanent magnet ECRIS and variable frequency RFQ accelerating 1-10 pnA of 40Ar8+, 84Kr17+ and 129Xe24+ ions to 4-7, 10-15 and 13-20 MeV. We present the PM ECRIS requirements focusing on the CUBE-ECRIS** with a quadrupole min-B field topology. Beam dynamics studies demonstrating good transmission of the heavy ion beams from the ion source to the RFQ entrance through the electrostatic low energy beam transport (LEBT) and a permanent magnet dipole are presented. The predicted LEBT transmissions of the CUBE-ECRIS (rectangular extraction slit) and a conventional ECRIS (circular extraction aperture) are compared. The conceptual design of the RFQ is described and the implications of the energy spread on the high energy beam transport are discussed. It is demonstrated that an energy spread below 0.2 % is necessary for appropriate resolution of the heavy ion ToF-ERDA.

To satisfy ultimate performance requirements for heavy ions, a 28 GHz superconducting ECR ion source is under development at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) in collaboration with Berkeley National Laboratory. The construction and testing of the superconducting magnet was completed at Berkeley and delivered to FRIB in January 2018. The magnet and cryostat have been assembled on the high voltage platform. Magnet cooldown and field mapping are planned by the end of 2020. The source commissioning shall start in early 2021. Details of the ion source design, current status of assembly, and commissioning plan will be presented in this paper.
