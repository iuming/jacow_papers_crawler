Requirements to high performances for modern FEL facilities transform to requirements of high stability of the field amplitude and phase in RF gun cavity. To provide high quality of bunches, RF gun cavities with photo cathodes operate in electron sources with high electric, hence, magnetic RF fields. Related to pulsed RF heating effects manifest themselves, which results in a change of the cavity frequency and quality factor even during several microseconds in RF pulse. Cavity deformations due to pulsed heating are considered and corresponding deviations in cavity frequency are evaluated basing both on general relations and results of numerical simulations. Resulting unavoidable deviations in the phase and the amplitude of the RF field in the cavity are estimated in dependence on the RF pulse duration.
