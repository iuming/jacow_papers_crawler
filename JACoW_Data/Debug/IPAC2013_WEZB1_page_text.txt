WEZB101
Status of the European XFEL

The European XFEL is one of the world's largest accelerators presently under construction. The facility includes a 17.5 GeV superconducting linac with more than 3 km of electron beam transport lines and up to 5 FEL undulators. In mid-2013 the underground civil construction will finish. With most of the large scale production in full swing and first accelerator components installed, this talk should present the XFEL facility status and plans for accelerator commissioning including prospects for first XFEL experiments in Hamburg.

Overview of Seeding Methods for FELs
2063

In recent years enormous progress has been achieved in the theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of FEL seeding. The state of the art for FEL seeding should be reviewed and compared to HHG, HGHG, EEHG techniques. The potential of various seeding methods and their promise to produce radiation pulses that approach the transform limit in a range of experimental configurations at different user facilities should be explored.
