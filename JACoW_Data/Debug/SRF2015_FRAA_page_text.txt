The talk will provide an overview on the latest advances of tuner development for SRF applications. Issues and present approaches on how to resolve them will be emphasized for both TM and TEM cavities and examples from various labs and projects (XFEL, LCLS-II, ESS, SPL, ARIEL, SPIRAL2, FRIB, ANL, IFMIF) will be given in order to better explain issues and solutions. Details on author’s contributions to European-XFEL tuner activity for 1.3 GHz and 3.9 GHz cavities will be also shown.

Module Performance in XFEL Cryomodule Mass-Production

The European XFEL cryomodule assembly is executed in CEA-Saclay premises and infrastructure by an industrial company, Alsyom, under the supervision of CEA. The nominal assembly throughput and delivery rate of one cryomodule per week has been reached with XM15 in October 2015. With a throughput of 4 days in place in January 2015 with XM26, the delivery of XM100 is currently foreseen before mid-2016. This contribution will present the status of this large scale production project, insisting on the challenges, both technical and organizational, for achieving the quantitative production goal, and on the enhanced quality control put in place in parallel to achieve the qualitative goals in term of module conformance and RF performance. Mitigation of non-conformities generated by the accelerator components, by the assembly tools and finally by the assembly process is essential to eliminate their impact on the production schedule and, especially for the last category, on the module acceptance. The most significant module test results will be discussed with emphasis on their correlation (or lack of thereof) to detailed assembly conditions and their evolution.

Cornell has designed, fabricated, and tested (by the time of the conference) a high current (100 mA) CW SRF prototype cryomodule for the Cornell ERL. This talk will report on the design and performance of this very high Q0 CW cryomodule including design issues and mitigation strategies.

The straight beam line of SETF at Peking University is under construction, which consists of a DC-SRF photoinjector and a superconducting linac with two 9-cell cavities. Stable operation of the DC-SRF photoinjector has been realized and the design, manufacture and assembly of the cryomodule with two 9-cell cavities have been completed. Improved capacitive coupling RF power coupler and fast tuner with piezo are adopted

The driver linac for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) will require the production of 48 cryomodules. FRIB has completed the fabrication and testing of a β=0.085 quarter-wave cryomodule as a pre-production prototype. This cryomodule qualified the performance of the resonators, fundamental power couplers, tuners, and cryogenic systems of the β=0.085 quarter-wave design. In addition to the successful systems qualification; the ReA6 cryomodule build also verified the FRIB bottom up assembly and alignment method. The lessons learned from the ReA6 cryomodule build, as well as valuable fabrication, sourcing, and assembly experience are applied to the design and fabrication of FRIB production cryomodules. This paper will report the results of the β=0.085 quarter-wave cryomodule testing, fabrication, and assembly; production implications to future cryomodules will also be presented.
