Challenges of Radioactive Beam Facilities – Comparing Solutions at SPIRAL2 and FAIR

The SPIRAL2 facility at GANIL will use a high-power p, d and heavy-ion driver to produce RIB though both ISOL and in-flight techniques. The SPIRAL2-injector beam is expected before the end of 2014. The construction of the FAIR facility has started at GSI and the outline of the accelerator complex is well defined. A clear strategy and construction schedule is defined in the framework of the international FAIR collaboration. This talk will give an overview of the accelerators at both facilities and compare the characteristics and benefits of these two approaches to meet their user needs.
