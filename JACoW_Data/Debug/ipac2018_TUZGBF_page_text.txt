A superconducting magnet gantry has been used at HIMAC in NIRS, transporting beams for carbon ion radiotherapy. A second superconducting gantry, with a different design, is under construction in Yamagata University. This invited talk presents an overview of these gantry designs, their advantages for light ion radiotherapy, their operational experiences, and future perspectives for superconducting radiotherapy gantries.

Many of the ~1000 hospital-based medical (proton) cyclotrons around the world today operate between 11 and 24 MeV, an ideal energy range for the production of a number of metallic radionuclides that are experiencing a dramatic increase in clinical demand. A Canadian team led by TRIUMF, has developed a solid target hardware configuration with a demonstrated irradiation capability between 2 and 12 kW for up to 6 hours on multiple cyclotron types. Production of Tc-99m, Cu-64 and Ga-68 have been demonstrated, with the team having also established Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) purification parameters under the operational capabilities of various machines. Plans are in place to expand and enable the production of a number of other metallic radioisotopes as the nuclear medicine community mobilizes to address a number of unmet clinical needs. This presentation will provide a summary of the hardware development effort, isotope production and purification capabilities, as well as the imaging and therapeutic applications that are driving clinical demand for Tc, Ga, Cu and a growing number of metal-based medical isotopes.

Betatron Core Slow Extraction at CNAO

CNAO is the only Italian hadrontherapy facility able to treat tumors with beams of protons and carbon ions. Beam is extracted with a momentum selection scheme in which beam enters the third order resonance driven by a betatron core. When irradiating a tumor, it is thought as divided in the longitudinal plane in several slices while each slice is divided in the transverse plane in several spots called voxels. Considering the dose uniformity that can be obtained during extraction, the machine must extract an average intensity related to the voxel that requires less dose. Therefore during a treatment, for some slices, a technique is needed to lower the extracted beam intensity with respect to the nominal one. A way to guarantee the correct average intensity according to the treatment planning requirements, is to introduce a mechanical filter (a degrader) that reduces the intensity of the accelerated particles. However this method used in the first treatments at CNAO showed some disadvantages and it has been replaced by what has been called the "dynamic betatron" method. The paper shows the implementations and the advantages of this method in the CNAO treatments.

iThemba LABS has developed a strategy to respond to the need to expand the research agenda of the facility, as well as to seize the opportunity to exploit the growing global demand for radioisotopes. This strategy will depend on the existing accelerator and isotope production infrastructure, as well as the acquisition of a cyclotron capable of accelerating protons to 70 MeV at beam currents in excess of 700 microampere. This development will be approached in two phases: Phase 1 will include the migration of the existing radioisotope production from the separated-sector cyclotron (SSC) to a new 70 MeV cyclotron. This rearrangement will increase the isotope production capability and also free up the SSC for research. In phase 2, beams of artificial isotopes will be produced at energies up to 5 MeV/nucleon to allow iThemba LABS to expand its research capabilities to new frontiers. The various different aspects of the proposed project will be discussed.

Linac-based system for borehole logging exploits KlyLac approach combing klystron and linac sharing the same electron beam, vacuum volume, and RF network enabling self-oscillation due to a positive feedback. The KlyLac prototype design tailors delivering ~1 MeV electrons in a linac section using part of the beam injected from a sheet beam klystron (SBK). The linac part is based on a very robust, high group velocity, cm-wave, and a standing wave accelerating structure of a 'cross-pin' type supplied by a sampler. The SBK part features a permanent magnet solenoid focusing, relatively low voltage, and high aspect ratio beam. The main SBK characteristics (perveance, power, and efficiency) are expected to be similar to that for a magnetron.
