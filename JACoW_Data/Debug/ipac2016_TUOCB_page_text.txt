The SuperKEKB, an electron-positron collider with asymmetric energies in KEK, has started the first commissioning with beams this year. One of major tasks in the commissioning is the beam scrubbing of new beam pipes in order to increase the beam lifetime and to decrease the background noise of the particle detector in the coming physics run. The temperatures and the vacuum pressures of new vacuum components, such as the bellows chambers, gate valves and the beam collimators, should be checked in this run. The decrease rate in the vacuum pressure are measured to estimate the vacuum scrubbing effect. Reported here will be the results obtained during the first commissioning and the present status of the vacuum system.

Reduction of SEY was achieved by surface engineering through laser ablation with a laser operating at • = 355 nm. It was shown that the SEY can be reduced to near or below 1 on copper, aluminium and 316LN stainless steel. The laser treated surfaces show an increased surface resistance, with a wide variation in resistance found de-pending on the exact treatment details. However, a treated copper surface with similar surface resistance to aluminium was produced.

One of the features for newly designed magnets for the SPring-8 major upgrade plan* is permanent magnet based dipole magnets for substantial energy saving. The new dipole magnets have been designed to be equipped with (i) a field variable function by controlling magnetic flux into a beam axis, (ii) a nose structure on iron poles for smooth B-field transition in the longitudinal gradient field, and (iii) a nearly zero temperature coefficient of magnet circuit with the help of a shunt alloy**. Demagnetization due to radiation is also a critical issue. At SPring-8, demagnetization process has been intensively studied, and the effect has been considered in the design of dipole magnets. Although electromagnet based multi-pole magnets are rather conventional technologies, yet new magnets need to be designed to fit in the next generation high packing factor lattice with as reasonably lower energy consumption as possible. Magnet alignment will be a key development as well; in order to secure adequate dynamic apertures, magnets ought to be aligned within tens of microns. Current design and recent progress in the developments of magnets and alignment schemes will be presented.
