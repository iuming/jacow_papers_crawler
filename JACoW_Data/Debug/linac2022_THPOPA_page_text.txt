The goal of FLASH2020+ upgrade is to increase the energy of the FLASH accelerator, which allows the use of even shorter wavelengths, which, in turn, will allow new research. For this purpose, during the shutdown in 2022, two superconducting accelerator modules for ACC2 and ACC3 will be replaced by new ones. To fully realize the potential of these cryomodules XFEL type of waveguide distributions will be installed on them. In addition, the existing ACC4 and ACC5 cryomodules will also be equipped with the new waveguide distributions, similar XFEL type. These waveguide distributions will be modified and improved so that the machine can operate with the maximum energy due to individual power supply for each cavity. Furthermore, three RF stations will receive a new klystron waveguide distribution, which will improve the reliability of all systems. The specific waveguide distributions have been developed, produced and tested at the Waveguide Assembly and Test Facility (WATF) at DESY. All together will lead to increasing the electron beam energy from 1.25 to 1.35 GeV. This paper presents data on the production and tuning of waveguide distribution systems for the FLASH2020+ upgrade at DESY.

The aim of present study is to determine end-point energies of the bremsstrahlung photons energy spectra emitted from 28-GHz ECRIS by using inverse-matrix unfold method. Azimuthal angular distribution of the bremsstrahlung photons from 28-GHz ECRIS were measured at Busan Center of KBSI. Gamma-ray detection system consists of three round type NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors positioned 62 cm radially from the beam axis and another detector placed at the extraction port for monitoring photon intensity along the beam axis. Bremsstrahlung photons energy spectra were measured at six azimuthal angles at RF power of 1 kW. Monte Carlo simulation based on Geant4 package was performed to take the geometrical acceptance and energy-dependent detection efficiency into account due to large non-uniformity in the material budget. We extracted true bremsstrahlung energy spectra using the inverse-matrix unfolding method. The end-point energies of the bremsstrahlung photons after application of deconvolution method were found to be 1.320±0.050 MeV, 1.530±0.070 MeV, 1.540±0.070 MeV, 1.690±0.030 MeV, 1.530±0.070 MeV and 1.690±0.030 MeV for 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° and 330°, respectively.

The CERN Linear Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) at CERN is a versatile user facility providing a 200 MeV electron beam for accelerator R&D, irradiation studies for space, and medical applications. After successful operation in 2017-2020, CLEAR running was extended in 2021 for another 5-year period. In the paper we give a status of the facility, outlining recent progress in beam performance and hardware improvements. We report on beam operation over the last years and review the main results of experimental activities. Finally, we discuss the planned upgrades together with the proposed future experimental program.

The interest for Very High Energy Electron (VHEE) radiotherapy (RT) for cancer treatment recently bloomed, given the present availability of high-gradient accelerator technology for compact, cost effective electron linacs in the 100-200 MeV energy range. Particularly promising is the so called FLASH high dose rate regime, in which cancer cells are damaged while healthy tissue is largely spared. VHEE beams are especially adapted for FLASH RT, given their penetration depth and the high beam current, needed to treat large deep seated tumors. In the CERN Linear Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) facility, a series of unique studies have been initiated on VHEE and FLASH RT issues, in collaboration with several multidisciplinary user groups. In this paper we briefly outline the activities and its main recent results, e.g. on localized dose deposition by beam focusing, and on chemical and biological test to clarify damage mechanisms. We then describe in details the dedicated systems and the techniques adopted - and in large part locally developed by the CLEAR team - in order to satisfy the user requirements, with particular attention to the crucial aspect of high dose rate dosimetry.

Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) designed and developed a high stability modulator system for a commercial linear accelerator application. The DTI modulator delivers significant advantages in klystron performance through highly reliable functionality as well as flicker- and droop-free operation from 50-500 microseconds up to 400 Hz (duty limited). The main assemblies on the DTI system consist of a controls rack, high voltage power supply (HVPS), modulator, and cooling manifolds for the modulator, high voltage power supply and klystron tube. Two HVPS (upgradeable to four) provide stable and accurate DC voltage which is used to drive a CPI VKP-8352C UHF-band pulsed klystron for the linear accelerator. A solid state series switch, based on DTI’s patented design, provides both pulse control and arc protection to the klystron. Operating with four HVPS, the DTI modulator is able to operate at a maximum average power of ~750 kW at 105 kV, 47 A nominal. At the end of the initial contract, DTI provided two systems and a total of four HVPS (two of which are used with each system).

The MedAustron Ion Therapy Centre is a synchrotron-based particle therapy facility, which delivers proton and carbon beams for clinical treatments. Currently, the facility treats 40 patients per day and is improving its systems and workflows to further increase this number. Although MedAustron is a young and modern center, the life-cycle of certain crucial control electronics is near end-of-life and needs to be addressed. This paper presents the 216MHz injector Low-Level Radio Frequency (iLLRF) system with option of use for the synchrotron Low-Level Radio Frequency (sLLRF - 0.4-10MHz). The developed system will unify the cavity regulation for both LLRFs and will also be used for beam diagnostics (injector/synchrotron) and RF knock-out slow extraction. The new LLRF system is based on a µTCA platform which is controlled by the MedAustron Control System based on NI-PXIe. Currently, it supports fiberoptics links (SFP+), but other links (e.g. EPICS, DOOCS) can be established. The modular implementation of this LLRF allows connections to other components, such as motors, amplifiers, or interlock systems, and will increase the robustness and maintainability of the accelerator.

The SPIRAL2 superconducting linac has been successfully commissioned with protons in 2020. During the commissioning, a model of the cavity and its LLRF control loop has been developed. The model enables to have better understanding of the system and was used to guide the tuning of the PI(D) correctors for beam loading compensation. Here we review the development of such a tool, computed with MATLAB Simulink and using the frequency domain (Laplace transfer function) to model the cavity RF and mechanical behaviours (Lorentz detuning), as well as all elements that compose the RF control loop (digital LLRF, amplifier, transmission lines, etc.). The benchmarking of the model with measurement carried out with the proton beam is also discussed in this contribution.

Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities are used in modern particle accelerators to take advantage of their very high quality factor (Q). A higher Q means that a higher RF field can be sustained, and a higher acceleration can be produced in the cavity for length unity. However, in certain situations, e.g., too high RF field, the SRF cavities can experience quenches that risk creating damage due to the rapid increase in the heat load. This is especially negative in continuous wave (CW) operation due to the impossibility of the system to recover during the off-load period. The design goal of a quench-detection system is to protect the system without being a limiting factor during the operation. In this paper, we compare two different classification approaches for improving a quench detection system. We perform tests using traces recorded from LCLS-II and show that the ARSENAL classifier outperforms a CNN classifier in terms of accuracy.

We propose a tuner control system for low-energy superconducting linac at RAON. The frequency error of the superconducting cavities must be smaller than a few of Hz to operate in beam acceleration mode. To minimize the freuqency error as much as possible, the error is calculated in the low-level RF(LLRF), and the proposed tuner control system changes the superconducting cavity frequency by using a mechanical tuner and a motor attached to the cavity directly. This control system deals with not only the initial frequency error of the cavity but also the frequency drift of the cavity induced by external disturbance such as the slow fluctuation helium pressure automatically. In addition, an automatic proportional gain calibration technique is also proposed. In this paper, the detailed operation and techniques will be described.

Funding: This work was supported through the KOMAC operation fund by the Ministry of Science and ICT of Korean government.
As a part of R&D toward the RFQ based heavy ion irradiation system, the 1 MeV/n RFQ was designed, brazed, installed and commissioned by staff researchers and engineers at KOMAC of KAERI. This 1 MeV/n RFQ system includes the microwave ion source, EBIS, RFQ, quadrupole magnets, switching magnet and the target systems. The digital based Low-Level RF was developed to provide the stable accelerating field to the RFQ. This Low-Level RF has features such as direct RF detection/generation without mixer, non-IQ sampling, PI feedback control, iterative learning based feed-forward control, and the digital RF interlock. In this paper, the characteristics of Low-Level RF are described, as well as the processes and results of an initial RF driving test for the RFQ’s RF conditioning.

LCLS-II is an X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) under commissioning at SLAC, being the first Continuous Wave (CW) hard XFEL in the world to come into operation. To accelerate the electron beam to an energy of 4 GeV, 280 superconducting cavities of the TESLA types are used. A Loaded Q (QL) value of 4x107 is used to drive the cavities at a power level of a few kilowatts. For this QL value, the RF cavity bandwidth is equal to 32 Hz. Therefore, keeping the cavity resonance frequency within such bandwidth is imperative to avoid a significant increase in the required RF power. In superconducting accelerators, resonance frequency variations are produced by mechanical microphonic vibrations of the cavities. One source of microphonics noise is rotary machinery such as vacuum pumps or HVAC equipment. A possible method to reject these disturbances is to use Narrowband Active Noise Control (NANC) techniques. Such a technique was already tested at DESY/CMTB and Cornell/CBETA. This proceeding presents the implementation of a NANC controller in the LCLS-II Low Level RF (LLRF) control system. Tests on the rejection of LCLS-II microphonics disturbances are also presented.

Low Level RF systems have historically fallen into two categories. Custom systems developed at national laboratories or industrial systems using custom hardware specifically designed for LLRF. Recently however advances in RF technology accompanied by demand from applications like quantum computing have led to commercially available systems that are viable for building a modular low-level RF system. Here we present an overview of a Keysight based digital LLRF system. Our system employs analog upconversion and downconversion with an intermediate frequency of 100MHz. We discuss our phase-reference system and provide initial results on the system performance.

The current analog LLRF systems which have supported the APS linac operation for over 25 years, will be replaced with digital LLRF systems utilizing the latest commercially available electronics technology. A customized LLRF system has been developed as the next-generation APS linac controller. Two systems have been manufactured and delivered to the APS. On-site tests demonstrated they met the APS linac operation requirements with the first system expected to be integrated into APS linac operation this year.

The JLAB LLRF 3.0 system has been developed and is replacing the 30-year-old LLRF systems in the CEBAF accelerator. The LLRF system builds upon 25 years of design and operational RF control experience (digital and analog), and our recent collaboration in the design of the LCLSII LLRF system. The new system also incorporates a cavity control algorithm using a fully functional phase and amplitude locked Self Exciting Loop (SELAP). The first system (controlling 8 cavities) was installed and commissioned in August of 2021. Since then the new LLRF system has been operating with cavity gradients up to 20 MV/m, and electron beam currents up to 350 uA. This paper discusses the operational experience of the LLRF 3.0 SELAP algorithm along with other software and firmware tools like cavity and klystron characterization and quench detection.

A server-based quench detection system is used since the beginning of operation at the European XFEL (2017) to stop driving superconducting cavities if they experience a quench. While this approach effectively detects quenches, it also generates false positives, tripping the accelerating stations when failures other than quenches occur. Using the post-mortem data snapshots generated for every trip, an additional signal (referred to as residual) is systematically computed based on the standard cavity model. Following an initial training on a set of such residuals derived from quench as well as non-quench events, two independent machine learning engines analyze routinely the trip snapshots and their residuals to identify if a trip was indeed triggered by a quench or has another root cause. The outcome of the analysis is automatically appended to the data snapshots and distributed to a team of experts. This constitutes a fully deployed example of machine-learning-assisted failure classification to identify quenches, supporting experts in their daily routine of monitoring and documenting the accelerator uptime and availability.
