The design of the Large Hadron collider integrates more than 40 years of knowledge starting with the Intersecting Storage rings where hadron beams were first stored and stochastic cooling was discovered followed by the SPS proton-antiproton collider and the Tevatron, the first large superconducting machine. Lessons learned along the way and their impact on the LHC are discussed.
