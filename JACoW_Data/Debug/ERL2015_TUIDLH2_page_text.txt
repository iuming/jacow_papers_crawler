Magnetic compression of ultra-relativistic electron bunches in a 180 deg periodic arc, made of identical double bend achromats, has recently been proposed*; its performance surpasses, to the author’s knowledge, that of any past studies on the subject, by reaching higher compression factors at larger bunch charges, and by upper-limiting the normalized transverse emittance growth to the 0.1 micron level. Chromatic aberrations and nonlinearity in the particle longitudinal dynamics are reduced with sextupole magnets. Coherent synchrotron radiation-induced emittance growth is minimized with a proper choice of beam optics and compression factor per cell. The design is supported by analytical considerations that found confirmation in particle tracking results. In this article, we enlarge our study to the dependence of the beam final emittance on optics, bunch charge and beam energy. The range of validity of the linear optics approach is discussed, together with limits of applicability of the lattice under consideration.

eRHIC adopts FFAG multi-pass ERL as its electron accelerator to provide up to 21.2 GeV electron beam. It takes 12 passes to reach 15.9 GeV and 16 passes to reach 21.2 GeV. The longitudinal dynamics of eRHIC ERL is essential to ensure the energy recovery efficiency and prevention of beam loss. We will present the results of the start to end simulation study for eRHIC ERL, to address this issue.
