Several years of experience using TANGO Control system are discussed in this paper. Construction of Linear Induction Accelerator (LIA-20) was the driving force for introduction of TANGO in Budker Institute. In the frame of this project, significant number of TANGO Classes for different types of hardware were developed and basic program infrastructure was provided. This progress made it feasible to apply TANGO to other facilities. Therefore, it was used in some subsystems at VEPP-2000 and vacuum stand. This paper presents overview of construction of TANGO based control system. The problems, which arise during its introduction to existing control system, are discussed as well.

The review of modern approach to synchronizing large physical installations including accelerators is given in this paper. This approach is based on using digital modules connected by an optical link to transfer a mixed clock/data signal. A sub-nanosecond jitter and nanosecond resolution can be achieved this way as well as dynamic delay compensation and precision timing. Several modern synchronization systems based on this principle are discussed: White Rabbit, MRF, J-PARC and BINP developments.

The paper describes bunch dimension measurements in VEPP-2000 collider at energy 350 MeV. The three bunch dimensions (transverse sizes along with bunch length) was measured against bunch current to detect the energy spread growth. Emmitance growth due to multiple intrabeam scattering was observed at bunch current below turbulence bunch lengthening threshold. The thresholds of these proceses was used to estimate values of longitudinal impedance. Obtained values in a good agreement with predictions.
