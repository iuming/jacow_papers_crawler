This presentation describes the International Linear Collider (ILC), an e+ and e- collider based on the superconducting linear accelerator with a center of mass energy of 500 GeV in the first stage, upgradeable to 1 TeV. According to the statement of the Science Council of Japan, MEXT (Ministry of Education, Science, and Sports) and the Japanese government have investigated the feasibility of the ILC project, not only from the scientific view, but also the political, economical, and sociological points of view. The latest status of the project will be presented.
