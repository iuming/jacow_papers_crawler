The Helmholtzinstitut Mainz (HIM) performs test experiments related to a possible improvement of high energy electron coolers. Results and activities concerning non-invasive beam diagnostics and beam control under large operational currents will be presented. Further, progress of our project to use turbogenerators as a means for potential free power generation in high energy electron coolers is presented.

The laser assisted H− charge exchange concept is under development at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) as on option for replacing traditional carbon-based foil technology in future accelerators. A laser based stripping system has the potential to alleviate limiting issues with foil technology, paving the way for accumulation of much higher density proton beams. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of a laser-based stripping system compared with traditional foil-based charge exchange systems for various beam accumulation scenarios, scaling from SNS experience with high power beam injection and calculations of laser stripping parameters. In addition, preparations for an experimental demonstration of laser assisted stripping for microsecond long 1 GeV, H− beams are described.

When the dynamics within an electron bunch is dominated by its angular momentum rather than other effects, the beam is said to be angular-momentum-dominated "magnetized". Such a beam can be directly applied to the field of electron-cooling of heavy ions; or it can be manipulated into a flat electron beam with a large transverse emittance ratio. A flat beam is of interest for high-energy electron-positron colliders or accelerator-based light sources where the radiation-generation device has a flat interaction surface. In this talk, the experimental results of round-to-flat beam transformation is presented and possible applications explored.

Ionization cooling is the preferred method of cooling a muon beam for the purposes of a bright muon source. This process works by sending a muon beam through an absorbing material and replacing the lost longitudinal momentum with radio frequency (RF) cavities. To maximize the effect of cooling, a small optical beta function is required at the locations of the absorbers. Strong focusing is therefore required, and as a result normal conducting RF cavities must operate in external magnetic fields on the order of 10 Tesla. Vacuum and high pressure gas filled RF test cells have been studied at the MuCool Test Area at Fermilab. Methods for mitigating breakdown in both test cells, as well as the effect of plasma loading in the gas filled test cell have been investigated. The results of these tests, as well as the current status of the two leading muon cooling channel designs, will be presented.
