J-PARC is developing the reacceleration system of the ultra slow (30 meV) muon (USM) obtained by two-photon laser resonant ionization of muonium atoms. The muon beam thus obtained has low emittance, meeting the requirement for the g-2/EDM experiment. J-PARC E34 experiment aims to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) with a precision of 0.1 ppm and search for EDM with a sensitivity to 10-21 e cm. The USM's are accelerated to 212 MeV by using a muon dedicated linac to be a ultra cold muon beam. The muon LINAC consists of an RFQ, a inter-digital H-mode DTL, disk and washer coupled cell structures, and disk loaded structures. The ultra-cold muons will have an extremely small transverse momentum spread of 0.1% with a normalized transverse emittance of around 1.5 pi mm-mrad. Proof of the slow muon acceleration scheme is an essential step to realize the world first muon linac. In October 2017, we have succeeded to accelerate slow negative muoniums generated using a simpler muonium source to 89 keV. In this talk, present design of the muon linac and the result of the world first muon acceleration experiment are reported.

Radioactive Ion Beams: A Global Overview of Facilities and New Techniques

The family of Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) facilities is growing and gaining capabilities with new projects in preparation at RISP (Korea), INFN-LNL (SPES), GSI (FAIR) and expanding facilities at ISAC (ARIEL), NSCL (FRIB), ISOLDE (HIE-Isolde), RIKEN (RIBF), ANL (Caribu) and others. The programs are based on the ISOL or fragmentation production techniques with added capabilities of gas-stopping and reacceleration for the fragment approach and the fragmentation of reaccelerated RIBs produced using the ISOL technique. Physics programs are broad with increasing interest in the development of theranostic ions for medical applications. This invited talk will give an overview of the global progress in developments and accelerator physics at radioactive beam facilities.

Driven by the development of next generation heavy ion accelerators such as IMP-HIAF, GSI-FAIR, RIKEN-RIBF, SPIRAL 2, JLEIC and so on that need very intense highly charged heavy ion beam injectors working at either pulsed or CW modes, intense research and development work towards more powerful ion sources have been made in different laboratories, which likewise has stimulated obvious advancement of the performances in recent years. However, even the best performing ion sources can't meet all the requirements. While the ion source researchers are tackling the next generation ion sources development, it is worth investigating the possibilities of other solutions, especially when very intense heavy ion beams are needed for the more intense and powerful heavy ion accelerators, for instance the driver accelerator to study inertial confinement fusion with heavy ion. This invited talk presents recent advancements of highly charged heavy ion sources, and discusses the other possible approaches for intense highly charged heavy ion beams for future heavy ion accelerators.
