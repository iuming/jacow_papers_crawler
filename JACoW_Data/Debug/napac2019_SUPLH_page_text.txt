Intrinsic emittance of photocathodes limits the brightness of electrons beams produced from photoemission guns. Recent advancements have shown that an order of magnitude improvement in intrinsic emittance over the commonly used polycrystalline metal and semiconductor cathodes is possible via use of single crystalline ordered surfaces of metals, semiconductors and other exotic materials at cryogenic temperatures as cathodes. However, due to practical design considerations, it is not trivial to test such cathodes in existing electron guns. Here we present the design of a 200kV DC electron gun being developed at the Arizona State University for this purpose.

We study turn-by-turn fluctuations in the number of emitted photons in an undulator, installed in the IOTA electron storage ring at Fermilab, with an InGaAs PIN photodiode and an integrating circuit. In this paper, we present a theoretical model for the experimental data from previous similar experiments and in our present experiment, we attempt to verify the model in an independent and a more systematic way. Moreover, in our experiment we consider the regime of very small fluctuation when the contribution from the photon shot noise is significant, whereas we believe it was negligible in the previous experiments. Accordingly, we present certain critical improvements in the experimental setup that let us measure such a small fluctuation.

In this talk I will discuss the production and application of sub-femtosecond x-ray pulses recently generated at LCLS. I will focus on angular streaking as the measurement technique to resolve the extremely short x-ray pulses. This method exploits phase dependent energy modulation of a photoelectron ionized in the presence of a strong laser field with circular polarization. I will present experimental results of single shot images and preliminary analysis results. Specifically I will discuss two applications of this technique: streaking of the Auger electrons and measuring the shape resonance directly in the time domain.

Crystal optical devices are widely used in X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) systems, monochromators, beam splitters, high-reflectance backscattering mirrors, lenses, phase plates, diffraction gratings, and spectrometers. The absorption of X-ray in these optical devices can cause increase of temperature and consequent thermal deformation, which can dynamic change in optic output. In self-seeding XFEL, the thermal deformation and strain in monochromator could cause significant seed quality degradation: central energy shift, band broadening and reduction in seed power. To quantitatively estimate the impact of thermomechanical effects on seed quality, we conduct thermomechanical simulations combined with diffraction to evaluate the seed quality with residual temperature field in a pump-probe manner. With our results, we show that a critical repetition rate could be determined, once the criteria for deviation of the seed quality are selected. This tool shows great potential for the design of XFEL optics for stable operation.

Recent investigations have shown that it is possible to obtain an order of magnitude smaller intrinsic emittance from photocathodes by precise atomic scale control of the surface, using an appropriate electronic band structure of single crystal cathodes and cryogenically cooling the cathode. Investigating the performance of such cathodes requires atomic scale surface diagnostic techniques connected in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) to the epitaxial thin film growth and surface preparation systems and photo-emission and photocathode diagnostic techniques. Here we report the capabilities and design of the laboratory being built at the Arizona State University for this purpose. The lab houses a 200 kV DC gun with a cryogenically cooled cathode along with a beam diagnostics and ultra fast electron diffraction beamline. The cathode of the gun can be transported in UHV to a suite of UHV growth chambers and surface and photoemission diagnostic techniques.

The electron beam for the Low Energy RHIC electron Cooler (LEReC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is generated by a high-power fiber laser illuminating a photocathode. The pointing stability of the electron beam, which is crucial given its long transport, is highly dependent on the center-of-mass (CoM) stability of the laser spot on the photocathode. For reasons of accessibility during operations, the laser is located outside the accelerator tunnel, and the laser beam is propagated over a total distance of 34 m via three laser tables to the photocathode. The challenges to achieving the required CoM stability of 10 microns RMS on the photocathode include mitigation of the effects of vibrations along the transport and of weather- and season-related environmental effects, while preserving accessibility and diagnostic capabilities. Due to the insufficiency of infrastructure alone in overcoming these challenges, two active laser transport stabilization systems aimed at addressing specific types of position instability were installed during the 2018 Shutdown. After successful commissioning of the full transport in 2018/19, we report on our solutions to these design challenges.

Researchers concentrated on resistive random access memories (RRAMs) due to excellent scalability, high integration density, quick switching, etc*,**. Intrinsic physical phenomenon of RRAMs is resistive switching. In this work, ion beam irradiation was used as a tool to modify resistive switching of pulsed laser deposited (PLD) Y0.95Ca0.05MnO3/Si films. Ion irradiation induced optimal resistive switching with spectroscopic correlations has been attributed to oxygen vacancy gradient. Resistive switching ratio is estimated to be increased for the film irradiated with fluence 1×1011 ions/cm2 due to irradiation induced strain and oxygen vacancies verified by X’ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, atomic force microscopy (AFM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements. Strain relaxation and oxygen vacancy annihilation have been realized for higher fluence (1×1012 and 1×1013 ions/cm2) owing to local annealing effect. Present study suggests that the films understudy can be considered as emerging candidates for RRAMs.

As part of the alternative design approach for the Jeffer-son Laboratory Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) ion com-plex, the electron storage ring (e-ring) is consolidated to also serve as a large booster for the ions. The goal of reaching 16 GeV/u or higher for all ions using only room-temperature magnets forces the re-design of the e-ring because of magnetic field and lattice limitations. The new design is challenging due to several imposed constraints: (1) use of room-temperature magnets, (2) avoiding transi-tion crossing, and (3) maintaining the size and shape of the original e-ring design as much as possible. A design study is presented for a 16 GeV/u large ion booster after analyzing different alternatives that use: (1) combined-function magnets, (2) large quadrupoles or (3) quadrupole doublets in the lattice design. This design boosts the injection energy to the collider ring from 8 GeV (proton-equivalent) in the original baseline design to 16 GeV/u for all ions which is beneficial for the high-energy option of JLEIC of 200 GeV or higher. A scheme for adapting the new large ion booster design to also serve as electron storage ring is presented.

One of the requirements for the future Electron Ion Col-lider (EIC) is to collide polarized electrons and light ions with at least 70% polarization for each beam. For light ions, polarized ion sources are used for injection to a linac, which is usually the first accelerator in the collider chain. The Jefferson Lab EIC (JLEIC) ion injector linac consists of a low-energy room-temperature section with quadrupole focusing followed by a superconducting linac with solenoid focusing inside long cryomodules. These two sections have different effects on the spin. Spin dy-namics simulation studies are carried out for the JLEIC injector linac in order to preserve and maintain a high degree of polarization for light ion beams for delivery to the booster. The different options to maintain and restore the spin in the different sections of the linac for hydrogen, deuterium and helium ions are presented and discussed. Results from both the Zgoubi and COSY-Infinity codes are presented and compared for every section of the ion linac but the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ). Current-ly, a method to simulate the RFQ using Zgoubi is being investigated.

A Super Proton-Proton Collider (SPPC) that aims to explore new physics beyond the standard model is planned in China. Here we focus on the impact of beam-beam interactions in the SPPC. Simulations show that with the current optics and nominal tunes, the dynamic aperture (DA) with all the beam-beam interactions is less than 6σ, the dominant cause being the long-range interactions. First, we show the results of a tune scan done to maximize the DA. Next, we discuss the compensation of the long-range interactions by increasing the crossing angle and also by using current carrying wires.

Beam synchronization of the future electron-ion collider (EIC) is studied with introducing different bunch numbers in the two colliding beams. This allows non-pairwise collisions between the bunches of the two beams and is known as "gear-change", whereby one bunch of the first beam collides with all other bunches of the second beam, one at a time. Here we report on the study of how the beam dynamics of the Jefferson Lab Electron Ion collider concept is affected by the gear change. For this study, we use the new GPU-based code (GHOST). It features symplectic one-turn maps for particle tracking and Bassetti-Erskine approach for beam-beam interactions.
