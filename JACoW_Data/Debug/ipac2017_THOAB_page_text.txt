Compton scattering of laser photons by a relativistic electron beam produces monoenergetic, tunable and small source size X-rays similar to synchrotron light sources in a very compact setting, due to the shorter undulator period of lasers. These X-ray sources can bring to every hospitals advanced radiology and radiotherapy that are currently only being conducted at synchrotron facilities. Few examples include phase contrast imaging utilizing the micron-scale source size, K-edge subtraction imaging from two monoenergetic X-rays at different energies and radiation therapy using radiosensitization of high-Z nanoparticles. At LLNL, 30 keV X-rays have been generated from the 30 MeV X-band linac, and the X-rays have been characterized and agree with the modeling very well. This source is being used to study the feasibility of aforementioned medical applications. Experimental setup of K-edge subtraction of contrast agents are presented, demonstrating the low-dose, high-contrast imaging potential of the light source. Plans to study enhanced radiotherapy using Gold nanoparticles with the upgrade of the machine to higher energies are discussed.

Funding: The MicroTCA Technology Lab at DESY is a Helmholtz Innovation Lab (HIL-02) and jointly funded by DESY, the Helmholtz Association, and industry.
Over the last decade, technology transfer has emerged as an important mission of major public research facilities. Funding agencies, regional governments and society at large have placed high hopes in the combination of scientific research and on-site technology transfer departments that can turn discoveries and research tools into marketable products. Pursuing economic interests while preserving scientific freedom is a delicate balancing act that requires novel instruments in finance, administration and governance. The Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres addressed this challenge with a set of new frameworks: the Helmholtz Validation Funds (HVF) and the Helmholtz Innovation Labs (HIL). MicroTCA is a case in point: Since 2009, DESY has upgraded this standard significantly to provide state-of-the-art LLRF systems for the facilities FLASH and European XFEL. When the technology sparked interest elsewhere, DESY bundled its transfer activities in the HVF project MicroTCA.4 for Industry (2012-2015) and the HIL project MicroTCA Technology Lab (since October 2016). We report on intermediate results achieved by the MicroTCA Technology Lab after seven months of operation.

An ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) using a relativistic-energy femtosecond-pulse electron beam has being developed at Osaka University. We succeeded to generate a 100-fs-pulse electron beam with energy of 3.1 MeV using a photocathode RF gun. In the demonstrations of UEM, we succeeded to observe the TEM imaging of polystyrene and gold nanoparticles by the accumulating measurement of 3.1-MeV femtosecond electron pulses. The relativistic-energy single-pulse electron imaging is also available under the low-magnification observation, i.e. 300 times. The UEM has also been succeeded for the study of the ultrafast structural dynamics in materials with the single-shot electron diffraction observation.
