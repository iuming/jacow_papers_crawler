A swift overview of modern areas of accelerator physics and technology presented via and connected through inventive principles of TRIZ, the industrial methodology of inventiveness. A wide range of topics, such as synchrotron radiation, electron cooling, plasma acceleration, are introduced via easy-to-follow back-of-the-envelope derivations. These are connected via canonical yet adjusted for science TRIZ inventive principles and laws, illustrated by numerous inventions such as fiber lasers, tune jumps, inverted guns, and others. This short tutorial introduces a new approach which amalgamates science and industrial inventiveness, enhances creativity, and boosts innovations towards developing the next generations of accelerators and their applications.
