High-energy carbon-ion radiotherapy is being carried out at Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). Over 12000 cancer patients have been treated with carbon beams having energies of between 56-430 MeV/u since 1994. There are two injectors in the HIMAC for medical and experimental use. First injector consists of two ECR ion sources and one PIG ion source, the RFQ linac and the DTL. Usually, this injector suppling the carbon ion for cancer therapy and various ion such as H, He, Fe, Xe are accelerated for biological and physical experiment. The 10 GHz NIRS-ECR ion source produce the carbon ion for cancer therapy. The 18 GHz NIRS-HEC ion source produce He to Xe ions for experimental use. Second injector consists of the compact ECR ion source with all permanent magnet, the RFQ linac and the APF IH-DTL. This injector supplies the carbon ion for experimental use. Additionally, we tried production of the Indium and the Tin ions by using the In(C5H5) and the Sn(i-C3H7)4 at the NIRS-HEC. Beam current of the 115In20+ and 120Sn18+ were 90 and 15μA, respectively. Present status of ECR ion sources and some development will be described.

Plasma ’ood guns (PFGs) are widely used to neutralize wafer charge during the doping process in modern ion implanters. Compared with traditional dc arc discharge with filament and RF discharge, the microwave driven source that has long lifetime and has no metallic contamination is regarded as a potential choice of PFG [1]. Attempt to develop a large scale PFG based on 2.45 GHz microwave driven sources was launched at Peking University (PKU). A prototype one is a miniaturized 2.45 GHz permanent magnet electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) source to produce point-like electron beam. In previous experiments, more than 8 mA electron beam has been extracted with a ’6 mm extraction hole at an input microwave power of 22 W with argon gas [2]. Recently, studies are focusing on the possibility of producing of ribbon electron beams as PFG with 2.45GHz microwave driven surface wave plasma (SWP) source. A cylindrical chamber surface wave plasma generator with a using cylindrical dielectric waveguide and a 70 mm×3 mm extraction slit was fabricated. The primary test results were obtained. More details of this PFGs will be discussed in this work.
