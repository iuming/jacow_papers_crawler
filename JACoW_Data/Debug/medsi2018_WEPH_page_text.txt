The Brockhouse X-ray Diffraction and Scattering Sector (BXDS) High-Energy (HE) beamline includes a bent Laue diffraction monochromator. The BXDS HE monochromator achieves energy ranges of 35keV to 90 keV through the bent Laue diffraction of two silicon crystal wafers. Each wafer (460um & 1000um thick) is bent to achieve specific sagittal radius (Rs); subsequent anticlastic meridional radius (Rm) results from the anisotropic nature of silicon, creating the desired x-ray focusing parameters. During the initial conditioning of the BXDS HE monochromator spurious diffraction patterns were observed indicating that the crystal holder, and crystal integrity failed. Alternative holder designs were evaluated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA; ANSYS) simulations to ensure that appropriate Rs and Rm values were achieved, verification of the crystal holder Rs was completed using contact 3D measurement (FaroArm), and the crystal surface was assessed using 3D optical profiling (Zygo). A superior holder was chosen based on the results, and replaced. The performance of the BXDS HE monochromator has been characterized, indicating the new holder design has achieved x-ray focusing parameters.

New front end beamline components at SESAME* are designed to handle the high heat load produced by the insertion devices. A mini gap wiggler will be installed for the Material science Beamline and the front end will receive 5.0 kW of total power and 7.74 kW/mrad2 of peak power density. The power produced by the insertion device was simulated using SynRad+, this software is using Monte Carlo simulation to simulate the synchrotron radiation from either an insertion device or any magnet source, the surface power density distribution generated by this software mapped directly to an FEA software to conduct a coupled thermo-mechanical analsys. The design, modeling, power source simulation and FEA analysis of the fixed mask, shutter and filter for the material science Beamline front end will be presented in this paper

The ISOLDE radioactive ion beam separator facility at CERN produces beams of short-lived isotopes for experiments in physics, material and medical science. New requirements for more precise measurement of profile, position and intensity has pushed the CERN beam instrumentation group to start the study of a new generation of ISOLDE beam instrumentation dedicated to the specific needs of this facility. This paper will describe the design and the development of a number of new ISOLDE instruments with the aim of achieving better performance, increased reliability and to facilitate maintenance in the radioactive environment. It will explain how modern technologies (i.e. magnetically coupled push pull, 3D additive machining) have been used to make a modern, precise and reliable beam instrumentation design.

A white beam filter and visual screen are required for the undulator beamline at the Brockhouse X-Ray Diffraction and Scattering Sector. Reusing a water-cooled copper paddle with a 0.1 mm thick chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond foil, a combined filter and screen design is presented. The Canadian Light Source previously experienced failure of CVD diamond filters when exposed to high flux density white beam. Finite element analysis (FEA) was done to determine if the CVD diamond will fracture under the undulator heat load. Conservative failure criteria are selected for CVD diamond based on available literature for the following failure mechanisms: high temperature, thermal fatigue, and temperature induced stress. Four designs are analyzed using FEA models simulating effects of clamping pressure and heat load on the CVD diamond. The simulations are verified by optimizing the model mesh, comparing results against hand calculations, and comparing theoretical absorbed heat load to simulated values. Details of the modeling method are reviewed and results for the different designs evaluated. Suggestions for future testing of CVD diamond in a synchrotron setting will be discussed.

Best Cyclotron Systems Inc (BCSI) has designed and manufactured a 70 MeV compact cyclotron for radioisotope production and research applications. The cyclotron extractor design allows negative ion stripping to extract protons between 35 and 70 MeV. The extractor is consistent with the requirement for high current operation with a minimum of intervention. Twenty-two extractor foils are available in any selection sequence on each side of the cyclotron. The foil exchange is performed in vacuum so that an exchange takes about 2 minutes while obeying safety protocols. The 22 foils are contained in a cartridge that can be quickly exchanged through a vacuum load lock minimizing operator exposure. An added benefit is that the extractor modular design reduces the operational space requirement outside of the cyclotron thus reducing the vault footprint and shielding requirement.

Along 2017 and 2018, a complete upgrade of ALBA magnetic measurements lab has been done. Upgrade has affected both hardware and software. Regarding hardware, a relevant innovation has been the replacement of DC motors by step motors in new Hall probe bench and in flipping and rotating coil benches. Up to now, this kind of continuous measurements usually were done using DC motors because step motors were considered unable to fulfil the required smoothness of the movement. However, current step motors state of the art made them compatible with DC. In our case, we have tested the performance of upgraded benches and they reach the same accuracy, or even better. Regarding software, we have unified all motion drivers to ICEPAP and all control system to Tango package, taking advantage of the last ICEPAP firmware. That includes the feature of triggering data acquisition system by signals generated from different axis that can be selected by software.

The light source front ends and beamlines contain several devices designed to limit the size of, or completely stop, the photon beam. Most of these devices are meant to protect personnel and/or equipment, thus their failure would have serious implications for the facility operation. The photon beam carries extremely high energy, thus the system will experience very large thermal loads. Accurate temperature and stress distribution of these components, based on well-reasoned assumptions, is needed to accurately review the performance of these devices during the design process. Applying nonuniform heat flux as a thermal load in simulation presents a challenge. This work describes the steps of the thermomechanical numerical simulation for a typical component at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), subject to photon beam interception. The numerical algorithm used to apply the nonuniform heat flux distribution on an irregular type of surface is presented in detail. The algorithm was developed using the commercial Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software ANSYS of ANSYS, Inc.

The installation, alignment measurement and vibration monitoring of the accelerator equipment are cumbersome. In order to reduce the work intensity and exposure time of personnel, this paper has developed a smart vehicle that can automatically walk and automatically adjust the horizontal in the accelerator or beam line area. The smart vehicle can move forwards, sideways, oblique lines, rotations and combinations, and can automatically adjust the level according to different terrains. The auto-leveling accuracy is better than 0.001 degrees. By installing vibration measuring equipment or collimating equipment on the vehicle platform, vibration testing and collimation measurement of the equipment in the accelerator or beamline device can be performed.

There is an increasingly critical demand on the angular stability of double crystal monochromator (DCM). This work focuses on a method to measure angular vibration directly at the DCM crystals using a dual-frequency interferometer. This method was applied to the off-line test of a newly developed cryocooled DCM at Shanghai Syn-chrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), which can obtain a resolution of 8 nrad. The DCM was then tested on the X-ray Test Line. Both off-line and on-line results were referenced for DCM structure optimizations. In this paper, the DCM angular stability measuring method is presented, and detailed information of the results are shown.

X-ray crystal monochromators of high thermal load exposed to white-beam in third generation synchrotron light sources are subject to thermal deformations that must be minimized using an optimized cooling structure. Finite-element analysis is used to calculate the crystal thermal deformations and optimize the cooling structure by changing crystal size and cooling structure. Optimization results are displayed. The heat absorbers consist of two copper cooling clamped to the crystal side faces via an indium foil in order to ensure a good thermal contact and to relax the thermal deformation. Those absorbers are each composed of 16 cooling fins regularly spaced and carved from the cooper block. The cooling fluid of high fin position is higher than the silicon crystal surface. The cooling structure can dissipate a heat load up to 800W& power density 10W/mm2.

Samples illuminated by pulsed soft X-rays with a large number of photons per pulse (XFEL, Laser-plasma sources) often restrict analytical methods to photon-in-photon-out techniques, since photon-in-electron-out techniques can suffer severely from space charge. We introduce a compact and large angle acceptance soft X-ray spectrometer for an energy range of 1-3 keV suitable for experiments under the above conditions. The spectrometer uses a von Hamos optical design covering a simultaneous energy window of >300 eV at a resolving power of 1200-2800 and a total length of the spectrometer of <600 mm. We will present design details and first performance test results.

Funding: The MOBIPIX project is part of Sirius project funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications.
In the light of the high brilliance fourth generation syn-chrotron light sources, real-time imaging techniques be-came possible, boosting the demand for fast and reliable detectors. Mobipix project is a compact X-ray imaging camera based on Medipix3RX* ASIC designed for Sirius**. The control and acquisition system uses Sys-tem-On-a-Chip technology with embedded GPUs where data processing algorithms will run in real time. The Mobipix X-ray detector is de-signed to perform as a video camera, enabling X-ray imaging experiments and beam diagnose, at thousands of frames per second, without external computers. This paper presents the development of the Mobipix detector mechanics. The authors describe the path taken to design the structural aspects, ensuring robustness and versatility in the device installation to the beamlines, and the thermal aspects, regarding forced air cooling, high heat density, and small volume through which the flow will occur. The latter aspects were developed by exploiting CFD modelling. The Mobipix has 28 x 28 mm² active area, composed by 260k pixels of 55 x 55 'm2, and is planned to achieve continuous readout up to 2000 FPS.

Optomechanical Optimization for a Sagittaly Bent Double Crystal Monochromator, Using Finite Elements and Ray Tracing

Designing a second crystal for a sagittally bent Double Crystal Monochromator (DCM) requires dealing with a number of conflicting requirements. Especially when working with high-energy photons, the angular aperture (Darwin width) becomes very narrow (below 10µrad for Si) while simultaneously the bending radius is increasing small (down to 1m for typical beamline dimensions at 40keV). In this situation, the cross-talk between tangential and sagittal curvature becomes a key parameter, and two strategies are generally used to overcome the issue: either using a flat crystal with a specific length/with ratio, or usage of a rib-stiffened crystal. In the frame of the upgrade of the SAMBA beamline DCM, both solutions have been explored, using a suite of scripts connecting a general purpose FEM code (ANSYS) and a ray-tracing code (SpotX). This has allowed a systematic evaluation of a wide number of configurations, giving insight in the interaction between geometric parameters, and ultimately resulting in a twofold increase in the photon throughput at 30keV without comprising neither spectral resolution nor spot size at sample location.

Experimental Modal Analysis was performed on an existing 5 degree of freedom mirror system on beamline I08 at The Diamond Light Source, by impacting the structure and measuring the response at locations of interest. Commercial software was used to generate the frequency response functions and mode shape animations. This experimental information was used to inform and optimise a design iteration for a new mirror system. The new mechanism was designed, installed and tested on the J08 branch line at The Diamond Light Source to validate the expected improvements in stability, stiffness and resonant frequency. The mirror system fundamental resonant frequency was significantly increased from 20 Hz to 49 Hz.

The Advanced Photon Source (APS) is currently in the process of upgrading to a multi-bend achromat (MBA) storage ring, which will increase brightness and coherent flux by several orders of magnitude. The planned In-Situ Nanoprobe (ISN) beamline, one of the feature beamlines of the APS Upgrade (APS-U) project, is a 220 m long beamline that aims to focus the x-ray beam to a spot size of 20 nm or below by focusing with a KB pair. A double-mirror system, consisting of a high heat load mirror and a pink beam mirror, is designed to provide high harmonic rejection, reduce the power transmitted to the monochromator, and focus the beam along the vertical direction to a beam-defining aperture (BDA). One of the key issues is to manage the high power and power density absorbed by these mirrors. To attain the best focus at the BDA, the pink beam mirror needs to be mechanically bent to correct for thermal deformations on both mirrors. In this paper we report on the thermal responses of the mirror system to different undulator tunings and cooling schemes as calculated with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and optical ray tracing.

Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) has developed a SASE X-ray Free Electron Laser based on 10 GeV linear accelerator. The inter-Undulator (IU) support section was developed to be used in the intersections of the Undulator Systems. The IU supports consist of phase shifter, quadrupole magnet with mover, beam loss monitor, cavity BPM with mover, two corrector magnets and vacuum components. The adjusting mechanism of IU Support has manual alignment system to be easily adjusting the component. The mover of quadruple magnet and cavity BPM with submicron repeatability has auto-adjusting systems with stepping motor. The mover main specifications include compact dimensions and a ±1.5 mm stroke in the vertical and horizontal direction. Linear motion guide based on 5-phase stepping motors have been chosen. This paper describes the design of the stages used for precise movement and results of mechanical measurements including reproducibility will be reported.

Several parts that comprise the large scientific equipment should be installed and operated at precise three-dimensional location coordinates X, Y, and Z through survey and alignment to ensure their optimal performance. As time goes by, however, the ground goes through uplift and subsidence, which consequently changes the coordinates of installed components and leads to alignment errors. As a result, the system parameters change, and the performance of the large scientific equipment deteriorates accordingly. Measuring the change in locations of systems comprising the large scientific equipment in real time would make it possible to predict alignment errors, locate any region with greater changes, realign components in the region fast, and shorten the time of survey and alignment. For this purpose, a WPS's (wire position sensor) are installed in undulator section and a HLS's (hydrostatic leveling sensor) are installed in PAL-XFEL building. This paper is designed to introduce performance enhancements to reduce observed phenomena and measurement errors in the HLS system operation process.

In-vacuum actuators are under consideration for operating the bending flexturs of the new Kirkpatrick-Baez focusing mirrors as part of the upgrade to LCLS-II. To achieve an mechanical accuracy of better than 104, the characteristics of the actuators need to be explored. We designed a testing procedure in terms of both setup and actuator excursion program to understand various behaviors of the actuator in a simulated typical operating condition. Multiple independent sensors were used, including optical linear encoder, laser interferometer and capacitive sensors. In this presentation, I will show the testing procedure and results obtained for a commercially available high-precision leadscrew type in-vacuum linear actuator with a stroke of 10 mm and a resolution of 2.5 nm. It was found that under typical static operation conditions, an accuracy of 104 can be achieved without external encoder feedback. Detailed behaviors regarding repeatability and backlash are also discussed.

Double crystal monochromators (DCM) are very important instruments in hard X-ray beamlines. Publications have indicated that the mechanical stability of the DCM would affect the whole beam quality very much. To upgrade the performance of the DCMs of the EMBL beamlines, the vibrational stability, thermal stability and mechanical repeatability were improved. To improve the vibrational stability, an off-line vibration measurement for the pitch and roll, as well as the perp, were designed with a set of in-vacuum interferometers was developed for measuring the vibrations without X-ray beam. Then several attempts were tried to reduce the vibration caused by the cooling system, in the end, the pitch vibration was improved from 390nrad to 50nrad. To improve the thermal stability, the cooling blocks and thermal braids were optimized with the FEA methods, the steady time of the 2nd crystal were improved from 2.5 hours to less than 45 minutes after each energy change. To improve the repeatability of the orientation, the wedge jacks were replaced by worm gear boxes, repeatability was reached to less than 3 um.

A family of reconfigurable devices able to work in synchrotron applications, especially in diffractometer environments has been developed. It can provide six (6) or less than six (<6) degrees of freedom (dof) motion capabilities (F<=6) being able to pose a heavy load sample (instruments) with high precision towards an X-ray coming beam. It is based on the Parallel Kinematics (PK) Quatropod concept with redundant actuation (Rd=2) and were built around the fully (F=6dof) basic topology 6-4(213) where 2-actuated and 1, 3-passive joints, respectively. By altering the passive joints dof, structures with less than six dof (F<6) can be obtained, e.g. 5-4[213(2)]/F=5, 4-4[213(1)]/F=4, 3-4[213(0)]/F=3 (3(2) and 3(1)and 3(0) stand for 3dof joint with constrained(less) dof - f=2, 1 or 0/blocked). For a perfect symmetric arrangement and using only P and S (P-prismatic, S-spherical) joints, several useful positioning mechanisms are presented. And, in the design phase, 2dof linear actuators(2P), e.g. XY stages have been proved to be a suitable choice, too.

The Advanced Photon Source-Upgrade (APS-U) project has stringent specifications and a 12 month installation schedule. Some form of these constraints appear to be common at all multi-bend achromat upgrade projects. At the APS-U, no full tests will be made of the final accelerator support design. The evaluation of the final design against the specifications will be based primarily on computer simulations using virtual inputs. Insuring that the final designs meet specifications solely based on simulations is much like cooking a complex, multi-course meal without a trial run. Producing a successful meal on the first try requires a prior understanding of the ingre-dients, techniques, and interactions between the constituents. A good cookbook can be essential in providing this under-standing. Likewise, producing an accelerator support final design that meets the requirements requires a prior under-standing of the materials, components, techniques, and interactions between them. This poster describes a cookbook-style approach that any design team can use to confidently predict important characteristics such as natural frequency and ambient vibration response with an error of around 10%.

For LOREA, the new beamline at ALBA, the Insertion Device Apple-II helical out-vacuum undulator requires the installation of a suitable narrow-gap aluminium chamber. The chamber design is based on the standard ALBA aluminium chamber which has an internal elliptical cross section, where NEG coating is deposited and bending magnet (BM) radiation from the upstream dipole is dissipated on the chamber walls. For the standard chamber the upstream distributed absorber cannot protect the entire chamber from direct BM radiation because there is a limitation for its design: the beam impedance of the machine. Based on new studies of collective effects it has been concluded that it's possible to implement modifications on the upstream distributed absorber and protect the chamber from lateral collision of BM radiation keeping the beam impedance of the machine inside of a safe range. In spite of that still there is a contribution of the tails of BM radiation. In this paper we describe the behavior of the new aluminium vacuum chamber for different thermal load conditions using water and air for refrigeration. Also we present the design of the modified OFHC upstream distributed absorber.

This paper presents the design of an Integrated Crotch Absorber for the new beamline LOREA (Low-Energy Ultra-High-Resolution Angular Photoemission for Complex Materials at ALBA). The LOREA Insertion Device (ID) consists of an Apple II undulator with a period of 125 mm. For the current ALBA dipole chamber the ID vertical polarized light hits the upper and lower walls because of the very narrow vertical aperture between the cooling channels. To solve this problem some modifications must be implemented both in the dipole chamber and in the crotch absorber located inside of the dipole. The new crotch absorber, named Integrated Crotch Absorber, must absorb a significant part of the ID vertical polarized light in order to avoid radiation impinging at the post dipole chamber. The geometry of the Integrated Crotch Absorber is a combination of the conventional crotch and the distributed absorber done at PSI for ANKA. The design has been optimized taking into account the standard thermo-mechanical design criteria as well as the reflective effects of the ID radiation from the opening towards the walls of the dipole chamber.

Sirius is a 4th generation synchrotron light source under construction in Brazil, with a bare emittance of 250 picometer rad, scheduled to have the first beam late this year. One of the most important aspects for this ultra-low emittance machine is the stability of the components, especially the magnets. This paper describes the main characteristics of the girder system, including the concrete pedestal, the leveling units, the girder itself, the clamping mechanism for the magnets and the measurements procedures. Each detail was considered in the design phase and the result is a high rigidity setup with a first horizontal mode close to 170 Hz.

Beamline P04 at the 6GeV storage ring PETRA-III is a XUV to soft x-ray facility in the range of 250-3000eV. High K (up to K=6.5) operation of the 5m long APPLE-2 undulator result in high on-axis heat load. The absorbed power on the first mirror will be up to 1.6 kW (100 mA ring current, linearly polarized light). This mirror is located 46 m upstream of the focal spot, therefor has optical requirements of a tangential slope error of less than 1 µrad and has to be operated under UHV-conditions. Previous FEM studies * pointed towards an internal cooling concept based on liquid nitrogen, to cope with the high heat load and the optical needs. This initial concept has been improved with further FEM simulations and the technical feasibility of a cryo-stable metal to silicon connection for the coolant was proven under vacuum conditions.

Thermal and thermomechanical analysis is one of the key process while designing accelerator components that may subject to synchrotron radiation heating. Even some closed-form solutions are available, and yet as to complex geometry numerical analysis such as finite element method (FEM) is commonly used to obtain the result. However due to its complexity of density distribution of the heat load, implementing such boundary conditions in the FEM model is relatively tedious. In this report we provide a simplified, practical and more conservative method to apply heat load both for bending magnet and insertion device. In addition, a general purpose synchrotron radiation heating numerical modeling is also introduced.

High performance goals of NSLS-II require stringent mechanical stability of its instruments such as BPMs, slits, mirrors, monochromators, and detectors. Mechanical stability of these components can be compromised by site-wide as well as local vibration sources (pumps, compressors, etc.). Several vibration studies have been performed at NSLS-II at the request of beamline users. This paper presents the results of these studies highlighting sources of vibration and mitigation strategies.

At the Taiwan Light Source (TLS) and Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), several studies related to energy savings in air-conditioning systems are underway, where heat recovery has been considered for laboratory applications. The performance of a run-around coil has demonstrated that heat recovery plays an important role in energy conservation. Based on this design of an air handling unit (AHU), we enhance this model by combining it with enthalpy control for seasonal changes. Here, we construct a new AHU to verify the practical impact of energy usage. The improvements show that both mechanisms can be achieved simultaneously.

The mirrors for Sirius, the new 4th-generation synchrotron at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), have strict requirements regarding thermo-mechanical stability and deformations, with figure height and slope errors limited to a few nanometers and tens of nanoradians, respectively. Therefore, fixed-shape mirrors have been defined with horizontally-reflecting orientation (except for vertically-reflecting mirrors of KB systems), whereas their cooling schemes (namely, air, water or liquid nitrogen cooling) depend on the particular power load. A thermal and mechanical optimization method was developed to guide the design of mirrors through the evaluation of deformations caused by power load, cooling, gravity, tightening of the fastening screws, manufacturing errors and modal analyses. Up to now, this method was already used to define the mirrors of Sirius' beamlines, which include plane, cylindrical, elliptical and ellipsoidal mirrors, as well as KB systems for microprobe and nanoprobe stations.

Challenges for Nanopositioning

In nanopositioning systems there are plenty of disturbance sources corrupting the stability of the positioners and optics. Vibrations are induced by machines like pumps and coolers, as well as by car traffic hundreds of meters far from the facility. Furthermore the small and lightweight mechanical components are strongly influenced by sound waves. The positioners themselves may also produce vibrations or at least amplify them by the eigenfrequencies of their flexure joints, which are used for nanometer positioning accuracy without backlash. To identify the sources, amplification and damping of vibrations inside the setup, different kinds of measurements, including broadband frequency stimulation, have been performed on a setup at a nano experimental hutch of a PETRA III Beamline. Therefore some mechanical components and positioning stages were changed against stiffer materials to have comparable measurements to get statements about the quality of the mechanical properties. The poster shows the experimental setup, the measuring methods and some comparing vibration plots, which give information about the identified mechanical behavior.

PROXIMA 2A is a high performance 3rd generation synchrotron beamline dedicated to X-ray micro-crystallography on biological macromolecules. Since opening in March 2013, the experimental station has hosted a large number of users who have collected vast amounts of X-ray diffraction images from literally thousands of crystals. In order to streamline the throughput, enhance performance and add functionality, a number of innovative developments have been launched on PROXIMA 2A. These cover all aspects of the beamline, from the practical to the visionary: such as the design, fabrication and implementation of a dedicated high-precision motorized stage to screen crystallization plates for in situ X-ray data collections, and the employment artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies for the detection of samples under liquid nitrogen. Other notable beamline projects include the addition of a vertical translation table for the EIGER X 9M detector to permit the acquisition of ultrahigh (0.6 Å) resolution X-ray data, the incorporation of a miniaturized YAG-coupled photodiode within a beamstop and the determination of the SOC of a recently added kappa arm to the goniometer.

The sagittally bent monochromator is a desirable optics for hard X-ray beamlines and an important part of the advanced research for High Energy Photon Source (HEPS). The information of the surface figure of the crystal is very important for the optimization of bender. However, it is difficult to measure the shape directly by interferometer or long trace profiler due to very big principal curvature (1/Rs), which distorts the deflectometric probe light therefore affects the accuracy of the measurement. We have developed ex-situ metrology instrument - a low-cost modified Twyman-Green interferometer by using commercial element in our laboratory. The misalignment among the detector, cylindrical sample light and the crystal mirror was adjusted by rotating the interferometer according to the theoretical calculation, which can separate the effect of the misalignment and the distortion of the mirror. The accuracy of the curvature radius (about few mm) is assured by precisely moving the mirror under test.

The Coherent X-ray Scattering (CXS) beamline at Taiwan Photon Source has been completely constructed in the end of 2015 and opened for users in the next half year of 2016 successfully. Two In-vacuum Undulators (IU22) with lengths of 3 m and 2 m were used as the Insertion Device (ID) to provide intense synchrotron radiation for the CXS beamline. To achieve the coherent performance, the setup of components in the beamline needs to be considered and designed carefully. As no white-beam diamond window was installed in the upstream beamline for the maintenance of coherent beam, a differential pumping mechanism was evaluated to prevent the worse vacuum condition influencing the front end and the storage ring. A single-crystal diamond filter was also adopted to maintain the coherence of x-ray. The protection of bremsstrahlung radiation for this beamline was designed specifically based on the optical layout. This paper will introduce the detailed mechanical design and current status for the CXS beamline.

A Front End (FE) prototype for a 19-mm period length Adjustable Phase Undulator (APU19) beamline of the new Brazilian 4th-generation synchrotron, Sirius, was assembled in the LNLS metrology building in January 2017 to validate main design concepts. Regarding stability, flow-induced vibration (FIV) investigations were carried out on the water-cooled components, and modal analyses were made on the X-Ray Beam Position Monitor (XBPM) support. As for the vacuum system, final pressure levels were investigated and a vacuum breach was intentionally provoked to verify the performance of the equipment protection system (EPS). In addition, cycling tests of the Photon and Gamma shutters were conducted to verify the FE reliability. Moreover, the three-layer protection system, developed to limit the maximum aperture for the high-power slits, was functionally evaluated. Finally, the results were used to improve the FE to its final design. This paper describes the tests setups and results obtained during the validations.

The ESRF is designing a laser facility for dynamic compression coupled to the ID24-ED beamline in order to study the properties and dynamic behavior of matter under extreme pressure and temperature. To achieve this, a pulsed laser will be focused on samples together with the Xray beam used to perform absorption spectroscopy. The laser setup is placed in a dedicated clean room from which an 85mm diameter beam is transported in the experimental hutch to the laser/sample interaction chamber thanks to a 15m long optical system. The laser beam is then focused down to 250 micrometres on the sample. Operating ID24-ED at different energies requires the samples to be rotated by about 40 degrees around the last Xray optical element of the beamline, a polychromator placed 1m upstream of the sample. The movement of the sample and the need for the laser to follow it put strong constraints on the mechanical design of the whole setup. We will present the layout of laser facility, the opto-mechanical system of mirrors and lenses used to transport the laser onto the sample, the kinematics of the mechanical system used to follow the rotation of the sample and the mechanical design of the interaction chamber.

The soft X-ray tomography endstation of TPS has the ability to provide 3D biological cell images by fluores-cence structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) and soft x-ray tomography (SXT). The electron energy is design to be in the range of 200 eV to 3 keV. The detector system equipped with an Andor® iKon-L Series imaging CCD, X-Z-roll-pitch adjustment stage, and long stroke bellows system. The detector system can adjust the CCD about 10 mm in both X and Z direction, and ±5 degree of roll. Moreover, the long stroke bellows system gives the CCD an extra degree of freedom in the Y direction and its range is up to 2500 mm. That can locate the CCD close to the sample to get a larger field of view, and far from the sample to get higher image resolution. In this study, the design and commission status of the detector system is studied and the mechanical structures are also presented.

We have developed a compact and rigid mechanical design for a liquid-nitrogen-cooled vertically-deflecting double-crystal monochromator (DCM) for the ANATOMIX beamline at Synchrotron SOLEIL. An in-situ differential interferometer setup directly measures the pitch and roll parallelism between the 1st and the 2nd crystal under operating conditions with liquid-nitrogen flow and at pressures below 10-8 mbar. Factory measurements at moderate LN2 flow rates show a stability of the relative pitch of 25 nrad RMS (0.1 to 10 kHz) and a first relevant resonant frequency of 175 Hz. At lower flow rates, still sufficient to dissipate several hundred watts of heat load, an angular stability of 15 nrad RMS is achieved.
