For the Korean heavy ion accelerator RAON, a normal-conducting quadrupole magnet doublet with an intermediate beam diagnostic devices between two cryomodules is served for collimating the heavy ion beam. Although the fringe field of a magnet at a superconducting cavity position is low enough, differently from a strong superconducting solenoid, it can degrade the acceleration performance in the case of quench of the cavity directly and/or indirectly by contaminating the cryomodule wall and magnetic shields. In this study, we analyze the magnetic measurement results in the cryomodule assembled with the magnet doublet compared to the calculated ones and discuss the future plan.

Residual resistance ratio (RRR) of 300-grade niobium has been analyzed to find optimal welding condition for a superconducting cavity. RRR values were not only measured along the welding directions, but also perpendicular to the welding lines. In this presentation, we will show the RRR analysis as a function of the distance, the welding speed, and the welding pressure.

The ESS elliptical superconducting Linac consists of two types of 704.42 MHz cavities, medium and high beta, to accelerate the beam from 216 MeV (spoke cavity Linac) up to the final energy at 2 GeV. The last Linac optimization, called Optimus+ [1], has been carried out taking into account the limitations of SRF cavity performance (field emission). The medium and high-beta parts of the Linac are composed of 36 and 84 elliptical cavities, with geometrical beta values of 0.67 and 0.86 respectively. This work presents the latest vertical test results on ESS medium beta elliptical cavity prototypes. We describe the cavity preparation procedure from buffer chemical polishing to vertical test. Finally magnetic probes (Fluxgate) were installed on the cavity to determine magnetic field background during vertical test. The latest vertical test results showed that our cavity design performance are beyond requirements.

The 200 MeV H− Linac has been operational for the last 45 years providing beam for the physics and isotope programs. Yearly integrated intensity delivered to BLIP has bean increased by six fold in past decade. Recently we have finish intensity, which resulted 40% more intensity for Brookhaven Linac Isotope Program (BLIP) and reduced losses along the linac and transfer line to BLIP by several folds. We will present detail of the upgrade and the future upgrades plane to further increase the intensity by factor of two

Isotope production yield rate is directly proportional to beam power, especially for heavy ions. Higher beam kinetic energy on target drives more isotope yield. FRIB has an energy upgrade plan up to ≥ 400 MeV/u for Uranium and already prepared a vacant space in the design stage and cryogenic capacity that accommodates for the energy upgrade plan[1]. This upgrade requires an optimized linac design and challenging technology for cavity performance improvement. In this paper, we will approach this issue concerning; maximizing final energy, optimum beta, cavity operating frequency, cryogenic power, fabrication and cost in order to develop a cavity that is suitable for the energy upgrade plan.
