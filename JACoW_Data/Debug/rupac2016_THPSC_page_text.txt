In the present work the mathematical model of the multipole system is presented. The multipole system is composed of arbitrary even number of the uniform electrodes. Each of the electrodes is a part of the plane. The potentials of the electrodes are the same modulus and opposite sign for neighboring electrodes. The variable separation method is used to solve the electrostatic problem. The potential distribution is represented as the eigen functions expansions. The boundary conditions and the normal derivative continuity conditions lead to the linear algebraic equations system relative to the series coefficients.

Magnetic systems are widespread in nature and technic. For example, they are the component of accelerator and spectrometer facilities, stabilization systems of artificial satellites etc. Nowadays the most often used methods for numerical analysis of magnetic systems are methods of finite differences, finite elements, boundary integral elements etc. The main disadvantage of these methods is the necessity to generate and adjust the computational grid for each unique area. The R-function method, proposed by Ukrainian academic of National academy of science V.L.Rvachev, can be an alternative to existing methods for magnetic systems calculation. This method allows to build so called "solution structures" - bundle of functions that exactly meets the boundary value problems. Method treats the geometry exactly as well. The use of R-function method to calculate magnetic field in spectrometric magnet SP-40 is observed. Solution structure that takes into account the geometry of the area occupied by magnetic system, meets all boundary conditions, including matched conditions on the "ferromagnetic-vacuum" edge is build for this problem. Approximation of the indefinite component of the solution structure is proposed to calculate using Galerkin method.

The traditional electron beam scanning magnet has many disadvantages, for example, the regulatory of excitation current is very complex and the irradiation uniformity as well as the irradiation area is very difficult to improve and expand. Thus the author of the paper proposes an innovative technology of a permanent magnet spread system for 10 MeV irradiation accelerator which uses a special configuration of the magnetic field to spread electron beam bunch directly and would remarkably improve the spread uniformity, simplify the accelerator and would be helpful to protect the titanium window and expand the irradiation area. Also, the technology could as well be used on the electron beam irradiation of those irregular structured objects of large size.

Beam injectors in tokamaks are utilized for plasma heating and diagnostics. Due to the relatively large distance between the injectors and plasma, the tokamak stray magnetic field inside injectors during the operation should be very low (down to the tenths of Gauss) to avoid the deflection of the ion beams. The Magnetic Field Reduction System (MFRS) should be used to reduce the stray magnetic field produced by the tokamak EM systems and plasma to an acceptable level inside the injectors. In total, the complex MFRS can consist of a passive magnetic shield and active coils to provide the strict design criteria during a plasma scenario. To provide precise computations, detailed numerical models of MFRS should have the dimensions up to several tens of millions of degrees of freedom. Such problem could be solved only with the use of high-efficiency vector algorithms and parallel computations. The paper is dedicated to simulation of MFRS for beam injectors in tokamaks.

Large electrophysical apparatus (accelerators, detectors, tokamaks, stellarators) usually produce strong magnetic fields, which magnetizing surrounding ferromagnetics (steel masses). For example, concrete structures of buildings are reinforced with steel rebar that can produce a local substantial contribution into the magnetic field in the area where the service staff and magnetically sensitive equipment is located. The article describes an advanced approach to modelling magnetic properties of reinforced concrete structures taking into account the anisotropic effect due to rod layers orientations. The equivalent model has been validated in the computation of a test problem. For comparison, simulations have been carried out with a detailed 3D FE model that describes each of the steel rods. The equivalent model has required a few times less finite elements than the detailed model. A comparison of the fields obtained has demonstrated a very good match, even for the distances comparable with the rebar rod gaps.

This paper is devoted to magnetic systems for beam transport at extraction channels of electron industrial accelerators of the ILU type. The extraction systems meant for energy of the accelerated electrons up to 10 MeV and beam power up to 100 kW are described. The analysis of their work subject to the processes connected with the induced eddy currents in metal walls of beam scanning chambers is made; special attention is paid to forming of the dose field in a radiation zone. In paper the magnetic system for bending of the nonmonochromatic beams is offered to application. The essence of the described device consists in application of two identical magnetic mirrors in which distribution of magnetic field on depth is formed so that natural rise of magnetic field intensity on an entrance to a mirror is followed by decrease of this field under a certain law. In the issue of impact on charged particles of forces arising in cylindrical lenses of each mirror is possible to compensate angular divergence of strongly nonmonochromatic beams in gaps of magnetic mirrors and to receive after bending a beam with parameters close to phase characteristics of an input beam. The design procedure of such bending device and a general view of installation for experimental check of the offered bending system on electron beam are given in this paper.

Modern particle accelerators and detectors* contain magnetic systems of complex geometrical configuration. Design and optimization of the systems led to the necessity of solving a nonlinear boundary-value problem of the magnetostatic. The considered region consists of two sub-domains namely: vacuum and ferromagnetic. In view of complexity of magnetic systems, the ferromagnetic/vacuum boundary can be non-smooth, i.e. it includes a corner point that separate two smooth curves belongs to different sub-domains and crossed in the corner point at some angle. A nonlinear differential equation of divergent type in the domain with a corner and the opportunity of existence of solutions with an unlimitedly growing module of gradient in the vicinity of the corner point have been considers in**. A theorem of limitation of the module of gradient of the solution in the vicinity of the corner point in the case of the magnetic permeability satisfying to certain conditions at high fields was proved. An upper estimate of the maximum possible growth of the magnetic field in the corner domain is presented in [4]. The method of designing the differential mesh near the corner domain allowed reducing considerably a relative error of calculating the magnetic field in the considered design problems. Examples of calculating some magnetic systems containing a domain with the corner point are given in [2-4].

The possibility to design, manufacture and test the dipole type magnets from the second generation high-temperature superconductors (HTS-II like YBCO and ReBCO) was demonstrated at the Efremov Institute. The paper describes available computation techniques, design approaches and manufacturing equipment, which could be used to meet the modern requirements for the magnets of accelerators, research equipment, magnet levitation systems etc. The manufacturing equipment comprises the winding lines and insulating devices to provide different configurations and insulating schemes of coils. Additionally, an equipment to produce the Roebel-cable for high current applications was procured and put in operation. As an example, the results of development of the HTC-II dipole type magnets for the different kind dummies of maglev systems are presented. The ReBCO tapes produced by JSC "SuperOx" (Moscow) were used. Up to 0.5 T magnets cooled by liquid nitrogen were designed as a part of levitation system consists of permanent, HTS-II and normal conductive magnets. Comprehensive tests verified the computation results and demonstrated the readiness to develop HTS-II dipole magnets under the customer requirements.

Development and creation of the NICA acceleration complex are continued at JINR (Dubna). One of the main facilities of the complex is the Booster in which preliminary acceleration and cooling of an ion beam is performed. Further acceleration is fulfilled in the circular accelerator NUCLOTRON. The beam transfer from the Booster into the NUCLOTRON is provided by means of the fast extraction system and one of its central elements is the kicker magnet. For the beam deflecting into the extraction septum-magnet it is supposed to use the nonferrous kicker magnet consisting of two couples of conductors. Recent changes made in configuration of the Booster extraction section demand decrease of the kicker magnet length that leads to change of the beam extraction scheme. This report is devoted to the choice of the alternative design of the magnet (the nonsymmetrical variant).

Pulsed deflecting magnet (kicker) project was worked out in BINP (Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics). The kicker design task is: impulsive force value is 1 mT*m, pulse edge is 5 ns, and impulse duration is about 200 ns. The unconventional approach is for plates to be substituted by a set of cylinders. Obtained magnet construction allows controlling field homogeneity by changing currents magnitudes in cylinders. Furthermore we demonstrated the method of field optimization. In addition the harmonic components measurement technique was considered and the possibility to control harmonic components value was shown.

In the end of 2015 the Injection Complex VEPP-5 was turned into operation in the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia). The main purpose of the VEPP-5 facility is supply the BINP colliders VEPP-2000 and VEPP-4 with high intense beams of electrons and positrons. At the VEPP200 synchrotron buster BEP is used as collector ring for electron or positron beams which supplied by VEPP-5. A generator of a pair of negative and positive polarity pulses bases on two double pulse forming network with hydrogen thyratrons was used for injection and extraction into BEP. The rise and fall time of this pulse have a typical time is 85 ns, and the period of revolution electron and positron beams in BEP is 70 ns. The pulses with rise/fall time no more 20ns and flat top not less 20 ns is necessary to provide for a new scheme of injection. The concept of the power supply for such kicker system is presented in the paper.

In the framework of the HL-LHC project, the vacuum performance of new surface material needs to be studied. In particular, a-C coating is proposed as an anti-multipactor surface in the HL-LHC Inner Triplets. Since the protons in the HL-LHC Inner Triplets will generate synchrotron radiation (SR) with ~ 10 eV critical energy and ~ 1016 ph/m/s flux, it is therefore of great importance to study the impact of such photons on a-C coating held at room and cryogenic temperature and compare the results against present LHC material. This paper describes construction and parameters of experimental set-up based on new Synchrotron Radiation beamline from booster synchrotron BEP at BINP. The experimental program releasing in collaboration between CERN and BINP for performing measurements of photon stimulated gas desorption, photon distribution and photo-electron emission provoked by synchrotron radiation are presented

NICA is a new accelerator collider complex under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. The facility is aimed at providing collider experiments with heavy ions up to Gold in a center of mass energy range from 4 to 11 GeV/u and an average luminosity up to 1027 cm-2 s-1. The collisions of polarized deuterons are also foreseen. The facility includes two injector chains, a new superconducting booster synchrotron, the existing superconducting synchrotron Nuclotron, and a new superconducting collider consisting of two rings, each of about 500 m in circumference. Vacuum volumes of the accelerator booster and Nuclotron and the superconducting collider are divided into volumes of superconducting elements thermal enclosure and beam chambers. The beam chambers consist regular cold periods, which are at a temperature of 4.2K to 80K, and warm irregular gaps at room temperature. Operating pressure in the thermal enclosure vacuum volumes have to maintained in the range of 10-7 to 10-4 mbar, in the beam chamber cold and warm areas - not more than 2·10-11 mbar. The requirements for materials, surface preparation conditions and the level of leakage in the vacuum volume are set out. The description of way to achievement and maintenance of the working vacuum in the NICA project are presented.

The total length of European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) tunnels is 5,77 km. There are used about 300 corrector magnets for tuning electron beam. Every corrector magnet is fed by separate power supply. Power supplies for corrector magnets are distributed in 6 halls. So, replacing of one failed power supply produced too long pause in facility operations. The paper discussed different solutions which allow increasing reliability of corrector magnet power supply system for European XFEL.

The power supply system for corrector magnets of European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) includes more than 300 pieces the precise current sources. To avoid the influence each power supplies to others power supplies the developers should consider and provide the electromagnetic compatibility of power supply system components on the designing phase. For this purpose there should be limited electromagnetic emission from power supplies. There is necessity to provide the tolerance of power supplies against electromagnetic emission, electrostatic discharges and other interference from outside. The paper presents the structural solutions which allowed to provide electromagnetic compatibility and results of testing the developed power supplies.

At this time BINP are working on material research for the ITER project. The spatial inhomogeneity of deformation is the scope of this study. An optical pattern generator GOG-1001 that increases the energy of monochromatic light source is used in such experiments. GOG-1001 is powered by a high-voltage quasi-momentum PS that feeds energy stored in a capacitor bank to the generator's pump tube. A pulsed voltage source driven by FPGA controller module has been developed. The module controls correct bank charge, monitors tube's current and voltage as well as calculates the energy supplied to the bank and activates the generator. A hardware bank overcharge protection prevents the pump tube from failure. The developed source has two control modes; remote - workstation and manual - front panel. The source control logic is based on FPGA while communication and date computing is processed by a digital processor and a graphic display.

The system of beam correction for European XFEL includes about 400 precise current sources. Before including in XFEL equipment the every current source must tested and verified in concordance with specifications. For this purpose there was developed the automated system allowing to test up to 7 current sources simultaneously. The system consists of stand and software that written for linux OS. The stand was equipped by test loads, which emulated the real load, by precise DCCT and by precise analog-to-digital converters with CANbus interface. During testing the current in each current source was changed and digitized in concordance with different algorithms. The duration of typical session was 25 hours. The specific software was developed for this stand. It provides testing process, collecting and storing the primary information and displaying the first information. There are addition utilities which allows to make different analyzes in off-line mode using data accumulated during tests. The article provides a detailed description of the stand and main results.

The report deals with the source of pulsed high voltage, and simultaneously, source of the pulsed current for the magnetic insulation of electrons near the cathode that was developed for a high-current accelerator of deuterons with laser-plasma anode. The accelerating voltage up to 400 kV and ion current about 1 kA have been achieved. The current in the spiral inductor has reached 4 kA and it excludes breakdown between the cathode and anode for 0.5 mks. For synchronization of physical processes in accelerator of deuterons with pulsed power, the laser control is applied.

OCEM and ENEA gained a wide experience in the design and experimental characterization of fast and accurate switching systems for high DC currents, as required to supply magnets and superconductors. The exploited idea consists in inserting an electronic switch in parallel to a light electromechanical switch in air to combine the benefits of both devices. The electronic switch is turned on and off to support the electromechanical commutations limiting their jitter and the arcs that would reduce the system lifetime. During the already performed tests, DC currents up to 20 kA were diverted in less than 100 mks with good repeatability. In case of emergency, the current can be interrupted in few tens of milliseconds. A resistor can be inserted in parallel to the switch to discharge inductive loads or to produce desired overvoltages (a voltage up to 5 kV was reached in this configuration). Specific circuits were designed to preserve the components from transient voltage overshoots. This switching system is expected to work for 10000 operations without major maintenance. The developed solutions may be extended to many relevant applications as particle accelerators and HVDC networks.

The source of negative hydrogen ions is constructed at IHEP for the implementation of multiturn charge-exchange injection to increase the intensity of IHEP buster. Surface-plasma ion souce (SPS) with Penning discharge is selected as a source of H-minus ions. A set of power supplies for SPS, which includes the extraction voltage power supply, the discharge power supplies, the hydrogen gas pulse valve power supply, cesium oven and cesium storage device temperature controllers, was designed, constructed and tested on the equivalent loads. This set of power supplies will allows for commissioning and testing the ion source with the beam extraction energy up to 25 keV and repetition rate 25 Hz.

In the BINP SB RAS was proposed and created a source of epithermal neutrons for BNCT. The proton beam is obtained on a tandem accelerator with vacuum insulation. Sectionalized demountable feed through insulator is an integral part of the accelerator. Voltage from the high voltage source is distributed to the electrodes via resistive divider. Because of the small amount of current (hundreds of microamperes) flowing through the divider, dark currents that occur in the accelerating gaps, can significantly affect the uniform distribution of the potential along the accelerating channel, and, consequently, on the beam transportation. Therefore there is a need to change the design of the feed through insulator which will allow to set potentials at the electrodes directly from the high voltage rectifier sections. To study the feasibility of such changes has been designed and built an experimental stand, in which a single insulator with double height subjected to the same conditions as in accelerator. On the experimental stand was studied electrical strength of ceramic and polycarbonate insulators with a different shape of the surface. The paper presents the results of experimental studies of insulators. Their application will get rid of the voltage divider inside the feed through insulator and realize the scheme which allows to set potential on the electrode gaps directly from the rectifier section. This will increase the operating voltage of the accelerator and its reliability.

In BINP the neutron source for BNCT based on proton accelerator was designed and built. It is necessary for the therapy to ensure a stable proton beam current of not less than 3 mA with energy 2 MeV. During the injection of negative hydrogen ion beam into the accelerator the unwanted charged particles are produced, affecting the stability of beam parameters. The article describes meth-ods of suppression of undesirable charged particles and the results of experiments.

In the BINP SB RAS was created a source of epithermal neutrons for BNCT. The proton beam is obtained by stripping negative hydrogen inside gas target. Using the gas target leads to interaction of injected beam with gas and producing unwanted flow of electrons in accelerating channel. Occurred electrons are accelerated up to 1 MeV energy, bombard the electrodes and produce radiation. For suppressing of electrons, electrodes diaphragm with magnets was designed. Diaphragm was set on first electrode, where electrons have low (166 keV) energy. The field about 15 mT separate main beam particles and electrons on 2 components. Thus, the main beam passes freely through diaphragm and accelerates, and electrons beam, with low energy, land on the first electrode. This article shows that the setting of diaphragm with magnets conduct to ~30% decreasing of radiation dose. Also, we discussed negative sides and technical solutions of this modification, such as reducing of potential on first electrode by electrons or demagnetization magnets by the beam.

The article considers three versions of high-voltage generators of ELV accelerators: the cuircut with a doubling of AC voltage inside rectifying sections and serious connection of them, the circuit with series-parallel connection of the rectyfying sections, and the scheme is a quadrupling of AC voltage inside sections with the series connection. The scheme of doubling is used in electron accelerators with beam current not to exceed 70mA. Series-parallel scheme is applied in particle accelerators with the maximum beam current of from 66 to 100 mm. These two types of HV generators are used in typical ELV accelerators. The scheme that utilizes the quadrupling voltage rectifying sections are used in accelerators with high gradient of the electric field at the height of the columns. This scheme was tested and prepared for use in research settings.

Insulated core transformer (ICT) electron accelerator is an ideal prototype in low energy radiation processing industry, and ICT high voltage power supply is the essential apparatus. Conventional ICT high voltage power supply uses laminated silicon steel sheets as magnetic cores and works at 50 Hz. In a novel design of the ICT high voltage power supply, the magnetic cores made of ferrite material are adopted to increase the frequency and improve the performance. Focusing on the new scheme, the loss calculation of the high voltage power supply was carried out. The loss of ferrite magnetic cores and the windings was analysed and simulated.

Insulated core transformer (ICT) high voltage power supply is an ideal model for industrial radiation accelerator at energy below 1MeV. Compared to the traditional scheme, a novel ICT high voltage power supply was put forward. Conventional silicon steel sheets were replaced with manganese zinc ferrites, raising working frequency from 50Hz to thousand hertz. Magnetic structure was changed from three-phase structure to four-phase structure. Accordingly, excitation voltage was changed from three-phase sinusoidal wave to square wave. Polyimide was chosen as insulation material instead of teflon or mica. A prototype of 400kV/50mA was designed, simulated and verified with the aid of finite element analysis software. To optimize the voltage distribution, corresponding flux compensation methods were raised to solve the problem of flux leakages.

A compact FEL oscillator is constructed to provide THz radiation through 30um to 300um in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). This project is proposed to produce a type of cost-effective THz source with table-top scale for civil use. So that, besides high performance, an extreme compact layout has been pursued in design and system assembly, by compressing beam line elements and simplifying diagnostic system under the premise of sufficient accuracy. Which means some obstacles come out in beam commissioning, such as inadequate online observation and tuning manners. This paper describes the assembly scheme and beam diagnostic methods for the HUST THz-FEL prototype, reports how to implement beam-based alignment for the transfer line and gives experiment results respectively.

A compact terahertz free electron laser (THz-FEL) prototype has been built up in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). In the prototype, a 0.85m long linac was designed to deliver electron beams with maximum energy of 14MeV and coaxial absorbing load instead of output coupler was selected to achieve a compact structure. In this case, no transmitted power signal could be used to determine the RF breakdown point (RFBP) in the linac cavity. Here we reported how the RFBP can be localized with just the input and reflected power signals through two methods. One refers to the analysis of time delay of the two signals and the other refers to the calculation of amplitude of the two signals. Quantitative analysis showed the two methods were well consistent with each other and indicated the RFBP located at the end of the linac cavity.

Nowadays project RISP is developed in IBS, Daejeon. One of the main project device is graphite target system meant for production of rare isotopes by means of the in-flight fragmentation (IF) technique. The power inside the target system deposited by the primary beam with energy of 200 MeV/u is estimated to be around 100 kW. The target represents rotating multi-slice graphite disc cooled by thermal radiation. Necessary step of target development is integrated test of target prototype under high power electron beam modelling real energy deposit into target. This test is planned to be held in BINP, Novosibirsk, with the use of ELV-6 accelerator. Heavy-ion beam will be modelled by the e- beam of ELV-6 accelerator with diameter down to ~1 mm and energy 800 keV (minimum possible). IF target is not full stopping target for an electron beam with energy 800 keV. Considerable part of beam energy will be not absorbed by a target material and must be deposited into special beam dump. In this paper the design of beam dump of the graphite cone geometry cooled by thermal irradiation is described.

Nowadays laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) is considered as one a perspective method for GeV electron beam production. Combination of laser accelerated electrons and Compton backscattering of probe light beam opens possibility to create the table top source of femtosecond light beam in x-ray and gamma range. Project of laser-driven Compton light source started in ILP SB RAS in collaboration with BINP SB RAS. Production of 1-10 pC electron beams sub-ps time range duration with energies up to 100 MeV is expected as a result of the first stage of the project. Since energy of electrons does not exceed of 100 MeV, it allows using Faraday cup (FC) with reasonable dimensions, instead of commonly used integrating current transformer (ICT). Geometry of FC was optimized taking into account of beam stopping simulation as well as low capacity requirement. RF properties, simulation of the system operation were carried out. System has been tested at the VEPP-5 electron linac. Results of development and testing of this FC are presented.

Results of gamma beam profile experimental investigations by measuring of Cherenkov radiation* generated in a fiber with 0.6 mm thickness and in a glass rod with 5 mm diameter are presented. These experiments were carried out on bremsstrahlung beam of the linear accelerator 'Philips SL-75' with 6 MeV energy and 4 Gr/min dose rate at 1 m distance. In works ** and *** authors have showed feasibility of Cherenkov radiation applying for high energy beam diagnostics. In our work the Cherenkov radiation yield dependence on the fiber orientation relative to the beam axis was investigated and showed that the maximal light yield corresponds to the angle between fiber and beam axes closed to the Cherenkov angle. When dose rate is higher than 1 Gr/min at 1 m distance one can register a light yield for the fiber orientation even less than Cherenkov angle. We suppose that the observed effect is connected with generating of electromagnetic shower by initial photons. Proposed technique of bremsstrahlung and electron **** beams profile measurements differs from well-known techniques based on ionization chambers due to its insensitive to low energy part of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and to undesirable background. Using this technique for beam profile scanning it is possible to construct compact and noise insensitive device relative to the well-known systems. It is also possible to reach submillimeter resolution with this device.

One of the most informative diagnostic methods dielectric materials is the analysis of the complex permittivity depending on the frequency of the electric field*. Dielectric chart is the dependence of the imaginary part of the complex permittivity of its real part. Thus, difference between the real dielectric chart from the reference or change it during the operation can be a means of diagnostics of dielectric materials. Dielectric chart in the classical theory of Debye is a semicircle with its center lying on the real axis. For solid dielectric the dielectric chart deviation from the semicircle can be quite large, but it still remains a circular arc. This deviation is characterized by parameter a (in the case of the Debye a=0). To clarify the physical meaning of the deviations of the experimental data on the Debye theory, expressed in the value of a, several possible causes have been considered: the effect hindered reorientation of dipoles, the effect of the non-sphericity of the molecules, the complex nature of viscosity. However, the main cause of deviations, in our opinion, is the availability of the distribution of relaxation times around a central relaxation time, in particular, due to defects in the sample. Gaussian distribution width increases rapidly with increasing a. In this paper we propose an algorithm for calculating a, allowing you to quickly determine the condition of the sample on a single parameter.

In order to design and construct new modern accelerators with high brightness beams, the development new non-destructive diagnostic tools for accelerated beams is required. Diffraction radiation (DR) is generated by charged particles moving in the vicinity of the conductive target. The DR technique is used successfully for non-destructive diagnostics for ultrarelativistic beams*,**. For non-relativistic and moderately relativistic charged particles beams (g ~ a few tens or less, g is the Lorentz factor) non-destructive DR diagnostics can be applied also if a beam intensity is high enough due to coherent effect. Intensity of coherent radiation is proportional to the squared bunch population. In this report estimations of non-destructive bunch diagnostics possibility based on DR for the beam parameters of a few machines are presented. Those estimations were performed for electron machine: PITZ project*** and laser wakefield accelerator****, and moreover for ESS proton linear accelerator*****. First evaluation of whole wavelength range DR from 4-mm-slit target gave about 56 mJ from one macro-pulse of ESS accelerator. Amplification of DR spectral-angular intensity due to coherent effect will be in N = 108 times than incoherent radiation from the same beam, where N is the bunch population.

The paper presents studies of the longitudinal broadband impedance of VEPP-4M and measurements of its bunch energy spread at different energies in range of 1.45 - 3.5 GeV. In order to measure the longitudinal bunch size at different currents we used PS-1/S1 streak camera with picosecond temporal resolution. Considering that influence of collective effects is negligible at low currents we determined bunch energy spread from its length at low currents. Collected bunch length data demonstrate microwave instability thresholds and potential well distortion lengthening. Potential well distortion was studied at 3 GeV and 3.5 GeV. Measured potential well distortion lengthening was used to estimate a value of the reactive part of the longitudinal impedance. Observed microwave instability thresholds was used to measure the value of broadband impedance. Measured value of the VEPP-4M is 7.9 ± 1.5 Ohm.

The stabilization system is designed to prevent drift of the spot SR at the experimental stations by local changes of the orbit. This system was developed and implemented about twelve years ago as an element of the ACS and worked well. Produced by modernization has led to the need of adaptation of the system of stabilization not only in hardware but also in software. Work on updating of the stabilization system and will be shown next.

Bunch shape monitors, based on a transverse RF-scanning of secondary electrons, are used for measurements of particles longitudinal distribution in bunches at different linear ion accelerators. The phase resolution of such monitors depends crucially on accuracy of fabrication and tuning of RF-deflector, thus preliminary simulations of its electrodynamic characteristics are of importance for subsequent commissioning of the monitor. Simulations of some basic operational electrodynamic parameters and results of experimental measurements are presented.

In order to exploit an accelerator successfully all parameters should be set correctly. To check and fix errors in the accelerator lattice measurements of parameters of the betatron motion and measurements of optical functions of the accelerator lattice are used. Due to Model Independent Analysis it is possible to carry out measurements of the beta-function and the phase advance fast. Using NAFF technique lets us compute betatron tune with good precision. Limiting capabilities of the MIA at SIS100 project are discussed, the first results of the application of MIA and NAFF techniques at booster VEPP-5 and at collider VEPP-2000 are shown.

Wire-based beam instrumentation remains a reference for calibration of many other instruments, providing direct and accurate measurements with high resolution. However beam power increasing of existing and forthcoming ion linacs results in strict constraints on operation modes acceptable for control and diagnostics. Relevant simulations of wire thermal loads are necessary not only for a mode choice, but also for a preliminary design of such instrumentation. Simulations for different wire materials and various beam parameters are made. Features of the model are discussed. Numerical estimations and conclusions are presented in comparison with some experimental results.

The paper describes the bunch length measurement system for VEPP-2000 collider, equiped with optical analysers based on LI-602 dissector, which provides permanent measurements of the longitudinal beam profile. Potential well distorsion lengthening was measured at different bunch currents for the energies below 500 MeV. First measurements reveals the presence of microwave instabilty with turbulent emittance growth. The thresholds of these processes was used to estimate the values of reactive part of the longitudinal impedance. Measured energy loss factors was compared with computer simulations for the RF cavity. All results will be discussed and further estimations will be given.

The Collector Ring (CR) is a dedicated storage ring in the FAIR project, where the main emphasis is laid on the effective stochastic precooling of intense secondary beams of stable ions, rare isotopes or antiprotons. A complex operation scheme with several types of operational cycles with beams in CR starting from injection, RF gymnastics, stochastic cooling then, and finishing to extraction is foreseen. Beam parameters changes significantly during the cycles. This demands an exceptional high dynamic range for the beam instrumentation. Non-destructive methods are mandatory for high currents as well as for the low current secondary beams due to the low repetition rate. Precise measurements of all beam parameters and automatic steering with short response time are required due to the necessary exploitation of the full ring acceptances. An overview of the challenges and solutions for various diagnostic installations will be given.

The Novosibirsk Free Electron Laser (FEL) is based on a 4-turn microtron-recuperator. To ensure its stable operation and radiation generation, it is necessary to provide a stable mode of electron beam recirculation and minimize beam losses on the vacuum chamber wall on all the way of beam in the accelerator beamline. To fulfil this task it is necessary to know the longitudinal distribution of these losses along the beamline. To this end, a system for registration of beam losses was created. The system applies optical fibers placed along the full length of the vacuum chamber and nearby it. In case of local electron beam losses somewhere in the vacuum chamber, electrons falling to the vacuum chamber wall cause generation of X- and gamma rays. This radiation in turn causes generation of optical radiation in the optic fiber nearby the region of electron 'precipitation' on the chamber wall. Then, executing some transformation and processing of the time dependencies of signals from these optic fibers, one can obtain the longitudinal distribution of electron beam losses along the whole accelerator channel in all its 4 turns.

The report presents the results of development the method TLSH* for finding of the particle speed distribution (PSD) in beams of accelerators. PSD is deduced from the Volterra integral equation of the first kind with the right part, which is by the dependence of Cherenkov radiation intensity (ChRI) from n, experimentally obtained for the given beam. PSD is the second derivative of ChRI. The problem of stability of the second derivative is solved by attracting the priori information (for example, nonnegative of the solution). Using optical dispersion of radiator is discussed. It enables to find PSD even in the single cluster of particles. The possibility of determining the PSD in the cross section beam is discussed too. The method also enables to find PSD upon a noticeable transverse speed of the particles in the beam. The method is virtually non-destructive in many cases.

Molecule of 4-pentyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (CB5), its dimers and their interaction with such dyes as diaminonitrobenzol, nitrozodimethylaniline and dimetilaminonitrostirol were investigated by the method of density functional theory (DFT). The electronic absorption spectra of isolated dye molecules and the resulting complexes with 4-pentyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl were calculated. It was shown that the shift of the absorption bands in the spectra of the dye depends on the structure of the complex. The shift and splitting of the bands minor impurity dye molecules placed in the liquid crystal gives an indication of the mesophase structure.

A quarter wavelength coaxial cavity has been developed for triode-type thermionic RF gun. The triode-type RF gun is a modification of present 4.5 cell thermionic RF gun of KU-FEL (Kyoto University Free Electron Laser) facility with aim to mitigate the back'bombardment effect. Thereby a coaxial quarter wavelength cavity with cathode material shall be added to the main 4.5 cell accelerating body. The coaxial cavity has the function of pre-buncher to control the injection phase and power of electron bunches into the main accelerating body*. Transient tests have demonstrated the quarter wavelength cavity to be undercoupled. However, for operation at high beam loading conditions overcoupled conditions are required. In order to control the coupling we have developed an external air side coaxial quarter wavelength impedance converter. The design of the impedance converter enables operation at high RF power (<20 kV) without changing the cavity geometry. In this work we present our design and performance of quarter wavelength impedance converter as applied to quarter wavelength triode cavity.

Integrated inspection method of motor transports was suggested based on linear electron accelerator and neutron generator, which helps to detect substances forbidden for carrying, including explosives, narcotic drugs and fissionable materials. The linear high-frequency electron accelerator is a source of X-ray bremsstrahlung. The result of scanning is an introscopical image of a motor transport with color-selected suspicious substances. The neutron activation analysis of these substances with neutron generator as a neutron source lets detect elemental substance composition as well as identify explosives or narcotic drugs. This article contains accelerator specifications, which lets implement suggested method.

In The Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics the accelerator-based source of epithermal neutrons was invented and now operates to be used in the boron neutron capture therapy. For several reasons the real beam flow in the facility differs from the calculated one. To take into account this distinction it is necessary to provide continuous monitoring of the beam parameters. In order to optimize the facility operation the beam should be followed not only during the formation but also while an acceleration takes place and the proton beam is thrown on the lithium target as the proton current and energy influence on the neutron output. In this way it seems to be a significant issue to measure the current, profile and also the position of the ion beam in a low-energy part of the accelerator. This work represents the results of experiments with the D-Pace WS-30 Wire Scanner Probe, which was installed in the low-energy part of the accelerator. The experiments were carried out under various conditions to vary the position and focusing control via the system of magnetic correcting elements. To correctly interpret experimental data it was necessary to take into account physical phenomena which occur during an experiment. In this way the effects which take place when the probe interacts with the beam were thoroughly considered. The obtained results allowed to restore the ion beam profile, define its size and position.

In The Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics the accelerator-based source of epithermal neutrons was invented and now operates to be used in the boron neutron capture therapy. Neutrons on the facility are generated during the threshold reaction 7Li(p, n)7Be which occurs when the proton beam is thrown on the lithium target. To control the neutron output it is necessary to monitor the parameters of the accelerated proton beam. The spatial distribution of the accelerated proton beam was measured exactly on the lithium target. Due to the interaction of protons and lithium there is an accumulation of a radioactive isotope of beryllium takes place. After experiments about neutrons generation it seems possible to track an area of beryllium storage and then restore the proton beam profile. The monitoring of gamma-quants with the energy of 0,477 MeV arising during the beryllium decay was carried out via the gamma-spectrometric complex. The main part of this complex is NaI-scintillation detector, which was pre-calibrated with energy. As a result of such kind of diagnostic the profile of the beam, its shape and characteristic size were determined and the results are depicted in this paper. Afterwards it could be used for an estimation of the total neutrons flux, its quantity, also to assess the target state and restore the proton beam profile.

Current measurement techniques of the charged particles flux density distribution in the beam cross-section have a number of disadvantages, such as radiation dose limitation on detection equipment units and consumable products usage, for example film dosimeters. In this paper we propose a method that allows carrying out express analysis of the charged particles flux density distribution based on mathematical reconstruction technology using the inverse Radon transformation. The research shows the theoretical justification of this method and determination of the necessary projection number. The experimental set up for the cross-section flux density distribution of the charged particles based on mathematical reconstruction technology is presented. The approbation results of this set up on the microtron TPU extracted electron beam are shown. The proposed method allows carrying out express analysis without consumable products, ensuring high spatial resolution, if necessary, less than 1 mm, and working with any charged particle beams in a wide energy range.

1.Previous systems of energy and current stabilization are based on analog PID-controllers. They provide good stability at sufficient speed-work. 2.Increased requirements of technological lines to the speed of the accelerator injection to set-up parameters and introduction of technological lines, in which the accelerator is a slave device and should within the shortest possible time to respond onto the changes of operation input parameters, forced us to find the way of stabilization systems improvement. 3.New stabilization system is able to provide current output speed up to 5mA/sec, at required energy stability. 4.Digital-to-analog stabilization is produced as a superstructure on the existing system and is made as a source code added into the basic accelerator control program. This approach enables to modernize simply the existing accelerators. The code itself is two independent parts. The first part is the current beam corrector, which calculate the derivate (current speed) at a time and aims to hold it in set-up range, taking into account the difference of the tasks and the necessity of cathode warm up. The second part is a energy compensator. It adds the current derivate into accelerator energy channel, reducing the energy settlements at once. 5.Present system passed through the testing and it is already installed onto ELV-0.5(0.5MeV, 100mA) accelerator in Qingzhou (a/m tyre production) and onto ELV-8(2.5MeV, 40mA) accelerators in China for cable insulation treatment.

Hardware-software complex "PIRS-5" was developed to make measurements in warm accelerating structures.  The idea was to create full-automatic measuring system, which can measure electrical field at the bead position with non-resonant and resonant pull techniques. PIRS-5 has postprocessor, which calculate electrical component from the frequency, reflection or transmission coefficient, shunt and effective shunt impedance. This work describes the construction of this complex, its mathematical part and possible future modifications.

Injection Complex VEPP-5 was turned into operation in the end of 2015 in the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia). The main task of the facility is production, acceleration and transportation of high intensity electron and positron beams for two BINP's colliders. Now, VEPP-5 successfully delivers electron and positron beams to the collider VEPP-2000 and ready to start operation with the acceleration complex VEPP-4M. Beam diagnostics issues are very important for VEPP-5 facility tuning during the operation. Longitudinal beam diagnostic based on synchrotron radiation in the VEPP-5 Damping Ring is presented in the article. Equipment operation principle, main measurement results and future prospects are presented in this paper.

In the process of creating a bench for radiation tests of electronic products on the synchrocyclotron of the PNPI absolute monitor, providing on-line measurement of the total number of protons with energy of 64 - 1000 MeV in the range fluxes of 106 - 109 s−1 with a cross section of the beam 2 - 20 cm2, was developed and extensively investigated. As detector we use a two-section ionization chamber filled with air at normal pressure. It structurally consists of two ionization chambers with different interelectrode distances, combined into a single module. Electrodes made of aluminum foil with a thickness of 10 mkm. The number of protons that have passed through the two-section ionization chamber, is calculated in real time according to the developed algorithm. Experimental information about the total number of protons and the average value of the flux of protons is displayed on the screen of the computer monitor. Photographic images of the proton beam of various energy were used for the analysis of the density distribution of protons in the beam. With their help, the method of computing the number of protons falling on any given area of the irradiated object was developed and experimentally verified.

The report discusses development of the host-based data acquisition system to control the accelerator. We consider modes of timing and allocation of operations of the system node. The time of any working cycle, rate of a data flow and an amount of serviced tasks are coordinated with characteristics of the node. Estimations of the readout rate of the data and the waiting time demonstrate the system efficiency. The data acquisition technique has been developed to provide checking of pulse parameters and control the linac LUE-200 of the neutron source IREN*.

This paper presents general description of hardware and software of the neutral beam injector control system. The system is developed for control of the neutral beam injector which operates with 15-25 keV deuterium and hydrogen beams of 2 s maximum duration. It performs injection parameters calculation according to the desired beam power vs time curve, synchronizes and protects the injector subsystems and acquires its data during the shot. It also controls the injector operation between the shots. The system is based on an industrial computer with National Instruments PCIe boards: two PCIe-7842R reconfigurable input-output modules and a PCIe-6323 data acquisition module. An in-house developed interfacing module (cross-box) as well as serial to fiber optic converters are used for galvanic isolation and electrical compatibility with the injector subsystems. User interface software and PCIe boards programmable logic firmware are implemented in LabVIEW. Injection calculations and results acquired are represented with MATLAB.

The European XFEL is under construction now in Hamburg. It is a big international project. Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) developed, produced and delivered power supplies for corrector magnets of XFEL. A controller for these power supplies was developed. It provides an 18 bits resolution of digital-to-analog converter and 6 channels of precise analog-to-digital converter with high accuracy and resolution. A combination of the general purpose functions with the specific function for power supplies allowed using the same controller for different equipment of corrector magnet subsystem. Here is described the controller, its properties and main applications.

A system for live presentation broadcasting has been developed on top of OGG streaming container utilization. The system was built on the base of media server for video and audio exchange between the U70 Accelerator Complex control rooms. A possibility has been added to media server allowing both the variety of clients connections and using of diverse broadcasting sources. The system kernel is represented by special program module that receives live streams from different broadcasting sources and transmits it to the number of connected clients. Any program module with ability of converting data to OGG container format could play the role of broadcasting source. The data for the broadcasting source could be taken from IP camera, computer screen or database table. The client program is a set of HTML5 pages that displays the information about available remote presentation, makes connection and displays the selected ones.

There is the accelerator-tandem at the Nuclear physics institute in Novosibirsk which is suitable for malignancies treatment such as glioblastoma and melanoma using BNCT methods. There are different gamma spectrometry diagnostics which apply under this project. One of these is used to determine the parameters of the neutron beam. The method is to irradiate a set of activation foils with neutrons. Then measure the gamma-spectrum of foils using gamma detector. Based on these data it can be calculated the activity of foil, as well as the amount and the energy of neutrons. For data processing of these diagnostics there was developed a software which is used for convenient display of gamma-spectrometer data and the activity of the foil. Software allows setting a canal calibration and the sensitivity calibration which is needed to calculate the foil activity.

The Linear Induction Accelerator LIA-20 is being created at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. Waveform monitoring system (WMS) is an important part of LIA-20 control system. WMS includes "slow" and "fast" monitoring subsystems. Three kinds of digitizers have been developed for WMS. "Slow" subsystem is based on ADCx32. This digitizer uses four 8 channel multiplexed SAR ADCs (8 us conversion cycle) with 12-bit resolution. Main feature of this module is program configurable channel sequencing, which allows to measure signals with different timing characteristics. Two types of digitizers are involved in "fast" subsystem. The first one, ADC4x250-4CH, is 4-channel 250 MSPS digitizer. The second one, ADC4x250-1CH, is single channel digitizer with sample rate of 1 GSPS. Resolution of both devices is 12 bit. "Fast" modules are based on the common hardware. This paper describes hardware and software architecture of these modules.

The new source of epithermal neutrons*, designed for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT)** of cancer in oncology clinic, was proposed and developed in Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. This method of treatment is effective against several currently incurable radioresistant tumors, such as brain glioblastoma and melanoma metastases. The neutron source includes a new type of accelerator: accelerator-tandem with vacuum insulation, lithium neutron generating target and neutron beam shaping assembly. Current accelerator produces a stationary 5 mA proton beam with 2 MeV energy, but this is not sufficient for therapy on humans. For conducting the experiment on humans it is necessary to create a new power rack for the ion source. The report summarizes results of the development and implementation of new power rack, with remote control and data collection systems, to reach 15 mA beam current. This system will increase the proton beam current and, as a result, the neutron yield, that is needed to heal people.

Nonlinear oscillatory systems are widely applied for the modeling of charge particles motions in cyclotrons in neighborhoods of equilibrium orbits. They are also used for the analysis and synthesis of magnetic control devices. An actual problem for such systems is stabilization of their operating modes. In this report, analytical and numerical investigations of stability of the equilibrium position for a nonlinear oscillatory system are presented. The system can be treated as a mathematical model of magnetic suspension control system of a gyro rotor. A delay in the feedback control scheme and dissipative forces occurring due to energy losses at the interaction of the magnetic field with currents in the control loops are taken into account. Two approaches to the synthesis of stabilizing controls are proposed. The first one is based on the using of gyroscopic control forces. It is applicable in the case of essentially nonlinear homogeneous dissipative forces. The second approach is efficient for systems with linear dissipative forces. For this case, potential control forces are constructed. With the aid of a computer simulation of dynamics of closed-loop systems, a comparison of these approaches is fulfilled, and their features and conditions of applicability are determined.

The charged beam moving in the accelerator is modelled by particle-in-cell method. The control with delay in the connection canal is simulated by the after-effect. Thus, the model is described by system of the differential equations with delay. We observe and estimate changes of particles coordinates in the cross-section of the accelerator. It is supposed that initial conditions are the set with random error and we have chance of updating the solution in periodic timepoints with the same error. The dependence between the estimate dispersion and the measuring error dispersion is recieved.
