KURAMA-II, a successor of a carborne gamma-ray survey system named KURAMA (Kyoto University RAdiation MApping system), has become one of the major systems for the activities related to the nuclear accident at TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. The development of KURAMA-II is still on the way to extend its application areas beyond specialists. One of such activities is the development of cloud services for serving an easy management environment for data management and interactions with existing radiation monitoring schemes. Another trial is to port the system to a single-board computer for serving KURAMA-II as a tool for the prompt establishment of radiation monitoring in a nuclear accident. In this paper, the current status of KURAMA-II on its developments and applications along with some results from its applications are introduced.

EPICS Area Detector connects area detector cameras to plugin pipelines through the standard flat namespace that EPICS provides. Visualizing and re-configuring this port connectivity in AreaDetector can be confusing and - at times - painful. adviewer provides a Qt-based interactive graph visualization of all cameras and plugins, along with per-plugin configuration capabilities and integration with an image viewer. adviewer is built on Python, ophyd, typhon, qtpynodeeditor, and Qt (via qtpy).
