KEK/J-PARC and CERN started the collaboration on the RF systems of Low Energy Ion Ring to use magnetic alloy loaded cavities in 2002 for heavy ion collision program at LHC. It was an exchange of our expertise on the wideband cavities and high-power solid-state amplifiers. This paper summarizes the 20-year collaboration which includes many synchrotrons of both facilities: J-PARC Rapid Cycling Synchrotron and Main Ring, CERN Proton Synchrotron, PS Booster, Antiproton Decelerator, Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring and MedAustron. By the improvements of cavity core using the magnetic annealing, field gradient of cavity and compactness were improved to fit the requirements for LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU)program. Radiation-hard and compact high-power solid-state amplifiers were also developed for LIU and future accelerator improvements.

High gradient acceleration is one of the critical technologies required by future linear colliders, free-electron lasers, and compact linac-based applications. Among decade long effort to break state-of-the-art gradient limitation of ~100 MV/m in normal conducting structures, using RF pulses shorter than 20 ns is a promising approach based on theoretic analysis and experimental observation. In this study, we demonstrated high gradient above 300 MV/m using an X-band 11.7 GHz single-cell travelling-wave structure with 6 ns FWHM RF pulses generated by a power extractor. In comparison, a scaled 11.424 GHz structure only reached below 150 MV/m driven by 30-100 ns RF pulses from a klystron with pulse compression. The experimental results and the suggested new mechanism of beam acceleration in the Breakdown Insensitive Acceleration Regime (BIAR) are presented in this manuscript.

As part of the effort to reduce the energy consumption of large research facilities using accelerators, high efficiency klystrons are being developed by CERN. However, a large fraction of the wall-plug power required to operate these klystrons is used in the focusing magnetic elements around the klystron in the form of normal conducting solenoids. In 2019, a prototype solenoid made of MgB2 was manufactured as a joint venture from CERN, Hitachi and KEK with the aim of reducing the power consumption by a factor ten using higher temperature superconductors. The characteristics of the magnet were measured upon manufacture and checked after the transport across the world. In 2020, the MgB2 magnet was integrated around one of the klystrons in the X-band facility at CERN and put into operation in the beginning of 2021. We present in this paper the final performance of the klystron when fitted with the new SC solenoid and compare it with the standard normal conducting solenoid system.
