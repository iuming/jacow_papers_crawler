The Chinese ADS project now is under key technology R&D and a 25 MeV CW proton superconducting linac is under assembling in Lanzhou by collaboration between IMP in Lanzhou and IHEP in Beijing. The beam commissioning is scheduled in June-July 2017. Before assembling 25 MeV proton linac, IMP team built a 10 MeV proton superconducting linac based on 162.5 MHz HWR cavity technology, which successfully accelerated 9.55-10 MeV@1-2.7 mA CW proton beam in 2016, meanwhile, IHEP team built a 10 MeV proton superconducting linac based on 325 MHz Spoke cavity technology, which successfully accelerated 10 MeV@2.1 mA CW proton beam in 2016. This invited alk will present 1-5 mA CW proton beam commissioning results and lessons learned from the 10-25 MeV superconducting linac.

IFMIF, the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility, is an accelerator-based neutron source that will use Li(d, xn) reactions to generate a flux of neutrons with a broad peak at 14 MeV equivalent to the conditions of the Deuterium-Tritium reactions in a fusion power plant. IFMIF is conceived for fusion materials testing. The IFMIF prototype linear accelerator (LIPAc) is jointly developed by Europe and Japan within the IFMIF EVEDA project: it is composed of an ion source, a LEBT, an RFQ, a MEBT and a SC linac, with a final energy of 9 MeV. The 4-vane Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), developed by INFN in Italy, will accelerate a 130 mA deuteron beam from 0.1 to 5 MeV in continuous wave, for a beam power of 650 kW. The 9.8 m long 175 MHz cavity is composed of 18 x 0.54 m long modules flanged together and aligned within 0.3 mm tolerance. The RFQ was completed, delivered and assembled at the Rokkasho site and is presently under extended RF tests. The second phase of beam commissioning (up to 2.5 MeV/u) was scheduled to start at the end of 2017. Several unexpected issues and incidents significantly delayed the original program, which is however proceeding step by step toward the full achievement of its goals.

China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS)) is a high intensity proton accelerator based facility for delivering spallation neutrons to users. It consists of an 80-MeV H− DTL linac, and a 1.6-GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron and a neutron production target. The accelerators will provide 100 kW proton beam for neutron target. The construction began in 2011, and up to date, the construction of accelerator components has been completed. The beam commissioning will be started soon. It is planned the beam commissioning for the first run will be completed in the end of 2017, and 10 kW proton beam will be available for neutron target. This invited talk presents he detailed commissioning process, with results given for both H− linac and proton rapid cycling synchrotron.
