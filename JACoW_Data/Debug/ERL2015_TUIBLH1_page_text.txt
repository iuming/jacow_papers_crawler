Beam commissioning of the compact ERL (cERL) has been performed since Apr. 2013 for the next generation ERL light source project (PEARL), and x-ray generation via laser Compton scattering was demonstrated recently. We will present two years operational experience and future upgrade plan of the DC photoemission gun at the cERL.

The second 500 kV DC gun with 70 mm anode-cathode gap has been constructed at KEK. In 2014, a high voltage conditioning up to 550 kV was carried out and a 500 kV test has been done more than 50 hours intermittently without any trips. The vacuum of the gun is achieved 6x10-10 Pa during a 500 kV test by pumping NEGs and a bakable cryopump. A beam test has been started from the end of March 2015.

TUIBLH1022
A High-Peak and High-Average Current, Low Emittance, Long Lifetime Electron Source for ERL Applications

This electron source is a thermionic RF gun that eliminates the electron back-bombardment and the poor quality beam existing in a conventional thermionic RF guns. The source would only emit electrons during the peak portion of the RF electric field. The source would operate at CW mode, and capable of high peak and average current, low emittance beam. As an example this technique is applied in generation of the magnetized beam for ion beam electron cooling in Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). Some preliminary proof of principle experiment results are presented.

A prototype of the high average current polarized electron funneling gun as ERL-FFAG based eRHIC injector has built at BNL. In last year, we generated two beams from GaAs photocathodes by CW green laser and combined by a switched combiner field. We observed the combined beams on a YAG crystal ,measured the photocurrent and cathode lifetime by a Faraday cup. In this paper, we will describe the major components of the gun and beam line optics. We will also discuss the recent beam test results and high voltage conditioning results.
