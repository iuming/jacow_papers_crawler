The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is under construction at the Michigan State University. The driver linac consists of a front-end, three superconducting segments connected by two 180-degree bending sections, and a beam delivery system, which will accelerate all stable ions beyond 200 MeV/u and deliver beam to a fragment target with power up to 400 kW. The front-end beam commissioning has been completed recently, and the commissioning of the first three cryomodules is underway. This talk will update the accelerator physics associated with construction and commissioning, present initial beam commissioning results, and report the current status of the project.

RISP (rare isotope science project) is developing a superconducting linac called RAON which can accelerate uranium beams 200 MeV/u of beam energy and 400 kW of beam power for uranium case. The broad range of ions from proton (A/q = 1) to uranium (A/q=7.2) will be used in RAON facility for the application in basic and applied sciences. RAON can also accelerate rare isotope beams generated by ISOL facility in order to generate more exotic isotope beams. Last year, the initial beam test in the SCL demo facility was successfully finished. Based on the vertical and horizontal tests for several types of SCL cavities, the mass production of the supercoducting cavities and cryomodules will start in this year. The beam optics study on error effects in the linac also confirmed that the beam loss should be less than 1 W/m through the linac. This work summarized the status of the linac development, the beam experiment in the SCL demo facility, and the important results in its beam dynamics.
