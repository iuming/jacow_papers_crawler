Over the past several years, the installation of the full 3-dimensional stochastic cooling system in RHIC has been completed. The FY12 U-U and Cu-Au collider runs were the first to benefit from the full installation. In the U-U run, stochastic cooling improved the integrated luminosity by a factor of 5. This presentation provides an overview of the design of the stochastic cooling system and reviews the performance of the system during the FY12 heavy ion runs.
