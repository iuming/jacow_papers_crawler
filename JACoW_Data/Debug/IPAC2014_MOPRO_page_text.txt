The SuperKEKB collider is under construction to achieve 40-times higher luminosity than that of previous KEKB collider. The injector LINAC should provide high-intensity and low-emittance beams of 7-GeV electron and 4-GeV positron for SuperKEKB based on a nano-beam scheme. A photocathode RF-gun for low emittance electron beam has been already installed and the commissioning has started. The construction of positron capture section using a flux-concentrator and the dumping ring for low emittance positron beam is in progress. The simultaneous top-up injections to four storage-rings including photon factories is also required. In the upstream of dumping ring, the compatible optics between positron and electron has been designed. In the downstream of dumping ring, RF phase, focusing, and steering magnets will be switched by pulse to pulse against each beam-mode for optimising beam-transportation. This paper describes recent upgrade status toward the SuperKEKB.

We present analytical calculations of the momentum spectrum of the drive beam in CLIC and the CLIC Test Facility CTF3 after part of its kinetic energy is converted to microwaves for the acceleration of the main beam. The resulting expressions are used to determine parameters of the power conversion process in the Power Extraction Structure (PETS) installed in the Two-beam Test Stand in CTF3.

Ultra-stable and -reproducible high-energy particle beams with short bunches are needed in novel linear accelerators and, in particular, in the Compact Linear Collider CLIC. A passive beam phase stabilization system based on a bunch compression with a negative transfer matrix element R56 and acceleration at a positive off-crest phase is proposed. The motivation and expected advantages of the proposed scheme are outlined.

The Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) proposed by Jefferson Lab is designed to provide high polarization of both colliding beams. One of the unique features of JLab’s MEIC is figure-8 shape of its rings. It allows preservation and control of polarization of all ion species including small-anomalous-magnetic-moment deuterons during their acceleration and storage. The figure-8 design conceptually expands the capability of obtaining polarized high-energy beams in comparison to conventional designs because of its property of having no preferred periodic spin direction. This allows one to control effectively the beam polarization by means of magnetic insertions with small field integrals. We present a complete scheme for preserving the ion polarization during all stages of acceleration and its control in the collider’s experimental straights.

One of the unique features of JLab's Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) is a full-acceptance detector with a dedicated, small-angle, high-resolution detection system, capable of covering a wide range of momenta (and charge-to-mass ratios) with respect to the original ion beam to enable access to new physics. We present an interaction region design developed with close integration of the detection and beam dynamical aspects. The dynamical aspect of the design rests on a symmetry-based concept for compensation of non-linear effects. The optics and geometry have been optimized to accommodate the detection requirements and to ensure the interaction region's modularity for ease of integration into the collider ring lattices. As a result, the design offers an excellent detector performance combined with the necessary provisions for non-linear dynamical optimization.

A highly longitudinally-polarized (over 70%) electron beam is required by the nuclear physics programme of the Medium Energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) at Jefferson Lab (JLab). To achieve this goal, a highly vertically-polarized electron beam is injected from the CEBAF. The polarization will be vertical in the arcs to avoid spin diffusion, and longitudinal at the collision points. The polarization rotation will be accomplished by using a total of four spin rotators, each of which consists of a set of solenoids and dipoles, placed at the ends of two arcs. The polarization configuration cancels the 1st order spin perturbation in the solenoids for the off-momentum particles and significantly reduces the synchrotron sideband resonances. In order to compensate the net Sokolov-Ternov depolarization effect, especially at higher energies, a continuous injection of a polarized electron beam from the CEBAF is being considered. We consider to perform a moderate spin matching in some key regions to extend the polarization lifetime so that the continuous injection can work more efficiently, while not imposing a burden on the optics design of the collider ring.

We present an update on the development of the new code for long-term simulation of beam-beam effects in particle colliders. The underlying physical model relies on a matrix-based arbitrary-order particle tracking (including a symplectic option) for beam transport and the generalized Bassetti-Erskine approximation for beam-beam interaction. The computations are accelerated through a parallel implementation on a hybrid GPU/CPU platform. With the new code, previously computationally prohibitive long-term simulations become tractable. The new code will be used to model the proposed Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) at Jefferson Lab.

The design strategy of the Medium Energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) at Jefferson Lab contemplates both matching of the emittance aspect ratios and a 50 mrad crossing angle along with crab crossing scheme for both electron and ion beams over the energy range (√s=20-70 GeV) to achieve high luminosities at the interaction points (IPs). However, the desired locations for placing the crabbing cavities may include regions where the transverse degrees of freedom of the beams are coupled with variable coupling strength that depends on the collider rings’ magnetic elements (solenoids and skew quadrupoles). In this work we explore the feasibility of employing twin rf dipoles that produce a variable direction crabbing kick to account for a range of transverse coupling of both beams.

In an electron accelerator, ions generated from the residual gas by the circulating electrons act back to the trailing electrons. Under unfavorable conditions this feed-back can cause unstable motion of the electron bunches, the process known as the fast beam ion instability. Current eRHIC design has two FFAG rings transporting 21 electron beams at 11 different energies. In this study, we use numerical simulation to investigate the fast ion instability in this complicated system, compare the simulation results with theory and discuss possible measures to mitigate the instability.

The Coherent Electron Cooling Proof of Principle (CeC PoP) system is being installed in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. It will demonstrate the ability of relativistic electrons to cool a single bunch of heavy ions in RHIC. This technique may increase the beam luminosity by as much as tenfold. Within the scope of this experiment, a 112 MHz 2 MeV Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) electron gun coupled with a cathode stalk mechanism, two normal conducting 500 MHz single-cell bunching cavities, a 704 MHz 20 MeV 5-cell SRF cavity and a helical undulator will be used. In this paper, we provide an overview of the engineering design for this project, test results and discuss project status and plansd.

This paper will be focused on advances and challenges in cooling of high-energy hadron – and potentially heavy lepton-beams. Such techniques are required to improve quality of hadron beams and for increasing the luminosity in hadron and electron-hadron colliders. In contrast with light leptons, which have very strong radiation damping via synchrotron radiation, the hadrons radiate very little (even in 7TeV LHC) and require additional cooling mechanism to control growth of their emittances. I will discuss the physics principles of revolutionary, but untested, technique: the coherent electron cooling (CeC). Further, current advances and novel CeC schemes will be presented as well as the status of preparation at Brookhaven National Laboratory for the CeC demonstration experiment.

Recent developments in synchrotron acceleration systems show a demand for broadband MA (Magnetic Alloy) magnetic core loaded cavities with a high field gradient. For many facilities e.g. GSI, CoSY, J-Parc limited installation lengths requires high gradients in the region of 40kV/m. Both requirements rule out ferrite materials due to the lower maximum excitation levels and high Q-value. This request can solely be met by Finemet type cores like NANOPERM® produced by MAGNETEC. In this paper, the statistics of 22 huge cores made of NANOPERM® and measured high frequency properties are shown under free-space (FS) condition and compared with the theoretical expectation.

Compact low emittance lattice cell providing large dynamic aperture is essential for development of extremely low (pm range) emittance storage rings. As it is well known, a pair of identical sextupoles connected by a mi-nus-identity matrix transformer in ideal case of kick-like magnets provides infinite dynamic aperture. Though the finite sextupole length degrades the aperture, it is still large enough, and in this report we discuss development of the low emittance cell providing the I condition for both horizontal and vertical chromatic sextupoles.

At present new electron and positron injection complex in BINP is comissioned and ready to feed VEPP-2000 collider with intensive beams with energy of 450 MeV. To obtain peak luminosity limited only by beam-beam effects in whole energy range of 160-1000 MeV and to perform high average luminosity with small dead time the top-up injection is needed. Booster BEP upgrade to 1 GeV includes modification of all magnetic elements, including warm dipoles magnetic field increase up to 2.6 T, vacuum chamber, RF-system, injection-extraction system. BEP comissioning is scheduled to the end of 2014.

In 2013, beam-induced quench tests with 4 TeV protons were performed to probe the quench level of LHC arc quadrupole magnets at timescales corresponding to millisecond beam losses and steady-state losses. As the energy deposition in magnet coils cannot be measured directly, this study presents corresponding FLUKA simulations as well as estimates of quench levels derived with the QP3 code. Furthermore, beam loss monitor (BLM) signals were simulated and benchmarked against the measurements. Simulated and measured BLM signals are generally found to agree within 30 percent.

The counter-rotating beams of the LHC are injected in insertion regions which also accommodate the ALICE and LHCb experiments. An assembly of beam absorbers ensures the protection of machine elements in case of injection kicker failures, which can affect either the injected or the stored beam. In the first years of LHC operation, secondary particle showers due to beam impact on the injection beam stopper caused damage to the MOS injectors of the ALICE silicon drift detector as well as high-voltage trips in other ALICE subdetectors. In this study, we present FLUKA simulations of particle fluences to the ALICE cavern for injection failures encountered during operation. Two different cases are reported, one where the miskicked beam is fully intercepted and one where the beam grazes the beam stopper.

The power deposited in dispersion suppressor (DS) magnets downstream of the LHC betatron cleaning insertion is governed by off-momentum protons which predominantly originate from single-diffractive interactions in primary collimators. With higher beam energy and intensities anticipated in future operation, these clustered proton losses could possibly induce magnet quenches during periods of short beam lifetime. In this paper, we present FLUKA simulations for nominal 7 TeV operation, comparing the existing layout with alternative layouts where selected DS dipoles are substituted by pairs of shorter higher-field magnets and a collimator. Power densities predicted for different collimator settings are compared against present estimates of quench limits. Further, the expected reduction factor due to DS collimators is evaluated.

The abort system of the SuperKEKB is described. The beam abort system consists of the beam abort kicker magnets, pulsed quadrupole magnets, a lambertson septum magnet and extracted window. The dumped beam is extracted with beam abort kicker through the extraction window. The pulsed quadrupole magnets make the beam spot size large at the window. The damages of the extraction window is tested with KEKB beam. The pulsed kicker power supply is under development.

For the SuperKEKB beam abort system, the Ti extraction window will be used. The damage of the extraction window was estimated with KEKB electron beam. Thin Ti plate and Ti alloy plate were tested as candidates of extraction window material. The damages were observed as a function of beam current. From this experiment, the maximum charge density at the extraction window is determined.

The SuperKEKB project is in progress toward the initial physics run in the year 2015. It assumes the nano-beam scheme, in which the emittance of the colliding beams is ε=4.6\mbox{nm}. The emittance of the injected beam is ε=1.46\mbox{nm}. To acheave such a low emittance, it is vitally important to preserve the emittance during the transport of the beam from the linac to the main ring. One of the most difficult sections is the injection system. It has been pointed out that the injected beam has possibility of leading to blowup in the ring, which is caused by a beam-beam interaction with the stored positron beam. To avoid the beam blowup, the synchrotron injection is adopted as a backup option. The orbit of the electron injection beam has been designed and the septum magnet prototype has been constructed. The optics study for electron injection and the current R&D status for the septum magnet will be reported in this paper.

The Pre-Damping Rings (PDRs) and Damping Rings (DRs) of CLIC are required to reduce the beam emittances to the small values required for the main linacs. The injection and extraction, from the PDRs and DRs, are performed by kicker systems. To achieve both low beam coupling impedance and reasonable broadband impedance matching to the electrical circuit, striplines have been chosen for the kicker elements. Prototype striplines have been built: tests and measurements of these striplines have started. The goal of these tests is to characterize, without beam, the electromagnetic response of the striplines. The tests have been carried out at CERN. To study the signal transmission through the striplines, the measured S-parameters have been compared with simulations. In addition, measurements of longitudinal beam coupling impedance, using the coaxial wire method, are reported and compared with simulations.

The CLIC study is investigating the technical feasibility of an electron-positron collider with high luminosity and a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 3 TeV. The CLIC pre-damping rings and damping rings (DRs) will produce ultra-low emittance beam with high bunch charge. To avoid beam emittance increase, the DR kicker systems must provide extremely flat, high-voltage, pulses. The specifications for the DR extraction kickers call for a 160 ns duration flat-top pulses of ±12.5 kV, 250 A, with a combined ripple and droop of not more than ±0.02 % (±2.5 V). An inductive adder is a very promising approach to meeting the specifications because this topology allows the use of both passive and analogue modulation methods to adjust the output waveform. Recently, two five-layer, 3.5 kV, prototype inductive adders have been built at CERN. The first of these has been used to test the passive and active analogue modulation methods to compensate voltage droop and ripple of the output pulses. Pulse waveforms have been recorded with ±0.05 % relative (±1.0 V) stability for 160 ns flat-top duration at 1.823 kV.

The emittance growth in the betatron collimation system of the 27 km long transfer lines between the CLIC damping rings and the main LINAC depends strongly on the transverse orbit jitter. The resulting stability requirements of the damping ring extraction elements seem extremely difficult to achieve. Position and angle feed forward systems in these long transfer lines bring the specified parameters of the extraction elements within reach. The designs of the optics and feed forward hardware are presented together with tracking simulations of the systems.

The LHC beam dumping system performed according to expectations during Run 1 of the LHC (2009 – 2013). A brief overview of the experience is given, including a summary of the observed performance in comparison to expectations. An important number of changes are applied to the beam dumping system during the present Long Shutdown on order to further improve its system safety and performance. They include the addition of a direct link between the Beam Interlock System and the re-triggering system of the dump kickers, the modification of the uninterrupted electrical power distribution architecture, the upgrade of the HV generators, the consolidation of the trigger synchronization system, the modifications to the triggering system of the power switches and the changes to the dump absorbers TCDQ.

To minimize the beam losses at the moment of an LHC beam dump the 3 μs long abort gap should contain as few particles as possible. Its population can be minimised by abort gap cleaning using the LHC transverse damper system. The LHC Run 1 experience is briefly recalled; changes foreseen for the LHC Run 2 are presented. They include improvements in the observation of the abort gap population and the mechanism to decide if cleaning is required, changes to the hardware of the transverse dampers to reduce the detrimental effect on the luminosity lifetime and proposed changes to the applied cleaning algorithms.

This paper presents the design of a halo collimation system for the ATF2 beamline. The main objective is the reduction of background noise that limits the performance of key diagnostic devices around the final focal point (IP), especially the Shintake Monitor (IPBSM) used for measuring the nanometer level vertical beam sizes and the future Diamond Sensor (DS) for measuring the beam halo. Beam tracking simulations have been performed to optimize the position and characteristics of the halo collimation devices. Furthermore the collimator wakefield-induced effect is being studied.

The post-linac energy collimation system of CLIC is designed to fulfill an essential function of protection of the Beam Delivery System (BDS) against miss-steered beams generated by failure modes in the main linac. Guaranteeing the collimator survivability in case of direct beam impact is very challenging, if we take into account the need to deal with an unprecedented transverse beam energy density per beam of the order of GJ/mm2. This translates into a high damage potential of uncontrolled beams. In this paper we present an alternative nonlinear energy collimation system as a potential solution to guarantee the survival of the collimators. The performance and error tolerances of this system are studied by means of beam tracking simulations, and compared with those of the conventional baseline CLIC energy collimation system.

In this paper we review the status of the studies on nonlinear collimation schemes for the LHC. Concretely we describe the design of a nonlinear optics for betatron cleaning in IR7. The aim is to investigate alternative nonlinear collimation systems to reduce the collimator-induced impedance that may limit the beam intensity towards the LHC luminosity upgrade. The performance of the LHC nonlinear collimation system is studied by means of tracking simulations and compared with the present LHC system. Furthermore, the advantages and possible limitations of such nonlinear collimation scheme are discussed.

The Extremely Low ENergy Antiproton ring (ELENA) is a small synchrotron equipped with an electron cooler, which shall be constructed at CERN to decelerate antiprotons to energies as low as 100 keV. At such low energies it is very important to carefully take contributions from electron cooling and heating effects (e.g. on the residual gas) into account. Detailed investigations into the ion kinetics under consideration of effects from electron cooling and scattering on the residual gas have been carried out using the BETACOOL code. In this contribution a consistent explanation of the different physical effects acting on the beam in ELENA is given. Beam lifetime, equilibrium momentum spread and emittance are all estimated based on numerical simulations. Finally, optimum machine settings are presented as a result of optimization studies.

The upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in terms of beam intensity and energy, implies an increasing risk of severe damage in particular in case of fast failures losses. For this reason, efforts were put in developing simulation tools to allow studies of asynchronous dump accident, including realistic failure cases for collimator settings and machine parameters like orbit and optics. The scope of these studies is to understand realistic beam loads in different collimators, in order to improve the actual LHC collimator system design, to provide feedbacks on optic design and to evaluate different mitigation actions. Simulations were set up with a modified SixTrack collimation routine able to simulate erroneous firing of a single dump kicker or the simultaneous malfunction of all the 15 kickers. In such a context, results are evaluated from the whole LHC collimation system point of view.

The Large Hadron Collider is designed to accommodate an unprecedented stored beam energy of 362~MJ in the nominal configuration and about the double in the high-luminosity upgrade HL-LHC that is presently under study. This requires an efficient collimation system to protect the superconducting magnets from quenches. During the design, it is therefore very important to accurately predict the expected beam loss distributions and cleaning efficiency. For this purpose, there are several ongoing efforts in improving the existing simulation tools or developing new ones. This paper gives a brief overview and status of the different available codes.

The upgrade of the LHC collimation system in view of the High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) foresees, amongst other scenarios, local collimation in the dispersion suppressors (DS) of IR7. Layouts have been worked out which rely on using stronger and short bending dipoles to free space for a collimator in the cold DS. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed layouts is studied with different imperfection models such as collimator alignment, jaw tilt and surface errors, optics errors and aperture imperfections. The effect of local DS collimation on the global losses around the ring is also addressed for different optics configurations.

The luminosity expected at the interaction points in LHC at 7 TeV will be unprecedented, up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 . Part of the debris produced by the collisions is lost locally im- mediately downstream the Interaction Point (IP), in the matching section and dispersion suppressor. In this paper, the dynamics of collision debris protons is discussed. First, the loss distributions close to the collision points, simulated with two codes – SixTrack and FLUKA – are compared for different layout configurations. Then, SixTrack is used to simulate the fraction of protons that have undergone inelastic interactions with smaller energy and and betatron offsets, which could travel for several turns around the ring and might be lost in other collimation insertions. A preliminary comparison is made between the resulting loss distribution and measurements.

The limiting location of the present LHC machine in terms of losses on cold magnets are the dispersion suppressors downstream of the betatron collimation insertion (IR7). These losses are dominated by off-energy protons that have by-passed the upstream secondary collimation system but are lost where the dispersion starts to rise. A solution under consideration for intercepting these losses is the addition of new collimators in the dispersive area. This paper discusses first a proposition for the new layout in the DS, where space is made for the new collimators by replacing an existing dipole by shorter and stronger magnets. Furthermore, simulations with SixTrack are presented, which quantify the gain in cleaning from the new collimators.

The LHC superconducting magnets in the dispersion suppressor of IR7 are the most exposed to beam losses leaking from the betatron collimation system and represent the main limitation for the halo cleaning. In 2013, quench tests were performed at 4 TeV to improve the quench limit estimates, which determine the maximum allowed beam loss rate for a given collimation cleaning. The main goal of the collimation quench test was to try to quench the magnets by increasing losses at the collimators. Losses of up to 1 MW over a few seconds were generated by blowing up the beam, achieving total losses of about 5.8 MJ. These controlled losses exceeded by a factor 2 the collimation design value, and the magnets did not quench.

A second generation prototype rotatable collimator has been fabricated at SLAC and delivered to CERN for further vacuum, metrology, function and impedance tests. The design features two cylindrical Glidcop jaws designed to each absorb 12kW of beam in steady state and up to 60kW in transitory beam loss with no damage and minimal thermal distortion. The design is motivated by the use of a radiation resistant high Z low impedance readily available material. A vacuum rotation mechanism using the standard LHC collimation jaw positioning motor system allows each jaw to be rotated to present a new 2cm high surface to the beam if the jaw surface were to be damaged by multiple full intensity beam bunch impacts in a asynchronous beam abort. Design modifications to improve on the first generation prototype, pre-delivery functional tests performed at SLAC and post-delivery test results at CERN are presented.

Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM) is a Geant4 and C++ based particle tracking code that seamlessly tracks particles through accelerators and detectors, including the full range of particle interaction physics processes from Geant4. BDSIM has been successfully used to model beam loss and background conditions for many current and future linear accelerators such as the Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). Current developments extend its application for use with storage rings, in particular for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the High Luminosity upgrade project (HL-LHC). This paper presents the latest results from using BDSIM to model the LHC as well as the developments underway to improve performance.

Simulations of the LHC collimation system have been carried out in previous years with the well known SixTrack code with collimation features. MERLIN is a C++ accelerator physics library that has been extended to perform collimation studies. The main features of the code are: its modular nature, allowing the user to easily implement new physics processes such as resistive wakefields and synchrotron radiation, improved scattering routines and the MPI protocol for parallel execution. MERLIN has been configured to use the same scattering routines as SixTrack in order to benchmark the code for the LHC collimation system. In this paper we present a detailed comparison between MERLIN and SixTrack for optics and cleaning inefficiency calculation.

The most effective way to increase the brilliance of synchrotron light sources is the reduction of beam emittance. To improve the CANDLE synchrotron light source performance, a new low emittance facility has been designed with the account of the new developments in magnets fabrication technology of last decade. The lattices for the booster and storage rings are re-designed keeping the geometrical layout of the facilities. The new design provides the beam emittance in storage ring below 5nm with sufficient dynamic aperture. This report presents the main design considerations, the linear and non-linear beam dynamics aspects of the modified facility performance.

Sirius is a 3 GeV synchrotron light source that is being built by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). The electron storage ring uses the multi-bend-achromat approach (5BA in this case) to achieve a very low beam emittance of 0.28 nm.rad. The 518 m circumference contains 20 straight sections of alternating 6 and 7 meters in length, to be used for insertion devices as well as injection and RF systems. The 5BA cell is modified to accommodate a thin high field dipole (for 1.4˚ deflection) in the center of the middle bend producing hard X-ray radiation (12 keV critical energy) with a modest contribution to the total energy loss. This high field dipole (2.0 T) will be made of permanent magnet material, whereas the low field (0.58 T) ones, responsible for the main beam deflection, will be electromagnetic. Many challenges are associated with this kind of lattice, including both in beam dynamics and in accelerator engineering, that require R&D on new techniques. In this paper we discuss the main issues and achievements for Sirius during the last year.

The CLS presently has a 12 cell DBA lattice with a circumference of 170.88 m. By using conventional magnet designs an emittance of 18 nm-rad is achieved. Twelve 5 m straights are available for injection, an RF cavity and insertion devices. An emittance of 1 nm-rad (at 2.9 GeV) can be achieved replacing each DBAs with multi-bend achromats (MBAs) while preserving the 12-fold symmetry although with a reduction of the length of the straights. To achieve the strong focussing required for low emittance very strong field gradients are required in the dipoles as well as the quadrupole and sextupole magnets. Sufficient dynamic aperture for off-axis injection and Touschek lifetime may be possible.

With regular user beam delivered to experiments, the commissioning of the ASTRID2 synchrotron light source is now mostly completed. The ring is running stable in top-up mode for beam currents up to 90 mA, with a lifetime of ~0.8 h at 90 mA. The orbit is controlled by a 10 Hz feedback loop, which includes feed forward loops when the insertion devices change gap. A similar 10 Hz loop compensates tune and beta function changes from the insertion devices. Some issues are still remaining. These include installation of a Landau cavity for lifetime improvements, a reduction in the heating of the in-vacuum ferrites of the injection bumpers, and a shielding of the stray magnetic field from the booster dipoles.

The 2.75 GeV synchrotron light source SOLEIL delivers photons to 27 beamlines; 2 new ones are under construction together with the FEMTOSLICING project of which commissioning started in January 2014. Five filling patterns are available for the users in Top-up injection mode. The storage ring is running with an upgraded optics less sensitive to insertion device (ID) configurations and giving both better beam lifetime and injection efficiency. The beam position stability remains excellent with a focus on electron vertical beam-size stability for the new very long beamlines. A gating system during Top-up injection improves significantly the quality of the spectrum on an infrared beamline. Several heavy actions of maintenance and upgrades on crucial subsystem equipment are underway. Others accelerator projects are going on such as the design and construction of new IDs, new Multipole Injection Kicker, radiation damage studies as well as R&D on solid-state amplifiers.

Within the scope of a future major upgrade of the SOLEIL storage ring, presently having the energy of 2.75 GeV, the circumference of 354 m and the horizontal emittance of 3.7 nm.rad, towards a Diffraction Limited Storage Ring (DLSR), the present paper presents and discusses the outcomes of a series of studies launched to explore different possible scenarios for the magnet lattice arrangement, under the constraint of making the upgrade in the same existing machine tunnel. Two scenarios were presented earlier in this context, which both preserved all the existing free straight sections for insertions, though the bending magnet positions were not strictly conserved. The purpose of the extended studies is to explore, in particular, the range of horizontal emittance that can be reached by hypothetically removing some of the existing geometric constraints, such as suppressing or shortening partially the straight sections. The emittance range is equally studied by fulfilling rigorously all constraints. The dependence of the nonlinear properties of the magnet lattice on the linear optics is simultaneously investigated.

The femtoslicing project at SOLEIL is currently under commissioning. It will enable to serve several beamlines with 100 fs FWHM long pulses of soft and hard X-rays with reasonable flux and with a 1 kHz repetition rate. It is based on the interaction of a femtosecond Ti:Sa laser with electrons circulating in the magnetic field of a modulator wiggler, that provides the electron beam energy modulation on the length scale of the laser pulse. The optimization of the interaction is performed using two dedicated diagnostics stations. The first one, operating in the Infra-Red (IR) is installed in the tunnel and allows the adjustment of the temporal, spectral and spatial overlap between the laser and the electron beam. The second one, located in the IR-THz AILES beamline, measures the intensity of the terahertz (THz) radiation emitted by the local dip structure produced in the core electron beam after interaction. This second setup provides refined optimization of the interaction. This paper describes the layout of these diagnostics and gives first results and characterization of the slicing experiment at SOLEIL.

The ESRF is close to the end of the first phase (2009-2015) of its Upgrade Programme and has defined the objectives for the ensuing second phase. It envisions a major upgrade of the source to best serve the new science opportunities. The ESRF Council endorsed the proposal to perform the technical design study of a new 7-bend achromat lattice. This configuration will allow the storage ring to operate with a decrease in horizontal emittance by a factor of about 30 and a consequent increase in brilliance and coherence of the photon beam. This paper reports on the status of the accelerator project, highlighting the progress in the technical design.

Photons carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) are present in the off-axis radiation of higher harmonics of helical undulators. Usually, the purity and visibility of OAM photons is blurred by electron beam emittance. However, high brightness OAM beams are expected in ultimate storage rings and FELs, and they may trigger a new class of experiments utilizing the variability of the topological charge, a 3rd degree of freedom besides wavelength and polarization. We report on the first detection of OAM photons in helical undulator radiation in the 3rd generation storage ring BESSY II. Measurements and simulations are compared and the impact of emittance and energy spread is discussed.

An upgrade of the BESSY II ring to a Variable bunch length Storage Ring BESSYVSR has been recently proposed *, by introducing strongly focusing superconducting cavities. This will allow to store simultaneously long and short bunches. In the regular user optics, bunch lengths of 15 ps (rms) and down to 1.5 ps (rms) are expected. Bunches as short as 300 fs (rms), close to the bunch length limit, and a ring current of 3.5 mA at the bunch bursting threshold can be provided by using a modified low-alpha optics. This presentation will discuss the properties of the low-alpha optics and intrinsic bunch length limits, given by coupling effects of the longitudinal and horizontal plane.

Since 22nd October 2012 BESSY is operated in top-up mode. Losses of electrons during injection cause an electromagnetic cascade, that consists of high energetic photons of the bremsstrahlung, and secondary electrons and positrons from the pair creations. The bremsstrahlung spectrum has a maximum at 1.022 MeV owing to pair creations. The spectrum has a high energetic tail, that reaches up to the electron energy of 1.7 GeV at BESSY. The low energy part of the electromagnetic cascade is produced by compton scattering or the photo - effect. Due to the opened beamshutters during top-up injections, the low energetic part of the bremsstrahlung spectrum can reach the experimental hall. We used the particle interaction and transport code FLUKA for the calculations of both the fluence and the dose distribution. We calculated the gamma spectra of the radiation through the shielding walls and through the front-ends. We discuss the question whether additional safety measures are necessary for top-up operation due to the low energy part of the spectrum. From our calculations we determined the correction factors for our ionisation chambers of the ambient dose measurement system.

Study of the Beam Lifetime at the Synchrotron Light Source DELTA

DELTA is a 1.5-GeV synchrotron light source operated by the TU Dortmund University. The beam lifetime, which is a critical issue for user operation of a light source, was studied experimentally and by simulation for different operation modes, i.e. single-bunch and multibunch fill patterns and for different beam currents. The electron loss rate is dominated by residual-gas scattering (Coulomb scattering and Bremsstrahlung) and by electron-electron scattering (Touschek effect). Since these processes depend in different ways on the momentum acceptance of the storage ring, a variation of the RF cavity voltage allows to disentangle their respective contributions to the total loss rate. The experimental results lead to a consistent picture for different operation modes with a characteristic dependence of the residual-gas pressure on the beam current.

At the ANKA synchrotron radiation facility measurements in the microwave range (~10 to 12 GHz) employing a LNB (Low Noise Block), which is the receiving part of a Satellite-TV system, have been carried out. Experiments showed that the observed signal depends on the length of the electron bunches. Furthermore the temporal shape of the microwave signal depends on the detector's position along the accelerator. Due the LNB antenna's sensitivity to polarisation it was also possible to measure the polarisation along the several ns long signal, revealing polarised and non-polarised regions. This paper describes the experimental setup and summarises the observations of the systematic studies performed with the LNB system.

The ANKA storage ring can generate brilliant coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the THz range due to a dedi- cated low-αc -optics with reduced bunch lengths. At higher electron currents the radiation is not stable, but occurs in powerful bursts caused by micro-bunching instabilities. This intense THz radiation is very attractive for users. However, the reproducibility of the experimental conditions is very low due to those power fluctuations. Systematic studies of bursting CSR in multi-bunch operation were performed with fast THz detectors at ANKA using a dedicated, ultra-fast DAQ-FPGA board. The technique and preliminary results of these studies are presented in this paper.

An ultra-low emittance lattice based on the ANKA ring geometry is under investigation in framework of the feasibility studies for a compact low emittance synchrotron light source at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany). An attempt to apply the concept of split bending magnets cells and to reduce the natural emittance of the bare ANKA DBA lattice from 90 nm×rad down to 2.5 nm×rad with not-vanishing dynamic aperture is described in this paper. The TME cell with split bends and a quadrupole lens in-between as well as a pair of non-interleaved sextupole lenses separated by “I ” unit transfer matrix of betatron oscillations allows to decrease the theoretical minimum emittance of ANKA ring down to approximately 6 nm×rad. Further reduction of the phase space volume requires to brake “I ” symmetry and add extra families of sextupoles, locate an additional high order field elements inside the quadrupoles, optimize the phase advance between sextupole families, shift the betatron tune point, enlarge the sextupole strength and other measures. Results of simulations are reported.

FLUTE, a new linac-based test facility and THz source is currently being built at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in collaboration with DESY and PSI. It consists of an RF photo gun and a traveling wave linac accelerating electrons to beam energies of ~41 MeV in the charge range from a few pC up to 3 nC. The electron bunch will then be compressed in a magnetic chicane in the range of 1 - 300 fs, depending on the charge, in order to generate coherent THz radiation with high peak power. An overview of the simulation and hardware status is given in this contribution.

The coherently emitted electric field pulse of a short electron bunch is obtained by summing the fields of the individual electrons, taking phase differences due to different longitudinal positions into account. For an electron density, this sum becomes an integral over the charge density and frequency spectrum of the emitted radiation, which, however, is difficult to evaluate numerically. In this paper, we present a fast analytic method valid for arbitrary bunch shapes. We also include shielding effects of the beam pipe and consider ultra-short bunches, where the high frequency part of the coherent synchrotron spectrum is cut-off not by the inverse bunch length but by the critical frequency of synchrotron radiation. Our technique is applied to bunches, simulated simulated for the linac-based FLUTE accelerator test facility at KIT.

The ANKA electron storage ring of the Karlsruher Institute of Technology (KIT, Germany) is regularly operated in low-alpha mode to produce short bunches for the generation of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). This paper evaluates systematic bunch length measurements taken in low-alpha operation of the ANKA storage ring. Above the bursting threshold not only the emission of CSR occurs in bursts, but also a continuous fluctuation of the bunch's length is observed. The measurements were carried out using concurrent multi turn (using a streak camera) as well as single shot (using electro-optical spectral decoding) methods. Furthermore, we compare information obtained on the fluctuation to simulations.

The Iranian Light Source Facility Project (ILSF) is a 3 GeV third generation light source with a current of 400 mA which will be built on a land of 50 hectares area in the city of Qazvin, located 150 km West of Tehran. ILSF conceptual design report, CDR, was published in October 2012. To have a competitive leading position in the future, 489.6 m storage ring of ILSF is designed to emphasize on small emittance electron beam( 0.93 nm-rad), high photon flux density, brightness, stability and reliability. Moreover, 40% of 489.6 m ring circumference is straight sections (14×8 m+ 14×6 m) which are long enough for the commonly used insertion devices. Some prototype accelerator components such as high power solid state radio frequency amplifiers, LLRF system, thermionic RF gun, Storage ring H-type dipole and quadruple magnets, Hall probe system for magnetic measurement and highly stable magnet power supplies have been constructed in ILSF R&D laboratory.

In this study the results of ground vibration measurement for the site of Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) has been investigated. Light source buildings are very sensitive to the ground weak motions. Sources for the ground vibrations could be Cultural noise from human activities like traffic and industrial works. In order to satisfy requirements for level of the ground vibrations, a perfect ground vibration survey has been conducted and compared with other same projects. Two broad-band seismometers were utilized for surveying the ground vibration at ILSF site. The raw data were pre-processed as well as analyzed in term of seismology and engineering aspects. Spectrum amplitudes along with powers of the vibration amplitudes were calculated at the time domain. The power spectral density of vibration displacements were extracted from the measurements and were compared with results of other synchrotron projects. The results show that the dedicated site for ILSF is in the appropriate condition in the point view of ground vibration issues.

The Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) are usually used in the particles accelerators to observe position of the beam and to record longitudinal bunch shape. As the vertical beam size demands beam stabilities on the submicron level in the particle accelerators, there must be a sever precision on designing and fabrication of the BPMs. In this paper, we have explored effect of the BPMs on the total impedance and loss factor of the ILSF storage ring.

Several lattice alternatives have been designed for the 3 GeV storage ring of Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF). Design of the ILSF storage ring emphasizes an ultra low electron beam emittance, great brightness, stability and reliability which make it competitive in the operation years. In this paper, we give a brief review of the main designed lattice candidates for the ILSF storage ring.

Total impedance is one of the most effective parameters for proper operation of an accelerator system. This quantity is evaluated with the summation of individual component impedance of the vacuum pipe and is desired to be as low as possible. The bellows have very significant effects on total impedance of the accelerator systems particularly synchrotron light source storage rings. Design of the bellow for Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) with a practical approach for fabrication has been down. Minimization of the total impedance budget, loss factor and the resulting wake field due to the passage of 400 mA electron beam is the main goal of our design.

In this paper, we give specifications of lattice linear and nonlinear optimization and review properties of the radiated x-ray.

Elettra lacks skew quadrupoles and the coupling is controlled via the vertical orbit. Elettra has typical operational coupling of 1%, values as low as 0.3% were reached but however not easily established and reproducible. In order to control the coupling in a reproducible manner skew quadrupoles must be installed. Simulations of the betatron coupling and correction for the Elettra synchrotron light source were performed and are here presented. The numerical study is based on measured machine misalignments and carried out with the ELEGANT particle tracking code. The inclusion of families of skew quadrupoles in the existing lattice is investigated and shown to be conclusive for the coupling correction at the level of 0.1%.

The SPARC_LAB Thomson source is presently under commissioning at LNF. An electron beam of energy between 30-150 MeV collides head-on with the laser pulse provided by the Ti:Sapphire laser FLAME, characterized in this phase by a length of 6 ps FWHM and by an energy ranging between 1 and 5 J. The key features of this system are the wide range of tunability of the X-rays yield energy, i.e. 20-500 keV, and the availability of a coupled quadrupole and solenoid focusing system, allowing to reach an electron beam size of 10-20 microns at the interaction point. The experimental results obtained in the February 2014 shifts are presented.

We proposed a torus knot type synchrotron radiation ring in that the beam orbit does not close in one turn but closes after multiple turns around the ring. Currently, we are designing a new ring based on the shape of a (11, 3) torus knot for our future plan ‘HiSOR-II.’ This ring is mid-low energy light source ring with a beam energy of 700 MeV. Recently some light source rings are achieving very low emittance that reaches a diffraction limited light by adopting a multi-bend scheme to the arc section of the ring. It is not difficult for low-mid energy VUV-SX light source ring because the electron beam less than 10 nmrad can provide the diffraction limited light in the energy less than 10eV. However the multi-bend lattice has many families of the magnets, therefore it is not easy to decide the parameters of the lattice. Especially, it is difficult for the torus knot type SR ring because there is a lot of geometric limitation around the cross points of orbits. We present the details of the designing procedure and the specifications of the ultra-low emittance light source ring having innovatively odd shape.

SPring-8 is a 3rd generation light source which has been operated stably. During user operation, an interlock system which turns off the RF acceleration signal if the beam orbit at insertion devices exceed a window is in operation. Beam abort events due to the interlock system have occurred as a rare event at SPring-8. Though in most cases we find trouble in accelerator devices as the source of the beam orbit shift, sometimes we cannot find any evidence after the beam abort. In order to identify the sources of such aborts, we have developed a system which observe beam orbit along the storage ring during beam abort. The system was realized by modification of the digital part of the existing COD measurement system. Every 1 ms, the system measures beam position at all BPMs with the position resolution of 1 micron or less. This system enabled us to identify the source when a beam abort due to an orbit shift with a time constant of longer than a few milliseconds. Furthermore, this system is applicable to survey sources of beam orbit fluctuations during stable operation. In this proceeding, we describe the system, beam orbit data during beam abort and source analysis.

An ultimate storage ring (USR) is being designed at synchrotron radiation facilities in the world. USR can generate theoretically minimum synchrotron radiation because emittance of the USR is less than diffraction limit of the radiation. The USR requires high alignment precision of micro-meter order. A vibrating wire method (VWM) has widely been used for such a high precision alignment. An error field of multi-pole magnet is estimated by detecting a vibration of a single wire excited with AC current. The wire position, where no vibration is excited, is defined as the magnetic center. The applied frequency is kept on a resonant frequency, which may drift due to temperature change etc. during the measurement. To trace the resonant frequency at all times, we developed a frequency feedback system. It is necessary to trace the resonance, even when the wire is set in the vicinity of the magnetic center where the magnetic field is nearly zero. Here we propose to install one or two additional wires parallel to the original wire. The additional wires off the center can detect the vibration frequency with enough S/N ratio. We discuss the effectiveness of it for quick and reliable alignment.

When the injection bump orbit is not closed perfectly at the beam injection, the horizontal stored beam oscillation is excited. In the SPring-8 storage ring, many efforts had been paid to reduce the beam oscillation by adjusting the temporal shape and timing of four bump magnets and by applying a counter kick to the residual oscillation, whose amplitude is as large as 0.4mm and the width is as narrow as 500ns. Now, the averaged oscillation amplitude has successfully been suppressed to the level of less than 0.1mm. To confirm the suppression effect, we observed the turn-by-turn photon beam profile at the diagnostics beamline with the insertion device. We confirmed that the light axis oscillation was significantly suppressed by a factor of 5 comparing by applying a counter kick. We also found that the oscillation shape and the oscillation amplitude, which were caused by the timing shift of firing bump magnets, are drastically changed by only timing shift of one magnet. We are considering the feedback scheme to keep the suppression effect at the initial level during the user-time.

At the SPring-8 storage ring, design study of beam optics concentrating particularly on increasing brilliance, not flux density, is in progress besides continuous efforts of increasing both brilliance and flux density for the user optics. The natural emittances are theoretically reduced from 2.41 nmrad at 8 GeV to 2.27 nmrad (8 GeV), 1.78 nmrad (7 GeV) and 1.33 nmrad (6 GeV) by utilizing an emittance damping effect by the insertion devices. The designed optics has experimentally been examined at 6 GeV, and the electron beam parameters have been confirmed by measurements at the diagnostics beamlines.

Update of the first-generation undulators installed in 1980s is pushed forward at PF-Ring, a 2.5-GeV SR source of KEK, taking advantage of the expanded straight sections reconstructed in 2005. New undulators have been designed as elliptically polarizing undulators each has 6 magnetic arrays to obtain various polarization states, not only circular polarization but also linear (horizontal and vertical) polarization. Three undulators will be installed in FY2013 and FY2014 for BL02, BL13 and BL28. For BL02, the longest straight section of about 9 m, the new undulator will be installed in tandem with the existing planar undulator, in order to cover the wide photon energy range from 15 eV to 2 keV. At PF-AR, a 6.5-GeV SR source, a new direct beam transport (BT) line from the injector LINAC is under construction. Super KEKB which shares the injector LINAC with PF-Ring and PF-AR will be commissioned at the end of FY2014. The full-energy continuous injection of PF-AR will be available as a simultaneous injection with the 7-GeV HER, the 4-GeV LER and PF-Ring not so later than the commissioning of Super KEKB.

Siberia-2 is a synchrotron light source with electron beam energy up to 2.5GeV, currently undergoing upgrade of controls hardware and software. Ocelot, an accelerator physics framework, was integrated with the new orbit correction system for high level beam control. We describe the steps taken for simulation studies of orbit correction strategies on a virtual machine model, integration of the software into the control system and experimental results.

The injection system is one of the important systems which determine efficiency and reliability of the accelerator facility. The spark gap switches (SGS), which were used before at Siberia-2 in high voltage nanosecond pulse generators, are the critical components requiring permanent maintenance. SGS has a series of limitations such as a relatively large pulse jitter and a work at a high pressure nitrogen atmosphere. The new injection system uses new half-sine microsecond pulse generators which based on Pseudo-Spark Switches. Some technical aspects of the new injection system are considered and results of generators operation are shown in the article.

A proposal of a low alpha lattice for the ALBA third generation light source is presented. Opposed to most of other machines, belonging to the same category, ALBA employs an optimized lattice making use of combined function dipoles. This has permitted a very compact design stripped out of all not strictly necessary quadrupoles resulting in a lack of flexibility. For such a reason the common approaches used in many other synchrotrons can not be directly applied to ALBA and a different strategy has to worked out.

The ALBA light source has been operating in decay mode since May 2012. Now it is ready for top-up operation, which should become the standard operation mode for users from mid 2014. In this paper we are going to summarise the different steps that have taken place before the start of top-up operation: radiation safety simulations and measurements, upgrade of hardware and software interlocks, control software and injection optimisation.

The interest in superradiant THz sources based on the coherent transition, synchrotron or undulator radiation grows continuously and such sources require high-quality electron bunches with low emittance, high charge and sub-picosecond (sub-ps) duration. Since accelerator-based THz sources are usually driven by relatively low energy electron bunches of a few tens of MeV, space-charge makes bunch compression to sub-ps level very challenging. In the present work we investigate the feasibility of ballistic bunching down to sub-ps duration while preserving the transverse phase-space quality. We found that in order to compensate for the nonlinear dependency of the arrival time on the energy as well as bunch deformations induced by space-charge effects, one needs to apply a nonlinear energy chirp. This chirp permits to maximize the bunch compression and can be realized by exciting a cavity with higher harmonics of the fundamental frequency. Issues related to synchronizing the harmonics are discussed and the analytical analysis is complemented by simulations with PARMELA.

Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) commissioning exercise by using the high-level accelerator physics application programs (HL-APAP) has been performed on the operational 1.5 GeV Taiwan Light Source (TLS) storage ring. It includes steering the injection beam in the first turn to achieve multi-turns and stored beam with the help of the RESOLVE analysis. The orbit correction programs using different algorithms such as SVD, Householder transformation, and local bumps were applied to reduce the closed orbit distortion of the stored beam and to adjust the beam orbit to pass through those field centers of quadrupoles indicated by the corresponding BPMs. The golden orbit defined by the measured data of BPMs corresponding to each quadrupole field center was based on the Beam Based Alignment (BBA). After approach the stored beam orbit to the golden orbit, we save all the BPMs data as the target orbit for machine operation. The lattice calibration is then performed by the LOCO. The detail of the commissioning exercise is described in this report.

Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a 3 GeV third generation electron synchrotron light source, consist of 5 major modules: LINAC, LTB transfer line, booster ring, BTS transfer line and storage ring. Its beam commissioning is scheduled in 2014. Getting the first turn and approaching the closed orbit is a crucial step for achieving stored beam in ring-based accelerator commissioning. In order to make first turn beam commissioning efficient, we develop a MATLAB-based application program based on AT and MML for automatic beam steering and closed orbit search. The algorithm and simulation results are presented.

We discuss the use of two novel techniques to deliver low emittance from a compact electron ring at energies around 1 GeV, suitable for EUV and soft X-ray synchrotron radiation production. The first method is the circulation of non-equilibrium electron bunches, which is made feasible using high repetition rate linacs and very fast bunch-by-bunch injection and extraction. The second method is to utilise a stacked storage ring in which two rings are coupled, and in which the strong damping wigglers in one ring depress the emittance in the other. We present example designs of each approach, noting that these methods may be used in combination with other emittance reduction techniques.

72 out of the 74 girders on which the Diamond Storage Ring magnets are mounted, can in principle be moved along 5 degrees of freedom (sway, heave, yaw,pitch, roll) potentially allowing a thorough re-alignment of the machine. Previously conducted tests improved our knowledge of the system both in terms of simulations and comprehension of the control system we rely upon. In this report we present the results of more detailed tests which now give us full confidence in our ability to predict the results of any given set of girder moves. We also discuss possible ways of increasing the speed of the procedure, and a strategy to mitigate the impact of girder moves involving nearby beam lines.

The concept of converting individual cells of the Diamond Double Bend Achromat (DBA) lattice into a modified 4-bend achromat with a new straight section for insertion devices (IDs) in the middle of the arc, grew out of earlier studies of low emittance MBA lattices*, and was motivated by the need for additional ID straight sections, since all of the 22 ID straight sections in the Diamond storage ring are either occupied or have been allocated to future beamlines. Such a modification effectively replaces each DBA cell with two new DBA cells, hence the term Double-DBA or DDBA has come to be used for the project. Since the tangent point for bending magnet beamlines lies close to the start of the second dipole in the original DBA, this allows unused exit ports and spaces on the experimental hall which are available for future bending magnet beamlines to be used for higher performance ID beamlines. In this report we present an overview of the status of the project, the various accelerator physics and engineering studies that have been carried out, and plans for the implementation of one or two DDBA cells in Diamond.

Intrabeam scattering (IBS) can cause emittance growth in diffraction limited light sources. At lower beam energy, the IBS effect is expected to be more pronounced. To study these effects we have developed a series of low energy lattices in SPEAR3 with beam energy ranging from 3GeV to 700MeV. The horizontal beam size and bunch length are measured as a function of beam energy and compared with theoretic calculations.

Since its 2003 construction, the SPEAR3 synchrotron light source at SLAC has continuously improved its performance by raising beam current, top-off injection, small alpha and smaller emittance. This makes SPEAR3 one of the most productive light sources in the world. Now to further enhance the operation of SPEAR3, we are looking into the possibility of converting SPEAR3 to a multi-bend achromat storage ring within its site constraint.

The Berlin Energy Recovery Linac Prototype BERLinPro is to be constructed at the Helmholtz Zentrum site in Berlin. The aim of the project is to expand the required accelerator physics and technology knowledge mandatory for the generation of a high current (100 mA), high brilliance (norm. emittance below 1 mm mrad) cw electron beam. Since the funding decision in October 2010 the project has entered a phase of detailed planning. Hardware specifications have been defined and various components have been ordered. Furthermore, extensive tests of principal superconducting accelerator components successfully demonstrated the envisaged hardware performance. A summary of the most recent activities together with the details of the project timeline for the coming years are given in this paper.

Multi-turn energy recovery linac based light sources are candidates for the future 4th generation synchrotron light sources. Using the superconducting linac technology, the Femto-Science-Factory (FSF) will provide its users with ultra-bright photon beams of angstrom wavelength at 6 GeV final beam energy. The FSF is intended to be a multi-user facility and offers a variety of operation modes. An overview of the machine layout and magnetic optics design of the installation will be given in this paper with the focus on high brightness injector design.

Beam losses due to eﬀects of Touschek, residual gas, intra-beam scattering, and field emission were studied for the KEK compact Energy Recovery Linac (cERL), which is now under commissioning. By studying the beam losses of cERL, we can better understand the loss mechanisms, estimate the beam loss rates, and localize potentially dangerous areas of the beamline for the future 3GeV ERL project. The goal is to achieve a safety low-emittance and high-current beams operation which can help contribute to the beam loss study under 3GeV ERL project. We used existing and modiﬁed ELEGANT routine to perform the simulations. We also developed a MATLAB data analysis algorithm to handle the large amount of information that is outputted from the program. The data obtained then compared with the theoretical estimation to judge the computation’s accuracy.

The Compact Energy Recovery Linac (cERL) project is ongoing at KEK in order to demonstrate excellent ERL performance as a future light source. The cERL injector was already constructed with its diagnostic beamline and successfully commissioned from April to June in 2013. In the next step, the cERL recirculation loop with a main superconducting linac and merger and dump sections has been constructed and its commissioning is scheduled to start in December 2013. Significant progress is expected by the IPAC14 conference date. In this presentation, we will describe the present status of the cERL including future developments.

A search for HOMs in Cornell’s ERL main linac cavity installed in a Horizontal Test Cryomodule (HTC) has been carried out using a bunch charge modulation method, as part of the effort towards building an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). The beam-based HOM measurements offer the significant advantage of being able to detect trapped modes invisible to both the RF pickup probes and HOM damping loads, and allow for measuring the R/Q of the modes. For each HOM detected during the search, measurements were taken to determine its nature (monopole, dipole, etc.), frequency, loaded quality factor and shunt impedance. A selection of the most notable modes found is presented, compared to 3D HOM simulations, and their potential impact on the BBU current of the future Cornell ERL is discussed.

The objective of the study is the simulation of the produced secondary radiation properties when the electron beam halo particles hit collimator walls. Using particle tracking simulation code FLUKA the European XFEL electron beam interaction with the titanium collimator and copper absorber of the undulator intersections as well as FLASH beam interaction with the tapered collimator were simulated. Absorbed dose spatial distribution in the material of the collimators was simulated for the total secondary radiation and its important photon and neutron components. Residual dose rate after irritation of the collimator material by the electron beam was calculated.

The S-DALINAC is the superconducting linear accelerator of the Institut für Kernphysik at Technische Universität Darmstadt. It delivers an electron beam with energies up to 130 MeV. In order to improve the energy spread and the energy stability of the beam for further acceleration a new scrapersystem has been developed and installed between the 10 MeV injector and the main linac. The system was designed to ensure an energy spread of dE < 10-03. After installation several tests have taken place, the results will be presented in this work.

In view of LHC intensity upgrades, collimator materials may become a limit to the machine performance: the high RF impedance of Carbon-Carbon composites can lead to beam instabilities, while the Tungsten alloy adopted in tertiary collimators exhibits low robustness in case of beam-induced accidents. An R&D program has been pursued to develop new materials overcoming such limitations. Molybdenum-Graphite, in addition to its outstanding thermal conductivity, can be coated with pure molybdenum, reducing collimator impedance by a factor of 10. A new secondary collimator is being designed around this novel composite. New high-melting materials are also proposed to improve the robustness of tertiary collimators. All the new collimators will be equipped with BPMs, significantly enhancing the alignment speed and the beta-star reach. This implies additional constraints of space, as well as detailed static and fatigue calculations on cables and connectors. This paper describes the mechanical design and the engineering calculations of such future collimators, focusing on the study via state-of-the-art numerical methods of interactions between the particle beams and the new materials adopted.
