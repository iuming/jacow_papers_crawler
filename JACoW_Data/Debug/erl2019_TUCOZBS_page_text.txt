A prototype Fast Reactive Tuner (FRT) for superconducting cavities has been developed, which allows the frequency to be controlled by application of a potential difference across a newly developed ultra-low loss ferro-electric material residing within the tuner. The tuner operates at room temperature, outside of the cryostat and coupled to the cavity via an antenna and co-axial cable. This technique allows for active compensation of microphonics, eliminating the need to design over-coupled fundamental power couplers and thus significantly reducing RF power particularly for low beam current applications. Modelling; simulation; and stability analysis, of the tuner; cavity; measurement system; and feedback loop, have been performed in the frequency and time domain, and are compared to the latest experimental results. The potential benefits of applying this techniques to ERLs, which are seen as one of the major use cases, are detailed both in general and with regards to specific projects. Ideas and designs for an improved next generation FRT are also discussed.

In the main linac (ML) of the KEK-cERL, two superconducting cavities with high loaded Q (QL ¿ 1×107) are operated in continuous wave (CW) mode. It is important to control and suppress the microphonics detuning owing to the low bandwidth of the cavities. We evaluated the background microphonics detuning by the low level radio frequency system during the beam operation. Interestingly, a ¿field level dependence microphonics¿ phenomenon was observed on one of the cavities in the ML. Several frequency components were suddenly excited if the cavity field is above a threshold field (~3 MV/m). We found that this threshold field is probably related with the cavity quench limits despite the unclear inherent physical mechanism. Furthermore, in order to optimize the cavity resonance control system for better microphonics rejection, we have measured the mechanical transfer function between the fast piezo tuner and cavity detuning. Finally, we validated this model by comparing the model response with actual system response.

The recirculating superconducting Darmstadt linear accelerator S-DALINAC [1] is one of the main research instruments at the institute for nuclear physics at the TU Darmstadt. It is operating in cw mode at beam currents of up to 20 uA with energies of up to 130 MeV using a thrice recirculating scheme. In 2010 the present digital low-level rf (LLRF) control system was set into operation. Since 2017 the S-DALINAC can be used as an energy recovery linac (ERL). The ERL mode is adjusted by shifting the phase of the beam by 180° in the second recirculation. The current setup of the LLRF control system is not optimized for the usage in an ERL operation. Therefore investigations in regard of the rf control performance have to be done. The first successful one turn ERL operation was set up in August 2017 where the rf control performance was investigated the first time in this new mode. In this talk the LLRF control system of the S-DALINAC is presented and its perfomance during an ERL operation is discussed.
