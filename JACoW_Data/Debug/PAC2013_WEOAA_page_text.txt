We present an overview of design studies and R&D toward NGLS  a Next Generation Light Source initiative at LBNL. The design concept is based on a multi-beamline soft x-ray FEL array powered by a CW superconducting linear accelerator, and operating with a high bunch repetition rate of approximately 1 MHz. The linac design uses TESLA and ILC technology, supplied by an injector based on a CW normal-conducting VHF photocathode electron gun. Electron bunches from the linac are distributed by RF deflecting cavities to the array of independently configurable FEL beamlines with nominal bunch rates of ~100 kHz in each FEL, with uniform pulse spacing, and some FELs capable of operating at the full linac bunch rate. Individual FELs may be configured for different modes of operation, including self-seeded and external-laser-seeded, and each may produce high peak and average brightness x-rays with a flexible pulse format.

Cornell University has pioneered the design and hardware for ERL lightsources. This preparatory research for ERL-lightsource construction will be discussed. Important milestones have been achieved in Cornell's prototype ERL injector, including the production of a prototype SRF cavity that exceeds design specifications, the regular production of long-lived and low emittance cathodes, the acceleration of ultra-low emittance bunches, and the world-record of 75 mA current from a photoemission DC gun. We believe that demonstration of the practical feasibility of these technologies have progressed sufficiently to allow the construction of an ERL-based lightsource like the Cornell ERL.

The first prototype superconducting undulator (SCU0) was successfully installed and commissioned at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and is delivering photons for user science. All the requirements before operating the SCU0 in the storage ring were satisfied during a short but detailed beam commissioning. The cryogenic system performed very well in the presence of the beam. The total beam-induced heat load on the SCU0 agreed well with the predictions, and the SCU0 is protected from excessive heat loads through a combination of orbit control and SCU0 alignment. When powered, the field integral measured with the beam agreed well with the magnet measurements. An induced quench caused very little beam motion, and did not cause loss of the beam. The device was found to quench during unintentional beam dumps, but quench recovery is transparent to storage ring operation. There were no beam chamber vacuum pressure issues and no negative effect observed on the beam. Finally, the SCU0 was operated well beyond its design requirements, and no significant issues were identified. The beam commissioning results are described in this paper.

We present a detailed study of the emittances produced in the Cornell Energy Recovery Linac Photoinjector. Both the horizontal and vertical transverse phase spaces, as well as the time-resolved (sliced) horizontal phase space, were simulated and directly measured at the end of the injector for 19 pC and 77 pC bunches at roughly 8 MeV. The resulting 90% normalized transverse emittances for 19 (77) pC/bunch were 0.23 ± 0.02 (0.51 ± 0.04) μm in the horizontal plane, and 0.14 ± 0.01 (0.29 ± 0.02) μm in the vertical plane, respectively. These emittances were measured with a corresponding bunch length of 2.1±0.1 (3.0±0.2) ps, respectively. For both bunch charges, the rms momentum spread was determined to be on the order of 10-3. Excellent overall agreement between measurement and simulation has been demonstrated. The beam brightness measured in this work is significantly better than the best of modern storage rings, and represents a milestone for the field of high-brightness, high-current photoinjectors.
