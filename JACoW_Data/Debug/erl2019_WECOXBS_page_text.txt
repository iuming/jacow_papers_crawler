Photoinjector driven electron accelerators place stringent requirements on the photocathodes used. This is primarily due to the fact that the properties of the generated electron bunch are crucially defined by the material properties of the photocathode employed. To generate high brightness and high average current a photocathode with high QE and low intrinsic emittance is required. Furthermore, to be of practical use, the material must be robust and exhibit a long lifetime to deliver stable beam. Bi-alkali antimonides are suitable candidates; they exhibit high quantum efficiencies and can be operated close to the photoemission threshold, thus enabling the generation of high current and low emittance electron beams. At HZB bi-alkali antimonides are the choice photocathode materials to drive the BERLinPro energy recovery linac. In this talk we present studies conducted at HZB to develop the optimal growth procedure for Cs-K-Sb and Na-K-Sb photocathodes with respect to QE and lifetime measurements.

The bi-alkali antimonide photocathode are chosen as the electron source material for the Low Energy RHIC electron Cooling (LEReC) project at RHIC, BNL based on its requirement for high bunch charge and long-time beam operation. This report presents the design and operation of the cathode deposition and transportation systems for the LEReC photocathodes, the cathode performance under the high current operation in the LEReC DC gun, as well as the characterization of the damaged cathodes from the long-time operation.

Continuous wave (CW) 100 mA electron rf gun for injecting the high-quality 300-400 keV electron beam in Novosibirsk Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) and driving Free Electron Laser (FEL) was developed, built, and commissioned at BINP SB RAS. The RF gun consists of normal conducting 90 MHz rf cavity with a gridded thermionic cathode unit. Bench tests of rf gun is confirmed good results in strict accordance with our numerical calculations and showed reliable work, unpretentious for vacuum conditions and stable in long-term operation. The design features of different components of the rf gun are presented. Preparation and commissioning experience is discussed. The latest beam results are reported.
