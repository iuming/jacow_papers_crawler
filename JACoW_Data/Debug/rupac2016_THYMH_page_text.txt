The scheme of the C ions beam production with energy 455 MeV/nucleon from the U-70 accelerator was described. The method of injection of carbon nuclei was described. The slow extraction scheme of carbon beam to the radiobiological stand was showed. Experimental parameters of the carbon beam were described. The first experimental results were shown.

JINR has the unique experience in cancer treatment with proton beam during about 50 years. In 2005 the collaboration with IBA (Belgium) was established. During these years the technical design of the first carbon superconducting cyclotron C400 was successfully created, the construction of serial proton cyclotron C230 was significantly improved and the fist modernized cyclotron C235 was assembled, debugged and put in the test operation in Dubna in 2013. This C235 will be used soon in the first Russian medical center with proton therapy in Dimitrovgrad. In 2015 the joint project with ASIPP (Hefei, China) on design and construction of superconducting proton cyclotron SC200 was started. Two samples of SC200 should be created according to the Collaboration Agreement between JINR and ASIPP. One will be used for proton therapy in Hefei and the second one should be used to replace the synchrocyclotron Phasotron in investigations on proton therapy at JINR.
