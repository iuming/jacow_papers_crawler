The microbunching instability is an ubiquitous problem in storage rings at high current density. However, the involved fast time-scales hampered the possibility to make direct real-time recordings of theses structures. When the structures occur at a cm scale, recent works at UVSOR*, revealed that direct recording of the CSR electric field with ultra-high speed electronics (17 ps) provides extremely precious informations on the microbunching dynamics. However, when CSR occurs at THz frequencies (and is thus out of reach of electronics), the problem remained largely open. Here we present a new opto-electronic strategy that enabled to record series of successive electric field pulses shapes with picosecond resolution (including carrier and envelope), every 12 ns, over a total duration of several milliseconds. We also present the first experimental results obtained with this method at Synchrotron SOLEIL, above the microbunching instability threshold, and we present direct tests of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck and macroparticle models. The method can be applied to the detection of ps electric fields in other situations where high repetition rate is also an issue.

In order to improve the injection efficiency of the round UNILAC heavy ion beam into the asymmetric acceptance of the SIS18 it would be of great advantage to decrease the horizontal emittance by a so called emittance transfer to the vertical plane. In this contribution the present status of the emittance transfer experiment EMTEX at GSI will be reported. A short introduction about the theoretical background of the technique will be given, while the main part is dedicated to the practical solutions setting up a test beam line at GSI. Finally, the results of a first commissioning beam time will be presented. The scheduled beam time to apply the emittance transfer technique foreseen in spring 2014 had to be shifted to calendar week 26 in 2014, just after this conference, as some components have not been delivered in time by the contractor. The results and comparison to the theoretical predictions you may find in later publications.

The transport and matching of electron beams generated by a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) is a major challenge due to their large energy spread and divergence. Strong focussing magnets and a chromatic correction are required. This contribution discusses the layout of the beam transport optics for a diagnostic beamline at the LWFA in Jena, Germany. The aim of this optics is to match the betatron functions and the dispersion to the field of a transverse gradient undulator (TGU) such that monochromatic undulator radiation is generated despite the large energy spread.
