Benchtop calibration of capacitive beam position monitors (BPMs) in low energy beamlines is challenging due to non-relativistic effects. Typical benchtop calibrations cannot account for these effects because they rely on speed of light fields transmitted along a straight wire. However, it is possible to replicate the electromagnetic fields generated by non-relativistic beams using a helical line pulse instead of a straight wire. In order to properly replicate the fields from a beam, a method must be developed for tailoring input pulses into the helical line to match bunch shape and a model of the impedance of the helix should be developed to assist with matching. This paper uses the sheath helix model to analyze signal propagation along a helical line in the time domain, with attention to dispersive effects and impedance matching. The results from this model are then compared to Microwave Studio simulations.

A nitrogen gas sheet will measure the two dimensional transverse profile of the 2.5 MeV proton beam in IOTA. The beam lifetime is limited by the interaction with the gas, thus a minimally invasive instrument is required. To produce a gas sheet with the desired density and thickness, various nozzle types are being investigated, including rectangular capillary tubes for gas injection and skimmers for final shaping of the gas. It is essential to meet vacuum requirements in the interaction chamber while maintaining the precise thickness and density of the gas, without significantly affecting the beam lifetime. The current design of a gas sheet beam profile monitor and present status will be discussed.

In order to analyze time variation of the ion species in a pulse, we are developing a mass analysis system that has multiple collector electrodes to detect several ion species simultaneously. Strong permanent magnets can generate 1T magnetic field and the size of the analyzing magnet system can be compact. The detected signals are scanned by a fast multiplexer. The scanning rate is 2 MHz, so that all electrode signals of the 16 channels are scanned in 8 μs period. In this paper, details of the design of the analysis system, and preliminary beam extraction test results with prototype of the system are described.

The LIPAc accelerator will be a linear CW deuteron accelerator capable of delivering a 9 MeV, 125 mA beam which aims to validate the technology that will be used in the future high power accelerator-driven neutron source, IFMIF. In summer 2017 a campaign of measurements was done during the injector commissioning, in which a Fluorescence Profile Monitor based on an Intensified CID camera (ICID) was used to measure the beam transverse profile at the extraction of the ion source. In this contribution we review the design of the ICID, its performance and discuss the measurements carried out. The performance of ICID monitors for its use in future accelerators will be assessed.

The University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) has the flexibility to set up alternative lattices for different research experiments, including nonlinear optics studies using octupoles. Each alternative lattice requires an acceptable steering solution for use in experiments. Existing beam-based alignment tools can take a significant amount of time to run and become difficult to process with a low number of BPMs. The Robust Conjugate Directional Search (RCDS) optimizer* is used to quickly obtain steering solutions for different lattice configurations and has been adopted for beam steering at UMER. Steering magnets are optimized online to reduce scraping, correct equilibrium orbits, and increase beam lifetimes. This study presents the application of the optimizer at UMER.

Ethernet POWERLINK (EPL) is a communication profile for Real-Time Ethernet. The communication profile meets real-time demands for the distributed system composed of multiple controllers. EPICS is a wildly used distributed control system in large scientific facilities. We design a distributed IO system based on EPL under the EPICS architecture and establish the prototype system composed of a PC and six FPGA boards. In this system, an EPICS driver based on openPOWERLINK is developed to monitor the system status. In this paper, the communication mechanism of EPL, the design of system architecture, the implementation of EPICS driver and the test results of prototype system will be described.

The experiment P2 will measure the weak mixing angle with an all-time high precision via electron-proton scattering. The measured physics asymmetry and its uncertainty has to be corrected by the apparatus' asymmetry, which is generated by helicity correlated fluctuations of the beam parameters position, angle, intensity and energy. This Poster will describe how the high precision of 0.1 ppb of the parity violating asymmetry can be provided by the high precision measurements of the parameters position, angle and intensity.

A fast closed orbit feedback system (bandwidth in the order of 1 kHz) is under development at the GSI SIS18 synchrotron for the orbit correction from injection to extraction including the acceleration ramp. The static process model, represented as the orbit response matrix (ORM), is subjected to the systematic optics changes during ramp e.g. beta function and phase advance variations at the locations of BPMs and steerers. In addition to these systematic variations, model mismatches may arise from dipole and quadrupole magnet errors, space charge dependent tune shift as well as BPM and steerer calibration errors. In this contribution, the effects of these model errors on the closed orbit correction are investigated which is necessary for the robust stability analysis of the feedback controller. For the robustness tests, the traditional SVD-based matrix pseudo-inversion is compared to a Fourier-based analysis. The results are achieved by detailed simulations in MADX.

A low-latency, intra-train feedback system employing cavity beam position monitors (BPMs) has been developed and tested at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2) at KEK. The feedback system can be operated with either position information from a single BPM to provide local beam stabilisation, or by using position information from two BPMs to stabilise the beam at an intermediate location. The correction is implemented using a stripline kicker and a custom power amplifier, with the feedback calculations being performed on a digital board built around a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The addition of indium sealing to the BPMs to increase the cavities' Q-values has led to improvements to the BPM system resolution, with current measurements of the resolution of order 20 nm. The feedback performance was tested with beam trains of two bunches, separated by 280 ns and with a charge of ~1 nC. For single- (two-)BPM feedback, stabilisation of the beam has been demonstrated to below 50 nm (41 nm). Ongoing work to improve the feedback performance further will be discussed.

Coherent pulse stacking (CPS) is a new time-domain coherent addition technique that stacks several optical pulses into a single output pulse, enabling high pulse energy and high average power. We model the CPS as a digital filter in the Z domain, and implement two deterministic algorithms extracting the cavity phase from limited data where only the pulse intensity is available. In a 2-stage 15-pulse CPS system, each optical cavity is stabilized at an individually-prescribed round-trip phase with 0.7 deg and 2.1 deg RMS phase errors for Stage 1 and Stage 2 respectively. Optical cavity phase control with nm accuracy ensures 1.2% intensity stability of the stacked pulse over 12 hours.

Transient beam loading compensation schemes, such as One-Turn-FeedBack (OTFB), require beam synchronous processing (BSP). Swept clocks derived from the RF, and therefore harmonic to the revolution frequency, are widely used in CERN synchrotrons; this simplifies implementation with energy ramping, where the revolution frequency changes. It is however not optimal for state-of-the-art digital hardware that prefers fixed frequency clocks. An alternative to the swept clocking is the use of a deterministic protocol, for example, White Rabbit (WR): a fixed reference clock can be extracted from its data stream, while enabling digital distribution of the RF frequency among other data. New algorithms must be developed for BSP using this fixed clock and the digital data transmitted on the WR link. This is the strategy adopted for the SPS Low Level RF (LLRF) upgrade. The paper gives an overview of the technical, technological and historical motivations for such a paradigm evolution. It lists the problems of fixed clock BSP, and presents an innovative solution based on a real-time variable ratio re-sampler for implementing an OTFB with the new fixed clock scheme.

The Low Level Radio Frequency control (LLRF) system measures the RF signals from the accelerator tube, compares it with the phase reference received from the timing distribution system, and provides the drive signal to the high power RF system to provide synchronized RF voltage to the electron beam. Usually, the LLRF system can achieve a ~50 fs RMS phase jitter which is limited by the microwave devices. The phase noise arise from the high voltage variation of the high power system will significantly increase phase noise from low level RF signal to high power RF. A high voltage feed forward subsystem is proposed to deal with the phase noise caused by the high voltage jitter of the modulator. The demo system is depolyed in Thomson scattering X-ray source (TTX).and the primary experiment result anaylse is discussed.

In order to clari-fy and improve the reference line performance, the RF reference phase stability is measured. The phase noise of the RF reference at each sector is shown in this paper. A new phase monitor system is implemented to measure the short-term stability and long-term drift due to the temperature and humidity fluctuations in the klystron gallery.

In order to reduce the vertical emittance at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), we first measure and correct the vertical orbit, dispersion, and coupling. However, due to the finite resolution of our optics measurements, we still retain a significant residual emittance. In order to correct this further, we made use of the theory of sloppy models, according to which certain high-dimensionality systems can be modeled with significantly fewer "eigenparameters" that still contain most of the effect on the desired objective, in this case, the emittance.* However, we noted that using these knobs for tuning often resulted in increased vertical orbit errors. In an attempt to constrain these, we have applied multi-objective genetic algorithms to this problem. We have found that it can be more efficient to run such algorithms using our eigenparameters as the genes to be varied, as opposed to the raw magnet values. When running with the first 8 such knobs as genes, we can get either orbits or beam sizes as good as we obtain with our regular emittance-tuning algorithm which uses all the corrector magnets.

In order to improve the resilience of the MAX IV 3 GeV ring's beam to a horizontal dipole kick while at the design tunes (42.20, 16.28) the optimisation algorithm RCDS (Robust Conjugate Direction Search) was deployed. The algorithm was able to increase the horizontal acceptance by finding new settings for the sextupole and octupole magnets, whilst leaving the vertical acceptance virtually unchanged. Additionally, the optimisation increased the momentum acceptance of the lattice, increasing beam lifetime.

Currently, in the electron linac ELBE there is a single beam line. Therefore, at any given time only single user can use the beam. Moreover, as different user experiments require distinct beam intensity settings, not all the experiments fully utilize the 13 MHz CW beam capability of the facility. To utilize the full beam capacity, multiple beam lines can be established by using an array of transverse deflecting structures. For that, an RF cavity was the design choice due to its inherent advantages with respect to repeatability of the kick voltage amplitude and phase, and the possibility of CW operation in the MHz range. Potential design candidates are the CEBAF RF separator, the three proposed crab cavities for the HL-LHC upgrade project, and a novel NC deflecting cavity design. In this comparative study, the figures of merit of the cavities are computed from electromagnetic field simulations for a transverse voltage of 300 kV. This comparative study supported our selection of the deflecting cavity design for ELBE.

We report a study of internal dark current generation by multipactor inside a 17 GHz single cell standing wave disk-loaded waveguide accelerator structure. The multipactor takes place on the side wall of the central cell, driven by the local rf electric and magnetic fields. Theory indicates that a resonant multipactor mode with two rf cycles can be excited near 45 MV/m gradient and a single rf cycle multipactor mode near 60 MV/m. The accelerator structure had two thin slits opened on the side wall of the central cell to directly extract and measure the internal dark current. The dark current was measured as a function of the gradient up to a gradient of 70 MV/m. The experimental results agreed well with theory, showing the two predicted multipactor modes. To further study the effect of the central cell side wall surface properties on the structure performance, we prepared and tested a second structure with the central cell side wall coated with a layer of diamond-like carbon. The comparison of the results showed that the coating reduced the internal dark current and thus enhanced the structure performance considerably.

The Cornell-BNL ERL Test Accelerator (CBETA) is a new multi-turn energy recovery linac currently under construction at Cornell University. It uses two superconducting linacs, both of which are susceptible to microphonics detuning. The high-current injector accelerates electrons to 6 MeV and the main linac accelerates and decelerates electrons by 36 MeV. In this paper, we discuss various measures taken to reduce vibrations caused by instabilities and flow transients in the cryogenic system of the main linac cryomodule. We further describe the use of a Least Mean Square algorithm in establishing a stable Active Microphonics Compensation system for operation of the main linac cavities.

The development of next-generation SRF cavities requires the deployment of innovative material solutions with RF performance beyond bulk Nb. Theoretical interest has stimulated efforts to grow and characterize thin multi-layer superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) structures for their potential capability of supporting otherwise inaccessible surface magnetic fields in SRF cavities *. The ternary B1-compound NbTiN is among the candidate superconducting materials for SIS structures. Single crystal NbTiN films with thicknesses below 15 nm are also of interest for the development of high resolution, high sensitivity (SNSPD) detectors for particle physics application. Using DC reactive magnetron sputtering, NbTiN can be deposited with nominal superconducting parameters. This contribution presents the on-going material surface and superconducting properties characterization in order to optimize the NbTiN films for each application.

Superconducting multi-spoke cavities are well-known optional choice for acceleration of heavy ions in medium velocity regimes. The paper describes the design, fabrication and test results of the superconducting double-spoke cavity developed at IMP. After Buffered Chemical Polishing and High pressure Rinsing, one cavity has undergone high gradient RF testing at 4 K in the Vertical Test Stand. We present measurements of the quality factor as a function of accelerating field and maximum field on the surface. Accelerating gradient of more than 15 MV/m is reached with peak electric field of 61 MV/m, and peak magnetic field of 118 mT.

Previous experiments have shown that introducing nitrogen gas during low temperature bakes (120-160 C) of niobium cavities introduces C, N, and O impurities to the first 10-100 nm of the surface. This new treatment results in higher quality factors and even 'anti-Q-slope' in some cases. However, it is not entirely clear the role that each of these impurities plays in the performance enhancement of the cavities. It has been suggested that interstitial N within the first few nm of the surface is solely responsible for the observed enhancement, but little work has been done on the role of C and O. Because both C and O are abundant in much higher quantities than N near the surface, it is important to understand whether they are beneficial or detrimental to cavity performance. We provide further insight into the effects of C and O on cavity performance by baking in an ambient atmosphere rich in CO2 as opposed to N2.

The anti-Q-slope, a field-dependent decrease in surface resistance observed in impurity-doped niobium, has been investigated extensively in 1.3 GHz cavities. New early research into this effect has recently been performed at higher and lower frequencies, revealing an additional dependence on frequency: the anti-Q-slope is stronger at higher frequencies and weaker at lower frequencies. Several models have been proposed to explain the anti-Q-slope, with varying success in this new frequency-dependent regime. In this work, we analyze recent experimental data from a low-temperature-doped 1.3 GHz cavity and a high-temperature nitrogen-doped 2.6 GHz cavity and discuss the implications of these results on the proposed models.

Growing layers of these materials of the quality necessary has proven to be difficult. In this work, we present the SRF performance of planar samples of the promising materials, NbN and Nb¬3Sn, grown using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) respectively. Results are promising.

Nb3Sn is a potential candidate to replace Nb in SRF accelerator cavities to reduce cost and advance perfor-mance. Tin vapor diffusion is the preferred technique to realize such cavities by growing a few microns thick Nb3Sn coating on the interior surface of the niobium cavity. The coating process typically uses temperatures of 1100-1200 °C for 3-6 hours. It is important to better understand the coating process, and optimize the coating parameters to overcome the current limitation on the performance of Nb3Sn coated SRF cavities. We investi-gate Nb3Sn coatings prepared in the temperature range of 900-1200 °C and duration of 3 - 12 hours using various material characterization tools. Variation of these pa-rameters appears to have notable effect on microstructure and topography of the obtained surface.

Nb3Sn is a potential candidate for surface material of SRF cavities since it can enable the cavity to operate at higher temperatures with high quality factor and at an increased accelerating gradient. Nb-Sn films were deposited using magnetron sputtering of individual Nb and Sn targets onto Nb and sapphire substrates. The as-deposited films were annealed at 1200 °C for 3 hours. The films were characterized for their structure by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), morphology by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and composition by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The surface resistivity was measured down to cryogenic temperature to determine the superconducting transition temperature and its width. The composition of the multilayered films was controlled by varying the thickness of the Nb and Sn layers. The films showed crystalline Nb3Sn phases with Tc up to 17.6 K.

Demands of CW high-power LINAC require SRF cavities operating at the frontier of high accelerating gradient and low RF power dissipation, i.e. high quality factor (Q0). This requirement poses a challenge for standard surface treatment recipes of SRF cavities. In a recent breakthrough, elliptical SRF cavities doped with Nitrogen have been shown to improve Q0 by a factor of 3, close to the fundamental SRF limit. The fundamental mechanisms at microscopic level and optimum doping recipe, however, have still not fully been understood. Materials other than Nb have also been proposed for SRF cavities to overcome the fundamental limit already reached with Nitrogen doping, e.g. Nb3Sn, MgB2, and Nb-SIS multilayer. At TRIUMF, a unique experimental facility is currently being developed to address these issues. This facility will be able to probe local surface magnetic field in the order of the London Penetration Depth (several tens of nm) via \beta decay detection of a low-energy radioactive ion-beam. This allows depth-resolution and layer-by-layer measurement of magnetic field shielding effectiveness of different SRF materials at high-parallel field (up to 200 mT). Design and current development of this facility will be presented here, as well as commissioning and future measurements strategies for new SRF materials.

The China Initiative Accelerator Driven System (CiADS) has been approved to transmute long-lived radi-oisotopes in used nuclear fuel into shorter-lived fission products. IHEP is developing a 325MHz double spoke cavity at β0 of 0.5 for the CiADS linac. The cavity shape was optimized to minimize Ep/Ea while keeping Bp/Ep reasonably low, while the multipacting was analyzed. Meanwhile, mechanical design was applied to check stress, Lorentz force detuning and microphonic effects, and to minimize pressure sensitivity. A new RF coupling scheme was proposed to avoid electrons hitting directly on ceramic window. The detailed design for the cavity is addressed in this paper.

The Mexican Particle Accelerator Community is currently designing the first Mexican RF eLINAC that will have three beamlines at 10, 60 and 100 MeV. In this work, we present an optimized design in terms of field quality and production cost for the 5 T/m normal conducting quadrupoles of the 10-MeV beamline. Several candidate materials for the yoke were studied based on their availability and machinability, with the aim to optimize in-house production cost (Mexico) while restricting a low multipole content.

The Beam Test Facility is part of the DAΦNE accelerators system of INFN Frascati National Laboratory. It is a transfer-line optimized for electrons and positrons extracted from the DAΦNE LINAC. An upgrade of the line is scheduled for two purposes: reach a beam energy of 920 MeV (with respect to the actual 750 MeV) and add a new branch to the present transfer line. This new layout foresees six new quadrupoles one fast ramped dipole, two H-shape and one C-shape sector dipoles. The design of the magnets has been completely performed at INFN involving Electromechanical Enterprise partner in the design phase in order to optimise the manufacturing process. This effort lead to a complete set of detailed CAD drawings that can be directly used by manufacturer to build the magnets. The goal is to boost the manufacturing of prototypes and small series from Small and Medium Enterprises. Magnetic measurements will be performed at INFN. This poster is focused on the realization of the two full iron yoke H-shape and C-shape dipoles, respectively with 45 and 15 bending angle. They are characterized by a high flux density of 1.7 T in a gap of 35 mm. They have a bending radius of 1.8 m

Hefei Advanced Light Source (HALS) is the fourth-generation radiation light source that is being pre-researched in China. Ultra-low emittance of the beam requires higher performance of power supply system. We designed a fast correcting power supply for the beam measurement needs. We adopted the all-digital method, the current closed-loop feedback used the AD7766 with 24-bit resolution as its A/D converter. And we added the corresponding constant temperature control, chain protection, etc. The small-signal frequency response of this system can reach more than 5kHz. The detail design scheme is described in this paper.

Vacuum chamber surface characteristics such as the photon and secondary electron yields (PEY and SEY) are critical parameters in the formation of an electron cloud, a serious problem that limits the performance of proton and positron accelerators. A few years ago it was discovered by the Vacuum Solutions Group at Daresbury laboratory that Laser Ablation Surface Engineering (LASE) could provide surfaces with SEY<1 [1,2]. The LASE surfaces are considered as a baseline solution for electron cloud miti-gation in the Future Circular Collider (FCC). However, these surfaces are undergoing further optimisation for the FCC application. While keeping SEY<1 the surfaces should meet the following criteria: Low outgassing, Low particulate generation and low surface resistance. In this paper we will report a number of new surfaces created using the LASE technique with different laser parameters (wavelength, scan speed, pitch, repetition rate, power, and pulse length) and their effect on the SEY, surface re-sistance and vacuum properties, etc

The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is equipped with two fast pulsed magnet systems (MKIs) that inject particle beams from the injector chain. Future operation for High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) with high intensity beams will cause heating of the ferrite yokes of the MKIs beyond their Curie temperature, preventing injection until the yokes cool down. Beam coupling impedance studies show that it is possible to move a substantial portion of the beam induced power deposition from the upstream ferrite yokes, which are the yokes with the highest power deposition, to ferrite rings located at the upstream end of the magnet. Thermal predictions show that this power redistribution, combined with the installation of a cooling system around the rings, will maintain the temperatures of all the yokes and ferrite rings below their Curie point. Since the rings are not pulsed to high voltage, whereas the ferrite yokes are, the installation of a cooling system is feasible around the rings. The proposed design of the cooling system will be tested to ensure good performance before its installation on the MKIs. The details of the simulations and the design process are reported.

TRIUMF has the objective of producing radioactive isotope beams (RIB) using the ISOL method. Radioactive isotopes are used in experiments in different areas of science. At the TRIUMF-ISAC facility, a 500 MeV proton driver beam impinges onto different targets and induces nuclear reactions in them. The isotopes obtained in this way then diffuse out of the target material before they are ionized and extracted to form an isotope beam. Targets of uranium carbide with excess of graphite (UCx) are the most requested targets at TRIUMF. ARIEL, TRIUMF's flagship project, aims at increasing the radioactive isotope production capabilities to satisfy the growing demand of radioactive isotopes. The current production method of UCx targest does not have the means to supply enough UCx targets to satisfy ARIEL's demand, therefore, a new method for efficient UCx target material synthesis is being developed.

At ISAC-TRIUMF, a 500 MeV proton beam is impinged upon thick targets to induce nuclear reactions to pro-duce reaction products that are delivered as a Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) to experiments. Uranium carbide is among the most commonly used target materials which produces a vast radionuclide inventory coming from both spallation and fission- events. This can also represent a major limitation for the successful delivery of certain RIBs to experiments since, for a given mass, many isobar-ic isotopes are to be filtered by the dipole mass separator. These contaminants can exceed the yield of the isotope of interest by orders of magnitude, often causing a significant reduction in the sensitivity of experiments or even making them impossible. The design of a 50 kW proton-to-neutron (p2n) converter-target is ongoing to enhance the production of neutron-rich nuclei while significantly reducing the rate of neutron-deficient contaminants. The converter is made out of a bulk tungsten block which converts proton beams into neutrons through spallation. The neutrons, in turn, induce pure fission in an upstream UCx target. The present target design and the service infrastructure needed for its operation will be discussed in this paper.

The Compact Laser Plasma Accelerator (CLAPA) has been built recently at Peking University, which composed of a 200TW laser acceleration platform and a beam line system. Proton with energy spread of <1%, up to 10 pC charge and different energies below 10 MeV have been produced and transported to the irradiation platform. Emittance is a critical parameter for beam transportation. The preliminary emittance measurement has been per-formed for CLAPA's proton beams using the quadrupole scan technique (QST). In the experiment, the focal spot size of the proton beam was changed by scanning the current of a quadrupole triplet magnet. The result shows that the normalized emittance is smaller than 0.01 mm·mrad for 5 MeV laser driven protons, which is on the same level of the previously reported work.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is developing a 5-cell 644 MHz βopt=0.65 elliptical cavity for a future linac energy upgrade to 400 MeV/u for the heaviest uranium ions. Superconducting elliptical cavities operated in continuous wave, such as the ones for FRIB, are prone to microphonics which can excite mechanical modes of the cavities. It has been shown that the detuning due to microphonics can be mitigated with the use of piezo actuators (fast tuner) as opposed to the costly option of increasing the input RF power. The FRIB slow/fast dynamic tuner will be based on the Fermilab experience with similar tuners like those developed for the linac coherent light source (LCLS) II and proton improvement plan (PIP) II. This paper will present the results of tuner properties on the bench.

Here we investigate how inserts of various densities (0.001-2.2 g/cm3) affect the dose distribution properties of VHEE beams at ~150 MeV. A range variation comparison was also made with clinical proton beams using TOPAS/GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we assess the viability of scattering foils for optimizing the size of VHEE beams for radiotherapy purposes. The experiments were conducted at CERN's CLEAR user facility.

A Terbium activated Gadolinium Oxysulfide (Gd2O2S:Tb)-filled optical fibre sensor was developed and tested as a proton therapy beam dosimeter on a 74 MeV proton beam. Tests were carried out at the TRIUMF proton therapy centre, where a passively scattered beam is used for treatment. To create a clinically relevant spread-out Bragg peak, a modulator wheel with steps of varying thickness is employed. To determine the sensor's response in a 23 mm spread out Bragg peak, the sensor signal was sampled at depth intervals of 0.79 mm along the beam axis in a water phantom. The resulting data showed a periodic variation in the signal corresponding to the rotation of the modulator wheel and related to the depth in water of the detector. This timing resolution in the sensor response could find application in quality assurance for modulated proton beams.

To fully exploit the advantageous dose distribution profiles of ion radiotherapy, an exact knowledge of the beam properties through online beam monitoring is essential, ensuring thus an effective dose delivery to the patient. One potential candidate for an online beam monitor is the LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO). This detector, originally developed for the LHCb experiment, has been adapted to the specific conditions of the clinical environment in a proton therapy centre. The semicircular design and position of its sensitive silicon detector offers a non-invasive way to measure the beam intensity without interfering with the beam core. In this contribution, modifications for VELO are described. The detector is synchronized with the readout of a locally-constructed Faraday Cup and the 25.7 MHz RF frequency of the cyclotron at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre (CCC). Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations investigate the integration of the detector in the treatment line and behaviour of the beam during delivery. The capability of VELO as a beam monitor will be assessed by measuring the beam current and by monitoring the beam profile along the beamline this summer.

The performance of the energy degrader in terms of beam properties directly impacts the design and cost of cyclotron-based proton therapy centers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performances of different existing and novel degrader materials. The quantitative estimate is based on detailed Geant4 simulations that analyze the beam-matter interaction and provide a determination of the beam emittance increase and transmission. Comparisons between existing (aluminium, graphite, beryllium) and novel (boron carbide and diamond) degrader materials are provided and evaluated against semi-analytical models of multiple Coulomb scattering. The results showing a potential in emittance reduction for novel materials are presented and discussed in detail.

The high-gradient performance of an accelerating structure prototype for a medical proton linac is presented. The structure was designed and built using technology developed by the CLIC collaboration and the target application is the TULIP (Turning Linac for Proton therapy) proposal developed by the TERA foundation. The special feature of this design is to produce gradient of more than 50 MV /m in low-β accelerating structures (v/c=0.38). The structure was tested in an S-band test stand at CERN. During the tests, the structure reached over above 60 MV/m at 1.2 μs pulse length and breakdown rate of about 5x10-6 bpp. The results presented include ultimate performance, long term behaviour and measurements that can guide future optimization.
