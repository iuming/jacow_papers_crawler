ADAM, Application of Detectors and Accelerators to Medicine is a Swiss Company based in Geneva Switzerland established on 20th December 2007. ADAM was founded to promote scientific know-how and innovations in medical technology for cancer treatment. In 2007 a first partnership agreement was signed with CERN and in 2011 ADAM has been officially recognized as CERN spin-off. After the first research results other partnership agreements were signed between ADAM and CERN with the main goal of establishing a framework within which the two parties can collaborate to develop novel technologies for detectors and accelerators. Currently ADAM research activity is mainly focused on the construction and testing of its first linear accelerator for medical application: LIGHT (Linac for Image-Guided Hadron Therapy). LIGHT is an innovative linear accelerator designed to revolutionise hadron therapy facilities by simplifying the infrastructure and make them profitable from an industrial point of view while providing a better quality beam. The current design allow LIGHT to accelerate proton beam up to 230MeV with several advantages comparing to the current solutions present in the market.
