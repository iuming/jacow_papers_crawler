CEPC have the biggest vacuum system in the word, so as to the FCC-ee. Its includes 100 km electron ring, positron ring, booster ring and the 1.2km linac. As the W, Z, tt mode has been proposed in TDR, the demands of vacuum system have been considered. Due to the difference of beam energy and current, the PSD of W, Z, tt mode has been changed comparing to Higgs mode, which shows that the photon-stimulated desorption gas load is very high. Similar to positron ring, NEG coating is proposed to vacuum chamber of electron storage ring to absorb extra gas load. To eliminate the quadrupolar wakes, elliptical vacuum chamber in the collider ring will be replaced by circular chambers with dimeter of 56 mm.
