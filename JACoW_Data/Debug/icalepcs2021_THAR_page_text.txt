ITER will produce large volumes of data that need to be visualized and analyzed. This paper describes the development of a graphical data visualization and exploration tool, MINT (Make Informative and Nice Trends), for plant engineers, operators and physicists. It describes the early development phase from requirements capture to first release covering the mistakes, lessons learnt and future steps. The requirements were collected by interviewing the various stakeholders. The initial neglect of the architecture and user-friendliness turned out to be key points when developing such a tool for a project with a long lifetime like ITER. Modular architecture and clear definition of generic interfaces (abstraction layer) is crucial for such a long lifetime project and makes it ready for future adaptations to new plotting, processing and GUI libraries. The MINT application is based upon the development of an independent plotting library, which acts as a wrapper to the underlying graphical library. This allows scientists and engineers to develop their own specific tools, which are immune to changes of graphical library. The development based on Python uses Qt5 as the visual backend.

Daiquiri is a web based User Interface (UI) framework for control system monitoring and data acquisition. It provides simple, intuitive, and responsive interfaces to control and monitor hardware, launch acquisition sequences, and manage associated metadata. Daiquiri concerns itself only with the UI layer, it does not provide a scan engine or controls system but can be easily integrated with existing systems. Daiquiri is implemented with a traditional client / server methodology with the intention of producing a generic extensible framework for acquisition. The server is implemented in Python 3 and provides a REST API and SocketIO service for real-time feedback. The client is implemented in javascript es6 making use of the popular front end framework React along with Redux. Daiquiri is currently deployed on the scanning X-ray microscope beamline ID21, as well as the BioSAXS beamline BM29 [1], and will be extended to BM23, ID24, ID27, and BM18. In the future daiquiri will be the standard interface by which users and scientists interact with the controls system on beamlines at ESRF.

MACE Scheduler software generates automated schedule for the observations of preloaded high energy gamma-ray sources. The paper presents the design of MACE Scheduler software covering; source rise/set time calculation algorithms; auto and manual schedule generation; various data visualizations provided for schedule and source visibility reports. The schedule generation for a specific period is automated using a filter workflow. The sources are selected for scheduling by processing the sources through a series of customizable user defined filters; source visibility filter, priority filter, priority resolution filter. The workflow provides flexibility to apply any user tailored filter criteria that can be loaded dynamically using XML schema. Loosely coupled design allowed decoupling the astronomical timing calculation algorithms from schedule preparation workflow. Scheduler provides metro UI based interface for source filtering workflow generating auto-schedule, updating the generated schedules. Tree-map visualization helped to represent hierarchical multi-dimensional schedule information for the selected date range. WPF flat UI control templates focused more on content than chrome
