The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is based on a continuous-wave superconducting heavy ion linac to accelerate all the stable isotopes to above 200 MeV/u. The anticipated beam power is 400 kW, being approximately two-to-three orders of magnitude higher than those of operating heavy-ion facilities. The FRIB Project entered into full construction phase recently. This report summarizes the current design and construction status.

Status Report on the SPIRAL2 Facility at GANIL
240


 

E. Petit
                       GANIL, Caen, France

 


 

The GANIL SPIRAL2 project is based on the construction of a superconducting ion CW LINAC with two experimental areas named S3 ('Super Separator Spectrometer') and NFS ('Neutron For Science'). This status will report the construction of the facility and the first beam commissioning results. The perspectives of the SPIRAL2 project, with the future construction of the low energy RIB experimental hall called DESIR and with the construction of a new injector with q/A>1/6 or 1/7, will also be presented.

The strong-focusing cyclotron is an isochronous sector cyclotron in which slot-geometry superconducting half-cell cavities are used to provide sufficient energy gain per turn to fully separate orbits and superconducting quadrupoles are located in the aperture of each sector dipole to provide strong focusing and control betatron tune. The SFC offers the possibility to address the several effects that most limit beam current in a CW cyclotron: space charge, bunch-bunch interactions, resonance-crossing, and wake fields. Simulation of optical transport and beam dynamics entails several new challenges: the combined-function fields in the sectors must be properly treated in a strongly curving geometry, and the strong energy gain induces continuous mixing of horizontal betatron and synchrotron phase space. We present a systematic simulation of optical transport using modified versions of MAD-X and SYNERGIA. We report progress in introducing further elements that will set the stage for studying dynamics of high-current bunches.

The Reaccelerator (ReA) Facility at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) located at Michigan State University (MSU) offers the low-energy nuclear science community unique capabilities to explore wider ranges of nuclear reactions and the structure of exotic nuclei. Future sensitive time-of-flight experiments on ReA will require the widening of pulse separation for improved temporal resolution in single bunch detection while minimizing loss of rare isotopes and cleaning of beam decay products that might pollute measurements. In this proceedings, we present a preliminary design of a heavy ion ring that will address the task of bunch compression, bunch separation enhancement, satellite bunches elimination, cleaning of decay products, beam loss mitigation, and improvement of beam transmission.
