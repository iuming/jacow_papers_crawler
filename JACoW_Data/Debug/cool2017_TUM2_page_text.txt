The new accelerator complex NICA is designed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR, Dubna, Russia) to do experiment with ion-ion and ion-proton collision in the range energy 1-4.5 GeV/u. The planned luminosity in these experiments is 1027cm-2c{-1}. This value can be obtained with help of very short bunches with small transverse size. This beam quality can be realized with electron and stochastic cooling at energy of the physics experiment. The subject of the report is the problem of the technical feasibility of fast electron cooling for collider in the energy range between 0.2 and 2.5 MeV. For the realization of the cooler device BINP team proposes the design that is like to COSY cooler. The main features of this design are the accelerating tube immersed in the magnetic field along the whole length and the strong magnetic field in the cooling section. The physics of electron cooling is based on the idea of the fast magnetized cooling when the ion interacts with Larmour circle and the cooling decrements are improved significantly. The cooling force at strong magnet field was measured at many experiments and can be surely estimated.

The 2 MeV electron cooler allows for cooling the proton and deuteron beams in the entire energy range of COSY and thereby study magnetized high energy electron cooling for the HESR and NICA. Manual electron beam adjustment in the high energy, high current regime proves a cumbersome and time consuming task. Special difficulties are presented by the particular geometry of the e-beam transport channel, limited beam diagnostics and general technical limitations. A model has been developed to track electrons through the transport channel of the cooler. This allows the offline study of response schemes around any particular setting of the cooler. It is envisaged to control linear, dipole and quadrupole behavior of the e-beam. Application of the model will result in optimized e-beam transport settings for a lossless and cool beam transport. This will improve cooling and recuperation efficiency and allow quick adjustment of the e-beam to the various operational modes of the machine. A good relative agreement of the model and the cooler could be shown. Main focus lies now in overhauling the software and finding suitable initial conditions to improve the agreement to an absolute degree.

A turbine driven high voltage section for manetized d.c. electron coolers may offer considerable advantages. This project is pursued in collaboration of BINP and Helmholtzinstitut Mainz. A 600kV prototype has seen first tests and will be installed in a pressurized tank at HIM in 2018. An outlook to further developments will be given.
