The SC program at IHEP of NRC Â“Kurchatov InstituteÂ” has been developed intensively in the 1980ies in the framework of the UNK project. More than a hundred of models of the SC magnets of various designs, and then the pilot batch consisting of 25 full-scale dipoles and 4 quadrupoles have been designed, manufactured and tested at IHEP. Two SC magnetic systems of Electron Lens for the Tevatron collider were developed, manufactured, shipped and successfully brought into operation. Development of fast-cycling SC magnets for the FAIR project is discussed. Racetrack coils from HTS-2G tape for electrical machines that were developed, manufactured and tested are reported. Test and trial results with HTS dipole magnets employing Bi2223 as well as second-generation HTS are also reviewed.

The development for superconducting accelerators has been started at TRIUMF in 2000. The main milestones and material implementations are: 2006 - commissioning of Phase-I of the heavy ion superconducting accelerator ISAC-II, 2010 - Phase-II, 2014 - commissioning of Phase-I of the superconducting electron linear accelerator eLinac. We are using the accumulated experience and resources for farther SRF development at TRIUMF and external projects VECC, RISP, FRIB and SLAC. TRIUMF is also running fundamental studies for SRF and educational program for universities. Status of Superconducting ISAC-II and eLinac accelerators and SRF development aspects, results and plans are discussed.
