The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is based upon a high power heavy ion driver linac under construction at Michigan State University under a cooperative agreement with the US DOE. The construction of conventional facilities already started in the summer, 2013, and the accelerator production began from the summer, 2014. FRIB will accelerate all the stable ion beams from proton to uranium beyond a beam energy of 200 MeV/u and up to a beam power of 400 kW to produce a great number of various rare isotopes using SRF linac. The FRIB SRF driver linac makes use of four kinds of SRF structures. Totally 332 two gap cavities and 48 cryomodules are needed. All SRF hardware components have been validated and are now moving to production. The SRF infrastructure also has been constructed in MSU campus. This talk will present FRIB project and challenges regarding SRF technologies. The status of SRF linac hardware validation and their production, SRF infrastructure status and plan shall be addressed. The information that can be relevant for future large scale proton/ion SRF linacs will also be provided.

The superconducting accelerator of the European XFEL consists of the injector part and the main linac. The injector includes one 1.3 GHz accelerator module and one 3.9 GHz third-harmonic module, while the main linac will consist of 100 accelerator modules, operating at an average design gradient of 23.6 MV/m. The fabrication and surface treatment by industry as well as RF acceptance tests of the required 808 superconducting 1.3 GHz cavities are close to an end by the time of SRF15. The accelerator module assembly, testing and installation in the tunnel is in full swing. First steps of commissioning have been made. The status and results of cavity and module RF tests at 1.3 GHz and 3.9 GHz are presented.

Construction of the RISP heavy ion accelerator facility is in progress in Korea. The driver linac is a superconducting linac that can accelerate uranium to proton beams, delivering 400 kW beam power to various targets. Prototyping and test of the superconducting cavities and cryomodules are proceeding. Prototype superconducting cavities were fabricated through domestic vendors and their vertical tests were performed in collaboration with TRIUMF. Vertical tests showed good performance of the prototype cavities, which verified that there were no significant issues of the cavity design and fabrication. SRF Test Facility is under construction to be completed by early 2016. Progress report of the RAON accelerator systems is presented.
