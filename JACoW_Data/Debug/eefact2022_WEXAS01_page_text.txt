The EIC is a major new project under construction at BNL in partnership with JLab. It relies upon a number of new SRF cavities at 197 MHz, 394 MHz, 591 MHz and 1773 MHz to pre-bunch, accelerate, cool and crab the stored beams. R&D is focusing on the 591 MHz elliptical cavity and 197 MHz crab cavity first as these are the most challenging. Preliminary designs of these cavities are presented along with an R&D status report. To avoid developing multiple different cryostats a modular approach is adopted using a high degree of commonality of parts and systems. This approach may be easily adapted to other frequencies and applications.

SuperKEKB aims for high luminosity on the order of 1035 cm-2s-1 with high beam currents of 2.6 A for electron and 3.6 A for positron to search a new physics beyond the Standard Model in the B meson regime. In recent operations, we achieved new record of the luminosity of 4.7x1034 cm-2s-1 with 1.1 A for electron and 1.3 A for positron. The RF system that is basically reused from KEKB is operating stably in the high current operation owing to the measures against to large beam power and HOM power. To cope with the large beam power, it has been increased the number of klystrons that drive only one normal conducting cavity (ARES) and reinforced the input couplers of ARES. As a measure against HOM power, the additional HOM dampers have been installed to superconducting cavities. One-third of LLRF control systems have been replaced with newly developed digital system to improve accuracy and flexibility. New damper system for coupled bunch instability expected in high current has been installed to new digital system. In this report, operation status of RF system under the high current operation will be presented.

High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), a 6 GeV diffraction-limited synchrotron light source, is currently under construction. The double-frequency RF system is being developed to deliver 5.4 MV of RF voltage and 900 kW of beam power with an active third harmonic system. The prototypes of the higher-order-mode-damped 166.6 MHz quarter-wave superconducting cavities, as well as the first 499.8 MHz harmonic superconducting cavity, have been fabricated and vertical tested, while the cryomodules for these cavities are being developed. Following the success of the prototype 166.6 MHz 260 kW and 499.8 MHz 150 kW solid-state power amplifiers, the series production has been launched. The new low-level RF control system based on Xilinx FPGA is in the prototyping phase and the first lab test results fulfill the HEPS requirements. The installation of the booster RF system will be launched in Fall 2022. This paper presents the status and progress of the RF system for HEPS.
