Several new accelerator projects are adopting superconducting accelerator technology. When accelerating cavities maintain high RF gradients, field emission, the emission of electrons from cavity walls, can occur and may impact operational cavity gradient, radiological environment via activated components, and reliability. In this talk, we will discuss instrumented measurements of field emission from the two 1.1 GeV superconducting continuous wave (CW) linacs in CEBAF. The goal is to improve the understanding of field emission sources originating from cryomodule production, installation and operation. Such basic knowledge is needed in guiding field emission control, mitigation, and reduction toward high gradient and reliable operation of superconducting accelerators.

The first km of the 3-km SLAC linac is being replaced by LCLS-2, a superconducting linac with continuous RF and a maximum beam rate of 1 MHz. The beam will have an energy of 4 GeV and a maximum power of 250 kW, with an upgrade to 8 GeV and 1 MW in planning. The beam will be transported through the accelerator tunnel, passing over the future 1-km FACET-2 and the existing 1-km LCLS linacs, both using normal-conducting copper cavities at repetition rates of up to 120 Hz. The LCLS and LCLS-2 beams will continue together through the Beam Transport Hall to two new undulators, for hard and soft x rays. Kickers will direct individual pulses to either undulator or to a dump. The high power in the beam and potentially in cavity field emission necessitate integrating losses over 500 ms but responding within 0.1 ms. A capacitor for integration and a comparator for the threshold give a simple and robust approach over a wide dynamic range. We plan both long loss monitors covering regions of typically 100 m and point monitors. In regions with two or more beamlines, the system will attempt to determine the line that caused a loss, so that only one is shut off.

Resonant Spin Depolarization is a high precision technique for beam energy measurement employed in the Diamond Light Source storage ring. The relation between spin tune and beam energy can be used to determine the energy of a transversely polarized beam. Vertical oscillations excite the beam at frequencies that match the fractional part of the spin tune and the beam loss rate is used to monitor the beam depolarization. However, the standard procedure of these measurements is intrusive and not compatible with user operation of a light source. The Advanced Resonant Spin Depolarization (AdReSD) project aims to extend and improve the method with the goal of making the measurements compatible with the user operation, for instance by acting only on a small fraction of the stored beam. As a first step, we are investigating the beam loss monitors that will be used to detect beam depolarization. The material, location and optimal geometry of the detector to capture the largest fraction of the radiation footprint resulting from beam losses are studied. Results and designs are presented and future work is discussed.

The low energy RHIC Electron Cooler (LEReC) will be operating with the electron beams having up to 140 kW power. It was determined that the missteered electron beam can damage the vacuum chamber and in-vacuum components within 20 us. We protect our accelerator against such a catastrophic scenario by a dedicated machine protection system (MPS). In this paper we describe the current status of the LEReC MPS work. We consider our experience with the commissioning and operation of the scaled down MPS system used for the LEReC gun test beamline and discuss the work on the MPS designed for the commissioning of the full LEReC accelerator.
