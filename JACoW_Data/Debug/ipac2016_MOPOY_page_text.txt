MedAustron is a medical accelerator facility for hadron therapy cancer treatment using protons and carbon ions. The Synchrotron is driven by a 0.47-3.26 MHz Finemet® loaded wideband cavity powered by 12x 1kW solid state amplifiers connected to a digital Low Level RF system. It was developed in collaboration with CERN and put to operation at MedAustron in early 2014. The main Synchrotron RF (sRF )commissioning steps for proton beams involved the setup of the adiabatic capture process, the setup of the frequency and voltage ramps and feedback loops for fast acceleration and the RF jump for extraction. The adiabatic capture process was optimized in terms of energy and voltage mismatch by analyzing longitudinal empty bucket scans after beam injection into the synchrotron. The acceleration ramp optimization was based on calculations using a software tool developed in-house and adapted experimentally to minimize losses at injection and during acceleration. This paper provides an overview of the acceleration system and describes the commissioning process of the sRF system and the related beam commissioning efforts at MedAustron.

The High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) is part of the upcoming Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) placed in Darmstadt (Germany). The HESR is designed for antiprotons with a momentum range from 1.5 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c, but will as well be suitable to provide heavy ion beams with a momentum range from approximately 0.6 GeV/c to 5.8 GeV/c. To guarantee smooth operation it is crucial to verify and improve the design with beam-dynamics simulations. Particularly the dynamic aperture is calculated as a measure of quality. Complementary to previous beam dynamics calculations based on frequency map analysis*, the dynamic aperture is calculated using a variant of the Lyapunov exponent. The first bending and focusing magnets have been delivered and the magnetic fields measured recently. So the modeled assumptions regarding the multipole imperfections of these elements are now replaced by values based on measurements. This contribution contains the inclusion of the measured values as well as the the tracking-based dynamic aperture calculations.

We have designed a compact proton synchrotron(7~230 MeV) for applications like proton therapy and space environment study. These applications may require slow extraction from 10~230 MeV. Traditionally, the low energy beam(10~70 MeV) is achieved by energy degradation from high energy beam which may cause beam lose and energy spread increase, because the beam quality may suffer from magnetic remanence, power ripple and strong space charge effects in low energy stage. To achieve high quality beam directly from resonance extraction, we study these effects by performing multi-particle simulation. Methods of improving beam quality are discussed.

The accelerators of the LHC injector chain need to be upgraded to provide the HL-LHC beams. The PS Booster, the first synchrotron in the LHC injection chain, uses three different RF systems (first, second and up to tenth harmonic) in each of its four rings. As part of the LHC Injector Upgrade the current ferrite RF systems will be replaced with broadband Finemet cavities, increasing the flexibility of the RF system. A Finemet test cavity has been installed in Ring 4 to investigate its effect on machine performance, especially beam stability, during extensive experimental studies. Due to large space charge impedance Landau damping is lost through most of the cycle in single harmonic operation, but is recovered when using the second harmonic and controlled longitudinal emittance blow-up. This paper compares beam parameters during acceleration with and without the Finemet test cavity. Comparisons were made using beam measurements and simulations with the BLonD code based on a full PS Booster impedance model. This work, together with simulations of future operation, have provided input for the decision to adopt a fully Finemet RF system.

In case a Future Circular Collider for hadrons (FCC-hh) is constructed at CERN, the tunnels for SPS, LHC and the 100 km collider will be available to house a High Energy Booster (HEB). The different machine options cover a large technology range from an iron-dominated machine in the 100 km tunnel to a superconducting machine in the SPS tunnel. Using a modified LHC as reference, these options are compared with respect to their energy reach, magnet technology and filling time of the collider. Potential issues with beam transfer, reliability and beam stability are presented.

The Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring (ELENA) is a small 30 m circumference synchroton under construction at CERN to further decelerate antiprotons from the Antiproton Decelerator AD from 5.3 MeV to 100 keV. Controlled deceleration in a synchrotron equipped with an electron cooler to reduce emittances in all three planes will allow the existing AD experiments to increase substantially their antiproton capture efficiencies and render new experiments possible. Installation of the machine and lines needed for the commissioning of the ring are ongoing and commissioning is expected to start around mid-2016. The aim is to complete ELENA ring commissioning in November followed by the installation of new electrostatic transfer lines to existing experiments until autumn 2017. Status of ELENA installations and preparations for commissioning will be reported.

Fermilab has recently completed an upgrade to the complex with the goal of delivering 700 kW of beam power as 120 GeV protons to the NuMI target. A major part of boosting beam power is to use the Fermilab Recycler to stack protons. Simulations focusing on the betatron resonance stopbands are presented taking into account different effects such as intensity and chromaticity. Simulations are compared with measurements.

Impedance could represent a limitation of running high intensity bunches in the Fermilab recycler. With high intensity upgrades foreseen, it is important to quantify the impedance. To do this, studies have been performed measuring the tune shift as a function of bunch intensity allowing the transverse impedance to be derived.

Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) is Fermilab's plan for providing powerful, high-intensity proton beams to the laboratory's experiments. Upgrades are foreseen for the recycler which will cope with bunches containing fifty percent more beam. Of particular concern is large space charge tune shifts caused by the intensity increase. Simulations performed using Synergia are detailed focusing on the space charge footprint.

The PIP-II project will replace the existing 400 MeV linac with a new, CW-capable, 800 MeV superconducting one. With respect to current operations, a 50% increase in beam intensity in the rapid cycling Booster synchrotron is expected. Booster batches are combined in the Recycler ring; this process limits the allowed longitudinal emittance of the extracted Booster beam. To suppress eddy currents, the Booster has no beam pipe; magnets are evacuated, exposing the beam to core laminations and this has a substantial impact on the longitudinal impedance. Noticeable longitudinal emittance growth is already observed at transition crossing. Operation at higher intensity will likely necessitate mitigation measures. We describe systematic efforts to construct a predictive model for current operating conditions. A longitudinal only code including a laminated wall impedance model, space charge effects, and feedback loops is developed. Parameter validation is performed using detailed measurements of relevant beam, rf and control parameters. An attempt is made to benchmark the code at operationally favorable machine settings.

As an injector to the future FAIR facility, the UNILAC accelerator is required to deliver ion beams with high intensities as well as good beam quality. The electrodes of the current HSI RFQ are exhausted and the current RFQ itself is assigned to be one bottle-neck for improving the brilliance performance of the whole linac. Based on the so-called NFSP (New Four-Section Procedure) method, a new RFQ electrode design has been developed and optimized for 20 emA, U4+ beams at the RFQ entrance. Since only the electrodes will be replaced, the RFQ length has been kept unchanged. Even with a lowered inter-vane voltage, the new RFQ design has achieved better beam performance compared to the previous design. This paper will focus on the performed study with respect to beam dynamics.

In order to meet the requirements on beam parameters for the upcoming FAIR facility at GSI, the injector linac UNILAC will be upgraded. The activities comprise development of the sources for stable provision of intense uranium beams at a repetition rate of 2.7 Hz, a revision of the beam dynamics layout of the 120 keV/u RFQ, the replacement of the matching section to the 1.4 MeV/u pre-stripper DTL, and enhancement of the gaseous stripping section efficiency. This section shall also include a round-to-flat emittance adaptor to prepare the beam for injection into the synchrotron SIS18 which has a flat transverse injection acceptance. Finally, the upgrade includes the complete replacement of the 40 year old 11.4 MeV/u Alvarez-type post-stripper DTL with a new DTL, preferably using Alvarez-type cavities with improved beam focusing features, as well as its rf-power alimentations.

In Darmstadt / Germany the existing accelerator cite GSI is expanding to one of the biggest joint research projects worldwide: FAIR, a new antiproton and ion research facility with so far unmatched intensities and quality. The existing accelerators will be used as pre-accelerators and therefor need to be upgraded to fulfill the requirements with respect for intensity and beam quality. In a first step the 9.2 m long 36 MHz-HSI-RFQ for high current beams will get new electrodes to reach the specific frequency, to allow a higher electric strength and to avoid unwanted multipole components. Therefor several simulations with CST MWS have been done. The parameters and results of the RF-design will be presented.

In the field of Super Heavy Elements (SHE) a superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) high intensity heavy ion LINAC is highly desirable. Currently a multi-stage R&D program conducted by GSI, HIM and IAP* is in progress. The baseline linac design composes a high performance ion source, a new low energy beam transport line, a (cw) upgraded High Charge State Injector (HLI), and a matching line (1.4 MeV/u) followed by the new sc-DTL LINAC for acceleration up to 7.3 MeV/u. The commissioning of the first CH cavity (Demonstrator), in a horizontal cryo module with beam is a major milestone in 2016**. The advanced demonstrator comprises constant-beta sc Crossbar-H-mode (CH) cavities operated at 217 MHz. Presently, the first two sc CH cavities of the advanced demonstrator are under construction at Research Instruments (RI), Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. A string of cavities and focusing elements build from several short CH-cavities with 8 gaps, without girders is recommended. The new design potentially reduces the overall technical risks during the fabrication and the pressure sensitivity through stiffening brackets. The present status of the first two sc cavities will be presented.

Within the scope of the FAIR project (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) at GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, the front end of the existing High Charge State Injector (HLI) is planned to be upgraded for cw operation. The required newly revised 4-Rod RFQ structure is currently being designed at the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) of the Goethe University of Frankfurt. It will be operated with a 100 kW power amplifier at 108 MHz. At first instance a dedicated 4-stem prototype, which is based on the RFQ design for MYRRHA* and FRANZ**, is planned to be manufactured in order to validate the simulated RF performance, thermal behavior and mechanical characteristics in continuous operation. The RF simulations as well as basic thermal simulations are done using CST Studio Suite. In order to prevent oscillations of the electrodes mechanical eigenmodes are analyzed using ANSYS Multiphysics. In addition the ANSYS software allows more sophisticated simulations regarding the cooling capability by considering fluid dynamics in water cooling channels, thus providing a more detailed thermal analysis.

A new continuous wave (cw) linac is required to deliver high intensity heavy ion beams for Super Heavy Element (SHE) future experiments at GSI Darmstadt, Germany. The presented upgrade measures are dedicated to improve the performance of the cw demonstrator setup. The key component is a cryomodule comprising a superconducting (sc) 217 MHz Crossbar-H-mode (CH) cavity surrounded by two sc 9.3T solenoids with compensation coils. The solenoid coil is made of a Nb3Sn wire; and the compensation coils at both ends of the solenoid comprises NbTi wires. The distance between solenoid lense and CH cavity has to be optimized for ideal beam matching as well as for a minimum rest field inside the cavity below the critical magnetic field. The GSI High Charge State (HLI) injector has to deliver a heavy ion beam with an energy of 1.4 MeV/u. Longitudinal matching to the demonstrator is provided by two 108.4 MHz cw room temperature λ/4 re-buncher cavity installed behind the HLI. In this paper electromagnetic simulations of the field optimization for the solenoids and the re-buncher cavities will be presented as well as first beam experiments at the beam transport line to the demonstrator cavity.

For future experiments with heavy ions near the coulomb barrier within the super-heavy element (SHE) research project a multi-stage R&D program of GSI, HIM and IAP is currently in progress. It aims at developing a superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) LINAC with multiple CH cavities as key components downstream the upgraded High Charge Injector (HLI) at GSI. The LINAC design is challenging, due to the requirement of intense beams in cw-mode up to a mass-to-charge-ratio of 6 while covering a broad output energy range from 3.5 to 7.3 MeV/u with minimum energy spread. The next milestone will be a full performance beam test of the first expansion stage at GSI, the Demonstrator, comprising two solenoids and a 15-gap CH cavity inside a cryostat.

In order to have an inexpensive alternative to 4-Vane RFQs above 200 MHz, we study the possibilities of a Ladder-RFQ. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the research program with cooled antiprotons at FAIR. This particular high frequency for an RFQ creates difficulties, which are challenging in developing a cavity. In order to define a satisfactory geometrical configuration for this resonator, both from the RF and the mechanical point of view, different designs have been examined and compared. Very promising results have been reached with a ladder type RFQ, which has been investigated since 2013. Due to its geometric size the manufacturing as well as maintenance is not that complex compared with welded accelerators. The manufacturing, coppering and assembling of a 0.8 m prototype RFQ is finished. We present recent measurements of the rf-field, frequency-tuning, field flatness and the mode spectrum.

A new facility to develop a proton linac based neutron source for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and various neutron science is planned at Okinawa institute of science and technology (OIST). This facility aims to develop a prototype system of the mass production model of BNCT systems as medical apparatus. The beam power and the beam energy at the neutron production target are assumed to about 60 kW and 10 MeV, respectively. The energy will be finally decided to optimize the ratio of necessary epi-thermal and other energy of neutron. If the energy is 10 MeV, 60 kW beam power can be achieved with a beam current of 30 mA and a duty factor of 20%. The linac consists of an ECR ion source, a two-solenoid-magnet LEBT, a four-vane RFQ, and an Alvarez DTL, which are very conventional as components of proton linac. To make the accelerator compact, we are considering to use a 400-MHz band resonant frequency. As a medical apparatus, it is required that the linac system is stable and operated easily without experts of accelerator. The design of proton linac is one of the most important issues in our development. In this paper, the baseline design of this OIST BNCT linac is described.

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is an accelerator-based neutron source being built at dongguan, Guangdong province in China. A conventional 324MHz Alvarez-type Drift tube linac (DTL) is utilized to accelerate an H− ion beam from 3MeV to 80MeV. The RF field tuning of DTL is necessary for compensating the unexpected error caused by manufacturing and assembling. For reasons of RF power saving it is convenient to build a long DTL tank, but this choice involves risks of accelerating field instability. This problem can be fixed by using the resonant coupling stabilization method and equipping DTL cavities with a series of post-couplers. A practical tuning method was proposed, an acceptable field distribution with a good stability was achieved for CSNS DTL-1.

Superconducting linear accelerator is the tendency in linac design with the development of superconducting RF technology. Superconducting cavities used as accelerating section in low energy Hadron linac are more and more common. The 5MeV test stand of CADS accelerator Injector I is composed of an ion source, a LEBT, a 325MHz RFQ, a MEBT, a cryogenic module (CM1) of seven SC spoke cavities (β=0.12) , seven SC solenoids, seven cold BPMs and a beam dump. The phase and amplitude setting of superconducting cavity are very important at the operation of accelerator, so beam based measurement of cavity phase and amplitude is necessary. Beam based phase scan is the most simple and effective method. Because the significant velocity changes in superconducting cavity at low energy section, the effective voltage is changing with cavity phase, meanwhile the synchronous phase is non-linear with LLRF phase. Above two problem make the cavity phase determination difficult. New date fitting method is proposed to solve these problem in this paper. Some measurements of spoke cavities in the CADS CM1 are also presented.

The C-ADS accelerator is a CW (Continuous-Wave) proton linac with 1.5 GeV in beam energy, 10 mA in beam current, and 15 MW in beam power. CADS Injector-I accelerator is a 10-mA 10-MeV CW proton linac, which uses a 3.2-MeV normal conducting 4-Vane RFQ and superconducting single-spoke cavities for accelerating. The 5MeV test stand of CADS accelerator Injector I is composed of an ion source, a LEBT, a 325MHz RFQ, a MEBT, a cryogenic module (CM1) of seven SC spoke cavities (β=0.12) , seven SC solenoids, seven cold BPMs and a beam dump. Emittance measurement is very important for the understanding of beam behavior and matching to the next accelerating section. Detailed emittance measurement with double-slit method after CM1 are presented in this paper.

Wire Scanners (WS) are used to measure beam profile and calculate the transverse Twiss parameters at the entrance of MEBT1 in the CADS injector I test stand. As to data process, the traditional method with transfer map doesn't consider the space charge effect. But, as we know, space charge effect can't be neglected for high intensity accelerators. In this paper, optimization algorithm is used in beam emittance measurement.

A Low Energy Accelerator Facility (LEAF) was launched as a pre-research facility for High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF). The LEAF consists of a 2-mA U34+ electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) type ion source with 300-kV extraction voltage, a low energy beam transport (LEBT) line with a multi-harmonic buncher (MHB), a CW 81.25MHz radio frequency quad-rupole (RFQ) accelerator which could accelerate heavy ions from 14 keV/u up to 500 keV/u, a triplet magnet for medium energy beam transport and an experimental platform for nuclear physics. After describing the selected structure, an octagonal cavity with π-mode stabilizing loop (PISL) type structure was adopted and simulated.

The RAON accelerator utilizes the low energy and high energy superconducting linacs for the acceleration of the stable ion beams and the rare isotope beams. The low energy superconducting linac is composed of the quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and the half-wave resonator (HWR) cavities, and the high energy superconducting linac consists of two kinds of single-spoke resonator (SSR) cavities. In the beam commissioning, the tuning of these superconducting cavities is a significant issue to achieve the targeted beam energy and to avoid the deterioration of the beam quality. In this paper, we will present the tuning program based on the phase scan tuning algorithm for the superconducting cavity amplitude and phase in the RAON accelerator and describe the simulation results.

The RISP (Rare Isotope Science Project) has been proposed as a multi-purpose accelerator facility for providing beams of exotic rare isotopes of various energies. It can deliver ions from proton to uranium. Proton and uranium ions are accelerated upto 600 MeV and 200 MeV/u respectively. The facility consists of three superconducting linacs of which superconducting cavities are independently phased. Requirement of the linac design is especially high for acceleration of multiple charge beams. In this paper, we present the RISP linac design, the prototyping of superconducting cavity and cryomodule.

KOMAC has been operating two beam lines for user service since 2013. A new beam line was completed in 2015 for radioisotope production and has a plan to be commissioned in 2016. Another beam line was proposed to supply low flux beam to users. The maximum energy and average current are 100 MeV and 10 nA. The beam line consists of collimator, energy degrader, dipole magnet for energy separation and octupole magnet for uniform beam production. In this paper, the design of the beam line and its components is presented.

The new accelerator complex Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is now under development and construction at JINR. New complex is assumed to operate using two injectors: the Alvarez-type linac LU-20 as injector of light ions, polarized protons and deuterons and a new linac HILac of heavy ions. Now the modernization of LU-20 is also realized and old pulse DC injector is planning to replace by RFQ linac. New RFQ linac was developed and manufactured and is now under commissioning at Nuclotron injectors hall. New results of RFQ linac resonator testing and measurements, RF power load and linac testing with deuterium and carbon beam will discuss in this report.

The new accelerator complex Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is now under development and construction at JINR. Existing Alvarez-type DTL linac LU-20 is now operates as injector of light ions, polarized protons and deuterons to Nuclotron for LHEP experimental program. It provides proton beam of 20 MeV energy and light ions of 5 MeV/u energy. In 2015 the cascade transformer 800 kV which is pre-accelerator of LU-20 had been replaced by the new RFQ linac (energy 155 keV for ions with Z/A<0.5). The proposal on Alvarez linac LU-20 upgrade by a superconducting light ion linac with energy up to 50 MeV is discussed in this report.

The European Spallation Source, ESS, uses a linear accelerator to bombard the tungsten target with the high intensity protons beam for producing intense beams of neutrons. The nominal average beam power of the linac is 5~MW with a peak beam power at target of 125~MW. This paper focuses on the beam dynamics design of the ESS linac and the diagnostics elements used for the tuning of the lattice and matching between sections.

Although modern high power proton machines can now routinely deliver MW level operating powers, the next generation accelerators will be required to reach powers orders of magnitude higher. Significant developments will be needed both in technology and in understanding the limits of high intensity operation. The present study investigates the beam dynamics in three experimental linac designs when the beam intensity is increased above current levels such that for CW regimes, beam powers of up to 400 MW can be attained. In the first, a 1 A proton beam is accelerated to 400 MeV using normal conducting structures. In the second, a comparison is made when two front ends accelerate 0.5 A beams to ~20 MeV where they are funnelled to 1 A and accelerated to 400 MeV. Similarly, in the third, two 0.25 A beams are funnelled to 0.5 A and then accelerated in superconducting structures to 800 MeV. In addition, alternative unconventional methods of generating high current beams are also discussed. The further studies that are needed to be undertaken in the future are outlined, but it is considered that the three linac configurations found are sufficiently promising for detailed technical designs to follow.

Accurate knowledge of the longitudinal profile of the bunch is important in the context of linear colliders, wake-field accelerators and for the next generation of light sources. As a result the non-destructive, single-shot evaluation of the profile is one of the challenging problems which can be addressed via spectral analysis of coherent radiation generated by a charged particle bunch. To reconstruct the bunch profile from the spectrum the phase retrieval problem has to be solved. Frequently applied methods, e.g. minimal phase retrieval or other iterative algorithms, are reliable if the Blaschke phase contribution is negligible. This is neither known a priori nor can it be assumed to apply to an arbitrary bunch profile. We present a novel approach which gives reproducible, most-probable and stable reconstructions for bunch profiles that would otherwise remain unresolved by the existing techniques. The algorithm proposed uses the output of Kramers-Kronig minimum phase as both initial and boundary conditions, providing a unique solution. To assure a converging solution, new conditions linked to the independently known experimental data such as beam charge were introduced.

Typical front-ends of modern light-ion high-intensity accelerators typically consist of an ion source, a Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a Radiofrequency Quadrupole and a Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT), which is followed by the main linac accelerating structures. Over the years, many LEBTs have been designed, constructed and operated very successfully. In this paper, we present the guiding principles and compromises that lead to the design choices of the PXIE LEBT, including the rationale for a beam line that allows un-neutralized transport over a significant portion of the LEBT whether the beam is pulsed or DC.

The FRIB superconducting linac will deliver all heavy ion beams with energy above 200 MeV/u, and beam power on target up to 400 kW for generation of short lived isotopes. Beam commissioning is the first step to prepare and tune the superconducting linac for high power operation. A staged beam commissioning plan of the FRIB linac is developed, and complete beam tuning practices segment by segment through the entire linac are introduced, which include phase scan signature matching of the superconducting cavities, longitudinal beam matching, transverse matching with horizontal-vertical beam coupling, and beam optics corrections of achromatic and isochronous folding segments up to the second order for acceleration and transport of multi charge state beams.

Turkish Atomic Energy Authority is working on building an experimental proton beamline with local resources at the Saraykoy Nuclear Research and Training Center (SANAEM). Manufacturing of the radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) was started after the beam dynamics and 3D electromagnetic simulation studies were performed. The vanes were machined with a three axis CNC machine. A CMM was used for the acceptance tests of the vanes and also for assembling. Production and assembly results were found acceptable for this cavity, the very first one developed in Turkey. Copper plating was performed by electroplating the aluminum vanes. The plated vanes were bolted and bonded with eight screws, eight pins and two different adhesives. A silver paste was used for RF sealing and a low vapor pressure epoxy was used for vacuum isolation. First LLRF tests of the RFQ were done with a bead-pull setup and a VNA. A N-type RF coupler and a pick-up were used for the LLRF tests. Phase shift method was used for the bead-pull tests. Cavity quality factor was measured with 3dB method for different RF sealing stages. This study summarizes the machining, assembling and the first LLRF tests of the SANAEM RFQ.

The 200 MeV H− Linac has been operational for the last 45 years providing beam for the physics and isotope programs. Currently we are upgrading the Linac for improved reliability and integrated intensity. Recently we replaced the 7651 tubes with solid-state RF amplifiers. In addition, the low level RF system and Timing system were upgraded and new beam loss monitors were installed that is sensitive at low-energies and to neutrons. We have a plan for future upgrades to the vacuum, Controls, diagnostics and power supply systems. In order to achieve higher average current for the isotope program, it is plan to increase the beam pulse length from 450 us to 900 us. This will require modifications to the RF and all pulse power supply systems.

With increasing the intensities of heavy ion beams in synchrotrons, charge related beam loss become more and more significant. In order to reduce space charge forces and to minimize the incoherent tune spread, the charge state of heavy Ions shall be lowered. Thus the cross section for charge related beam loss is further enhanced. For the FAIR project, GSI has developed a number of different technologies to stabilize the dynamic residual gas pressure and thereby to minimize charge related beam loss at high intensity heavy ion operation. Technologies suitable for such issues are, dedicated lattice structures, cold and warm ion catchers, NEG coated and cryogenic magnet chambers and cryo-adsorption pumps.

Qualification of the materials is among the important challenges for a fusion reactor. Working in tandem with the present need that recognizes the value of evaluating fusion reactor materials, Institute for Plasma Research has initiated the 'Development of RFQ for Accelerators' project, which will provide a neutronic facility for material qualification in a relatively larger scale. The facility will consist of an high intensity ECR ion (H+/D+) source coupled to Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) Accelerator through a LEBT system to produce 5 MeV, 40 mA deuterium ions to fulfil the objectives. Further upgrade in the beam energy and current is also foreseen to suit the facility requirement. A four vane type copper RFQ @352.2 MHz frequency with transmission efficiency of ≈ 96% has been designed to accelerate deutrons upto 1 MeV energy as a demonstration of the RFQ functioning and controls. Through LEBT system, deuterons are then focused into RFQ using weak beam focalization method. The harmonization of the vane tips design and manufacturing constraints has been part of the study to have a near realistic engineering design. Design and analysis of RFQ will be discussed.

The IFMIF aims to provide an accelerator-based, D-Li neutron source to produce high energy neutrons at sufficient intensity. Part of the BA agreement (Japan-EURATOM), the goal of the IFMIF/EVEDA project is to work on the engineering design of IFMIF and to validate the main technological challenges which includes a 125mA CW D+ accelerator up to 9 MeV mainly designed and manufactured in Europe. The components are in an advanced stage of manufacturing. The first components which allow the production of a 140 mA-100 keV deuteron beam have been delivered, installed and under commissioning at Rokkasho. The second phase (100 keV to 5 MeV) will end by March 2017. The third phase (short pulse) and forth phase (cw) will be the integrated commissioning of the LIPAc up to 9 MeV. The duration of the project has been recently extended up to end 2019 to allow the commissioning and operation of the whole accelerator (1MW). The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the LIPAc, currently under commissioning in Japan, to outline the engineering design and the development of the key components, as well as the expected outcomes of the engineering work, associated with the experimental program.

In preparation of the SPS as an LHC injector its impedance was significantly reduced in 1999 - 2000. A new SPS impedance reduction campaign is planned now for the High Luminosity (HL)-LHC project, which requires bunch intensities twice as high as the nominal one. One of the known intensity limitations is a longitudinal multi-bunch instability with a threshold 3 times below this operational intensity. The instability is presently cured using the 4th harmonic RF system and controlled emittance blow-up, but reaching the HL-LHC parameters cannot be assured without improving the machine impedance. Recently the impedance sources responsible for this instability were identified and implementation of their shielding and damping is foreseen during the next long shutdown (2019 - 2020) in synergy with two other important upgrades: amorphous carbon coating of (part of) the vacuum chamber against the e-cloud effect and rearrangement of the 200 MHz RF system. In this paper the strategy of impedance reduction is presented together with beam intensity achievable after its realisation. The potential effect of other proposals on remaining limitations is also considered.

A massive improvement program of the LHC injector chain is presently being conducted under the LIU project. For the proton chain, this includes the replacement of Linac2 with Linac4 as well as all necessary upgrades to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), aimed at producing beams with the challenging High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) parameters. Regarding the heavy ions, plans to improve the performance of Linac3 and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) are also pursued under the general LIU program. The full LHC injection chain returned to operation after Long Shutdown 1, with extended beam studies taking place in Run 2. A general project Cost and Schedule Review also took place in March 2015, and several dedicated LIU project reviews were held to address issues awaiting pending decisions. In view of these developments, 2014 and 2015 have been key years to define a number of important aspects of the final LIU path. This paper will describe the reviewed LIU roadmap and revised performance objectives of the main upgrades, including the work status and outlook in terms of the required installation and commissioning stages.

The new g-2 experiment at Fermilab aims to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment to a precision of ±0.14 ppm ─ a fourfold improvement over the 0.54 ppm precision obtained in the g-2 BNL E821experiment. Achieving this goal requires the delivery of highly polarized 3.094 GeV/c muons with a narrow ±0.5% Δp/p acceptance to the g-2 storage ring. In this study, we describe a muon capture and transport scheme that should meet this requirement. First, we present the conceptual design of our proposed scheme wherein we describe its basic features. Then, we detail its performance numerically by simulating the pion production in the (g-2) production target, the muon collection by the downstream beamline optics as well as the beam polarization and spin-momentum correlation up to the storage ring. The sensitivity in performance of our proposed channel against key parameters such as magnet apertures and magnet positioning errors is analyzed
