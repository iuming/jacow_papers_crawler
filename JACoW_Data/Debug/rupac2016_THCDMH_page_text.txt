An increasing number of proton therapy facilities are being planned and built at hospital based centers. Many facilities use rotatable gantry beamlines to direct the proton or ion-beam at the patient from different angles. A key issue is the need to make future gantries lighter and more compact with the use of cryogen-free superconducting magnets, in particular for the final bending section which can be of large aperture. Benefits of using the superconducting technology are: (1) the possibility to have a large momentum acceptance, hence reducing the need to ramp the magnet and enabling new treatment techniques, (2) the size reduction due to a lower bend radius and (3) the weight reduction up to a factor ten. The latter will also significantly reduce the costs of the supporting structure. We present a conceptual design based on Nb3Sn superconducting combined function magnets (dipole, quadrupole, sextupole). The geometry using racetracks, the superconducting strand and cable parameters and the results of the thermal and the mechanical studies are reported. These magnets will work at a temperature of about 4.2 K cooled with cryocoolers.

Primary purpose of this experiment is the development of techniques to simplify and make cheaper the construction of the cryomodules. In the current ILC TDR design the helium vessel and the connected pipes are made of expensive titanium. JINR in association with INFN several designs for these transitions have been produced and studied during the last years. The results of measuring microhardness by Vickers microindentation are issued of ~3.8 GPa and the breaking strength was 375 MPa. Helium leak measurements revealed no leaks at a background leak rate of 0.4*10-10 atm*cc/s. For imitation of use transition sample in real working position, connected with Nb cavity, Nb rings were joint with Nb pipe of samples by EBW. Superposition of all residual stresses may result plastic deformation, failure of welds, and consequently occurrence of a leak. Test result of thermocycles in LHe and in the LN ussued absence of leak at background leak rate ~0.5*10-10 atm*cc/sec. The results showed the full eligibility of suggested design Nb+Ti+SS transition sample not for only Linear Collider, but for any cryogenic systems.

NICA is a new accelerator collider complex under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. The facility is aimed at providing collider experiments with heavy ions up to Gold in the center of mass energy from 4 to 11 GeV/u and an average luminosity up to 1*1027 cm-2 s−1 for Au79+. The collisions of polarized deuterons are also foreseen. The facility includes two injector chains, a new superconducting booster synchrotron, the existing 6 AGeV superconducting synchrotron Nuclotron, and a new superconducting collider consisting of two rings, each 503 m in circumference. The booster synchrotron is based on an iron-dominated "window frame"- type magnet with a hollow superconductor winding analogous to the Nuclotron magnet. The design of superconducting magnets for the NICA booster synchrotron is described. The progress of work on the manufacturing and testing of the magnets is discussed. The calculated and measured values of the characteristics of the magnets are presented. The status of the facility for serial test of superconducting magnets for the NICA and FAIR projects is described.

Based on a common R&D process GSI Darmstadt and JINR Dubna had optimized the operation parameters of their fast ramped accelerator magnets designated for the heavy ion synchrotron SIS100 of the FAIR project as well as for the booster synchrotron and the heavy ion collider of the NICA project. These facilities are now under construction and the series production of the main magnets and correctors for SIS100 and NICA booster was launched. In parallel the superconducting magnet test facilities were commissioned in both institutes. The quadrupole and corrector magnets of the SIS100 will be produced by JINR as a Russian In-Kind contribution to FAIR and cold tested at the common NICA test facility in Dubna. We summarize the main parameters of the optimized magnets related to the magnetic field quality and the cooling efficiency, present the first production experiences and test results and give an outlook on the overall project schedules.
