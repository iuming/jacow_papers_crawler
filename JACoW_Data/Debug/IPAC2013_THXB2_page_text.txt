This talk should review novel techniques and challenges for beam delivery systems with various beam scanning methods (such as 3D scanning, 4D scanning and so on) to conform the beam dose to the tumor shape in proton and carbon ion therapy, as developed by PSI, GSI, HIMAC, IMP etc. Besides traditional accelerators such as cyclotrons and synchrotrons, the talk should review the technical challenges and prospects for future compact hadron therapy accelerators such as DWA, laser accelerators and so on.
