An overview on some of the major challenges for beam instrumentation and diagnostics for large ring colliders is given. In the Introduction the general challenges are listed, independent of particle type and accelerator specifics. After a short LHC introduction, examples from the LHC experience are presented, related to observed issues, and to the present upgrade and improvement efforts, made during the long shutdown 1. A list, however not comprehensive, of relevant beam instrumentation R&D activities closes this summary
