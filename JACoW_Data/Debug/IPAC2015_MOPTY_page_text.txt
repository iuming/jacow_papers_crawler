To suppress intra-bunch oscillations and to reduce particle losses, the intra-bunch feedback (IBFB) system has been developed in 2014 for the J-PARC Main Ring (MR). A new BPM was also installed to the MR for the IBFB system. This BPM has a sufficient frequency response and position sensitivity(up to 1.5GHz within 15% fluctuation ). However, a better performance may be needed in future for more precise analysis of internal motions (e.g. due to an electron cloud). We report the development of the BPM and precise measurement results of the BPM characteristics. We also report simulation studies of the digital equalizer which helps to reconstructs the beam shape from beam signals.

Ultrashort electron bunches with durations of femtoseconds and attoseconds are essential for time-resolved measurements, including pulse radiolysis and ultrafast electron microscopy. However, generation of the ultrashort electron bunches is commonly difficult because of bunch length growth due to space charge effect, nonlinear momentum dispersion and so on. Several bunch length measurement methods for the ultrashort electron beams have also been considered so far, which have not been established yet. In this study, the femtosecond electron beams were generated using a laser photocathode radio-frequency gun linac and a magnetic bunch compressor. The bunch length measurement was carried out using a Michelson interferometer based on monitoring coherent transition radiation (CTR), which is characterized by square modulus of the Fourier transform of the longitudinal bunch distribution. Analyzing the experimentally obtained interferograms of CTR, the electron beams with the average duration of 5 fs were generated and measured successfully at the condition of bunch charge of 1 pC. Consideration of the longitudinal bunch shapes was also carried out using the Kramers-Kronig relation.

In the J-PARC RCS, the beam tuning toward the design output beam power of 1MW were started after the completing of the beam energy and beam current upgrades in the LINAC. One of the important issues to achieve the 1MW beam operation is the optimization of the injection beam from the LINAC. Due to the longitudinal beam tuning in the LINAC, the momentum spread of the injected beam into the RCS was measured with the longitudinal tomography method. Our longitudinal tomography tool had been developed using the simple algorithm with the Convolution Back-Projection (CBP) method for the beam storage mode of the RCS. Accordingly, we improved this tool to expand into the acceleration mode.

The accelerating structures for CLIC must be aligned with a precision of a few um with respect to the beam trajectory in order to mitigate emittance growth due to transverse wake fields. We report on first results from wake field monitor tests in an X-band structure, with a probe beam at the CLIC Test Facility. The monitors are currently installed in the CLIC Two-Beam Module. In order to fully demonstrate the feasibility of using wakefield monitors for CLIC, the precision of the monitors must be verified using a probe beam while simultaneously filling the structure with high power rf used to drive the accelerating mode. We outline plans to perform such a demonstration in the CLIC Test Facility.

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) accelerator uses H− stripping and phase space painting method of filling large ring acceptance with the linac beam of small emittance. The beam commissioning software system is the key part of CSNS accelerator. The injection beam commissioning software for CSNS contains three parts currently: painting curve control, injection beam control and injection orbit correction. The injection beam control contains two subsections: single bunch beam calculation and LRBT beam control at the foil. The injection orbit correction also contains two subsections: injection orbit correction by the calculation and injection trim power control.

For the proton linear accelerators used in applications such as ADS, due to the nature of the operation, it is essential to have beam failures at the rate several orders of magnitude lower than usual performance of similar accelerators. In order to achieve this extremely high performance reliability requirement, in addition to hardware improvement, a failure tolerant design is mandatory. A compensation mechanism to cope with hardware failure, mainly RF failures of superconducting cavities, will be in place in order to maintain the high uptime, short recovery time and extremely low frequency of beam loss. The hardware implementation of the mechanism poses high challenges due to the extremely tight timing constraints, high logic complexity, and mostly important, high flexibility and short turnaround time due to varying operation contexts. We will explore the hardware implementation of the scheme using fast electronic devices and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In order to achieve the goals of short recovery time and flexibility in compensation algorithms, an advanced hardware design methodology including high-level synthesis will be used.

The spin physics program in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) requires fast polarimeter to monitor the polarization evolution on the ramp and during stores. Over past decade, the polarimeter has evolved greatly to improve its performance. These include dual chamber design, monitoring camera, Si detector selection (and orientation), target quality control, and target frame modification. The preamp boards have been modified to deal with the high rate problem, too. The ultra thin carbon target lifetime is a concern. Simulations have been carried out on the target interaction with beam. Modification has also been done on the frame design. Extra caution has been put on RF shielding to deal with the pickup noises from the nearby stochastic cooling kickers. This paper summarizes the recent operation performance of this delicate device.

A 100 MeV/100 kW electron LINAC is being constructed by IHEP, China for the NSC KIPT Neutron Source project in Ukraine. A LLRF system is required to produce the driver RF input of the klystron and maintain the accelerating phase and amplitude stability of the machine. The LLRF system consists of an RF reference distribution system, six identical control units, and the fast RF interlock module. The main part of control unit is the PXI-bus crate implemented with PXI9846 - 4 ADC digitizer board and ICS572 - high speed 2 ADC/2 DAC signal process board. An EPICS IOC based on WinDriver as the PCI device driver is developed and tested. Preliminary results show phase detect resolution of 0.03 degree (rms) of 2856 MHz signal has been achieved.

Higher-order modes (HOMs) excited by electron beam traversing a superconducting rf (SRF) cavity contain lots of information and can be used for intra-cavity electron beam diagnostics. Unlike single bunch, multiple bunches would excite HOMs with a much complicated spectrum. In this paper, we present our recent research on HOMs excited by a high repetition rate electron beam in an SRF cavity. Especially, we focus on the integer multiple frequency peaks in the HOM spectrum, which are determined by the nearest eigen HOM peaks. The experiments were carried out on the DC-SRF photoinjector, which was operated at MHz repetition rate. The results agree well with theoretic analysis.

To ensure the quality of high brightness electron beams needed by the terahertz FEL facility at China academy of engineering physics(CAEP), which aims to obtain 100 to 300 terahertz light, a feed-back control system is required to monitor the amplitude and phase jittering by measuring beam arrival time as well as bunch length at the site of the beam position monitor(BPM). In this paper, we make an idealized model of injector section and deduce analytic expressions of bunch arrival time and bunch length. In consideration of the space charge effect on bunch lengthening, bunch arrival time and bunch length as a function of DC gun voltage, buncher field amplitude and buncher phase is carefully calibrated by means of particle in cell (PIC) simulation. With the time and space resolution of the BPM, the control accuracy of phase is estimated to be 0.01 degree, while the amplitude is 0.04%.

Diamond detectors function as beam loss or luminosity monitors for high energy accelerators, such as LHC, Babar, etc. Because of regular detectors‘ insufficient protection of the front end, diamond detectors owning significant characteristics, like time resolution in the nanosecond range, radiation hardness and negligible temperature dependence. Thus, diamond detectors have been becoming promising candidates for detecting BLMs of fully super-conducting hadron accelerator, such as C-ADS, FRIB. In this paper, the sensitivity of diamond detectors was simulated by Monte Carlo program FLUKA and GEAN4. Meanwhile, we tested the performance of a new prototype of CVD diamond detector, and compared it with Si-PIN and Bergoz detectors at the storage ring of the HLS II. The results of the diamond detector were consistent with other two detectors well. More evaluation of diamond detectors in low energy radiation field are ongoing.

Beam position is one of the most important parameters in a particle accelerator. The more accurate and precise the measurement system is, the more features of the beam dynamics could be revealed. A method called model-independent analysis (MIA) takes advantage of multiple beam position monitors (BPM) on the storage ring to obtain the actual beam positions by removing the random noise of each BPM. Inspired by MIA, the original voltage waveforms obtained from the electrodes of a single BPM can also be decomposed to get the beam position information. This article discusses the results of the experiments and the evaluation of the performance of the BPM at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics.

An intelligent trigger abnormal beam operation monitoring processor has been designed at the SSRF. By applying digital signal processing algorithms in FPGA, the processor keeps monitoring the beam operation status. It will output a trigger signal and store the turn-by-turn beam position data when abnormal events detected. The abnormal events include injection, beam loss, and abnormal disturbance. This ability makes the processor a powerful tool for abnormal operation causes analysing and machine study.

Digital BPM processor with turn-by-turn capability has been widely used in synchrotron radiation facilities over the world, which is proved to be very useful and powerful for daily operation and linear optics study but not good enough in the case of individual bunch information required. In order to sufficient individual bunch diagnostics requirements a development plan of the next generation DBPM processor with bunch-by-bunch capability has been initiated in SINAP since 2012. The whole development was divided into three steps: a concept processor based on digital oscilloscope IOC, an algorithm prototype processor based on commercial high speed ADC board, and a custom designed dedicated processor. The progress of this work and several preliminary beam experiments will be discussed in this paper.

With the aim to obtain short-pulse bunches with high peak current for a terahertz radiation source, an FEL-based LINAC is employed in HUST THz-FEL, and the LINAC consists of an EC-ITC RF gun, a disk-loaed waveguide structure with a constant gradient and collinear absorbing loads with focusing coils surrounded and so on. To achieve a balance between compactness and high performance, beam diagnostic system should be simple and high-precision. So that a cost-effective measurement scheme for the high-brightness beam extracted by the LINAC is needed. This paper will describe the beam line and beam diagnostic system of the LINAC in the HUST THz-FEL in detail and give corresponding assembly scheme. In addition, online monitor system is introduced.

Rare isotope Accelerator Of Newness (RAON) heavy ion accelerator has been designed as a facility for a rare isotepe accelerator of the Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP). RAON provides 400 kW CW heavy ion beams from proton to uranium to support researches in various science fields. The RAON system consists of a few ECR ion source, low energy beam transport systems (LEBTs), CW radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerators, a medium energy beam transport and superconducting linac. We present the design study of the RFQ accelerator from 30 keV/u to 1.5 MeV/u of deuteron beam with meeting a requirement of over 15 mA beam at the target. We optimized the normal conducting CW RFQ accelerator that has a high transmission and a low longitudinal emittance. In this paper, we will present the design result of RFQ beam dynamics studies and its 2D and 3D EM analysis.

PAL-XFEL is being installed and will be completed by December of 2015 so that users can be supported beginning in 2016. PAL-XFEL equipment should continuously maintain the bunch beam parameter. To this end, PAL-XFEL equipment has to be kept precisely aligned. As a part of the process for installing PAL-XFEL, a surface geodetic network and the installation of a tunnel measurement network inside buildings is in preparation; additionally, the fiducialization of major equipment is underway. After PAL-XFEL equipment is optimized and aligned, if the ground and buildings go through vertical changes during operation, misalignment of equipments will cause errors in the electron beam trajectory, which will lead to changes to the beam parameter. For continuous and systemic measurement of vertical changes in buildings and to monitor ground sinking and uplifting, the BINP Ultrasonic-type Hydrostatic Levelling System (HLS) is to be installed and operated in all sections of PAL-XFEL for linear accelerator, Undulator and beam line. This study will introduce the operation principle, design concept and advantages (self-calibration) of HLS, and will outline its installation plan and operation plan.

The KHIMA (Korea Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator) project is launched to construct the carbon and proton beam base ion therapy machine. It, which consists of the injector with RFQ and IH-DTL linacs, medium beam transport line, synchrotron, and high energy beam transport line, will be provided the carbon beam up to 430 MeV/u and proton beam up to 230 MeV for cancer therapy. The high precision beam position monitor is required to match and control the beam trajectory for the beam injection and closed orbit in synchrotron. It was also used for measuring the beta-function, tune, and chromaticity. Since the bunch length at heavy ion synchrotron is relatively long, a few meters, a box-like device with long plates of typically 20 cm is used to enhance the signal strength and to get a precise linear dependence with respect to the beam displacement. In this presentation, we show the electromagnetic design of the electrode and surroundings to satisfy the resolution of 100 um, the criteria for mechanical aspect to satisfy the position accuracy of 200 um, the measurement result of position accuracy by using the wire test-bench, and the beam-test results with long (~ 1.6 us) electron beam in PAL.

Pulsed deflecting magnet project was worked out in BINP. The kicker design task is: impulsive force value is 1 mT*m, pulse edge is 5 ns, and impulse duration is about 200 ns. The unconventional approach to kicker design was offered. The possibility for set of wires using instead of plates using is considered. This approach allows us to reduce the effective plate surface. In this case we can decrease effects related to induced charges and currents. In the result of modelling optimal construction was developed. It includes 6 wires. The magnet aperture is about 5 cm. Calculated field rise time (about 1.5 ns) satisfies the conditions. Induced current effect reducing idea was confirmed. For configuration with 3 wires pair (with cross section of 2 mm) induced current in one wire is about 10% and in the wall is about 40%. However for design with plates current is about 40% and 20% respectively. Obtained magnet construction allows controlling of high field homogeneity by changing currents magnitudes in wires. In general we demonstrated the method of field optimization. Optimal kicker design was obtained. Wires using idea was substantiated.

A distributed beam loss monitor based on the Cherenkov effect in optical fiber has been implemented for the VEPP­5 electron and positron linacs and the 510 MeV damping ring at the Budker INP. The monitor operation is based on detection of the Cherenkov radiation generated in optical fiber by means of relativistic particles created in electromagnetic shower after highly relativistic beam particles (electrons or positrons) hit the vacuum pipe. The main advantage of the distributed monitor compared to local ones is that a long optical fiber section can be used instead of a large number of local beam loss monitors. In our experiments the Cherenkov light was detected by photomultiplier tube (PMT). Timing of PMT signal gives the location of the beam loss. In the experiment with 20 m long optical fiber we achieved 3 m spatial resolution. To improve spatial resolution optimization and selection process of optical fiber and PMT are needed and according to our theoretical estimations 0.5 m spatial resolution can be achieved. We also suggest similar techniques for detection of electron (or positron) losses due to Touschek effect in storage rings.

Three-dimensional* and planar** periodic structures can be used for non-destructive diagnostics of charged particle bunches. Here we consider the semi-infinite planar structure comprised of thin conducting parallel wires. If the period of the structure is much less than the typical wavelength of the electromagnetic field, then the structure's influence can be described with help of the averaged boundary conditions***. We study radiation of a charged particle bunch with small transversal size and arbitrary longitudinal one in two cases: (i) the bunch moves orthogonally to the grid at some distance from the edge and (ii) it moves along the edge of the grid. The problems are solved analytically. In both cases the bunch generates a surface wave which contains the information about the size of the bunch. The shape of the surface waves is similar to the radiation generated in the presence of 3D periodical wire structures*, however planar structure is simpler for use in accelerating system. Some typical numerical results for bunches of various shapes are given.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II accelerator consists of the Storage Ring, the Booster Ring, and Linac along with their associated cavities. NSLS II is committed to the use of digital RF controllers for controlling these cavities. Given the number, types and variety of functions of these cavities, we sought to limit the logic development effort by reuse of parameterized code on one hardware platform. Currently we have fielded six controllers in the NSLS II system. There are two controllers each in both the Storage ring and Booster. The first controller in each is used to control the cavity field and the second controller used for diagnostics. In the Linac a controller is provided which modulates the eGUN grid to generate the bunches. Lastly, in the Master Oscillator Distribution System a controller is used to make phase corrections to the outgoing master oscillator clock signal to account for thermal phase drifts along the distribution path.

The accelerators of the Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research are designed to deliver stable and rare isotope beams covering a huge range of intensities and beam energies. FAIR will employ heavy ion synchrotrons for highest intensities, anti-proton and rare isotope production stations, high resolution separators and several storage rings where beam cooling can be applied. Instrumentation Technologies will develop and deliver a beam diagnostic system for SIS100, HESR and CR rings. Furthermore the beam transfers will be equipped with the beam position diagnostics. The project is on schedule and the first instrument prototypes are already being under evaluation. This article discusses the new BPM electronics concept, the tests performed in the laboratory and the performance obtained.

Beam loss monitors in synchrotron light sources are finding an increasing utility in particular with the trend of numerous light sources pushing to lower emittances and thus higher intra-beam scattering, while operating in top-up injection modes and employing in-vacuum undulators in their rings. The development of an optimized electron BeamLoss Monitor aims at fulfilling, in one single system, all possible functionalities and applications like both the measurement of fast-time-resolved losses at injection and the possibility of ultra-sensitive detection of low & slow electron loss level variations. This optimized beam loss monitor system comprises both the acquisition electronics and up to four sensor head per unit. The sensor heads themselves, that can be configured for different sizes or volumes, are based on the detection of the electromagnetic shower resulting from an electron loss through the use of either Cherenkov radiator or gamma scintillator and a photomultiplier tube, all assembled in a single compact housing ready for installation.

ALBA is a 3GeV synchrotron light source located in Barcelona and operating with users since May 2012. The RF system of the SR is composed of six cavities, each one powered by combining the power of two 80 kW IOTs through a Cavity Combiner (CaCo). At present, there are several RF interlocks per week. The redundancy given by the six cavities makes possible the survival of the beam after one of these trips. In these cases, the cavity has to be recovered with the circulating beam. An autorecovery process has been implemented in the digital LLRF system in order to recover the faulty RF plant after a trip. But these trips also create perturbations to the beam stability. In order to minimize the beam perturbations induced by these RF interlock, an additional feed-forward loop is being implemented. The functionally, main parameters and test results of these new algorithms will be presented.

Among all the LIPAc/IFMIF accelerator diagnostics instrumentation, the Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) are a cornerstone for its operation. An electronics system centered on self-calibration and extraction of beam phase information for Time Of Flight measurement is proposed for the twenty BPM stations distributed along the accelerator. The system under development is a fully digital instrumentation which incorporates automatic calibration of the monitors' signals and allows monitoring of both fundamental and second signal harmonics. The current state of the development and first experimental results of the system on the test bench will be presented.

Over the last decades, the complexity and performance levels of machine protection have developed. The level of reliability and availability analysis prior to operation differs between facilities, just as the pragmatic changes of the machine protection during operation. This paper studies the experience and development of machine protection for some of the state of the art proton and ion accelerators, and how it relates to reducing damage to and downtime of the machine. The findings are discussed and categorized, with emphasis on proton accelerators. The paper is concluded with some recommendations for a future high power linear proton accelerator.

Reliability and availability are key metrics for achieving the scientific vision of the ESS. The approach taken to analyze and to improve these metrics in order to achieve the goals is described in this contribution. The methodology used to obtain the requirements considers not only the availability and reliability figures but also the specific needs extracted from users expectations from the neutron source in order to succeed in their experiments. A top-down requirements allocation is being developed at the same time that bottom-up reliability and availability analyses is being performed. The experiments expected at ESS and their needs in terms of neutron beam performance (reliability, availability and quality) are described as well as the tools used to analyze it. Moreover, the consequences of these analyses in the design phase are discussed.

Providing and assuring safe conditions for personnel is a key parameter required to operate the European Spallation Source (ESS). The ESS will be responsible for developing all of the facility personnel safety related systems. All of these systems will be developed by the Integrated Control Systems Division (ICS) and all will be designed, manufactured, commissioned and operated in accordance with the IEC61508 standard, with regard to functional safety for Electrical/Electronic and Programmable Electronic (E/E/PE) safety related systems. This paper describes the ESS Personnel safety system’s scope, strategy, initial design requirements, and methodology but also provides an update of the system design progress so far.

The linear accelerator of ESS will produce a 5 MW proton beam. Beam of this power must be strictly monitored by a specialized Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) System to detect any abnormal losses and to ensure that operational losses do not lead to excessive activation. A long series of beam loss simulations was performed using MARS Monte Carlo code system in order to optimize the number and setting mounting locations of the detectors for best coverage, distinguishability and sensitivity. Simulations anticipated multiple possible beam loss scenarios resulting in different loss patterns. The results of energy deposition in air in the linac tunnel in multiple locations were analysed in several different ways. Incorporated methods varied from simple brute force approach to more sophisticated singular value decomposition based algorithms, all resulting in detector layout proposals. Locations selected for BLMs were evaluated for all methods.

The ESS proton beam power of 125MW per pulse (5MW average) will be unprecedented and its uncontrolled release could lead to serious damage of equipment within a few microseconds only. To optimize the operational efficiency of the ESS facility allowing for very high beam availability with high reliability towards the end-users, accidents should be avoided and interruptions of beam operation have to be rare and limited to a short time. Finding the right balance between efficient protection of equipment from damage and high beam availability is the key idea on which the ESS Machine Protection Strategy is being based on. Implementing and realizing the measures needed to provide the correct level of machine protection in case of a complex facility like the ESS, requires a systematic approach, which will be discussed in this paper. A method of how to derive machine protection relevant requirements and how to assure completeness of these will be outlined as well.

Approximately 350 resistive magnets and 350 power supplies (PS) will be installed in the 600 m long linear accelerator (LINAC) at ESS, transporting the proton beam from the source to the target station. In order to protect this equipment from damage (e.g. due to overheating) and to take the appropriate actions required to minimise recovery time, a dedicated magnet powering interlock system is being designed. The magnet powering interlock system will safely switch off a PS upon the detection of an internal magnet or PS failure and inform the beam interlock system to inhibit further beam operation. The different failure modes and related mitigation techniques of magnets and their PS will be presented. Failures of the magnet cooling system can be detected for example by interlocking the opening of a thermo-switch or a flow-switch. To achieve the required level of dependability, an interlock system based on safety PLC technology, distributed safety PLC software programming tools, PROFINET fieldbus networking, and current loops for hardwired interlock signal exchanges, has been prototyped and will be discussed.

The expected damage due to the release of the full LHC beam energy at a single aperture bottleneck has been studied. These studies have shown that the range of the 7 TeV LHC proton beam is significantly extended compared to that of a single proton due to hydrodynamic tunneling effect. For instance, it was evaluated that the protons and their showers will penetrate up to a length of 25 m in solid carbon compared to a static range of around 3 m. To check the validity of these simulations, beam- target heating experiments using the 440 GeV proton beam generated by the SPS were performed at the HiRadMat test facility at CERN *. Solid copper targets were facially irradiated by the beam and measurements confirmed hydrodynamic tunneling of the protons and their showers. Simulations have been done by running the energy deposition code FLUKA and the 2D hydrodynamic code, BIG2, iteratively. Very good agreement has been found between the simulations and the experimental results ** providing confidence in the validity of the studies for the LHC. This paper presents the simulation studies, the results of a benchmarking experiment, and the detailed target investigations.

This paper presents the preliminary electromagnetic design of a stripline Beam Position Monitor (BPM) for the High Luminosity program of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN. The design is fitted into a new octagonal shielded Beam Screen for the low-beta triplets and is optimized for high directivity. It also includes internal Tungsten absorbers, required to reduce the energy deposition in the superconducting magnets. The achieved broadband directivity in wakefield solver simulations presents significant improvement over the directivity of the current stripline BPMs installed in the LHC.

The optical fibres that transmit the beam permit loop signals at the CERN accelerator complex are deployed along radiation areas. This may result in increased attenuation of the fibres, which reduces the power margin of the links. In addition, other events may cause the links to not function properly and result in false dumps, reducing the availability of the accelerator chain and affecting physics data taking. In order to evaluate the state of the fibres, an out-of-band fibre monitoring system is proposed, working in parallel to the actual beam permit loops. The future beam interlock system to be deployed during LHC long shutdown 2 will implement online, real-time monitoring of the fibres, a feature the current system lacks. Commercial off-the-shelf components to implement the optical transceivers are proposed whenever possible instead of ad-hoc designs.

The Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system of the LHC consists of over 3600 ionization chambers. The main task of the system is to prevent the superconducting magnets from quenching and protect the machine components from damage, as a result of critical beam losses. The BLM system therefore requests a beam abort when the measured dose in the chambers exceeds a threshold value. During Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) a series of modifications were made to the system. Based on the experience from Run 1 and from improved simulation models, all the threshold settings were revised, and modified where required. This was done to improve the machine safety at 7 TeV, and to reduce beam abort requests when neither a magnet quench or damage to machine components is expected. In addition to the updates of the threshold values, about 800 monitors were relocated. This improves the response to unforeseen beam losses in the millisecond time scale due to micron size dust particles present in the vacuum chamber. This contribution will discuss all the changes made to the BLM system, with the reasoning behind them.

A new Extra Low ENergy Antiproton ring (ELENA) is under construction at CERN to further decelerate the antiprotons from the existing Antiproton Decelerator (AD) to an energy of just 100 keV. This contribution will describe the beam position system foreseen for ELENA and how it can be adapted for Schottky measurements. The orbit system being developed is based on electrostatic shoebox BPMs fitted with Digital Down Converters (DDC). The main requirement is to measure complete orbits every 20 ms with a resolution of 0.1mm for intensities in the range of 1-3x107 charges. The pick-up signals will, after amplification with a low noise charge amplifier, be down-mixed to baseband for position computation. In order to provide the longitudinal Schottky diagnostics of un-bunched beams, the 20 BPM sum signals will, after time off flight corrections, be added digitally to give an expected S/N increase of 13 dB compared to using a single electrostatic pick-up.

At the end of a physics fill and in case of a failure, the LHC beams must be extracted and transferred through a 750m long line to the beam dump block. During the rise of the extraction kickers to their full strength a particle-free abort gap, with a length of 3 us in the LHC filling pattern, is required to prevent beam losses that could lead to substantial quenching of magnets, with a risk of damage. Therefore the particle population in the abort gap, which is mainly due to un-bunched beam, is monitored. Above a certain threshold an active cleaning by excitation of betatron oscillations with the transverse feedback system is initiated. This paper describes a novel method of monitoring the abort gap population using diamond particle detectors for detecting the interactions of beam in the abort gap with neon gas, injected in the beam pipe. Two different layouts of the system and the expected interaction and detection rates are discussed.

Comprehensive understanding of beam losses in the LHC is required to ensure full machine protection and efficient operation. The existing BLM system using ionization chambers is not adequate to resolve losses with a time resolution below some 10 us. Ionization chambers are also not adequate to measure very large transient losses, e.g. beam impacting on collimators. Diamond particle detectors with bunch-by-bunch resolution have therefore been used in LHC to measure fast particle losses with a time resolution down to a level of single bunches. Diamond detectors have also successfully been used for material damage studies in other facilities, e.g. HiRadMat at the CERN-SPS. To fully understand their potential, such detectors were characterized with an electron beam at the BTF in LNF INFN Italy, with bunch intensities from 103 to 109 electrons. The detector response and efficiency has been measured with a 50 Ω and a 1 Ω read-out system. This paper describes the experimental setup and the results of the experiment. In particular, the responses of three samples of 100 um single-crystalline diamond detectors and two samples of 500 um polycrystalline diamond detectors are presented.

The Large Hadron Collider powering systems have been tested and commissioned before to start the second run of physics production. This commissioning used for the first time analysis modules defined directly by system experts in an english-like domain specific language. In these modules, the experts defined assertions that the data generated by the powering tests must verify in order for the test to pass. These modules concerned 4 tests executed for more than 1000 systems. They allowed experts to identify issues that were hidden behind the repetitive manual analysis performed during the previous campaigns. This paper describes this first operational experience of the analysis modules, as well as the replay of all the previous campaign with them. It will also present a critical point of view on these modules to identify their drawbacks and the next step to improve this system.

This paper presents an alternative way to produce flat-topped RF pulses at the pulse compressor output. Flat-topped RF pulses are suitable for multi-bunch operation where it is often required that beams experience the same accelerating gradient. Moreover, the energy gain, in this case, is less sensitive to timing jitters. The proposed approach is based on Iterative Learning Control technique, which iteratively updates the input waveforms, in order to generate the desired output waveforms.

A linear accelerator including several klystron driver RF stations can be viewed as a single virtual RF station with a certain accelerating RF voltage (in amplitude and phase). This paper develops an optimization scheme that, for a specified beam energy gain, determines the klystrons output powers and the modulators high voltages optimally. The algorithm employs the klystron nonlinear static characteristics curves to calculate the input RF amplitude of the drive chain.

There are more and more non-linear electronic equipments such as inverters using in facility nowadays. These non-linear electronic equipments let us achieve energy saving, but induce other electrical pollution to the whole power grid in contrast. Among these electrical pollutions, electric harmonic is the most common and harmful to power facility. Therefore, how to monitor the electrical noises from these non-linear equipments becomes an important issue. In this article, a set of power quality monitoring system based on FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) modules and PAC (Programmable Automatic Controller) has been built because of their programmability and fast processing speed. By using this monitoring system, any abnormality in power system and its spectrum will be recorded thoroughly. On the other hand, the maintainer could follow the trace of noise and then propose a suitable solution to eliminate the electrical interference too.

In order to maintain and operate a synchrotron radiation light source well requires quite a few efforts. All parts of the big machine, including vacuum system, all kinds of magnets, RF facility, cryogenic equipments, radiation security, optic devices and utility equipment must cooperate in harmony to provide high quality light. Any one of the above system contains lots of analog or digital signal transmission, not to mention the vast range of utility. Numbers of programmable automation controllers (PACs) are applied in utility system in TPS to ensure the utility operates normally. In addition to the high reliability and distribution, the flexible programmability of PAC is the most critical feature in this project. A well-designed program, Archive Viewer, provides a platform for showing these big data from all distributed systems. The architecture of the server system for utility is described in this paper as well.

Booster synchrotron for the Taiwan photon source project which is a 3 GeV synchrotron light source constructed at NSRRC is in commissioning. The booster is designed to ramp electron beams from 150 MeV to 3 GeV in 3 Hz therefore the large main power supplies have features of waveform play with trigger functionalities to enable electron beams ramp from 150 MeV to 3 GeV in 3 Hz. However, due to limited bandwidth of power supplies, different magnet loading will result in quite different phase lag for dipoles and four quadrupoles families. To improve tracking error between quadrupole to dipole readings, several strategies are developed and will be summarized in this report.

The global orbit feedback for the 1.5 GeV electron storage ring of TLS has been operated more than ten years. This system uses general processors to control feedback loop with 1 kHz rate. It is very important for various operation of storage ring now, but some hardware components could have been out of stock in the future. As a prototype, a FPGA based fast global orbit feedback at a 10 kHz data acquisition rate has been developed. A micro-TCA liked platform with FPGA board is used to implement control algorithm and acquire BPM data from Libera Brillance. The correction algorithm is written in VHDL and connected to power supply with AURORA digital links. The system architecture will be discussed in this report.

Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a third generation 3 GeV synchrotron light facility. The synchrotron radiation from a dipole can be used to observe the beam parameters. The synchrotron radiation monitor (SRM) systems were designed and implemented for the booster synchrotron and storage ring. The SRM for the booster synchrotron can serve to diagnose the energy ramping process. The beam size decreases when the energy increases was observed. In the storage ring, the streak camera was preferred to observe the beam behaviour of the consecutive bunches. The bunch length and longitudinal instability were observed. The preliminary beam test results are summarized in this report.

Taiwan photon source is a 3rd generation synchrotron light source which is in beam commissioning at NSRRC. Orbit stability within 100 nm range is essential for such a small emittance light source. Technical noise from the vacuum pumps, water flow, etc. will cause the vibration of quadrupoles and deleterious orbit stability. In order to investigate the magnitude of vibration in the magnets of the storage ring, the vibration spectra of the lattice quadruples; the coherence between the magnets, girders and ground will be systematic investigated in this report.

The TLS (Taiwan Light Source) is a third generation of synchrotron light source, and it has been operated since 1993. The TLS control system is a proprietary design. It was performed minor upgrade several times to avoid obsolete of some system components and keep up-to-date during last two decades. The control system of the TPS project (Taiwan Photon Source) is based upon the EPICS framework. To save resources for TLS control system maintenance, adopt EPICS for newly developed and rejuvenated subsystems for some of the TLS control interfaces includes BPM system, insertion devices, bunch-by-bunch feedbacks, electronics instruments interface and so on. Some EPICS related applications have been developed, and EPICS graphical user interface is also operated at the TLS control consoles environment normally. Current system allowed two kinds of control environments working together. The efforts will be described at this report.

The TPS (Taiwan Photon Source) is low emittance 3 GeV synchrotron light source. The design and implementation of a pulse magnet power supply control system for beam injection and extraction were done. The EPICS embedded programmable logic controller (PLC) was applied to control pulse magnet power supply. The system comprises various input/output modules and a CPU module with built-in Ethernet interface. The control information (status of the power supply, ON, OFF, warn up, reset, reading/setting voltage, etc.) can be accessed remotely using EPICS client tools. The TPS timing system provide trigger signals for pulse magnet power supplies. The Ethernet-based oscilloscope is employed to observe current waveform of pulse magnet power supply with EPICS support. This paper describes control interface and operation GUI for the TPS pulse magnet power supply.

24 sets of Laser PSD positioning system are parts of the TPS girder auto¬alignment system. Laser PSD positioning systems are installed in the straight¬ section girders of TPS storage ring. The Laser PSD systems are assembled and calibrated in the Lab beforehand. The Laser and PSDs are assembled on girder and transported to TPS storage ring and Installed. During construction the system deviates from the normal position caused by variant temperature and external influence. For absolute position precision, another laser calibration system should be built to recalibrate the laser PSD system. This paper describes the installation of Laser PSD system in TPS storage ring and the status of the PSD system. A new absolute position calibration method for precision upgrade is also discussed.

Micro-bunch instabilities (MBI) have been detected at many light sources across the world. The radiation bursts produced as a result of this instability occur in the millimetre wavelength regime. In order to understand more about the mechanism of MBI and improve the accuracy of simulations, more information is needed about the dynamics and spectral content of the radiation. A single shot spectrometer has therefore been developed to investigate this instability at Diamond Light Source. Due to their low noise, ultra-fast response and excellent sensitivity, Schottky detector diodes are employed. Currently, seven Schottky detectors are in place covering a range of 33-750 GHz. Unlike previous measurements at Diamond, each of the Schottky detectors has been characterised thus allowing the results obtained to be more easily compared to simulations. In this paper, we present the calibration of each Schottky detector in the spectrometer, the first results of tests with beam, as well as future plans for the spectrometer.

The PXIE Ion Source and Low-Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) section are designed to create and transfer a 1–10 mA H− beam, in either pulsed (0.001–16 ms) or DC mode, from the ion source through to the injection point of the RFQ. This paper discusses the range of diagnostic tools Allison-type Emittance Scanner, Faraday Cup, Toroid, DCCT, electrically isolated diaphragms – involved in the commissioning of the beamline and preparation of the beam for injection into the RFQ.

Ultra-low latency beam-based digital feedbacks have been developed by the Feedback On Nanosecond Timescales (FONT) Group and tested at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2) at KEK in a programme aimed at beam stabilisation at the nanometre level at the ATF2 final focus. Three prototypes were tested: 1) A feedback system based on high-resolution stripline BPMs was used to stabilise the beam orbit in the beamline region c. 50m upstream of the final focus. 2) Information from this system was used in a feed-forward mode to stabilise the beam locally at the final focus. 3) A final-focus local feedback system utilising cavity BPMs was deployed. In all three cases the degree of beam stabilisation was observed in high-precision cavity BPMs at the ATF2 interaction point. Latest results are reported on stabilising the beam position to below 100 nanometres.

A high-resolution, low-latency beam position monitor (BPM) system has been developed for use in particle accelerators and beamlines that operate with trains of particle bunches with bunch separations as low as several tens of nanoseconds, such as future linear electron-positron colliders and free-electron lasers. The system was tested with electron beams in the extraction line of the Accelerator Test Facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan. The fast analogue front-end signal processor is based on a single-stage RF down-mixer. The processor latency is 15.6 ± 0.1 ns. A position resolution below 300 nm has been demonstrated for beam intensities of around 1 nC, with single-pass beam.
