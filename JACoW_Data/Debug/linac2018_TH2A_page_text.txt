The European XFEL cw upgrade requires cavities with reduced surface resistance (high Q-values) for high duty-cycle while maintaining high accelerating gradient for short-pulse operation. To improve on European XFEL performance, a recently discovered treatment is investigated: The so called Nitrogen-infusion. The recent test results of the cavity based R&D and the progress of the relevant infrastructure is presented. The aim of this approach is to establish a stable, reproducible recipe and to identify all key parameters for this process. In parallel, advanced surface analyses, such as SEM/EDX, TEM, XPS, XRR, GIXRD and TOF-SIMS, of samples after in-situ treatment, cut-outs of cavities and samples treated together with cavities are done. The aim of this approach is to understand the underlying processes of the material evolution, resulting in the improved performance. Results of these analyses, their implications for the cavity R&D, and next steps are presented.

The constant need for higher beam intensity of single charged ion beams is a strong motivation to investigate 2.45GHz electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source. It has been chosen by many constructed and constructing facilities such as LEDA, IFMIF, SPIRAL2, SARAF, FAIR, ESS, PKUNIFTY, CADS as H+/D+ beam generator. In this paper, a review of its present status will be given. The key issues for a 2.45GHz ECR ion source development will be described. The permanent magnet ECR build by Peking University (PKU) will be displayed as an example.
