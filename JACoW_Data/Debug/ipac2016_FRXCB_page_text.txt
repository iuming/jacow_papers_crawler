Structure based wakefield acceleration provides a viable approach capable of accelerating a sufficient electrons and positrons in a substantially high graident needed to meet the luminosity, efficiency, and cost requirements of a future linear collider. The short pulse Two Beam wakefield Acceleration (TBA) studied at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility is aimed to pave the way toward the next linear collider. Here we present the latest results including the 100MeV/m of the single stage TBA and the staged TBA in which a 0.5nC bunch gained equal amount of energy in two stages (~2.4 MeV per stage, corresponding to an average acceleration gradient ~70 MeV/m). The technique is scalable to a staged-acceleration at 200-300MeV/m by using a GeV-scale drive beam. Such a development will considerably reduce both cost and footprint of a future high-energy physics collider as well as future X-Ray light source.
