Power converters (PC) is one of the key technologies for accelerators. During recent years with the development of power semiconductor devices, optimization of topologies, and improvement of manufacturing, the voltage and current ratings and power densities have greatly increased for PCs. Various PCs are required for various magnets in accelerators, but in principle the design for main topologies and the methodology for stabilizing the output are similar. Main topologies, digital control systems，and considerations for the future about the magnet PC are briefly discussed in this presentation.
