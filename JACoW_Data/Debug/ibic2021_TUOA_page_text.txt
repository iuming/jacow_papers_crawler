A new type of transmissive pixel detector has been developed for synchrotron radiation diagnostics at Diamond Light Source. A thin single-crystal CVD diamond plate is used as the detector material, and a pulsed-laser technique has been used to write conductive graphitic electrodes inside the diamond plate. Instead of using traditional electrodes formed from a layer of surface metallisation, the graphitic electrodes are buried under the surface of the diamond and result in an all-carbon imaging detector. Within the instrument’s transmissive aperture there are no surface structures that could be damaged by exposure to radiation beams, and no surface metallization that could introduce unwanted absorption edges. The instrument has successfully been used to image the X-ray beam profile and measure the beam position to sub-micron accuracy at 100 Hz at Diamond Light Source. A novel modulation lock-in technique is used to read out all pixels simultaneously. Presented in this work are measurements of the detector’s beam position resolution and intensity resolution. Initial measurements of the instrument’s spread-function are also presented. Numerical simulations are used to identify potential improvements to the electrode geometry to improve the spatial resolution of similar future detectors. The instrument has applications in both synchrotron radiation instrumentation, where real-time monitoring of the beam profile is useful for beam diagnostics and fault-finding, and particle tracking at colliders, where the electrode geometries that buried graphitic tracks can provide increased the charge collection efficiency of the detector.

Novel schemes for generating ultralow emittance electron beams have been developed in past years and promise compact particle sources with excellent beam quality suitable for future high-energy physics experiments and free-electron lasers. Current methods for the characterization of low emittance electron beams such as pepperpot measurements or beam focus scanning are limited in their capability to resolve emittances in the sub 0.1 mm mrad regime. Here we propose a novel, highly sensitive method for the single shot characterization of the beam waist and emittance using interfering laser beams. In this scheme, two laser pulses are focused under an angle creating a gratinglike interference pattern. When the electron beam interacts with the structured laser field, the phase space of the electron beam becomes modulated by the laser ponderomotive force and results in a modulated beam profile after further electron beam phase advance, which allows for the characterization of ultralow emittance beams. 2D PIC simulations show the effectiveness of the technique for normalized emittances in the range of 0.01 to 1 mm mrad.

Generally, turn-to-turn power fluctuations of incoherent spontaneous synchrotron radiation in a storage ring depend on the 6D phase-space distribution of the electron bunch. In some cases, if only one parameter of the distribution is unknown, this parameter can be determined from the measured magnitude of these power fluctuations. In this contribution, we report the results of our experiment at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring, where we carried out an absolute measurement (no free parameters or calibration) of a small vertical emittance (5–15 nm rms) of a flat beam by this new method, under conditions, when the small vertical emittance is unresolvable by a conventional synchrotron light beam size monitor. This technique may be particularly beneficial for existing state-of-the-art and next generation low-emittance high-brightness ultraviolet and x-ray synchrotron light sources.

A high-intensity beam accelerator requires a non-destructive beam profile monitor since a destructive monitor, such as a wire-scanning-type profile monitor, may be broken by deposited energy. We have been developing a non-destructive transverse beam profile monitor using a gas sheet. The sheet-shaped gas flow is formed by a technique of rarefied gas dynamics and enables two-dimensional profile measurement. One of the issues on development of the profile monitor based on beam-gas interaction is reconstruction of the beam profile from the obtained signal by the monitor. Our gas sheet monitor captures the beam-induced fluorescence using an image intensifier and a CCD camera. Photons produced by beam-gas interaction are integrated along the normal direction of the detector; the luminous intensity distribution of the obtained image can be written as an integral of the product of the sheet-gas density distribution and the beam profile. To solve the equation and reconstruct the profile, the sheet-gas density distribution needs to be measured. The gas density distribution was quantified using an electron beam narrow enough as compared with the beam whose profile needs to be measured. The narrow electron beam induces local photon emission from the gas sheet, and the gas density distribution can be measured by scanning the electron beam position on the gas sheet while monitoring the photon signal intensities. An advantage of this measurement method of the gas density distribution is the obtained distribution includes the sensitivity distribution of the detector, such as a CCD camera and an image intensifier. The measured gas density distribution including the sensitivity distribution was applied to the profile reconstruction of 3 MeV, 60 mA negative hydrogen ion beam in J-PARC Linac, and the beam profile was successfully obtained.

A pair of operational Beam Gas Ionisation (BGI) profile monitors was installed in the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) at the beginning of 2021. These instruments use Timepix3 hybrid pixel detectors to continuously measure the beam profile throughout the cycle in the horizontal and vertical planes. In the weeks following their installation, both BGI’s were commissioned in situ by equalizing and tuning the thresholds of the Timepix3 detectors. First measurements were taken during the beam commissioning period, demonstrating the operational readiness of the instruments. Sextupolar components originating from the magnetic shield in the vertical BGI magnet were later discovered and required compensation to reduce their effect on the PS beams. With the compensation in place, operational measurements could be started and provided new insights into the dynamics of the PS beam cycles.

We report on 2D beam size measurements with a novel interferometric technique named Heterodyne Near Field Speckles, capable of resolving few-micrometer beam sizes. It relies on the interference between the weak spherical waves scattered by a colloidal suspension and the intense transilluminating X-ray beam. Fourier analysis of the resulting speckles enables full 2D coherence mapping of the incoming radiation, from which the beam sizes along the two orthogonal directions are retrieved. We show experimental results obtained with 12.4 keV X-rays at the NCD-SWEET undulator beamline at ALBA, where the vertical beam size has been changed between 5 and 15 micrometers by varying the beam coupling. The results agree well with the estimated beam sizes from the pinhole calculations. Finally, we discuss recent investigations on alternative targets aimed at improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the technique.
