The RAON heavy ion accelerator facility is under construction in Korea. With a 400-kW superconducting linac as the workhorse, the facility is to establish the In-flight Fragment (IF) and Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) facilities to support advanced science researches. Beam dynamics studies have progressed to cover start-to-end simulations including machine errors. There has been significant progress in sub-system prototype studies including 28-GHz ECR ion source, superconducting cavities and magnets, and IF target. This talk presents recent progress and status of the project.

The construction of the European Spallation Source, ESS, started in summer 2014. At the site in Lund, the accelerator tunnel will be completed at the time of IPAC16, while prototyping and manufacturing or prepara-tions for manpower contributions are going on in more 23 laboratories distributed over the 12 European countries collaborating on the accelerator project. Major technical milestones have been reached include the testing of su-perconducting cavity prototypes of two families to values above design gradients, the first ESS modulator has been tested to 90 kV and the first klystron prototype has been received in April 2016. Equally important developments are taking place at many partner laboratories. The presen-tation will summarize the status of the ESS accelerator project by the time of IPAC16..

It is the new approaches of sustainable fission energy that high power accelerator produces intensive external neutron to close fuel cycle and utilize fissile fuel ?95%. The system includes the fissile fuel burner and used fuel recycle. The burner is optimized as the nuclear waste transmutation, fissile material breeding and energy production in situ by the accelerator driven system. There are 4 phases in the Chinese development road map and the new research sites are introduced in this talk as well. The 2nd phase will be finished around 2022, with its high power LINAC (proton beam ~250MeV&10mA) providing the best opportunity to make DAR source for neutrino research. The burner, optimizing from ADS, consists of the high power LINAC, the spallation target and the subcritical core. The 25MeV LINAC prototype will be commissioned by the end of this year. The 10 MeV LINAC has produced a CW proton beam in 10's kW and has been operated with the ion source being operated more than 2000 hrs. The new concept of spallation target is granular fluid target, in which the solid grain fluid and beam implant from top to down. All these sub-systems will be described in this talk.
