National Synchrotron Light Source II is a third generation light source constructed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The project includes highly optimized 3 GeV electron storage ring, linac pre-injector and full-energy injector-synchrotron. Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics built turnkey booster for NSLS-II. The main parameters of the booster, its characteristics and the results of commissioning are described in this paper.

The current status of the hard X-ray and gamma sources, based on the Compton backscattering effect presented. The types of such sources - based on linacs, energy recovery accelerators, electron storage rings, the possibilities and prospects for the use of compact Compton radiation sources are discussed. The basic parameters of x-ray generator NESTOR, which is being run at the National Science Center "Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology Institute" are presented. The facility consists of the compact 40-225 MeV storage ring, linear 35-90 MeV electron accelerator as an injector, beam transportation system, Nd:Yag laser system and optical cavity. It is expected that the facility will generate X-rays flux of about 1013 phot/s.
