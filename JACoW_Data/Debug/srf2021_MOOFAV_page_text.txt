A new superconducting booster linac, so-called SRILAC, has been constructed at the RIKEN Nishina Center to upgrade the acceleration voltage of the existing linac in order to enable further investigation of new super-heavy elements and the production of useful RIs. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made from pure niobium sheets which operate at 4.5 K. We succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the required Q0 of 1E+9 with a wide margin. Installation of the cryomodule and He refrigerator system was completed by the end of FY2018, and the first cooling test was performed in September 2019. After various tests of the RF system, the beam acceleration was successfully commissioned in January 2020. In June 2020, the beam supply to the experiment was started. In this talk, I will report on the beam commissioning of SRILAC as well as the status of the frequency tuner and the differential pump system.

RAON, being constructed as the Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) since 2011 is a flagship heavy ion accelerator facility in Korea to promote fundamental science and application of isotope nuclei and related science. The installation of the heavy ion accelerator systems including injector, rare isotope (RI) production systems, and experimental systems are currently being progressed toward to commissioning of RAON, while the civil construction of the RAON site in Shindong, Daejeon of Korea, is going to finish in 2021. The superconducting LINAC with low energy, so-call SCL3 as the 1st phase will be commissioned on the December of 2021. The overview RAON accelerator facility and status of RISP are reported in this paper.

The CW superconducting linac CAFe (China ADS Front-end demo facility) at IMP was designed for 25 MeV protons aiming at the front-end demonstration of China ADS project in 2011 and constructed in 2017. Since then, the major upgradings have been made to accelerate the particles with A/q=2. It consists an RFQ for alphas, three cryomodules with 6 HWRs of beta 0.1 and one cryomudule with 5 taper-type HWRs of beta 0.15. It can accelerate protons to 20 MeV and alphas to 40 MeV. It took more than 3 years to improve the hardware and software to go after a higher beam power and higher availability during operation according to the lessens learned from several commissioning campaigns. At beginning of 2021, it achieved 10 mA and 205 kW continuous wave (CW) proton beam successfully. The beam availability remains 93%~96% during operation test in 12 hours at 174kW/10mA and in 108 hour at 126kW/7.3mA. This talk will report the progress of the CAFe with describing the operation experience and lessons learned including cavities, cryogenics, LLRF. The recent Nb/Cu cavity development at IMP will be also reported as an R&D topic for the future ADS.

We report here the recent progress of the activities for the preparation of the ESS cold linac components. The assembly of the series Spoke and Elliptical cryomodules is currently ongoing at CEA and IPNO, the test activities on the cryomodule prototypes have been completed and the series testing has started at the ESS testing facilities FREIA in Uppsala and Test Stand 2 at Lund. Status of the cavity fabrication and testing will be summarized. The experience of the commissioning of the testing facilities and the first results obtained on the series modules is presented and analyzed with respect to the vertical tests. For the elliptical cryomodules the TS2 results are compared with the CEA tests performed on the first three cryomodules of the series.

The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) project is an essential upgrade to Fermilab’s particle accelerator complex to enable the world’s most intense neutrino beam for LBNF/DUNE and a broad particle physics program for many decades to come. PIP-II will deliver 1.2 MW of proton beam power from the Main Injector, upgradeable to multi-MW capability. The central element of PIP-II is an 800 MeV linac, which comprises a room temperature front end followed by an SRF accelerator. The front end has been constructed and operated with (pulsed & CW) beam in the PIP-II Injector Test facility (PIP2IT). The SRF accelerator consists of five different types of cavities/cryomodules, including Half Wave Resonators (HWR), Single Spoke and elliptical resonators operating at state-of-the-art parameters. The first two PIP-II cryomodules, HWR and Single Spoke Resonator 1 (SSR1) are installed in PIP2IT and have accelerated beam to 17 MeV. PIP-II is the first U.S. accelerator project that will be constructed with significant contributions from international partners, including India, Italy, France, United Kingdom and Poland. The project was recently baselined, and site construction is underway

The European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) has been successfully operating for almost 4 years, and routinely delivering 6- to 14-KeV X-rays to users (30 KeV photon energy was demonstrated). At the heart of the machine is the 1.3 km long 1.3 GHz SCRF linac which can reach a maximum electron energy of 17.6 GeV, and is capable of accelerating up to 2700 bunches per RF pulse at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, delivering beam to 6 experiments via 3 SASE undulator sections. In this contribution, we relate on the linac operational experience and highlight some recent developments towards monitoring and improving operations and linac availability.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is an ac-celerator-based facility funded by the US Department of Energy for nuclear physics research. FRIB is nearing the end of technical construction, with first user beams ex-pected in Summer 2022. Key features are the delivery of a variety of rare isotopes with a beam energy of ’ 200 MeV/u and a beam power of up to 400 kW. The facility is upgradable to 400 MeV/u and multi-user capability. The FRIB driver linac consists of 324 superconducting resonators and 69 superconducting solenoids in 46 cry-omodules. FRIB is the first linac to deploy a large number of HWRs (220) and the first heavy ion linac to operate at 2 K. We report on the completion of production and in-stallation of the FRIB cryomodules and phased beam commissioning results.
