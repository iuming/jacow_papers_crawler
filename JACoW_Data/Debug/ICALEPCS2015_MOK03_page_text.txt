The Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) was opened to general users three years ago after more than five years of development. The beamline is now one of the most advanced instruments of this type in the world, designed to provide three major types of experiments: fast in-vivo imaging, computed tomography and radiation therapy. Advanced features which make it unique include high photon flux in the wide range of energies, large beam, direct link to the high performance cluster and others. These properties are achieved due to the state-of-art instrumentation and cooperative action of countless components. Their robust operation under the heavy load, high level of flexibility characteristic to the scientific activities and critical safety requirements dictate the exceptional demands on the control systems. In the short history of the user operation the IMBL proved to be an extremely powerful, sometimes irreplaceable, tool for various fields of science and industry. In this paper a brief overview of IMBL experiments is given and some of the recent results from biology, geology, palaeontology and medicine are presented. Concomitant challenges met by the control and IT teams are described.
