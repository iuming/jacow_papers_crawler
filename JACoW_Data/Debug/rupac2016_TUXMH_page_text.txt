Funding: The European XFEL is funded by the respective funding agencies of the contributing countries.
The European X-ray Free Electron Laser* in Hamburg, Germany, is being constructed by an international consortium. The facility is being built to offer photon beam of highest brilliance at wavelengths down to below 1 Angstrom. The accelerator complex with all its sections, the injector, the 17.5 GeV superconducting linac, bunch compressors, beam distribution systems etc. was built under the leadership of DESY. Seventeen European research institutes contributed to the accelerator complex and to the comprehensive infrastructure. DESY coordinates the European XFEL Accelerator Consortium but also contributes with many accelerator components, and the technical equipment of buildings, with its associated general infrastructure. With the finishing of the accelerator installation in autumn 2016, the first cool-down of the superconducting linac was started. Commissioning is next with the goal to demonstrate first lasing in spring 2017. Users are expected to use the first photon beams in 2017. A project overview and the status will be given illustrating the success of the collaborative work.

High-power free electron laser (FEL) facility NovoFEL has been created at Budker INP. Its wavelength can be tuned over a wide range in terahertz and infrared spectrum regions. As a source of electron bunches this FEL uses multi-turn energy recovery linac which has five straight sections. Three sections are used for three FELs which operate in different wavelength ranges (the first one - 90-240 microns, the second - 37-80 microns and the third - 5-20 microns). The first and the second FELs were commissioned in 2003 and 2009 respectively. They operate for users now. The third FEL is installed on forth accelerator track which is the last one and electron energy is maximal here. It comprises three undulator sections and 40 m optical cavity. The first lasing of this FEL was obtained in summer, 2015. The radiation wavelength was 9 microns and average power was about 100 watts. The designed power is 1 kilowatt at repetition rate 3.75 MHz. Radiation of third FEL has been delivered to user stations recently. The third FEL commissioning results as well as current status of the first and second FELs and future development prospects are presented.
