The European Spallation Source (ESS) aims to build and commission a 2 MW proton linac ready for neutron production in 2025. The normal conducting section of the ESS linac is designed to accelerate a 62.5 mA proton beam to 90 MeV at 14 Hz. The section consists of a microwave ion source, Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and 5-tank Drift Tube Linac (DTL). All sections are provided to ESS by in-kind partners across Europe. This paper reports the recent progress on the assembly, installation, testing and commissioning of the ESS normal conducting linac.

The ESS Target Proton Beam Imaging System has as objective to image the 5 MW ESS proton beam as it enters the spallation target. The Imaging System has to operate in a harsh radiation environment, leading to a number of challenges : development of radiation hard photon sources, long and aperture-restricted optical paths and fast electronics required to provide rapid information in case of beam anomalies. This paper outlines how main challenges of the Imaging System have been addressed, and the status of deployment as ESS gets closer to beam.

A new maintenance-free, high current, high duty-factor H− linac pre-injector is being commissioned for the ISIS pulsed spallation neutron and muon facility. As well as delivering a low emittance-growth, loss-free beam, the pre-injector incorporates a chopper to facilitate arbitrary bunch time-structures. A 50 Hz, 0.9 ms (4.5% duty factor) RF-driven H− ion source operates extremely reliably and with a large available parameter space via a novel microwave ignition gun and a wideband solid-state RF amplifier. A 202.5 MHz medium energy beam transport (MEBT) incorporates eight quadrupole magnets with integrated xy steerers, four quarter-wave re-bunching cavities, four extremely compact beam position monitors and an electrostatic chopper in just two metres of footprint. Beam has been extracted from the ion source and MEBT commissioning is due Spring 2023. Thereafter, the entire pre-injector will be soak-tested offline for a year before installing on the user facility.

The Alvarez-type post-stripper DTL at GSI accelerates intense ion beams with A/q <= 8.5 from 1.4 to 11.4 MeV/u. After more than 45 years of operation it suffers from aging and its design does not meet the requirements of the upcoming FAIR project. The design of a new 108 MHz Alvarez-type DTL has been completed and series components for the 55 m long DTL are under production. In preparation, a first cavity section as First of Series has been operated at nominal RF-parameters. Additionally, a prototype drift tube with internal pulsed quadrupole has been built and operated at nominal parameters successfully. High quality of copper-plating of large components and add-on parts has been achieved within the ambitious specifications. This contribution summarizes the current project status of Alvarez 2.0 at GSI and sketches the future path to completion.

Magnetron RF power sources for single cavities can cost much less and operate at much higher efficiency than klystrons, but they do not have the phase and amplitude control, or the lifetime, needed to drive SRF cavities for superconducting particle accelerators. Existing magnetrons that are typically used to study methods of control or lifetime improvements for SRF accelerators are built for much different applications such as kitchen microwave ovens (1kW, 2.45 GHz) or industrial heating (100 kW, 915 MHz). Muons, Inc. is working with Richardson Electronics LLC to develop fast and flexible manufacturing techniques to allow many ideas to be tested for construction variations that enable new phase and amplitude injection locking control methods, longer lifetime, and inexpensive refurbishing resulting in the lowest possible life-cycle costs. A magnetron suitable for 1497 MHz klystron replacements at Jefferson Lab has been designed, constructed, and tested.

This work is focused on the anomalous skin effect in copper and how it affects the efficiency of copper-cavities in the temperature range 40-50 K. The quality factor Q of three coaxial cavities was measured over the temperature range from 10 K to room temperature in the experiment. The three coaxial cavities have the same structure, but different lengths, which correspond to resonant frequencies: around 100 MHz, 220 MHz and 340 MHz. Furthermore, the effects of copper-plating and additional baking in the vacuum oven on the quality factor Q are studied in the experiment. The motivation is to check the feasibility of an efficient, pulsed, ion linac, operated at cryogenic temperatures.

The PIP2IT accelerator was assembled in multiple stages in 2014 - 2021 to test concepts and components of the future PIP-II linac that is being constructed at Fermilab. In its final configuration, PIP2IT accelerated a 0.55 ms x 20 Hz x 2 mA H− beam to 16 MeV. To determine location of the beam loss in the accelerator’s low-energy part, where radiation monitors are ineffective, a method using oscillating trajectories was implemented. If the beam is scraped at an aperture limitation, moving its centroid with two dipole correctors located upstream and oscillating in sync, produces a line at the corresponding frequency in spectra of BPM sum signals downstream of the loss point. Comparison of these responses along the beam line allows to find the loss location. The paper describes the method and results of its implementation at PIP2IT.

The mechanism of space charge compensation given by the residual gas ionization is a key factor for the emittance containment in the low energy beam transport (LEBT) lines of high intensity hadron injectors. A typical front end including a microwave Ion source, a LEBT and Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), is equipped with two repellers at each interface to prevent electrons from flowing back, to the source, or forward, to the RFQ. In this paper we will emphasize the importance of the ion Source and LEBT repellers on giving the appropriate boundary conditions for the space-charge compensation building-up mechanism. The theory and simulations are supported by experiments performed in the high intensity facility such as ESS and IFMIF/EVEDA.

The SNS Beam Test Facility research program is focused detailed studies of beam distributions for medium-energy ion beams, with the goal of reconstructing realistic 6D bunch distributions to enable halo prediction. For complete characterization of the initial distribution, scan time scales exponentially with scan dimension. Currently, a full 6D measurement with ~10 points across most dimensions requires 30 hours. However, measurement of the 5D distribution f(x, x’,y,y’,w) can be done very rapidly using a hybrid slit/screen method. This approach requires ~4 hours to obtain at least 32 points/dimension, with very high resolution (0.5 keV) in the energy distribution. This presentation reports on the approach and results for 5D characterization of the initial RFQ-formed bunch. This includes higher-resolution views of previously reported transverse-longitudinal dependence and additional interplane dependencies that were not previously reported.
