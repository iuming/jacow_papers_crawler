The construction of the ESS accelerator is in full swing. Many key components have been delivered from our in-kind partners and installation, testing and commissioning is making remarkable progress. The first machine section to be commissioned with beam is the Normal Conducting Linac (NCL). When completed, a 14 Hz, 2.86 ms proton beam up to 62.5 mA will be transported from the Ion Source, through the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) line, the Radiofrequency Quadrupole (RFQ), the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) line and the five Drift Tube Linac (DTL) tanks up to 90 MeV where it will be injected in the first superconducting module of the machine. This paper will highlight recent progress across the NCL, present briefly the first commissioning results and discuss the upcoming phases as well as challenges in delivering a machine capable of meeting the requirements for a next generation spallation neutron facility.

Various Gabor-Lenses (GL) were investigated at Goethe University. Confinement of sufficient electron densities (ne~1E15m3) were reached without any external source of electrons. Focusing of ion beams by low energy was demonstrated, long term stability and reproducibility were approved. Main differences compared to experiments and investigations of the pure non-neutral in Penning-Malmberg traps are higher residual gas pressure and therefore higher collision rates, higher bulk temperatures, self-sustaining electron production process, much higher evaporation cooling rate. GL2000 is a new 2m long device and was mainly designed for focusing of ion beams in energy ranges up to GeV but also for investigation of non-neutral plasma parameters. The confined electron column is much longer compared to previous constructed Lenses. This makes ion and hadron beam focussing much more efficient, in addition new physical phenomena can be expected and investigated. Simulation results of steady- and thermal equilibrium states with various external parameters and first measurements will be presented. The first operational tests show that it is possible to confine a two-meter long electron column.

At GSI a prototype electron lens for space charge (SC) compensation is currently being designed and main components as the RF-modulated electron gun are already under commissioning. The goal of this project is the (partial) compensation of SC forces within the ion beam by an overlapping electron beam. This may help to increase the intensity of primary beams, especially in the FAIR facility and potentially all large synchrotrons operated at the SC limit. For an effective SC compensation, the generated electron beam needs to follow the transverse and longitudinal beam profile of the ion bunch structure. The requirements are maximum currents of 10 A and grid modulation to cover a broad frequency range from 400 kHz to 1 MHz. The RF-modulated electron gun was designed and manufactured in the scope of the ARIES collaboration and is currently being tested at the E-Lens Lab of Goethe University Frankfurt. A dedicated test bench was built for commissioning of the major e-lens components and diagnostics. In this contribution the overall set-up will be presented putting special emphasis on the beam dynamics and collector design as well as as well as simulation results of the electron gun.

The J-PARC Main Ring (MR) is a high intensity proton accelerator and delivers 30 GeV proton beams for the long-base line neutrino experiment and the hadron experiments. At present, the beam intensity supplied to the neutrino experiment reached 520 kW with a cycle time of 2.48 s. Toward the design beam power of 750 kW and future goal of 1.3 MW, we chose shortening the MR operation cycle. Accelerating time is shortened in order to shorten the cycle, so a high accelerating voltage is required. Therefore, it is necessary to upgrade the RF systems. This RF upgrade expands the current nine RF systems to a total of thirteen. We are planning to fabricate four RF power sources and add four additional cavities that are recombined with existing cavities. The present status and upgrade plan of the MR RF systems are reported.

We discuss design considerations for a circular ion trap based on electromagnetic and particle beam simulations. This is a circular radiofrequency quadrupole (rfq) being designed for quantum information applications. The circular rfq should have good electromagnetic properties to accumulate and store the beam for prolonged times, while providing apertures for laser cooling and lower voltage electrodes to provide control over the beam. We use the electromagnetic and particle-in-cell software VSim, which uses finite difference time-domain and particle-in-cell methods, together with high performance computing tools.

The High Intensity Proton Accelerator (HIPA) cyclotron at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) delivers 590 MeV CW proton beam with a maximum power of 1.42 MW. After extraction, the beam is transferred in a 120 m long channel towards two target stations (TgM and TgE) before depositing its remaining power at the spallation target SINQ for neutron production. As part of the High Intensity Muon Beamline (HIMB) feasibility study, which belongs to the IMPACT (Isotope and Muon Production using Advanced Cyclotron and Target technologies) initiative, the first of these targets will be replaced with a thicker one and its geometry opti- mized thereby specifically boosting the emission of surface muons. In order to assess the impact of the changes on the proton beamline, BDSIM/GEANT4 simulations were performed with the realistic technical design of the target insert, the collimation system was redesigned and the power depositions were benchmarked with MCNP6. In this paper, we discuss the major changes and challenges for HIMB as well as the key considerations in redesigning the optics of the high power beam in the vicinity of the target stations.

The intensity frontier has called for new initiatives in hadron accelerator design in order to accommodate space charge dominated beams. Octupoles are often used to damp beam instabilities caused by space charge, however the insertion of octupole magnets leads to a nonintegrable lattice which reduces the area of stable particle motion. One proposed solution is Quasi-Integrable optics (QIO), where the octupoles are inserted between sections of a specific lattice insertion called a T-insert. An octupole with a strength that scales as 1/beta3(s) is applied in the drift region, where the horizontal and vertical beta functions are equal, to create a time independent octupole field. This leads to a lattice with a time-independent Hamiltonian which is robust to small perturbations. IBEX is a Paul trap which allows the transverse dynamics of a collection of trapped particles to be studied, mimicking the propagation through multiple quadrupole lattice periods, whilst remaining stationary in the laboratory frame. In order to test QIO at the IBEX experiment, it has recently undergone an upgrade to allow for the creation of octupole fields. We present our design of the IBEX experiment upgrade along with simulation results of our proposed experiment to test QIO with space charge.

A Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) initiative was recently established at CERN to exploit the full scientific potential of its accelerator complex and scientific infrastructure to tackle fundamental open questions in particle physics through experiments complementary to those in current and future colliders. This initiative brings together similar studies to optimize resources globally in order to reach a common goal and promote scientific development efficiently. In this work, we present the work performed by the Conventional Beam Working Group (CBWG) and specifically from the Neutrino Beams (NB) subgroup. The subgroup currently deals with two novel neutrino-tagged beams projects, ENUBET and NUTAG, as well as with a more classic, low energy, beamline dedicated to hadron cross-sections for neutrino beams with the NA61 experiment already installed in the H2 beamline of the CERN North Area. This contribution will detail the advances made with these three projects as well as their status and future plans.

The preparation and follow-up of CERN accelerator complex programmed stops require clear processes and methodologies. The LHC and its Injectors were stopped in December 2018, to maintain, consolidate and upgrade the different equipment of the accelerator chain. During the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2), major projects were implemented such as the LHC Injectors upgrade and the LHC Dipoles Diodes consolidation. The installation of some equipment of the HL-LHC project took also place. This paper presents the application to the LS2 of the processes and tools to managed CERN programmed stops: it covers the preparation, implementation and follow up phases, as well as the KPIs, the tools used to build a coherent schedule and to follow up and report the progress. The description of the methodology to create a linear schedule, as well the construction of automatised broken lines and progress curves are detailed. It also describes the organizational set-up for the coordination of the works, the main activities and the key milestones. The impact of the COVID-19 on the long shutdown will be described, especially the strategy implemented to minimise its consequences.

The operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN started in September 2008. Every 5 or 6 years, Long Shutdowns (LS) are programmed to execute time-intensive ordinary and extra-ordinary maintenance of the LHC and its injectors. The second LS (LS2) started in December 2018 and was completed end 2020 for the injectors and early 2022 for the LHC. A huge number of maintenance, consolidation and upgrade activities, especially the upgrade of the injectors complex, were performed with challenges at various levels, from technical, to organizational and managerial. This paper presents the applied methodology put in place by the Accelerator Coordination & Engineering (EN-ACE) Group, in charge of the technical coordination of the activities for the interventions and changes to the LHC and its injectors, to ensure that the installation activities are performed safely, meeting the required high level of quality, while optimizing the schedule. It highlights key points of success and lessons learnt in terms of general coordination, quality assurance, configuration and layout management, spatial integration, planning and scheduling, operational safety, logistics and worksite coordination

After the successful implementation of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project, studies were conducted in the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) in order to assess the intensity reach with the increased beam brightness. The studies focused on the high intensity beams delivered to the PSB users, both at 1.4 and 2 GeV. In addition, possible intensity limitations in view of the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study were investigated. To this end, various machine configurations were tested including different resonance compensation schemes and chromaticity settings in correlation with the longitudinal parameters. This paper summarizes the results obtained since the machine recommissioning.

The PS Booster (PSB) is the first synchrotron in the injection chain for protons. The beams produced for the LHC and various fixed target experiments cover a very large parameter space. Over the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2), the PSB was heavily upgraded as part of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project. The low-level RF systems now drive the new Finemet-loaded cavities, control RF synchronisation for the new injection mechanism, and cope with the increased injection and extraction energies. The Finemet cavities provide exceptional flexibility, allowing an arbitrary distribution of voltage at different revolution frequency harmonics, but at the cost of significant broadband impedance. The new injection mechanism allows bunch-to-bucket multi-turn injection, which significantly reduces the amount of beam loss at the start of the cycle. The longitudinal beam production schema for each beam-type was developed based on simulations during LS2, and then adapted during the setting-up phase to suit the final operational configuration. This paper discusses the commissioning of the new LLRF, and the consequences of the LIU upgrades on the production of various beams.

Over CERN’s Long Shutdown 2, the conventional ferrite-loaded cavities of the PS Booster were replaced with wide-band Finemet-loaded cavities. The Finemet cavities bring many operational advantages, but also represent a significant broadband impedance source. The impedance is mitigated by servo loops, which suppress the induced voltage, reducing the impedance as seen by the beam. Accurately including the impedance of the cavity and the effect of the servoloops in longitudinal tracking simulations is essential to predict the performance with beam. This paper discusses the results of a measurement campaign, which is intended to give a direct measurement of the cavity impedance. Using the detected voltage and the measured beam profile, the cavity impedance can be inferred and used to improve beam dynamics modelling.

The Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will accelerate protons and heavy ions up to a proton energy of 275 GeV and an Au+79 110 GeV/u to collide with electrons of energies up to 18 GeV. To accomplish the acceleration process, the hadrons are pre-accelerated in the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS), extracted, and transferred to HSR for injection. The planned area for injection is the current Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) 4 o’clock straight section. To inject hadrons, a series of modifications must be made to the existing RHIC 4 o’clock straight section to accommodate for the 20 new ~18 ns injection kickers and a new injection septum, while providing sufficient space and proper beam conditions for polarimetry equipment. These modifications will be discussed in this paper.

The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) will be composed of the current Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) yellow ring sextants with the exception of the 1 o’clock and the 11 o’clock arc. These two arcs use the existing blue ring inner (1 o’clock) and outer (11 o’clock) magnetic lattice for 275 GeV proton operation. The inner yellow 11 o’clock arc is used for 41 GeV energy operation. A switching magnet must be used to guide the hadron beam from the low and high energy arc respectively into the shared arc. This report provides the necessary lattice configuration, magnetic fields, and optics for the 10 o’clock utility straight section (USS) switchyard for both high and low energy configuration while providing the necessary space allocations and beam specifications for accelerator systems such as an additional radiofrequency cavity and beam dump.

The ECR ion sources are widely used to produce high intensities of highly charged positive ions*. To increase their performance further, several techniques are employed. The addition of a lighter gas into the main plasma (so-called gas mixing) shows a substantial effect on the charge state distribution of highly charged ions. Although many theoretical models were used to explain this gas mixing effect, yet it is not fully understood. The low energy ion beam facility (LEIBF) at Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi, India, which comprises a 10 GHz all-permanent magnet NANOGAN ECR source placed on a high voltage platform (400kV) has been used to develop several plasmas for the physical understanding of ions production and their confinement in a strong magnetic field**. Further, the LEIBF allows us to extract ion beams from the plasma in the energy range of a few keV to tens of MeV for novel ion-matter interaction experiments. In this paper, the charge state distribution studies (relevant to gas mixing effect) of various atomic species at optimized ion source tuning parameters along with some interesting results on materials synthesis/modification using ion beams is presented.

The negative ion source development has reached performances very close to those required by the ITER project; see for example the test facility ELISE results*. A main residual problem seems to be the great amount of co-extracted electrons in the top part of the source. The introduction of a magnetic filter to remove the electrons from the extraction zone of the source causes ExB particle drifts (or shifts) which move both ions and electrons towards the top (or bottom depending on the B direction); in the top part the electron concentration and extracted current increase and that limits the extracted ion amount. In this contribution, as a possible solution, the application of a Planar Ion Funnel (PIF) extraction electric field configuration** on the source exit is proposed. The electric field line shape of PIF configuration, not only should break the perpendicularity between the magnetic filter B and the extraction electric field E in such a way to prevents the ExB particle drifts, but also should give a more efficient field shape for the H-/D- extraction. Preliminary simulations of D- and e- trajectories are presented to confirm the efficiency of the PIF system.

With the higher stored energy envisioned for future heavy-ion runs in the LHC and the challenging fragmentation aspect of heavy-ion beams due to interaction with collimator material, the need arises for even more performing collimation systems. One promising solution is crystal channeling, which is used in the HL-LHC baseline and starts with Run III for heavy-ion collimation. To investigate an optimal configuration for the collimation system, a well-tested simulation setup is required. This work shows the simulations of channeling and other coherent effects in the SixTrack-FLUKA Coupling simulation framework and compares simulated loss patterns with data from previous beam tests.

A laser ion source (LION) at Brookhaven National Labor-atory (BNL) has been operational since 2014 to provide low charge state heavy ions of various species for Rela-tivistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). Pulsed ion beams (100~300 µs) with beam current ranging from 100 µA to 1 mA from any solid-state targets can be supplied without memory effect of previous beams at pulse-by-pulse basis. LION is an essential device for the operation of a galactic cosmic ray simulator at NSRL together with high-performance beams for RHIC. Because the importance of LION has been widely recognized, an upgraded version of LION, which is called LION2, is being developed for improved performance and reliability. The design and status of the LION2 will be shown.

Laser ion sources generate plasma and supply ions by focusing energy by light onto a solid surface. The ionization is achieved during the pulsed laser irradiation period. Then the plasma expands vertically from the target surface as it moves forward. Usually, this drift distance is chosen from tens of centimeters to several meters. Once the required pulse width and plasma density are met, an extraction electric field is applied. In most cases, this electric field is set in the same direction as the direction of the plasma. In this study, we experimentally verify how performance is achieved when the direction of the extraction field is at an angle to the direction of motion of the plasma. If the extraction field can be slanted without degradation of the ion source performance, it is considered to be able to shield neutral vapors and debris generated simultaneously with the plasma, which will be advantageous for the long-term operation of the laser ion source.

The temporal beam stabilization of slowly extracted beams from the synchrotron within several seconds is crucial for fulfilling the demands of fix-target experiments. Results from previous investigations suggest that the transit time spread can be increased by reducing the beam emittance in the plane of extraction. Increased transit time spread is known to cut-off high frequency noise introduced by magnet power supplies. A pilot experiment was performed at SIS18 at GSI to introduce transverse emittance exchange, resulting in the circulating beam’s smaller horizontal beam size. The improvement of the spillμstructure is reported in this contribution.

The Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre’s synchrotron makes use of the sextupole driven RF-KO method near the third-order resonance in order to slowly extract the beam that is delivered to the patients. The horizontal beam response of a coasting beam was studied experimentally and with simulations at extraction conditions in order to deduce regions of interest for an optimal excitation signal spectrum. Two narrow frequency regions were found were the beam reacts coherently. With these information an RF signal was proposed for the resonant slow extraction.

Since there are many magnets, it is necessary to be careful about failure. It is important to consider how to continue beam supply even if one of the septum mag-nets is missing. From July 2021, upgrade works of the FX septum magnets commenced with an aim of increasing the beam power of MR to 1.3 MW from 500 kW. We simulated the beam extraction without one of the septum magnets under the conditions of the new geometry of septum magnets and the new aperture. We found that the beam can be extracted by increasing the current of the surrounding septum magnets and compensating for the output.

We aim to supply a high-power proton beam of 1.3 MW to the neutrino facility from J-PARC Main Ring (MR) by shortening the repetition cycle to 1.16 s from 2.48 s and increasing the number of particles by 30%. The six sep-tum magnets for fast extraction (FX) need to be replaced to reduce the heat that is generated as a result of shorten-ing the repetition cycle. The replacement of the septum magnets began in July 2021 and was completed at the end of May 2022. The beam commissioning starts in June 2022. We report the details of the replacement work and operation test of the new septum magnets. We found a defect in the magnetic coil of the septum (SM32) in August 2021. We decided to postpone its installation to around August 2022 and produce new magnet coils for the SM32. The beam extraction in June 2022 will be per-formed using a temporary vacuum duct instead of the SM32 magnet, and the extraction beam orbit will be maintained by increasing the magnetic field of the other five septum magnets.

The Future Circular electron-positron Collider (FCC-ee) is proposed to operate in four modes, with beam energies from 45.6 GeV (Z-pole) to 182.5 GeV (tt-bar production) and luminosities up to 4.6×1036 cm2s-1. At the highest energies the beam lifetime would be less than one hour, meaning that top-up injection will be crucial to maximise the integrated luminosity. Two top-up injection strategies are considered here: conventional injection, employing a closed orbit bump and septum, and multipole-kicker injection, with a pulsed multipole magnet and septum. On-axis and off-axis injections are considered for both. We present a comparison of these injection strategies taking into account aspects such as spatial constraints, machine protection, disturbance to the stored beam and injection efficiency. We overview potential kicker and septum technologies for each.

ELENA is a small synchrotron ring that decelerates antiprotons down to a kinetic energy of 100 keV. With an experimental complex capable of housing up to 9 different experiments operating simultaneously, the transfer line design needed to be highly flexible. The low energy of the beam transported allowed the exploitation of electrostatic devices instead of magnets, to simplify design, production and operation. This contribution presents the systematic characterisation of the beam optics at the different experimental handover locations during beam commissioning using H− ions from an external source, as well as the performance of the lines in operation with antiprotons. Finally, the effect of stray fields created by the experimental setup will be presented and compared with the first measurements.

Resonant slow extraction from synchrotrons aims at providing constant intensity spills over timescales much longer than the revolution period of the machine. However, the extracted intensity is undesirably modulated by noise on the machine’s power converters with a frequency range of between 50 Hz and a few kHz. The impact of power converter noise can be suppressed by exploiting a Radio Frequency (RF) technique known as empty bucket channelling, which increases the speed at which particles cross the tune resonance boundary. In this contribution the implementation of empty bucket channelling in the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) is described via simulation and measurement. The technique was tested with both a resonant RF cavity and an inductive Finemet cavity, which can produce non-sinusoidal waveforms, to significantly reduce the low frequency noise observed on the extracted spill.

The Accelerators Validating Antimatter physics (AVA) project has enabled an interdisciplinary and cross-sector R&D program on low energy antimatter research. The network comprises 13 universities, 9 national and inter-national research centers and 13 partners from industry. Between 2016 and 2021, AVA has successfully trained 16 early-stage researchers that were based at universities, research centers and companies across Europe where they carried out cutting edge research into low energy antimat-ter physics and related technologies. This contribution presents several research highlights that originated within or on the basis of AVA: Results from studies into carbon nano-tubes as field emitters for cold electron beams with supe-rior beam quality, the design of a low energy negative ion injection beamline for experiments with antiprotonic atoms, and studies into realistic simulations of antiproton deceleration in foil degraders.

The seeded self-modulation (SSM) of long particle bunches for the generation of gigavolts-per-meter wakefields that can accelerate witness electron beams was first shown using the Super Proton Synchrotron beam as a driver by the AWAKE experiment. The stability of the produced microbunch trains over tens or hundreds of meters is crucial for extrapolating this scheme as proposed for use in several high energy plasma-based linear colliders. However, aside from the competing hosing instability, which has been shown to be suppressible by SSM when that process saturates, few works have examined other effects of transverse asymmetry in this process. Here, we use analytical modelling and 3D particle-in-cell simulations with QuickPIC to characterise the impact on the SSM growth process due to transverse asymmetry in the beam. A metric is constructed for asymmetry in simulation results, showing that the initial azimuthal complexity changes only slightly during SSM growth. Further, we show quantitative agreement between simulations and analytical predictions for the scaling of the reduction SSM growth rate with unequal aspect ratio of the initial beam profile. These results serve to inform planning and tolerances for both AWAKE and other SSM-based novel acceleration methods in the future.

Interaction of low-energy antiprotons with nuclear targets provided fundamental knowledge about proton and neutron densities of many nuclei through the capture process, cascade on lower electron orbits, and annihilation with the nucleon. The expelled electrons produce X-rays and with the recoil particles after annihilation, thus, a sufficient amount of information can be obtained about this interaction. However, all previous experiments were done via formation of antiprotonic atoms in solid or gaseous targets. Therefore, annihilation occurs prior reaching the S or P orbital levels and precise measurements are missing. Recently, AEgIS collaboration proposed a conceptually new experimental scheme. The creation of cold antiprotonic atoms in a vacuum guarantees the absence of the Stark effect. And with the sub-ns timing and synchronization, the previous experimental obstacles would be resolved. This will allow studying atomic properties, evolution, and fragmentation process with improved precision and extended lifetimes. In this contribution, we present an overview of the experimental scheme as well as various aspects of negative ion injection beamline into the AEgIS experiment.

The AD-ELENA complex decelerates antiprotons to ener- gies of 100 keV before transport to experiments through elec- trostatic transfer lines. Transfer line optics are traditionally designed from a lattice based approach and are unaffected by external effects. Presented is a method of rapidly proto- typing MAD-X simulations into G4Beamline models which propagate particles via electromagnetic fields rather than idealised optical lattice parameters. The transfer line to the ALPHA experiment is simulated in this approach. Due to the presence of fringe fields disagreement is found between the two models. Using an error minimisation technique, revised quadrupole strengths are found which improve agreement by 30% without any manual adjustment.

The Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) study investigates means of exploiting the potential of the CERN accelerator complex to complement the laboratory’s scientific programme at the main Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. The LHC fixed-target (FT) working group studies new experiments at beam energies up to 7 TeV. One of the proposed experiments is based on a bent crystal, part of the collimation hierarchy, to extract secondary halo particles and steer them onto a target. A second bent crystal immediately downstream of the target is used to study electric and magnetic dipole moments of short-lived baryons. The possibility to install a test stand in the LHC off-momentum collimation Insertion Region (IR3) to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this challenging scheme is currently under investigation. The integration of a spectrometer magnet into the present layout is particularly critical. In this contribution, we study a possible test setup that could be used in LHC Run 3.

LHC Beam Collimation During Extended β*-Levelling in Run 3

During the third operational Run of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, starting in 2022, the bunch population will be increased to unprecedented levels requiring to deploy β*-levelling of the luminosity over a wide range of values to cope with the limitations imposed by event pile-up at the experiments and heat load on the triplets induced by collision debris. During this levelling, both beam optics and orbit change in various areas of the ring, in particular around the high-luminosity experiments, where several collimators are installed. This requires adapting the collimation system settings adequately, in particular for the tertiary collimators (TCTs) that protect the inner-triplet magnets. To this end, two strategies are considered: keeping collimators at fixed physical openings while shifting their centres following the beam orbit, or varying also the collimator openings. The latter strategy is planned when the larger optics range will be deployed. In this paper, we investigate several loss scenarios at the TCTs in different steps of the levelling, and present the proposed collimator settings during Run 3.

The design of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) calls for using parts of both of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Blue and Yellow beamlines. With the HSR having to circulate low (41 GeV) and high (100+ GeV) energy hadron beams while matching the time of flight in the Electron Storage Ring (ESR), it becomes necessary for the ring lattice to switch from an outer arc to an inner arc in order to accommodate for the change in circumference. To do so, a switchyard is planned for installation in the HSR straight section at 12 o’clock with the other switchyard being placed in the straight section immediately downstream, 10 o’clock. The 12 o’clock straight section is simultaneously dedicated to the EIC 2-stage collimation system. The following reviews the layout constraints in the12 o’clock straight section that come with installing such a switchyard, along with the implications on the linear optics for that straight section at all HSR rigidities. The space allocation, twiss parameters and the mechanical requirements of the HSR betatron collimators that will be installed in this section are also discussed.

At present, one of diseases that kills many people worldwide is cancer. The FLASH radiotherapy (RT) is a promising cancer treatment under study. It involves the fast delivery of RT at much higher dose rates than those currently used in clinical practice. The very short time of exposure leads to the destruction of the cancer cells, while the nearby normal cells are less damaged as compared with conventional RT. This work focuses on study of FLASH-RT experiment using electron beams produced from the accelerator system at the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory. The structure and properties of our electron pulses with microbunches in picosecond time scale and macropulses in microsecond time scale match well to FLASH-RT requirement. To optimize the condition for experiment, the electron beam simulations are performed by varying energy, charge and bunch length. The 25 MeV electrons energy before hitting the window for 50 and 100 pC bunch length have a bunch length of 1.16 and 1.97 ps. The transverse rms beam sizes of 50 pC and 100 pC bunch charges have the differences between ASTRA and GEANT4 from 7.90 % to 34.0 %. The optimized electron beam properties from this study will be used as the guideline for further simulation and experiment preparation.

The matter-antimatter asymmetry might be understood by investigating the EDM (Electric Dipole Moment) of elementary charged particles. A permanent EDM of a subatomic particle violates time reversal and parity symmetry at the same time and would be, with the currently achievable experimental accuracy, an indication for further CP violation than established in the Standard Model. The JEDI-Collaboration (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) in Jülich has performed a direct EDM measurement for deuterons with the so called precurser experiments at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron). In order to understand the measured data and to disentangle an EDM signal from systematic effects, spin tracking simulations in an accurate simulation model of COSY are needed. Therefore a model of COSY was implemented using the software library Bmad. Systematic effects were considered by including element misalignments, effective dipole shortening and steerer kicks. These effects rotate the invariant spin axis additional to the EDM and have to be analyzed and understood. The most recent spin tracking results as well as the methods to find the invariant spin axis will be presented.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade project, the Beam Gas Ionisation (BGI) profile monitors installed in the Proton Synchrotron (PS) were fitted with a gas injection system capable of boosting the signal rate high enough to capture single turn acquisitions immediately after injection. This contribution reports on the studies carried out during the beam commissioning of the BGI system in a turn-by-turn matching monitor mode for its eventual implementation in an optimisation framework to preserve emittance during transfer between the PS Booster and PS. The BGI commissioning included a benchmarking with data from a wire-grid secondary emission monitor inserted into the circulating beam.

At the end of the 2018 run the intensity target for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) had just been reached at extraction from the Proton Synchrotron (PS). In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project additional RF improvements have been implemented during the 2019/2020 long shutdown (LS2), mainly impacting the impedance of the 10 MHz, 40 MHz, and 80 MHz RF systems. With the upgraded injection energy of 2 GeV (kinetic), also the intermediate plateau energy for RF manipulations has been increased. Following a campaign of beam studies throughout the 2021 run, a bunch intensity of up to 2.9·1011 p/b in trains of 72 bunches is achieved with the required longitudinal beam quality, surpassing the LIU target of 2.6·1011 p/b. The threshold of longitudinal quadrupolar coupled-bunch instabilities is increased during acceleration, but they are again observed at the flat-top. While dipolar coupled-bunch oscillations are well damped by a dedicated feedback system, the quadrupolar modes are suppressed by operating a 40 MHz system as an active higher-harmonic Landau cavity. The main commissioning steps are outlined, together with the key contributions to the improved beam performance.

In the Low Energy Ring (LER) for positrons in the SuperKEKB, a vertical beam size blow-up was observed when the bunch current was approximately 1 mA. If a beam size blow-up occurs, the design luminosity cannot be achieved. Therefore, beam size blow-ups must be pre-vented. According to calculations, the bunch current threshold of the Transverse Mode Coupling instability (TMCI) is 2 mA or more, and the observed value is 50% or smaller. This vertical beam size blow-up cannot be explained by ordinary TMCI. This paper shows that by analyzing factors such as beam oscillation, the cause of the vertical beam size blow-up was determined. The study results showed that the vertical beam size blow-up in the LER was caused by the oscillations of the -1 mode.

Beam instruments based on synchrotron light are an important part of the beam monitoring diagnostics suite in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In frame of the high luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC) additional synchrotron light diagnostics are demanded, too many to be covered by the present Beam Synchrotron-light Radiation Telescope (BSRT), which utilizes a fixed light extraction mirror. Therefore, an additional synchrotron light diagnostics setup is under development, now with a movable mirror to extract the synchrotron light emitted solely by a superconducting LHC dipole magnet. With higher bunch intensities anticipated in the HL-LHC, the beam induced power losses, and therefore local heat dissipation, play a critical role in the design of the extraction mirror. This paper summarizes the estimation of the bunched-beam induced power losses based on numerical simulations and RF measurements on a prototype light extraction mirror.

Since the Siam Photon Source (SPS) had an electron beam energy upgraded from 1.0 GeV to 1.2 GeV in 2005, the storage ring impedance measurements were done once in 2007. Two insertion magnet devices have been installed in the SPS storage ring during June to August 2013. There are several vacuum components added to the storage ring; these affect the ring impedance. Quantitative understanding of instabilities requires detailed knowledge of the impedance of the ring. For this purpose, the development of an impedance database is a necessity, where the wake potentials of each vacuum component are kept and maintained in a standard format. The self-describing data sets (SDDS) file format will be utilized to record components wake potentials. The wake potentials of each vacuum component can be obtained from a particle tracking simulation; a CST particle studio program will be used in the simulation process. The wake potentials can also be included in a beam dynamic tracking program such as ELEGANT to observe beam behaviors with these instabilities and find a curing means. The study results will be presented.

The Fermilab Recycler is an 8 GeV storage ring composed of permanent magnets that was crucial to the success of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider program. It is currently being used to slip-stack protons for the high energy neutrino program and to re-bunch protons for use in the Muon g-2 and Mu2e experiments. For the latter applications, the Recycler re-bunches each 1.6 µs "batch" from the Fermilab Booster into four 2.5 MHz bunches. For the Mu2e experiment, it is crucial that beam more than 125 ns from the nominal bunch center be suppressed by at least a factor of 1E-5. While bunch formation is currently in operation for the g-2 experiment, this out of time requirement has not been met, and the reason is not understood. This work presents a simulation of bunch formation in the Recycler, in an effort to understand the reason for this excessive out of time beam and to search for a way to reduce it.

Validated particle in cell (PIC) simulations of the DARHT Axis 1 injector have the potential to reduce accelerator downtime, assist experimental data analysis and improve accelerator tunes. To realize these benefits, the simulations must be validated with experimental results. In this work, the particle in cell code Chicago is used to simulate the injector region of the dual-axis radiographic hydrodynamic test facility (DARHT) first axis. These simulations are validated against experiment using measured anode-cathode voltage, beam current at three positions, optical transition radiation and previously calculated emittance. Since all of these measurements contain some variation, the respective simulation parameters are varied to understand their effect. The resulting simulated beam current distributions can then be compared to the measured 2RMS radius. This resulted in a reasonably well validated simulation model. Some inconstancy between simulated and measured results still exists, which future work will address.

SIRIUS is the new storage ring-based 4th generation synchrotron light source built and operated by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM). In ultralow emittance storage rings such as SIRIUS, the dominant contribution to the beam lifetime is due to large angle scattering between electrons within the same bunch, namely the Touschek effect. We used the strategy of storing two bunches simultaneously with different currents to measure their Touschek lifetime independently of other contributions, such as gas scattering. The measurements were carried out in different conditions of bunch current and RF voltage to compare the experimental results with those expected from theory and simulations for SIRIUS.

Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is emitted when the emitting structure is equal to or smaller than the observed wavelength. Consequently, these pulses are very short and most detectors respond with their impulse response, regardless of the pulse length and shape. Here we present single-shot measurements performed at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA) using a fast real-time oscilloscope and Schottky barrier detectors sensitive in the sub-THz range. The time response of this setup to CSR pulses emitted by electron bunches during the microbunching instability is shown to be sensitive to the shape of the electron bunch. Our results show how, in the future, the shape of electron bunches can be directly measured using a straightforward setup.

Past studies on the Transverse Mode Coupling Instability (TMCI) suggested that it can be suppressed in the presence of space-charge forces. Recent developments in this field show that for higher strength, space-charge forces leads to other types of instabilities. We investigate the characteristics of these instabilities by means of stability threshold measurements at the CERN SPS for various intensities, longitudinal and transverse emittances. These observations are compared to numerical tracking simulations.

In hadron synchrotrons, external sources of noise affecting the beam induce emittance growth through the mechanism of decoherence. Active feedbacks are often used to suppress this emittance growth. In the presence of beam-beam interactions, it was shown that coherent modes of oscillations with frequencies shifted outside of the incoherent spectrum significantly enhances the efficiency of the emittance growth suppression by active feedbacks. We show that the same enhancement of the emittance growth suppression may be driven by a beam coupling impedance generating a real tune shift larger than the detuning.

Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) is a pump-probe experimental technique that aims to image the structural changes that happen in a target structure due to photo-excitation. Development of MeV UED capabilities is one of the main objectives at Sealab, a superconducting RF accelerator facility being commissioned in Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. In order to perform UED experiments, the optimization of temporal resolution is of the utmost importance. The composition of the SRF Photoinjector, currently the main beam-line in Sealab, offers superb flexibility to manipulate the longitudinal phase-space of the electron bunch. At the same time, the CW operation of the accelerator provides an enhanced beam stability compared to warm guns, together with MHz repetition rates. This work aims to show the capacity of the SRF Photoinjector in Sealab to reach the required temporal resolution and explain the development and current status of the necessary tools to perform UED experiments at the facility.

We are designing a storage ring lattice for the future plan of UVSOR. As a candidate, we have designed a storage ring of 1 GeV electron energy, which is higher than the present value, 750 MeV. The magnetic lattice is based on a compact double bend achromat cell, which consists of two bending magnets and four focusing magnets, all of which are of combined function. The circumference is around 82.5 m. The emittance is around 4 nm in the achromatic condition, which becomes lower in the non-achromatic condition. The lattice of 6-fold symmetry has six straight sections of 4 m long and six of 1.5 m long. Undulators can radiate nearly diffraction-limited light in VUV. If we install high field multipole wiggler at the short straight sections, they can provide high flux tender X-rays. We are expecting the usage of a laser-based accelerator as the injector, which might be developed in the next decade. As an alternative plan, we have designed a traditional injector, which consists of a linear accelerator and a booster synchrotron and can be constructed inside of the storage ring.

In high-intensity high-brightness circular colliders such as the CERN LHC, coherent beam-beam effects and impedance cannot be treated independently. Coherent beam-beam dipole modes can couple with higher order head-tail modes and lead to the transverse mode coupling instability of colliding beams. This mechanism has been analysed in detail in the past through the eigenvalues, which describe the evolution of the beam oscillation mode-frequency shifts. In this contribution, the transverse mode coupling instability of colliding beams is studied using the eigenvectors, which describe the evolution of the intrabunch motion. As this instability exhibits several mode couplings and mode decouplings, the evolution of the intrabunch motion reveals quite some interesting features (such as a propagation of the traveling-wave not only from the head to the tail but also from the tail to the head and similar intrabunch signals for some mode coupling and mode decoupling), which are compared to past predictions in the presence of impedance only.

The coaxial wire method is a common and appreciated choice to assess the beam coupling impedance of an accelerator element from scattering parameters. Nevertheless, the results obtained from wire measurements could be inaccurate due to the presence of the stretched conductive wire that artificially creates the conditions for the propagation of a Transverse ElectroMagnetic (TEM) mode. The aim of this work is to establish a solid technique to obtain the beam coupling impedance from electromagnetic simulations, without modifications of the device under test. In this framework, we identified a new relation to get the resistive wall beam coupling impedance of a circular chamber directly from the scattering parameters and demonstrated that it reduces to the exact theoretical expression. Furthermore, a possible generalization of the method to arbitrary cross section geometries has been studied and validated with numerical simulations.

The Plasma-driven Attosecond X-ray source (PAX) project at FACET-II aims to produce attosecond EUV/soft x-ray pulses with milijoule-scale pulse energy via nearly coherent emission from pre-bunched electron beams. In the baseline approach*, a beam is generated using the density downramp injection scheme with a percent-per-micron chirp and 1e-4 scale slice energy spread. Subsequent compression yields a current spike of just 100 as duration which can emit 10 nm light nearly coherently due to its strong pre-bunching. In this work, we report simulation studies of a scheme to generate similarly short beams without relying on plasma injection. Instead, we utilize a high-charge beam generated at an RF photocathode, with its tail acting as the witness bunch for the wake. The witness develops a percent-per-micron chirp in the plasma which is then compressible downstream. The final bunch length demonstrated here is as short as 100 nm, and is limited primarily by emittance effects. The configurations studied in this work are available for experimental testing at existing PWFA facilities such as FACET-II.

Intrabeam scattering (IBS) is becoming an increasingly important effect in the design of high-brightness linear electron accelerators due to the ever-increasing transverse brightness of beams produced from radiofrequency photoinjectors. The existing theory describing the energy spread growth rate due to IBS was derived in the context of circular machines where the beam particles are frequently and randomly colliding, and therefore should only be applied to non-laminar, emittance dominated flow. This is not the case in the injector portion of a linear accelerator, where the beam is space-charge dominated and the flow is laminar. The different nature of the microscopic motion in the two cases demands a reevaluation of the applicability of IBS theory to the photoinjector. In this work, we present a simple analytic model for energy spread growth during perfectly laminar flow and show that it matches well to point-to-point multiparticle simulations. In this way we demonstrate that stochastic energy spread growth in laminar beams is more attributable to the initial random placement of the particles in the bunch rather than the traditional temperature rearrangement mechanism of IBS.
