A linac power upgrade program is now in progress after a successful recovery from the earthquake disaster. The power upgrade includes an ion source, an RFQ and a 400 MeV Annular-ring Coupled Structure (ACS) linac. We started a full-scale development of a cesium seeded RF-driven negative hydrogen ion source. The ion source extracted the beam of more than 60 mA with a duty factor of 2.5 %, which is satisfied with the requirement of the program. A new RFQ for 50 mA acceleration is under construction on the basis of a RFQ fabrication process, which was built as a backup for the present RFQ. Mass production of the ACS modules have almost completed. There is a plan to install these components and schedule the beam test in 2013. This presentation will cover the power upgrade status of the J-PARC linac.
