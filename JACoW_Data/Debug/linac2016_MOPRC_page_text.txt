Low energy neutron accelerator can be realized by the combination of an adiabatic fast passage spin flipper and a gradient magnetic field. Neutrons have magnetic moments, so that the accumulated potential energies are not cancelled before and after passage of a magnetic field and their kinetic energies change in case their spins are flipped in the field. This accelerator handles lower kinetic energy neutrons than approximately 300 neV. Currently we have developed the advanced version which makes it possible to handle broader kinetic energy range. The design and measured characteristics are described.

The Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) develops, tests and characterizes high brightness electron sources for FLASH and European XFEL. Since these FELs work with superconducting accelerators in pulsed mode, also the corresponding normal-conducting RF gun has to operate with long RF pulses. Generating high beam quality from the photocathode RF gun in addition requires a high accelerating gradient at the cathode. Therefore, the RF gun has to ensure stable and reliable operation at high average RF power, e.g. 6.5 MW peak power in the gun for 650 μs RF pulse length at 10 Hz repetition rate for the European XFEL. Several RF gun setups have been operated towards these goals over the last years. The latest gun setup was brought into the PITZ tunnel on February 10th 2016 and its RF operation started on March 7th. This setup includes RF gun prototype 4.6 with a new cathode contact spring design and an RF input distribution which consists of an in-vacuum coaxial coupler, an in-vacuum T-combiner and 2 RF windows from DESY production. In this contribution we will summarize the experience from the RF conditioning of this setup towards high average RF power and first experience from the operation with photoelectrons.

Normal conducting RF systems are currently able to pro-vide gradients of around 100 MV/m, limited by break-down on the metallic structures. The breakdown rate is known to scale with pulse length and, in conventional RF systems, this is limited by the filling time of the RF struc-ture. Progressing to higher frequencies, from RF to THz and optical, can utilise higher gradient structures due to the fast filling times. Further increases in gradient may be possible by replacing metallic structures with dielectric structures. The DATA programme at the Cockcroft Insti-tute is investigating concepts for particle acceleration with laser driven THz sources and dielectric structures, beam driven dielectric and metallic structures, and optical and infrared laser acceleration using grating and photonic structures. A cornerstone of the programme is the VELA and CLARA electron accelerator test facility at Daresbury Laboratory which will be used for proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating particle acceleration.

Beam based alignment (BBA) techniques are important tools for precise beam orbit correction of a high power linac, and supplement to the model based or orbit response matrix (ORM) based correction methods. BBA will be applied to beam orbit analysis and correction of the FRIB linac arcs where a beam orbit offset within 0.1 mm is required to the second order achromatic beam tuning. In this paper, we first introduce the study of model based beam orbit correction of the arc, and then a more precise orbit correction with BBA. Realistic misalignment of beam elements and beam position monitors (BPMs) are included in the simulation studies.

To achieve the design beam power for heaviest ion species, acceleration and transport of multi charge state beams simultaneously in the FRIB superconducting linac becomes necessary, which poses a technical challenge especially to the FRIB folded lattice design. Achromatic and isochronous beam optics up to the second order must be established precisely in the linac bending areas, and as none-perfection beam elements and system errors exist in the real machine, beam tuning and beam optics corrections of the bending area are important to high power operation. In this paper, we introduce the beam tuning algorithms of the FRIB linac achromatic arcs and also discuss the simulation studies.

Beam tuning and error analysis of a superconducting linac for heavy ion beams are introduced in this paper. In simulation studies with accelerator codes, system errors to the beam tuning are analyzed numerically, which include random cavity and magnet errors and measurement errors of absolute beam phase, beam bunch length, and beam transverse profiles. Simple statistical equations are developed from the tedious and time-consuming numerical simulations, and they may provide advantage tools not only to analyze a linac beam tuning, such as phase and amplitude tuning of superconducting cavity, longitudinal and transverse beam matching, but also will be very helpful to linac design with practical beam diagnostics system and authentic accelerator lattice.

One of the goals of the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) at CERN is to demonstrate the feasibility of the CLIC Drive Beam recombination, which takes place in the Drive Beam Recombination Complex (DBRC). The tight geometry of the DBRC together with its strong optics and the high energy-spread of the beam require a careful control of the beam size along the different sections of the DBRC. One of the main contribution to beam size is the dispersion. If uncontrolled, dispersion leads to fast increase of the beam size, hence it may affect the beam current stability of the combined beam. A tool has been implemented at CTF3 to measure and correct dispersion during and after the setup of the machine. Dispersion Free Steering (DFS) has been applied in the upstream drive beam LINAC, while Dispersion Target Steering (DTS) has been used in the rings of the DBRC. In the LINAC the weak optics and the wide dynamic aperture of the beamline allow a straightforward correction. In the DBRC the aperture is tighter, and the strong optics produce non-linear dispersion which one needs to take into account. A general overview of current status and future plans in controlling dispersion at CTF3 will be presented.

Simulating Apertures in the Uniform Equivalent Beam Model

The uniform equivalent beam model is useful for simulating particle beam envelopes. Beam root-mean-square (rms) sizes, divergences, and emittances of an equivalent uniform beam approximate well the rms properties of more realistic beam distributions, even in the presence of space charge. Envelope simulation codes for high current beams using the model, such as TRACE 3-D, are central to particle optics design. However, the modeling of apertures has required multi-particle simulation codes. Multi-particle codes do not typically have the fitting and optimization capabilities common to envelope codes, so the evaluation of aperture effects is often a secondary study that may result in further design iteration. To incorporate aperture effects into the optics design at the start, a method has been developed for simulating apertures in the context of a uniform equivalent beam. The method is described and its TRACE 3-D implementation is outlined. Comparisons with multi-particle simulations are used to validate the method and examine regions of applicability.

Accelerator beam simulation is crucial for the successful commissioning and operation of the FRIB linear accelerator. A primary requirement of the FRIB linear accelerator is to support a broad range of particle species and change states. Beam simulations must be performed for these various accelerator configurations and it is important the results be managed to ensure consistency and reproducibility. The FRIB Lattice-Model Service has been developed to manage simulation data using a convenient web-based interface, as well as, a RESTful API to allow integration with other services. This service provides a central location to store and organize simulation data. Additional features include search, comparison and visualization. The system architecture, data model and key features are discussed.

Tracking Based Courant-Snyder Parameter Matching in a Linac with a Strong Space-Charge Force
93

During the design of a hadron linac, matching at the interfaces of different structures or lattice periods is often performed with the linear approximation of the space-charge force. When space-charge is extremely strong, like in the low energy part of the proton linac of the European Spallation Source, such a matching method is not always good enough and could lead to a residual mismatch at the design level. To avoid this, a matching scheme based on iterations of tracking, thus including the full effect of the space-charge force, is developed. This paper presents the scheme itself as well as its application to the ESS linac.

A major challenge for high energy density physics is to measure properties of matter under extreme states of temperature and pressure that only occur in a time scale of 10 ns to 1 μs. Here we propose to use a single shot electron beam from an S-band photoinjector with enough energy to penetrate the material as a diagnostic capable of time resolution (< ns). In this paper, we report on the primary beam dynamics simulation of a S-band photocathode electron gun and accelerator that capable of producing up to 10 nC charge with high enough energy. Optimizations of the system parameters, including gun, focusing solenoid and acceleration field are performed using particle tracking code. The beam-line is designed to be installed in the Institute of Modern Physics(IMP) electron accelerator centre for high precision electron imaging experimental studies.

The new software FLAME has been developed to serve as physics model used for on-line beam commissioning applications. FLAME is specially designed to cover FRIB modeling challenges to balance between speed and precision. Several on-line beam commissioning applications have been prototyped based on FLAME and tested on the physics application prototyping environment. In this paper, components of the physics application prototyping environment are firstly described. Then, the design strategy and result of the four major applications: baseline generator, cavity tuning, orbit correction, transverse matching, are discussed.

RF-Track is a novel tracking code developed at CERN for the optimization of low-energy ion linacs in presence of space-charge effects. RF-Track features great flexibility and rapid simulation speed. It can transport beams of particles with arbitrary mass and charge even mixed together, solving fully relativistic equations of motion. It implements direct space-charge effects in a physically consistent manner, using parallel algorithms. It can simulate bunched beams as well as continuous ones, and transport through conventional elements as well as through maps of oscillating radio-frequency fields. RF-Track is written in optimized and parallel C++, and it uses the scripting languages Octave and Python as user interfaces. RF-Track has been tested successfully in several cases. The main features of the code and the results of its benchmark studies are presented in this paper.

CIADS (China Initiative Accelerator Driven System) 600MeV HEBT (High-Energy Beam Transport) will deliver 6 MW beam to the target, with CW (continuous wave) 10 mA beam. The most serious challenges are vacuum differential section and beam uniformization on the target. A novel collimation plus vacuum differential section is proposed in the lattice design. A scanning method is designed for the round beam uniformization on the target.

The FAIR facility at GSI requires a dedicated 70 MeV, 70 mA proton injector for the research program with intense antiproton beams. The main accelerator part consists of six 'Crossbar H-type' (CH) cavities operated at 325 MHz. Based on a linac layout carefully developed over several years, recently the beam dynamics has been revised with the scope of finalising the design and thus being able to start the construction of the main linac components. As compared to previous designs the MEBT behind the RFQ was slightly extended, the gap numbers per CH cavity and the voltage distributions were optimised and the layout of the intermediate diagnostics section including a rebuncher cavity at 33 MeV was redesigned. Finally, detailed machine error studies were performed in order to check the error response of the new design and the steering concept in particular. In the consequence, the final parameters obtained from the beam dynamics update are used for finalizing the CH-DTL cavity design by CST-MWS calculations.

SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species) is a facility intended for production of neutron-rich Radioactive Ion Beams (RIBs) at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN-LNL, Legnaro, Italy). Exotic nuclei production based on the ISOL (Isotope Separation On-Line) technology using UCx target. Neutron-rich nuclei will be generated by uranium fission under the influence of proton beam from cyclotron. After that, RIBs will be reaccelerated by the ALPI (Acceleratore Lineare Per Ioni). RFQ (Radio Frequency Quadrupole) will be used as a front-end part of the ALPI. Double drift double buncher system is planned to install before RFQ for increasing transmission. This article is dedicated to beam dynamic simulation and laying-out of transport line at section before ALPI.

A new semi-three-dimensional beam-tracking simulation code for electron injectors using bulk-to-point calculation technique for space charge fields is developed. The calculated space charge fields are not produced by a point charge but a doughnut which has the volume and whose cross-section is ellipsoid. Since the calculation noise which is usually caused by distributions of positions of point charge can be minimized, high accuracy calculation on emittance is realized with small number of electrons. Simultaneously, the calculation time becomes markedly shortened. In this paper, calculation examples for asymmetrical beams are demonstrated by the new code. The accuracy of emittance is also discussed.

SNRC and CEA collaborate to the upgrade of the SARAF accelerator to 5 mA CW 40 MeV deuteron and proton beams (Phase 2). CEA is in charge of the design, construction and commissioning of the superconducting linac (SARAF-LINAC Project). The SCL is made up of 4 cryomodules: the first two will host each 6 half-wave resonator (HWR) low beta cavities (β = 0.09) at 176 MHz; the last two will host each 7 HWR high-beta cavities (β = 0.18) at 176 MHz. The fully equipped cavity includes the niobium cavity with a helium tank, an input power couplers and a frequency tuning system. The final RF design of the low and high beta cavities will be presented in this poster, as well as the RF design of the couplers, the expected tuning range of the cavities and the multipactor analysis.

Surface roughness of current Niobium-3 Tin (Nb3Sn) superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) accelerator cavities can cause enhancement of the surface magnetic field. This enhancement can push the surface magnetic field beyond the critical field, which, if it occurs over a large enough area, can cause the cavity to quench. This paper presents simulations of the surface magnetic field enhancements in SRF cavities caused by the surface roughness of current Cornell Nb3Sn cavities, which have achieved record efficiency. Simple, smooth cavity geometry is defined and surface magnetic fields calculated using SLANS2. The cavity geometry is modified with a small rough region for which the geometry is determined from AFM scans of a Nb3Sn coated sample and the surface fields are calculated again. The calculated surface fields of the smooth and rough cavities are compared to determine the extent of the field enhancement, the area over which the enhancement is significant, and which surface features cause large field enhancement. We find that 1% of the surface analyzed has fields enhance by more than 45%. On average the Q-factor is increased by (3.8 ± 1.0) \%.

Hydrocarbons, which migrate from the vacuum bumps system, will absorb on the cavity surface after periods of operation. The contaminants can reduce the surface electron work function to enhance the field emission effect and restrict the cavity accelerating gradient. The room temperature in-situ plasma surface processing to clean the hydrocarbon contaminants can act as a convenient and efficient technology for the accelerator on line performance recovery. For better control of the discharge inside the cavity, the experiment works on a single HWR cavity aims to research the ignition between the swarm parameters (gas flow, pressure, forward power).

An accelerating structure is a critical component of particle accelerators for medical, security, industrial and scientific applications. Standing-wave side-coupled accelerating structures are used where available RF power is at a premium, while average current and average RF power lost in the structure are high. These structures are expensive to manufacture and typically require a circulator to divert structure-reflected power away from RF source, klystron or magnetron. In this report a traveling wave accelerating structure is presented which combines high shunt impedance of the side-coupled standing wave structure with such advantages as simpler tuning and manufacturing. In addition, the structure is matched to the RF source so no circulator is needed. This paper presents the motivation for this structure and shows a practical example.

Dry-Ice cleaning is today a well established cleaning method in matters of reducing harmful dark current and field emission in copper RF-structures like RF-Guns such as for the European XFEL, FLASH and REGAE. This led to the idea to clean longer RF-structures, in particular 3GHz transverse deflecting structures for the European XFEL. We developed a cleaning device with the possibility to clean up to 2 m long structures in horizontal position with an inner diameter of not more than 40 mm. Furthermore this device also allows to clean 9-cell TESLA-type Nb-cavities as well. A report of the technical layout and results of RF-tests will be given.
