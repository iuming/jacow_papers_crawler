Beam monitors developed and utilized at MR and RCS of J-PARC will be presented with emphasis on special characteristics for high intensity proton accelerator. Achieved beam characteristics and approach to improve beam intensity will be described in connection with the beam monitors. Usage of a transverse RF field to improve a duty factor of the slow extracted beam will be presented.
