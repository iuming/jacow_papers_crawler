SSC-LINAC control system is based on EPICS architecture. The sub control system of digital power supplies is a kind of IOC send and receive custom command via Ethernet and TCP/IP protocol. The old IOC is designed to use period scan mode IOC, and there are so many digital power supplies, that we can't make sure every connect condition of digital power supply is fine. IOC must wait a long time if one of them can't connect correctly and other digital power supply's PV may also be blocked. An IOC that uses interrupt driven mode to avoid the shortcoming was designed. This will be described in this paper.

The MCOR-12[Magnet Corrector] is a 16-channel modular architecture, precision magnet driver, capable of providing bipolar output currents in the range from 12A to +12A. A single, unregulated bulk power supply provides the main DC power for the entire crate. Currently the MCORs have a 1000ppm regulation on the B-field. The MCOR controller card upgrades, existing LCLS-I and future LCLS-II needed, controls for Magnet Corrector Power Supplies. The project shifts the existing functionality of the VME based DAC and SAM and an Allen Bradley PLC into a new slot-0 card residing in the MCOR chassis. Elimination of the VME crate and the PLC will free up rack space to be used in future. The new interface card has a long term stability of 100 ppm and monitors ground fault currents and various other interlocks for the MCOR power supplies. The controller can interface to EPICS Channel Access and Fast Feedback system at SLAC using two Gigabit Ethernet ports and has an FPGA based EVR for getting 'time stamps' from the Event Generator system at SLAC. The EPICS control system along with embedded diagnostic features will allow for enhanced remote control and monitoring of the power supplies.

The Controls Configuration Service (CCS) is a key component in CERN's data driven accelerator Control System.  Based around a central database, the service also provides a range of client APIs and user interfaces - enabling configuration of controls for CERN's accelerator complex.  The service has existed for 35 years (29 based on Oracle DBMS). There has been substantial evolution of the CCS over time to cater for changing requirements and technology advances.  Inevitably this has led to increases in CCS complexity and an accumulation of technical debt.  These two aspects combined have a negative impact on the flexibility and maintainability of the CCS, leading to a potential bottleneck for Control System evolution.   This paper describes on-going renovation efforts (started mid-2014) to tackle the aforementioned issues, whilst ensuring overall system stability.  In particular, this paper covers architectural changes, the agile development process in place - bringing users close to the development cycle, and the deterministic approach used to treat technical debt.  Collectively these efforts are leading towards a successful renovation of a core element of the Control System.

SLAC's Low Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) controls software for the S-Band deflecting structures needed to be upgraded significantly when a new X-Band transverse deflecting cavity (XTCAV) was installed downstream of the LCLS undulators in Spring 2013 to assist in FEL diagnostics such as characterizing the temporal profile of X-ray pulses that vary shot-to-shot. The unique location of the XTCAV in the beamline posed several challenges. A new design of the Modulator and Klystron control Support Unit (MKSU-II) for interlocking was added at the XTCAV controls station that required new software development. The timing setup was also different from the rest of the Linac. This paper outlines the LLRF controls layout for the XTCAV and discusses the manner in which the challenges were addressed. XTCAV has now become a successful tool for gathering data that enables reconstruction of X-ray FEL power profiles with greater resolution.

Wire scanners are a main diagnostic tool for transverse beam size and emittance measurements at LCLS. The original SLAC wire scanners were not optimized for speed (taking minutes to scan), and can't perform at the desired level of position resolution necessary for measuring LCLS' small beam size. A new fast wire scanner, based on a dc linear servo motor, has been designed and installed in the LCLS. The new fast wire scanner has several advantages over the original wire scanner: scan times are reduced from minutes to seconds while minimizing wire vibrations. Rather than counting open-loop step pulses, the new fast wire scanner uses real time position capture for beam synchronous sampling of the wire position, enhancing beam profile accuracy.

The first long shutdown of the Large Hadron Collider (LS1, 2013-2015) provided an opportunity for significant upgrades of the detector control and safety systems of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter. A thorough evaluation was undertaken, building upon experience acquired during several years of detector operations. Substantial improvements were made to the monitoring systems in order to extend readout ranges and provide improved monitoring precision and data reliability. Additional remotely controlled hardware devices and automatic software routines were implemented to optimize the detector recovery time in the case of failures. The safety system was prepared in order to guarantee full support for both commercial off-the-shelf and custom hardware components throughout the next accelerator running period. The software applications were modified to operate on redundant host servers, to fulfil new requirements of the experiment. User interface extensions were also added to provide a more complete overview of the control system. This paper summarises the motivation, implementation and validation of the major improvements made to the hardware and software components during the LS1 and the early data-taking period of LHC Run 2.

Historically Diamond's photon front-ends have adopted control systems based on the VMEbus platform. With increasing pressure towards improved system versatility, space constraints and the issues of long term support for the VME platform, a programme of migration to distributed remote I/O control systems was undertaken. This paper reports on the design strategies, benefits and issues addressed since the new design has been operational.

The Detector and Run Control systems for the NA62 experiment, which started physics data-taking in Autumn of 2014, were designed, developed and deployed in collaboration between the Physics and Engineering Departments at CERN. Based on the commonly used control frameworks, UNICOS and JCOP, they were developed with scarce manpower while meeting the challenge of extreme agility, evolving requirements, as well as integration of new types of hardware. This paper presents, for the first time, the architecture of these systems and discusses the challenges and experience in developing and maintaining them during the first months of operation.

Almost 200 controls applications, in domains like LHC magnet protection, cryogenics and vacuum systems, cooling-and-ventilation or electrical network supervision, have been developed and are currently maintained by the CERN Industrial Controls Group in close collaboration with several equipment groups. The supervision layer of these systems is based on the same technologies as 400 other systems running in the LHC Experiments (e.g. WinCC Open Architecture, Oracle). During the last two-year LHC Long Shutdown 1, the 200 systems have been successfully migrated from a file-based archiver to a centralized infrastructure based on Oracle databases. This migration has homogenized the archiving chain for all CERN systems, and at the same time has presented a number of additional challenges. The paper presents the design, the necessary optimizations and the migration process that allowed us to meet unprecedented data-archiving rates (unachievable for the previously used system), and liaise with the existing long-term storage system (LHC LoggingDB) to assure data-continuity.

In preparation of FAIR, several well-established beam instrumentation systems of the GSI heavy-ion synchrotron SIS18 and its connected high-energy beam transfer lines (HEBT) have to be modernized. In this contribution, the data acquisition upgrade of particle detectors such as ion chambers and plastic scintillators is described. This covers the replacement of an outdated custom-built readout- and control hardware by modern FMC (FPGA mezzanine card) based I/O hardware, new multi-channel high voltage power supplies and a new data acquisition system (DAQ) for the VME based scalers. The latter will replace the old Kylix-based ABLASS software by LASSIE (Large Analog Signal and Scaling Information Environment) to fit into the new FAIR control system concept. LASSIE is based on FESA (Front End Software Architecture). FESA was originally developed by CERN and enhanced by GSI-specific modifications. Furthermore, the new particle detector DAQ will be able to take full advantage of the new FAIR timing system which is based on the White Rabbit protocol.

The update of control system at the SAGA Light Source storage ring power supplies is in progress for improving the ramp-up speed (from 255 MeV to 1.4 GeV) and for easily changing the stored beam energy. By replacing the CPU unit of PLC used for control of the power supplies, the ramp-up time was reduced from 4 to 2 minutes in a test bench prepared for the upgrade system. Currently the allowable beam energy is restricted to some fixed values in the ramp-up operation due to the original specification of the PLC ladder program. To operate storage ring at an arbitrary energy, the algorism used in the PLC program has been improvement. Energy dependent measurements (betatron-tune, beam size, and beam half-lifetime) will be carried out by using the updated control system. The upper layer of the control system using the National Instrument LabVIEW and ActiveXCA was also reconstructed for flexible GUI.

During the first LHC shut-down period, software for the LHC Beam-based Feedback Controller (BFC) and Service Unit (BFSU) was migrated to new 64-bit multi-core hardware and to a new version of CERN's FESA3 real-time framework. This coincided with the transfer of responsibility to a new software team, charged with readying the systems for beam in 2015 as well as maintaining and improving the code-base in the future. In order to facilitate the comprehension of the system's 90'000+ existing lines of code, a new testing framework was developed which would not only serve to define the system's functional specification, but also provide acceptance tests for future releases. This paper presents how the BFC and BFSU systems were decoupled from each other as well as from the LHC plant's measurement and correction systems, thus allowing simulation-data driven instances to be deployed in a test environment. It also describes the resulting Java-based domain-specific language (DSL) which, when employed in JUnit, allows the formation of repeatable acceptance tests.

WinCC Open Architecture (WinCC OA) is used at CERN as the solution for many control system developments. This product models the process variables in structures known as data points and offers a custom procedural scripting language, called Control Language (CTRL). CTRL is also the language to program functionality of the native user interfaces (UI) and is used by the WinCC OA based CERN control system frameworks. CTRL does not support object oriented (OO) modeling by default. A lower level OO application programming interface (API) is provided, but requires significantly more expertise and development effort than CTRL. The Detector Control System group of the CMS experiment has developed CMSfwClass, a programming toolkit which adds OO behavior to the data points and CTRL. CMSfwClass reduces the semantic gap between high level software design and the application domain. It increases maintainability, encapsulation, reusability and abstraction. This paper presents the details of the implementation as well as the benefits and use cases of CMSfwClass.

A mid-infrared FEL has been established at the Fritz-Haber-Institut in Berlin. It is used for spectroscopic investigations of molecules, clusters, nanoparticles and surfaces. The oscillator FEL is operated with 15 - 50 MeV electrons from a normal-conducting S-band linac equipped with a gridded thermionic gun and a chicane for controlled bunch compression. The EPICS software framework was choosen to build the control system for this facility. In an effort to support the various experimenters two different Laser Beam Profiling cameras have been integrated. Here, the areadetector framework with genicam integration is used. The control system was also expanded with fast digitizers (SIS3316) but connected via Ethernet instead of using a VMEbus crate controller to get a higher flexibility. A iPad app for monitoring completes the enhancement. This paper presents design and implementation aspects of the upgrade, its capabilities, and lessons learned during the development.

EtherCAT bus and interface are widely used for external module and device control in accelerator environments at PSI, ranging from undulator communication, over basic I/O control to Machine Protection System for the new SwissFEL accelerator. A new combined EPICS/Linux driver has been developed at PSI, to allow for simple and mostly automatic setup of various EtherCAT configurations. The new driver is capable of automatic scanning of the existing device and module layout, followed by self-configuration and finally autonomous operation of the EtherCAT bus real-time loop. If additional configuration is needed, the driver offers both user- and kernel-space APIs, as well as the command line interface for fast configuration or reading/writing the module entries. The EtherCAT modules and their data objects (entries) are completely exposed by the driver, with each entry corresponding to a virtual file in the Linux procfs file system. This way, any user application can read or write the EtherCAT entries in a simple manner, even without using any of the supplied APIs. Finally, the driver offers EPICS interface with automatic template generation from the scanned EtherCAT configuration.

As facilities age and evolve, constant effort is needed in upgrading control system infrastructure; this applies to all aspects of an accelerator facility. Portions of the Personnel Protection System of the Linac Coherent Light Source are still relying on a legacy, relay-based Safety System. An upgrade is underway to modernize these systems using Siemens S7-300 Safety PLCs and Pilz PNOZMulti programmable controllers. The upgrade will be rolled out over multiple years requiring the implementation to be fully compatible with adjacent legacy system while setting the foundation for the new generation system. The solution relies on a modularized safety system which can be deployed in a short time (1 month) while being flexible enough to adapt to the evolving needs over the next 20 years.

T2K is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment at J-PARC in Japan. High intensity neutrino/antineutrino beam is generated and propagates 295km to Super-Kamiokande. High intensity proton beam, 350 kW in May 2015, is extracted from Main Ring synchrotron, guided through a primary proton beamline to a graphite target using normal-conducting (NC) magnets and super-conducting combined-function magnets. In October 2014, we replaced all the power supplies (PSs) for NC magnets with newly developed PSs. We also developed new control system based on EPICS and PLCs, putting emphasis on the safe operation of power supplies, and integrated it into the existing interlock system. Consequently the latency time for the interlock system was improved. We report the actual implementation and operation results of these developments.

LCLS is a facility for generation of very short duration, highly intense x-ray pulses which requires an extremely reliable photocathode electron source. In order to maintain high up-time (>95%) for the experimenters, operations rely on a maintenance program for active laser components as well as on built-in redundancy in case of failure. To accomplish this, a duplicate laser system was installed, allowing for quick swap between the active system and the spare in the event of a malfunction or for planned maintenance. As an added bonus, this redundant system provides additional possibilities for science as both laser systems can also be run to the cathode simultaneously to create multiple particle bunches. Diagnostics were put in place to maintain both special and temporal overlap and allow for the fast switching between systems by operations personnel while still remaining within the safety envelope. This was done for both the primary UV drive laser as well as the secondary IR "heater" laser. This paper describes the installation challenges and design architecture for this backup laser system.

SESAME is a 2.5 GeV synchrotron light source under construction in Allan, Jordan. The control system of SESAME is based on EPICS and CSS. Various developments in EPICS drivers, clients, software tools and hardware have been done. This paper will present some of the main achievements: new linux-x86 EPICS drivers and soft IOCS developed for the Micro-Research Finland event timing system replacing the VME/VxWorks-based drivers; new EPICS drivers and clients developed for the Basler GigE cameras; an IOC deployment and management driver developed to monitor the numerous virtual machines running the soft IOCs, and to ease deployment of updates to these IOCs; an automated EPICS checking tool developed to aid in the review, validation and application of the in-house rules for all record databases; a new EPICS record type (mbbi2) developed to provide alarm features missing from the multibit binary records found in the base distribution of EPICS; and a test of feasibility for replacing serial terminal servers with low-cost computers.

Toward SuperKEKB project, the injector linac upgrade is ongoing for aiming at the stable electron/positron beam operation with low emittance and high intensity bunch charge. To obtain such high quality beam, we have being commissioning many newly developed subsystems including a low emittance photocathode rf gun since October of 2013. Eventually, we will perform the simultaneous top-up for the four independent storage rings including two light sources. The stable beam operation as long as possible is desired since the prospective physics results strongly depends on the reliability and availability of accelerator operation. Since the middle stage of KEKB project, the injector linac control system has been gradually transferred to the EPICS based one from the in-house system based on RPC. We are expanding the existing control system for the newly installed devices like a network attached power supply, timing jitter monitoring system, and so on. In addition, many commissioning tools are now under development to accelerate the high quality beam development. In this paper, we will describe the present status of injector linac control system and future plan in detail.

Increasing demands, mandatory replacement of obsolete controls equipment as well as the introduction of new soft- and hardware technologies with short innovation cycles are some of the reasons why control systems need to be revised continuously. Thus, also at the EPICS-based DELTA control system, several projects have been tackled in recent years: (1) Embedding the new CHG-based short-pulse facility for VUV and THz radiation required, for example, the integration of IP-cameras, Raspberry-Pi PCs and EtherCat/TwinCat wired I/O-devices. (2) The request for a staff-free control room led to the programming of new web applications using Python and the Django framework. This development resulted in a web-based interlock system that can be run, amongst others, on Android-based mobile devices. (3) The virtualization infrastructure for server consolidation has been extended and migrated from XEN to the kernel based KVM approach. (4) I/O-units which were connected via conventional fieldbus systems (CAN, GPIB, RS-232/485), are now gradually replaced by TCP/IP-controlled devices. This paper describes details of these upgrades and further new developments.

For years, accelerator operators at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) have favored hardware knobs in the control room for accelerator tuning. Hardware knobs provide a tactile, intuitive, and efficient means of adjusting devices. The evolution of separate control systems for different accelerator facilities at SLAC has resulted in multiple flavors of knob hardware and software. To improve efficiency, space usage, and ease of use, the knob systems have been upgraded and integrated.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a free electron laser (FEL) facility operating at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC). A stripline beam position monitor (BPM) system was developed at SLAC [1] to meet the performance requirements necessary to provide high-quality stable beams for LCLS. This design has been modified to achieve improved position resolution in a more compact form factor. Prototype installations of this system have been operating in the LCLS LINAC and tested at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). Production systems are deployed at the new PAL XFEL facility and at the SPEAR storage ring at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at SLAC. This paper presents the design and commissioning results of this system.

The WinCC Open Architecture (OA) SCADA package and the controls frameworks (UNICOS, JCOP) developed at CERN were successfully used to implement many critical control systems at CERN. In the recent years, the supervision and the controls of many technical infrastructure systems (electrical distribution, cooling and ventilation, etc.) were rewritten to use this standard environment. Operators at the Technical Infrastructure desk, who monitor these systems, are forced to continuously switch between the applications that allow them to monitor these infrastructure systems. The Technical Infrastructure Portal (TIP) was designed and is being developed to provide centralized access to all technical infrastructure systems and extend their functionality by linking to a powerful localization system based on GIS. Furthermore, it provides an environment for operators to develop views that aggregate data from different sources, like cooling and electricity.

The Keck telescopes, located at one of the world's premier sites for astronomy, were the first of a new generation of very large ground-based optical/infrared telescopes with the first Keck telescope beginning science operations in May of 1993, and the second in October of 1996. The components of the telescopes and control systems are more than 15 years old. The upgrade to the control systems of the telescopes consists of mechanical, electrical, software and network components with the overall goals of improving performance, increasing reliability, addressing serious obsolescence issues and providing a knowledge refresh. This paper is a continuation of one published at the 2013 conference and will describe the current status of the control systems upgrade. It will detail the implementation and testing for the Keck II telescope, including successes and challenges met to date. Transitioning to nighttime operations will be discussed, as will implementation on the Keck I telescope.

At LNL it is being carried out an upgrade campaign of the control systems of the accelerator complex. The two main goals are standardization of hardware and software and system interoperability. EPICS has been chosen as the standard framework for developing new control systems; this will address software standardization and system interoperability. In order to achieve hardware standardization, a new EPICS IOC is under development, which will become a basic construction block for all future control systems. The COM (Computer-on-Modules) from factor has been chosen as the hardware platform for the IOC, along with the peripheral devices needed for developing all the foreseen control system at LNL. Prototypes of this IOC has been developed using ADLINK's Type 6 COM Express modules on generic carrier boards with DIO, ADC and DAC expansion boards. These prototypes have been tested under typical applications at LNL in order to validate the hardware platform choice. Experimental results show that the performance of the IOC in terms of effective resolution (ENOB and bias error), sample rates and CPU usage is suitable for satisfying the requirements of the control systems.

Linear IFMIF* Prototype Accelerator (LIPAc), Rokkasho, Japan, comprises a succession of devices and systems that accelerate a deuteron beam up to 9 MeV with a current of 125 mA, generating a power of 1.125 MW, and transport it up to a beam dump. The beam power becomes critical from the point of view of losses; even tiny losses must be avoided. This fact, and the complexity of the accelerator operation, requires a coherent strategy when designing, commissioning and optimizing the accelerator control system, specifically focused in the control systems of the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) and the Diagnostic Plate (DP, a movable set of diagnostics). Both systems are essential to validate the performance of the accelerator and particularly the ion source, Radio Frequency (RF) and Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) systems. This contribution will describe the recent advances in the control architectures and the EPICS based developments achieved in MEBT for the motion control of bunchers and scrapers, control of the power supplies in quadrupoles and steerers, and refrigeration and vacuum. Besides, control of fluorescence profile monitors (FPMs) in the D-Plate is displayed.
*IFMIF, the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility, is an accelerator-based neutron source that will use Li (d, xn) reactions to generate a flux of neutrons with a broad peak at 14 MeV.

SOLEIL is a third generation synchrotron radiation source located near Paris in France. REVOLUTION (REconsider Various contrOLler for yoUr motion) is the motion controller upgrade project currently in progress at SOLEIL. It was initiated to maintain the facility operations by addressing the risk of hardware obsolescence in motion control but at the same time making room for complex applications requirements to face new high performance challenges. In order to achieve these considerations, SOLEIL's strategy move was to go from a single controller for all applications to two motion controllers. A first Controller GALIL DMC-4183 was chosen to succeed the previous version DMC-2182. Both controllers can be integrated in the existing architecture with little hardware and software adaptation enabling full compatibility with the existing architecture. A second controller, Delta Tau Power Brick, has been selected as a HIGH PERFORMANCE solution providing advanced functionality. The CLASSIC controller upgrade is about to be completed and the integration of Power Brick into the SOLEIL control system is ongoing. The system complexity is abstracted by embedding processing functions into low-level code and giving end-users a simple high-level interface. The work done to structure the interfacing and standardization of the controller are detailed in this paper.

Instrument control at ISIS is in the process of migrating from a mainly locally developed system to an EPICS based system. The new control system, called IBEX, was initially used during commissioning of a new instrument prior to a long maintenance shutdown. This first usage has provided valuable feedback and significant progress has been made on enhancing the system during the facility maintenance period in preparation for the move onto production use. Areas that will be of particular interest to scientists in the future will be linking feedback from live data analysis with instrument control and also providing a simple and powerful scripting interface for facility users. In this paper we will cover the architecture and design of the new control system, our choices of technologies, how the system has evolved following initial use, and our plans for moving forward.

The MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility is currently being constructed in Lund, Sweden. A linear accelerator serves as the injector for the two storage rings and also as the source of short X ray pulses, in which mode it will operate with a 100Hz repetition rate. The controls system, based on TANGO, is required to collect and archive data from several different types of hardware at up to this 100Hz frequency. These data are used for example in offline beam diagnostics, for which they must be associated to a unique electron bunch number. To meet these requirements, the timing performance of the hardware components have been studied, and a TANGO Fast Archiver device created. The system is currently in the deployment phase and will play an important role in allowing the linac and Short Pulse Facility reach their 100Hz design goal

ELI-ALPS will provide a wide range of attosecond pulses which will be used for performing experiments by international research groups. ELI-ALPS will use the TANGO Controls framework to build up the central control system and to integrate the autonomous subsystems regarding software monitoring and control. Beside a robust central and integrated control system a flexible and dynamic high level environment could be beneficial. The envisioned users will come from diverse fields including chemistry, biology, physics or medicine. Most of the users will not have programming or scripting background. Meanwhile workflow system provides visual programming facilities where the logics can be drawn, which is understandable by the potential users. We have integrated TANGO into the Kepler workflow system because it gives a lot of actors for all natural scientific fields. Moreover it has the potential for running the workflows on HPC or GRID resources. We demonstrated the usability of the development with a beamline simulation. The TANGO-Kepler integration provides an easy-to-use environment for the users therefore it can facilitate e.g. the standardization of measurements protocols as well.

ELI-ALPS uses the TANGO Controls framework to build up the central control system and to integrate the autonomous subsystems regarding monitoring and control. It will be also used for the implementation of some autonomous systems' control system while others will be implemented differently. The central control system and the integration strategy of the autonomous systems is designed. The centralization and integration needs are surveyed and the requirements are collected. Prototypes have been developed to clarify the requirements and to test the designs. Requirements elicitation, designing and prototype development follows a Lean-Agile approach and includes several fields: device drivers and simulators; integration logic; central supervision, archiving, logging and error recovery; graphical user interfaces and so on.

LHCb is one of the four experiments at the LHC accelerator at CERN. For the LHCb upgrade, hundreds of new electronics boards for the central data acquisition and for the front-end readout of the different sub-detectors are being developed. These devices will need to be integrated in the Experiment Control System (ECS) that drives LHCb. Typically, they are controlled via a server running on a PC which allows the communication between the hardware registers and the experiment SCADA (WinCC OA). A set of tools was developed that provide an easy integration of the control and monitoring of the devices in the ECS. The fwHw is a tool that allows the abstraction of the device models into the ECS. Using XML files describing the structure and registers of the devices it creates the necessary model of the hardware as a data structure in the SCADA. It allows then the control and monitoring of the defined registers using their name, without the need to know the details of the hardware behind. The fwHw tool also provides the facility of defining and applying recipes - named sets of configuration parameters which can be used to easily configure the hardware according to specific needs.

Synchronising High-Speed Triggered Image and Meta Data Acquisition for Beamlines

High-speed image acquisition is becoming more and more common on beamlines. As experiments increase in complexity, the need to record parameters related to the environment at the same time increases with them. As a result, conventional systems for combining experimental meta data and images often struggle to deliver at a speed and precision that would be desirable for the experiment. We describe an integrated solution that addresses those needs, overcoming the performance limitations of PV monitoring by combining hardware triggering of an ADC card, coordination of signals in a Zebra box* and three instances of area-Detector streaming to HDF5 data. This solution is expected to be appropriate for frame rates ranging from 30Hz to 1000Hz, with the limiting factor being the maximum speed of the camera. Conceptually, the individual data streams are arranged in pipelines controlled by a master Zebra box, expecting start/stop signals on one end and producing the data collections at the other. This design ensures efficiency on the acquisition side while allowing easy interaction with higher-level applications on the other.

Beamlines in LNLS are being modernized to use the synchrotron light as efficiently as possible. As the photon flux increases, experiment speed constraints become more visible to the user. Experiment control has been done by ordinary computers, under a conventional operating system, running high-level software written in most common programming languages. This architecture presents some time issues as computer is subject to interruptions from input devices like mouse, keyboard or network. The programs quickly became the bottleneck of the experiment. To improve experiment control and automation speed, we transferred software algorithms to a FPGA device. FPGAs are semiconductor devices based around a matrix of logic blocks reconfigurable by software. The results of using a NI Compact RIO device with FPGA programmed through LabVIEW for adopting this technology and future improvements are briefly shown in this paper.

When the FRM-2 neutron source went into operation (2002) and many instruments were moved from the closed-down Jülich reactor to the new facility, it was agreed on a choice of front-end hardware and the TACO middleware from ESRF. To keep up with software standards, it was decided recently to switch to TACO's successor - the TANGO control software. For a unified "user experience", new graphical user interface software "NICOS-2" is being developed by the software group at FRM2. While general semantics of TACO and TANGO don't look very different at a first glance, and adaption of device servers seemed to be straightforward at first, various problems in practical operation were found. The problems were due to differences in state handling, timing behavior and error reporting. These problems, and the changes that had to be made to ensure reliable operation again, will be described.

Forschungszentrum Jülich has been operating the neutron Instrument DNS at the neutron source FRM II for about 10 years. DNS is a time of flight neutron spectrometer with polarization analysis that experienced a major upgrade in 2014 and 2015. During the upgrade DNS was equipped with new electronics and a new control and data acquisition system, including a transition from the existing TACO system to its successor TANGO. On the client side the NICOS software developed at FRM II is used for the implementation of measurement operations and user interface. The design of the new control and data acquisition system is presented and the lessons learned by the introduction of TANGO are reported.

MAX IV Laboratory, a synchrotron facility in Lund, has selected TANGO as the control system framework for the entire facility. On the beamlines that are being built the Python-based SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system Sardana will be used for experimental control. SPECIES, one out of eight new soft X-ray beamlines, is used as a test bench for evaluating the chosen standards. Sardana is used to control the energy setting of the PGM (plane grating monochromator) as well as to provide macros and other utilities for the user. Generic Taurus GUIs and a SVG-synoptic give the user a way to interact with the control system and display relevant information. The standardized graphical interfaces give a familiar look and feel across the entire facility. All motorized axes are controlled with the IcePAP motion controller. For the axes of the PGM, the IcePAP driver operates in hardware closed loop. Special care is taken in order to avoid slow and inaccurate movements of the PGM energy due to the non-linear relationship between the motors and the angular encoders.

Synchronous ramping of an assembly of magnets is critical for operation of beam in an accelerator. Magnet currents must remain within the operational limits to avoid dis-alignment of electron beam. In order to comply with the design specifications of ERL and ELENS project , two different software control mechanisms have been developed. The ramp profile is automated and maintained by tracking current in all dipole magnets at ERL and superconducting solenoid magnets at ELENS. This mechanism speeds up operations and adds a level of protection. The purpose of this application is to reduce unnecessary interlocks of the personnel protection system. This paper will describe the power supply arrangement, communication mechanism and the state machine algorithm used for feedback and control. A report on operating experience will be presented.

The 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope, currently under construction, comprises several loosely coupled independent subsystems, requiring a higher level Control and Monitoring (CAM) system to operate as a coherent instrument. Many control-system architectures are bus-like, clients directly \mbox{receiving} monitoring points from Input/Output Controllers; instead a multi-layer architecture based on point-to-point Karoo Array Telescope Control Protocol (KATCP) connections is used for MeerKAT. Clients (e.g. operators or scientists) only communicate directly with the outer layer of the telescope; only telescope interactions required for the given role are exposed to the user. The layers, interconnections, and how this architecture is used to meet telescope system requirements are described. Requirements include: Independently controllable telescope subsets; dynamically allocating telescope resources to individual users or observations, preventing the control of resources not allocated to them; commensal observations sharing resources; automatic detection of, and responses to, system-level alarm events; high level operator controls and health displays; automatic execution of scheduled observations.

The increased brilliance of state-of-the-art Synchrotron radiation sources and Free Electron Lasers require imaging detectors capable of taking advantage of these light source facilities. The PERCIVAL ("Pixelated Energy Resolving CMOS Imager, Versatile and Large") detector is being developed in collaboration between DESY, Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, Diamond Light Source and Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. It is a CMOS detector targeting soft X-rays < 1 KeV, with a high resolution of up to 13 M pixels reading out at 120 Hz, producing a challenging data rate of 6 GB/s. The controls and data acquisition system will include a SDK to allow integration with third party control systems like Tango and DOOCS; an EPICS areaDetector driver will be included by default. It will make use of parallel readout to keep pace with the data rate, distributing the data over multiple nodes to create a single virtual dataset using the HDF5 file format for its speed advantages in high volumes of regular data. This paper presents the design of the control system software for the Percival detector, an update of the current state of the implementation carried out by Diamond Light Source.

In the era of extremely large telescopes (ELT) an adaptive optics (AO) system with artificial guide stars is an essential part of the optics between the source and the instrument. For the Giant Magellan Telescope these guide stars are formed by stimulating emission from Sodium atoms in the atmosphere with lasers launched from the side of the telescope. Moreover, they are resolved by the adaptive optics system so Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors record elongated spots. Cost effective proof-of-concept systems for investigating control algorithms must be built for deployment in the lab or on small telescopes. We present a hardware and software system that mimics the propagation of a single laser guide star (LGS) through the Earth's atmosphere and the optics of the Giant Magellan Telescope, using source motion and brightness modulation to simulate the source extension. A service oriented architecture allows adaptive optics scientists to construct images from different LGS asterisms and build non-real-time closed-loop control systems in high-level languages.

A new hot checkout process was implemented at Jefferson Lab for the upgraded 12 GeV accelerator. The previous process proved insufficient in the fall of 2011 when a fire broke out in a septa magnet along the beam line due to a lack of communication about the status of systems. The improved process provides rigorous verification of system readiness thus protecting property while minimizing program delays. To achieve these goals, a database and web application were created to maintain an accurate list of machine components and coordinate and record verification checks by each responsible group. The process requires groups to publish checklists detailing each system check to encourage good work practice. Within groups, the process encourages two independent checks of each component: the first by a technician, and a second by the group leader. Finally, the application provides a dashboard display of checkout progress for each system and beam destination of the machine allowing for informed management decisions. Successful deployment of the new process has led to safe and efficient machine commissioning.

Full stability potential of orbit and bunch-by-bunch-feedback controlled top-up operation becomes available to the experimental users only if the remaining slow drifts of essential operational parameters are properly compensated. At the light source BESSY II these are the transversal tunes as well as the path length and energy. These compensations are realized using feedback control loops together with supervising state machines. Key to the tune control is a multi-source tune determination algorithm. For the path length correction empirical findings are utilized. All involved software systems and data-paths are sketched.

The piezo based control of the superconducting cavity tuning has been under the development over last years. Automated compensation of Lorentz force detuning of FLASH and European X-FEL resonators allowed to maintain cavities in resonance operation even for high acceleration gradients (in range of 30 MV/m). It should be emphasized that cavity resonance control consists of two independent subsystems. First of all the slow motor tuner based system can be used for slow, wide range mechanical tuning (range of hundreds of kHz). Additionally the piezo tuning system allows for fine, dynamic compensation in a range of ~1 kHz. In mentioned pulse mode experiments (like FLASH), the piezo regulation budget should be preserved for in-pulse detuning control. In order to maintain optimal cavity frequency adjustment capabilities slow motor tuners should automatically act on the static detuning component at the same time. This paper presents work concerning development, implementation and evaluation of automatic superconducting cavity frequency control towards piezo range optimization. FLASH and X-FEL dedicated cavities tuning control experiences are also summarized.

NICA (Nuclotron based Ion Collider fAcility) is an accelerator complex, which is being built in JINR (Dubna, Russia). The system described in this paper is controlling the RF stations of booster, the first element of the NICA complex. The two devices are parts of the Control System: Intellectual Controller and Tester module. The first one is designed for precise measurement of magnetic field, generation of the acceleration frequency in accordance with measured field and control RF power and pre-amplifiers. Intellectual Controller is a real-time feed-forward system with 20 ums loop time. It is based on ARM microcontroller and bare-metal control programs are used to reach maximum performance. Approaches that were used to achieve maximum performance are elaborated and presented in this paper. The second part of system - Tester is a simulator for tuning and checking the RF stations before start of operations or in absence of real accelerator. The achieved accuracy in chain 'magnetic field' - 'acceleration frequency' is better than 5*10-5. Plans on feedback incorporation to stabilize ion beam behavior via frequency and phase tuning are discussed.

The TPS is a state-of-the-art synchrotron radiation facility featuring ultra-high photon brightness with extremely low emittance. Its Booster has 6 FODO cells which include 7 BD dipoles with 1.6 m long and 2 BH dipoles with 0.8 m long in each cell. After magnetization of stainless steel vacuum chamber of the booster were identified and then dismantled, annealed, and re-installed, the electron beam energy of the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) in the booster ring has ramped to 3 GeV in a week. The booster tune correction during ramping is one of the main reasons why the booster commissioning progress is so fast. In this paper the summarized the booster tune monitor system will be summarised

For a low emittance light source, beam orbit motion needs to be controlled within submicron for obtaining a high quality light. Magnets vibration especially quadruples will be one of the main sources to destroy the beam stability. In order to study the relationship between vibration and beam motion, it is highly desirable to use a synchronous data acquisition system which integrates measurement of vibration and beam position monitor systems especially for the coherence analysis. For a larger vibration such as earthquakes are also deleterious to beam stability or even make the beam trip due to the quench of superconducting RF cavity. A data acquisition system integrated with an earthquake detector is also quite necessary to show and archive the data on the control system. The data acquisition systems of vibration and earthquake measurement system are summarized in this report. The relationship between the beam motion and magnets vibration will also study here.

The electrical power converter group at CERN is responsible for the design of fast-pulsed power converters. These generate a flat-top pulse of the order of a few milliseconds. Control of these power converters is orchestrated by an embedded computer, known as the Function Generator/Controller (FGC). The FGC is the main component in the so-called RegFGC3 chassis, which also houses a variety of purpose-built cards. Ensuring the generation of the pulse at a precise moment, typically when the beam passes, is paramount to the correct behaviour of the accelerator. To that end, the timing distribution and posterior handling by the FGC must be well defined. Also important is the ability to provide operational feedback, and to configure the FGC, the converter, and the pulse characteristics. This paper presents an overview of the system architecture as well as the results obtained during the commissioning of this control solution in CERN's new Linac4.

The measured bending field of the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) is received in real-time by the longitudinal beam control system and converted into the revolution frequency used as set-point for beam phase and radial loops. With the renovation of the bending field measurement system the transmission technique is changed from a differential sequence of pulses, the so-called B-train, to a stream of Ethernet frames based on the White Rabbit protocol. The packets contain field, its derivative and auxiliary information. A new frequency program for the conversion of the bending field into the revolution frequency, depending also on parameters like radius of the accelerator and the particle type, has been developed. Instead of storing large conversion tables from field to frequency for fixed parameters, the frequencies are directly calculated in programmable logic (FPGA). In order to reduce development time and keep flexibility, the conversion is processed in real-time in the FPGA using Xilinx floating-point primitives mapped by a higher level tool Simulink System Generator. Commissioning with beam of the new frequency program in the PS is progressing.

The Accelerator R&D Group within the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Physics Division maintains a beam dynamics model named TRACK. This simulation code has the potential to assist operators in visualizing key performance parameters of the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerating System (ATLAS). By having real-time access to visual and animated models of the particle beam transverse and longitudinal phase spaces, operators can more quickly iterate to a final machine tune. However, this effort requires a seamless integration into the control system, both to extract initial run-time information from the accelerator, and to present the simulation results back to the users. This paper presents efforts to pre-process, batch execute, and visualize TRACK particle beam physics simulations in real-time via the ATLAS Control System.

Stable and reproducible generation of a photon beam at Free Electron Lasers (FELs) necessitates a low energy spread of the electron beam. A low level radio frequency (LLRF) control system stabilizes the RF field inside accelerating modules. An electron beam passing through the cavity induces a drop in the actual stored field proportional to the charge, the cavity shunt impedance, and the bunch repetition rate. The feedback loop compensates for the perturbation after the accelerating gradient drops. Due to the digital loop delay and limited bandwidth of the closed loop system, this disturbance induces control errors which can increase beam energy spread. An open-loop controller uses information obtained from the beam diagnostic systems accounting in real-time for fluctuations of the beam current. This paper describes the bunch charge detection scheme, its implementation, as well as results of the tests performed on the ELBE (Electron Linac for beams with high Brilliance and low Emittance) radiation source at the HZDR (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf) facility.

We describe the detailed internal architecture of the Transverse Multi-Bunch Feedback processor used at Diamond for control of multi-bunch instabilities and measurement of betatron tunes. Bunch by bunch selectable control over feedback filters, gain and excitation allows fine control over feedback, allowing for example the single bunch in a hybrid or camshaft fill pattern to be controlled independently from the bunch train. It is also possible to excite all bunches at a single frequency while simultaneously sweeping the excitation for tune measurement of a few selected bunches. The single frequency excitation has been used for continuous measurement of the beta-function. A simple programmable event sequencer provides support for up to 7 steps of programmable sweeps and changes to feedback and excitation, allowing a variety of complex and precisely timed beam characterisation experiments including grow-damp measurements in unstable conditions and programmed bunch cleaning. Finally input and output compensation filters allow for correction of front end and amplifier phasing at higher frequencies.

Synchrotron SOLEIL and Diamond Light Source are two third generation light sources located respectively in France and the UK. In the past 5 years, both facilities separately developed their own platform permitting encoder processing to synchronize motion systems and acquisition during experiments, SPIETBOX by SOLEIL and Zebra by Diamond. New operational requirements for simultaneous and multi-technique scanning, and support of multiple encoder standards have been identified by both institutes. In order to address these a collaborative project has been initiated between SOLEIL and Diamond to realize a new 'Position and Acquisition' processing platform, called PandA. The PandA project addresses current systems' limitations in term of obsolescence and need for more processing power. Its design is going to be a 1U standalone system powered by a Xilinx Zynq SoC to implement a configurable set of logic functionalities. It will provide a flexible and open solution to interface different third party hardware (detectors and motion Controllers). This paper details the organization of this collaboration, sharing technical leadership between both institutes and the status of the project.

In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), over 100 movable collimators are connected to a three-tier control system which moves them to the required settings throughout the operational cycle from injection to collision energy. A dedicated control system was developed to align the collimators to the beam during machine commissioning periods and hence determine operational settings for the active run. During Long Shutdown 1, the control system was upgraded to allow beam-based alignments to be performed using embedded beam position monitors in 18 newly installed collimators as well as beam loss monitors. This paper presents the new collimation controls architecture for LHC Run II along with several modifications in the Java-based application layer.

The European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) will generate extremely short and intense X-ray flashes from the electron beam of a 2.1 km long superconducting linear accelerator. Due to the complexity of the facility and the sheer number of subsystems and components, special emphasis needs to be placed on the automatization of procedures, on the abstraction of machine parameters, and on the development of user-friendly high-level software for the operation of the accelerator. This paper gives an overview of the ongoing work and highlights several new tools and concepts.

NA62 is a fixed target experiment to measure very rare decays of Kaons at CERN Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator. The NA62 experiment line comprises several large detectors installed inside a vacuum vessel with a length of 250 m and an internal diameter of up to 2.8 m. The vacuum installation consists of 170 remote controlled pumps, valves and gauges. The operational specifications of NA62 require a complex vacuum control system: tight interaction between vacuum controllers and detector controllers, including pumping or venting vetoes, and detector start-stop interlocks; most of the valves are interlocked, including the large vacuum sector gate valves; the vacuum devices are driven by 20 logic processes. The vacuum control system is based on commercial Programmable Logical Controllers (Siemens PLC: S7-300 series) and a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition application (Siemens SCADA: WINCC OA). The control software is built upon the standard framework used in CERN accelerators vacuum, with some specific developments. We describe the controls architecture, and report on the particular requirements and the solutions implemented.

NA62 is the follow-up of the NA48 experiment, in the SPS North Area of CERN, and reuses a large fraction of its detectors and beam line equipment. Still, there are many new vacuum devices in the beam line (including pumps, valves & gauges), which required a thorough modification of the control system and a large number of new controllers, many of which were custom-made. The NA62 vacuum control system is based on the use of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition). The controllers and signal conditioning electronics are accessed from the PLC via a field bus (Profibus); optical fibre is used between surface racks and the underground gallery. The control hardware was completely commissioned during 2014. The nominal pressure levels were attained in all sectors of the experiment. The remote control of all devices and the interlocks were successfully tested. This paper summarizes the architecture of the vacuum control system of NA62, the types of instruments to control, the communication networks, the hardware alarms and the supervisory interface.

For two years (Spring 2013 - Spring 2015), the LHC went through its first long shutdown (LS1). It was mainly motivated by the consolidation of magnet interconnects, to allow operation with 6.5 TeV proton beams. Moreover, around the accelerator complex, many other systems were repaired, consolidated or upgraded, and several new installations came to life. The standardization of vacuum controls has progressed in the injectors, with the renovation of most of their obsolete equipment. In the LHC, many new instruments were added, the signal transmission integrity was improved, and the exposure to radiation was reduced in critical places. Several developments were needed for new equipment types or new operational requirements.

Funding: This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 289485.
We have developed a control system configuration tool, which provides an easy-to-use interface for quick configuration of the entire facility. It uses Microsoft Excel as the front-end application and allows the user to quickly generate and deploy IOC configuration (EPICS start-up scripts, alarms and archive configuration) onto IOCs; start, stop and restart IOCs, alarm servers and archive engines, and more. The DCDB tool utilizes a relational database, which stores information about all the elements of the accelerator. The communication between the client, database and IOCs is realized by a REST server written in Python. The key feature of the DCDB tool is that the user does not need to recompile the source code. It is achieved by using a dynamic library loader, which automatically loads and links device support libraries. The DCDB tool is compliant with CODAC (used at ITER and ELI-NP), but can also be used in any other EPICS environment (e.g. it has been customized to work at ESS).

The Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) manages three radio telescopes: the Medicina and Noto dishes and the newly-built SRT. In order to make their capabilities more valuable to the scientific community, we started the DISCOS (Development of the Italian Single-dish COntrol System) project. DISCOS is implemented according to a distributed Component-Container model and hides to the users the differences among the telescopes by presenting the same user interface and the same data format. The complexity of coping with three heterogeneous instruments was handled designing a software development infrastructure with a wide monolithic codebase (libraries, components and generic interfaces), which is completely shared among the three product lines. This design permits to produce new software components with a minimum effort and to set up the same test suites for all the environments, thus leading to an affordable development and maintenance process. In this paper we illustrate the design strategies and the development techniques used to realize and optimize this common control software. We also provide a description of the project status and future plans.

MAX IV and Solaris are new synchrotrons third generation. MAX IV synchrotron consist of 1.5 GeV storage ring, 3.0 GeV storage ring and linac; it is located in Lund, Sweden. Solaris synchrotron is a replica of the 1.5 GeV storage ring of the MAX IV project; it is located in Kraków, Poland. Structure of storage rings contains several pulse magnets (kicker and pinger). Control system of pulse power supplies based on LTR crate with several modules (ADC, DAC, input/output registers etc.). LTR crate is product Russian firm L-CARD. LTR crate is crate with integrated controller (ADSP Blackfin BF537) and PLC EP1C30 with direct connection to modules. In order to communicate with crate native LTR-server is used. LTR-server is a Windows application based on use of sockets. Control system of MAX IV and Solaris uses TANGO. For integration LTR-crates in final structure, special software gateway (csMAXIVltr) is used. This gateway is a set of several specific Windows applications implemented by using Qt5 libraries. Gateway allow communicating TANGO- server with crate through built-in HTTP-server. In final structure of control system csMAXIVltr will be work on a Windows virtual machine.

In the LHC beam pipes and cryostats, the pressure measurement covers a wide range, from 1500 mbar down to 10-11 mbar and even lower. If vacuum deteriorates, alarm signals are generated and sent to other systems, e.g. cryogenics, accelerating cavities, kicker magnets, and beam interlock. In addition, an unacceptable pressure rise in beam pipes generates interlocks to close the adjacent sector valves, thus isolating the sector, so that the pressure rise does not propagate. This paper describes the measurement chains, the alarms and interlocks logic used in the vacuum control system of the LHC. We analyze the possible signal degradation caused by ionizing radiation or due to cable length, shielding and grounding. The weaknesses of the existing vacuum measurement system are pointed out, and a prospective for improvement of the conditioning electronics is proposed. During the first LHC long shut down, several corrections were applied; the results of the tests after commissioning are also presented.

During the last two years, triggered by the construction of the XRD2 beamline, and to comply with the top-up operations, a complete refurbishment of the Elettra Super Conducting Wiggler (SCW) has been carried out. Alongside with the mechanical, cryogenic and electrical components, also the electronics, the control and interlock systems have been upgraded. The MVME5110 PowerPC single board computer, which is a standard in the Elettra control system, has been adopted, as well as RS232 communication modules, analog to digital converters and digital I/O lines. In order to cope with the high output power of the SCW, up to18 KW, the interlock system, protecting both the wiggler and the beamline front-end, has been completely redesigned. The control system software has been re-written from scratch using the TANGO software framework. The complete system has been tested during the second half of 2014 and is now fully operational.

Phase 1 of TRIUMF Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) was completed in September 2014. At phase 1, the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system of ARIEL's electron linear accelerator (e-Linac) consists of a buncher and a deflector, one single-cavity injector cryomodule and the first cavity of two dual-cavity accelerating cryomodules. The model for the e-Linac LLRF system is largely based on the experience gained from the fully-commissioned TRIUMF ISAC-II linear accelerator (linac). Similarly, the EPICS-based Controls for the e-Linac LLRF builds on the lessons learned with the linac LLRF Controls. This paper describes the interface between the ARIEL Control System (ACS) and the e-Linac LLRF using EPICS ASYN/StreamDevice and a SCPI-like protocol. Also discussed are the ACS EDM displays and future plans for LLRF Controls.

To shorten the development time of supervision applications, CERN has developed the UNICOS framework, which simplifies the configuration of the front-end devices and the supervision (SCADA) layer. At CERN the SCADA system of choice is WinCC OA, but for specific projects (small size, not connected to accelerator operation or not located at CERN) a more customisable SCADA using LabVIEW is an attractive alternative. Therefore a similar system, called UNICOS in LabVIEW (UiL), has been implemented. It provides a set of highly customisable re-usable components, devices and utilities. Because LabVIEW uses different programming methods than WinCC OA, the tools for automatic instantiation of devices on both the front-end and supervision layer had to be re-developed, but the configuration files of the devices and the SCADA can be reused. This paper reports how the implementation was done, it describes the first project implemented in UiL and an outlook to other possible applications.

In J-PARC main ring, each of the main magnets (Dipole, Quadrupole, and Sextupole) has a trim-coil. The basic aim of trim-coil is to correct small deviation of each magnetic field. In addition, we have used them for other purposes, for example: (1) in Beam-Based-Alingnment studies, (2) as flux monitors, and (3) to make a short-circuit to reduce ripples of magnetic field. At a moment, trim-coils can be used for only one purpose. Relay-switches were introduced to change trim-coil connection to a device, which corresponds to the selected purpose. When the purpose is switched, 1,200 on-site relays have to be changed manually, distributed in three buildings. Thus, a control system for trim-coil relay-selectors was developed in winter, 2014-2015. EPICS tools and environment are used to develop the system. The system comprises PLC I/O modules with controller running EPICS on Linux. The system will be in operation after March, 2015. By using the system, a much easier switching of relay-switches than before, is expected.

The Rare Isotope Science Project at the Institute for Basic Science constructs the rare isotope accelerator (RAON) facility in South Korea. The stable ion beam as an ion source for the RAON accelerator could be generated by ECR ion source system. Therefore, it is mandatory to build ECR ion source control system that could be integrated into an accelerator control system easily. The vacuum control system is an essential part of the ECR control system, because of one vacuum chamber among three different voltage stages (ground, 50 kV, and 80 kV). The preliminary design and implementation of vacuum control system for the ECR ion source will be discussed. It is planned to use a PLC in order to communicate with a vacuum gauge and turbo pump controllers among multi-voltage stages (ground, 50 kV and 80 kV) by optical fibers connection. The PLC system has two major components: a digital I/O module that provides power to each component and standard RS-232 modules which are connected with the gauge & pump controllers. In addition, its extension plan to integrate the vacuum control system into the RAON accelerator control system based on system the EPICS framework, will be discussed.

CAN bus is a recommended fieldbus at CERN. It is widely used in the control systems of the experiments to control and monitor large amounts of equipment (IO devices, front-end electronics, power supplies). CAN nodes are distributed over busses that are interfaced to the computers via PCI or USB CAN interfaces. These interfaces limit the possible evolution of the Detector Control Systems (DCS). For instance, PCI cards are not compatible with all computer hardware and new requirements for virtualization and redundancy require dynamic reallocation of CAN bus interfaces to different computers. Additionally, these interfaces cannot be installed at a different location than the front-end computers. Ethernet based CAN interfaces resolve these issues, providing network access to the field busses. The Ethernet-CAN gateways from Analytica (GmbH) were evaluated to determine if they meet the hardware and software specifications of CERN. This paper presents the evaluation methodology and results as well as highlighting the benefits of using such gateways in experiment production environments. Preliminary experience with the Analytica interfaces in the DCS of the CMS experiment is presented.

For CERN's Linac4 (L4) Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) injection scheme, slices of the 160 MeV H− beam will be distributed to the 4 superposed synchrotron rings of the PSB. The beam will then be injected horizontally into the PSB by means of an H− charge-exchange injection system using a graphite stripping foil to strip the electrons from the H− ions. The foil and its positioning mechanism will be housed under vacuum inside a stripping foil unit, containing a set of six foils that can be mechanically rotated into the beam aperture. The band with mounted foils is controlled by a stepping motor while a resolver, micro-switches and a membrane potentiometer provide foil position feedback. The vicinity of the ionizing beam and vacuum requirements have constrained the selection of the above mentioned control system parts. The positioning and interlocking logic is implemented in an industrial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This paper describes the design of the stripping foil unit electronics and controls and presents the first results obtained from a test bench unit which will be installed in the Linac4 transfer line by the end of the 2015 for foil tests with beam.

Fast pulsed kicker magnet systems are powered by high-voltage and high-current pulse generators with adjustable pulse length and amplitude. To deliver this power, fast high-voltage switches such as thyratrons and GTOs are used to control the fast discharge of pre-stored energy. To protect the machine and the generator itself against internal failures of these switches several types of fast interlocks systems are used at TE-ABT (CERN Technology department, Accelerator Beam Transfer). To get rid of this heterogeneous situation, a modular digital Fast Interlock Detection System (FIDS) has been developed in order to replace the existing fast interlocks systems. In addition to the existing functionality, the FIDS system will offer new functionalities such as extended flexibility, improved modularity, increased surveillance and diagnostics, contemporary communication protocols and automated card parametrization. A Xilinx Zynq®-7000 SoC has been selected for implementation of the required functionalities so that the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) can hold the fast detection and interlocking logic while the ARM® processors allow for a flexible integration in CERN's Front-End Software Architecture (FESA) framework, advanced diagnostics and automated self-parametrization.

Hadron experimental facility is designed to handle intense slow-extraction proton beam from Main Ring (MR) of Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). On May 23, 2013, 2×1013 proton beams were instantaneously extracted to Hadron experimental facility in 5 milliseconds due to the malfunction of the power supply for Extraction Quadrapole magnet for a spill feedback at MR. Therefore the production target made of gold was locally damaged at Hadron experimental facility because of overheat by absorbing proton beam. After the accident we upgraded target temperature measurements with 100 milliseconds sampling and synchronization with beam spills in order to promptly detect damage to the production target as soon as possible. In addition, we also upgraded temperature trend graphs and an interlock system in order to figure out the state of the production target. Currently Hadron experimental facility ready to accept slow-extraction proton beam. The results of the temperature measurements and the interlock system for the production target during beam operation at J-PARC Hadron experimental facility, will be reported in this paper.

The Interlock System for FAIR named General Interlock System (GIS) is part of the Machine Protection System which protects the accelerator from damage by misled beams. The GIS collects various Interlock sources hardware signals from up to 60 distributed remote I/O stations through PROFINET to a central PLC CPU. Thus a bit-field is build and sent to the interlock processor via a simple Ethernet point-to-point connection. Additional software Interlock sources can be picked up by the Interlock Processor via UDP/IP protocol. The Interlock System for FAIR project was divided into 2 development phases. Phase A contains the interlock signal gathering (HW and SW) and a status viewer. Phase B entails the fully functional interlock logic (support for dynamic configuration), interface with Timing System, interlock signal acknowledging, interlock signal masking, archiving and logging. The realization of the phase A will be presented in this paper.

As accelerators are becoming increasingly powerful, the requirement of a reliable machine protection system is apparent to avoid beam-induced damage to the equipment. A missed detection of a hazard is undesirable as it could lead to equipment damage on very short time scales. In addition, the number of false beam trips, leading to unnecessary downtime, should be kept at a minimum to achieve user satisfaction. This paper describes a method for predicting and mitigating these faults, based on the architecture of the system. The method is greatly influenced by the IEC61508 standard for functional safety for the industry and implements a Failure Mode, Effects, and Diagnostics Analysis (FMEDA). It is suggested that this method is applied at an early stage in the design phase of a high-power accelerator, so that possible protection and mitigation can be suggested and implemented in the interlock system logic. The method described in this paper is currently applied at the European Spallation Source and the results follow from the analysis on the Beam Interlock System of this facility.

The RHIC Beam Permit System (BPS) monitors the anomalies occurring in the collider and restores the machine to a safe state upon fault detection. The reliability of the BPS thus directly impacts RHIC availability. An analytical multistate reliability model of the BPS has been developed to understand the failure development and propagation over store length variation. BPS has a modular structure. The individual modules have joint survival distributions defined by competing risks with exponential lifetimes. Modules differ in functionality and input response. The overall complex behavior of the system is analyzed by first principles for different failure/success states of the system. The model structure changes according to the type of scenario. The analytical model yields the marginal survival distribution for each scenario versus different store lengths. Analysis of structural importance and interdependencies of modules is also examined. A former Monte Carlo model* is used for the verification of the analytical model for a certain store length. This work is next step towards building knowledge base for eRHIC design by understanding finer failure characteristics of the BPS.

ThomX is a Compton based photons source. It aims to produce a compact and directional X-rays source, with high performance, high brightness and adjustable energy*. The principal application fields are medical sciences, social technology and industry. An interlock system has been implemented for machine protection, especially to protect sensitive and essential equipment (magnets, vacuum system, etc.) during machine operation. ThomX interlock system is based on Programmable Logic Controller (PLC-Siemens S7-1500), it collects default signals from the different equipment of the machine, up to the central PLC which kills the beam, by stopping the RF or the injection, in case of problem (bad vacuum, magnets overheating, etc.). The interlock system consists of two levels. The first one is a local process, whose role is to monitor the variations of different parameters of the machine equipment, and generates a default signal in case of operation problem. The second level is the central PLC, which gathers and process all the default signals from subsystems, and stops the RF power in a very short time. Actually, the interlock system is under test, it will allow accelerator to work safely.

Interlocks are an important feature of both personnel and machine protection systems for mitigating risks inherent in operation of dangerous equipment. The purpose of an interlock is to secure specific equipment or entire systems under well defined conditions in order to prevent accidents from happening. Depending on specific requirements for the level of reliability, availability, speed, and cost of the interlock, various technologies are available. Different approaches are discussed, in particular in the context of personnel safety systems, which have been built or tested at CERN during the last few years. Technologies discussed include examples of programmable devices, PLCs and FPGAs, as well as wired logic based on relays and special logic cards.

In this paper a new fast machine protection system is proposed. This system is designed for the injection Ι of C-ADS which fault reaction time requires less than 20us, and the one minute down time requires less than 7 times in a whole year. The system consist of one highly reliable control network based on a control board and some front IO sub-boards, and one nanosecond precision timing system using white rabbit protocol. The control board and front IO sub-board are redundant separately. The structure of the communication network is a combination structure of star and tree types which using the 2.5GHz optical fiber links the all nodes. This paper pioneered the use of nanosecond timing system based on the white rabbit protocol to determine the time and sequence of each system failure. Another advantage of the design is that it uses standard FMC and an easy extension structure which made the design is easy to use in a large accelerator.

Various upgrades were performed on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Beam Dumping System (LBDS) during Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) at CERN, in particular to the Trigger Synchronisation and Distribution System (TSDS): A redundant direct connection from the LHC Beam Interlock System to the re-trigger lines of the LBDS was implemented, a fully redundant powering architecture was set up, and new Trigger Synchronisation Unit cards were deployed over two separate crates instead of one. These hardware changes implied the adaptation of the State Control and Surveillance System and an improvement of the monitoring and diagnosis systems, like the various Internal Post Operation Check (IPOC) systems that ensure that, after every beam dump event, the LBDS worked as expected and is 'as good as new' for the next LHC beam.

ADaMS is CERN's Access Distribution and Management System. It evaluates access authorizations to more than 400 zones and for more than 35k persons. Although accesses are granted based on a combination of training courses followed, administrative authorizations and the radio-protection situation of an individual, the policies and technicalities are constantly evolving along with the laboratory's activities; the current version of ADaMS is based on a 7 year old design, and is starting to show its limits. A new version of ADaMS (3) will allow improved coordination with CERN's scheduling and planning tools (used heavily during technical shutdowns, for instance), will allow CERN's training catalog to change without impacting access management and will simplify and reduce the administrative workload of granting access. The new version will provide enhanced self-services to end users by focusing on access points (the physical barriers) instead of safety zones. ADaMS 3 will be able to cope better with changing and new requirements, as well as the multiplication of access points. The project requires the cooperation of a dozen services at CERN, and should take 18 months to develop.

J-Parc linac has developed the output beam power by increasing of acceleration energy and the peak beam current. The beam loss is getting serious along with increasing the output beam power, however, the beam loss caused at the low energy part is difficult to detect due to the low energy radioactive emission. An interlock system has been developed to prevent from the sufficient material activation using the beam current monitors. In the system, an electrical circuit to take the beam transmission between two beam current monitors is newly designed and fabricated. This paper describes the performance of the electrical circuit and the system configuration will be introduced.

The ESS, consisting of a pulsed proton linear accelerator, a rotating spallation target designed for an average beam power of up to 5 MW, and a suite of neutron instruments, requires a large variety of instrumentation, both for controlling as well as protecting the different hardware systems and the beam. The ESS beam power is unprecedented and an uncontrolled release could lead to serious damage of equipment installed along the tunnel and target station within only a few microseconds. Major failures of certain equipment will result in long repair times, because it is delicate and difficult to access and sometimes located in high radiation areas. To optimize the operational efficiency of the facility, accidents should be avoided and interruptions should be rare and limited to a short time. Hence, a sophisticated machine protection system is required. In order to stop efficiently the proton beam production in case of failures, a Fast Beam Interlock (FBI) system with a targeted reaction time of less than 5 microseconds and very high dependability is being designed. The design approach for this FPGA-based interlock system will be presented as well as the status on prototyping.

The Equipment Protection Systems and Personnel Safety Systems of the ALBA Synchrotron are complex and highly distributed control systems based on PLC's from different vendors. EPS and PSS not only regulate the interlocks of the whole ALBA facility but provide an extense network of analog and digital sensors that collect information from all subsystems; as well as its logical states. TANGO is the Control System framework used at ALBA, providing several tools and services (GUI's, Archiving, Alarms) in which EPS and PSS systems must be integrated. PyPLC, a dynamic Tango device, have been developed in python to provide a flexible interface and enable PLC developers to automatically update it. This paper describes how protection systems and the PLC code generation cycle have been fully integrated within TANGO Control System at ALBA.

The beam abort system was installed in KEKB in order to protect the accelerator equipment and the Belle detector, and for radiation safety, from high current beams. For SuperKEKB, the new abort trigger system was developed. It collects more than 130 beam abort request signals and issues the beam abort trigger signal to the abort kickers. The request signals are partially aggregated in local control rooms located along the SuperKEKB ring and finally aggregated in central control room. In order to increase the system reliability, the VME-based module and the O/E module was developed, and all the abort signals between the modules are transmitted as optical signals. The VME-based module aggregates input signals and input signals are OR and latched. The E/O module converts electrical signal from abort request source to optical signal. The system also has the timestamp function to keep track of the abort signal received time. The timestamps are expected to contribute to identify the cause of the beam abort. Based on feasibility tests with a prototype module, the new module design was improved and fixed. This paper describes the details of the new abort trigger system.

As the recovery from the nuclear accident in Fukushima progresses, strong demands arise on the continuous monitoring of individual radiation exposure based on action histories in a large group, such as the residents returning to their hometown after decontamination, or the workers involved in the decomissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. KURAMA-micro, a personal dosimetry system with network and positioning capability, is developed for such purpose. KURAMA-micro consists of a semiconductor dosimeter and a DAQ board based on OpenATOMS. Each unit records radiation data tagged with their measurement time and locations, and uploads the data to the server over a ZigBee-based network once each unit comes near one of the access points prepared expected activities range of users. Location data are basically obtained by a GPS unit, and an additional radio beacon scheme using ZigBee broadcast protocol is also used for the indoor positioning. The development of a proto-type KURAMA-micro is finished and a field test for the workers of a nuclear reactor under normal operation is planned in the spring of 2015.

Engineering of Personnel Protection Systems (PPS) in large research facilities, such CERN, represents nowadays a major challenge in terms of requirements for safety and access control functionalities. PPS are usually conceived as two separate independent entities: a Safety System dealing with machine interlocks and subject to rigid safe-ty standards (e.g. IEC-61508); and a conventional Access Control System made by integration of different COTS technologies. The latter provides a large palette of func-tionalities and tools intended either to assist users access-ing the controlled areas, either to automate a certain number of control room operator's tasks. In this paper we analyse the benefits in terms of performance, cost and system maintainability of adopting the new generation of NI multipurpose CRIO 903x controllers. These new de-vices allows an optimal integration of a large set of access control functionalities, namely: automatic control of mo-torized devices, identification/count of users in zone, im-plementation of dedicated anti-intrusion algorithms, graphical display of relevant information for local users, and remote control/monitoring for control room opera-tors.

The Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) Facility will provide an electron beam with up to 3000 bunches per macro-pulse, 5Hz repetition rate and 300 MeV beam energy. The completed machine will be capable of sustaining an average electron beam power of close to 15KW at the bunch charge of 3.2nC. A robust Machine Protection System (MPS) capable of interrupting the beam within a macro-pulse and that interfaces well with new and existing controls system infrastructure has been developed to mitigate and analyze faults related to this relatively high damage potential. This paper describes the component layers of the MPS system, including a FPGA-based Permit Generator and Laser Pulse Controller, the Beam Loss Monitoring system design as well as the controls and related work done to date.

Approaching the commissioning of CRYRING, the first accelerator to be operated using the new control system for FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research), the new settings management system will also be deployed in a production environment for the first time. A major development effort is ongoing to realize requirements necessary to support accelerator operations at FAIR. The focus is on the pattern concept which allows controlling the whole facility with its different parallel beams in an integrative way. Being able to utilize central parts of the new control system already at CRYRING, before the first FAIR accelerators are commissioned, facilitates an early proof of concept and testing possibilities. Concurrently, refactorings and enhancements of the commonly used LSA (LHC Software Architecture) framework take place. At CERN, the interface to devices has been redesigned to enhance maintainability and diagnostics capabilities. At GSI, support for polynomials as a native datatype has been implemented, which will be used to represent accelerator settings as well as calibration curves. Besides functional improvements, quality assurance measures are being taken to increase code quality in prospect of productive use.

SOLEIL Computing division continuously needs to enhance its operational activities and minimize the workload of IT groups because IT performances directly impacts accelerators and beamlines operations in a context of an increase of the overall technical and organizational complexity. The Control & Data Acquisition group changed in 2013 it internal projects and support organization toward a service-oriented approach. This promising first step pointed out that enhancing the service delivered to our customers required to agree with them on a common vocabulary, on semantics and on operational processes. The ITIL* methodology appeared then as very good starting point to this purpose. This paper will describe the overall vision of our project 'Improving IT operation with a service oriented approach' and will detail the first ITIL operational processes we have adopted and how it helped us clarifying roles and responsibilities within our IT organization. In order to conclude the paper will give perspectives of using ITIL practices to enhance operational practices of other technical groups which activities strongly impact the service delivered to SOLEIL end users.

At FAIR the re-assembly of the well known CRYRING accelerator, formerly hosted by Manne Siegbahn Laboratory (MSL) Stockholm, is currently in progress. This compact low energy heavy ion synchrotron and experimental storage ring will be a testing platform for all control system (CS) concepts decided on for FAIR. The CRYRING CS will be based on the system originally developed by CERN which combines the JAVA based application level LSA (LHC Software Architecture) , the data acquisition level FESA (Front-End Software Architecture) and the White Rabbit based timing system. All parts have been enhanced with GSI specific functionality. In preparation for the commissioning of CRYRING later in 2015 all required beam instrumentation (BI) equipment including the software is now under development. The data acquisition (DAQ) concepts for the various instruments is presented, with emphasis on the seamless integration into the overall CS. For standard BI systems, such as digital imaging, profile and intensity measurement, VME and IndustryPC based DAQ systems are used. For beam position monitoring a new hardware strategy which combines the microTCA and FMC (FPGA mezzanine card) form factors is under evaluation.

EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) is the first full superconducting experimental Tokamak fusion device in the world which has been carried out ten campaigns since its implementation at the end of 2005. The cryogenic control system for EAST was designed based on DeltaV DCS of Emerson Corporation which has been in operation for the same time period and has been proved to be safe and stable. However, Manny control components have been running beyond the expected lifetime gradually. Many problems from control system have affected the cryogenic system reliability. This paper presents the current status and upgrade solutions of the cryogenic control system of EAST.

The Electron Lens upgrade project at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has reached an operational status, whereby intense, pulsed or DC beams of electrons are generated in order to interact with the RHIC polarized proton beams in both the Blue and Yellow Rings at the 10 o'clock Interaction Region. Interactions between the electrons and protons are utilized to counteract the beam-beam effect that arises from the desired polarized proton collisions, which result in a higher RHIC luminosity. A complex system for operating the e-lens has been developed, including superconducting and non-superconducting magnet controls, instrumentation systems, a COTS-based Machine Protection System, custom Blue and Yellow e-lens timing systems for synchronizing the electron beam with the RHIC timing system, beam alignment software tools for maximizing electron-proton collisions, as well as complex user interfaces to support routine operation of the system. e-lens software and hardware design will be presented, as well as recent updates to the system that were required in order to meet changing system requirements in preparation for the first operational run of the system.

Sirius is a new 3 GeV synchrotron light source currently being designed at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) in Campinas, Brazil. The Control System will be distributed and digitally connected to all equipment in order to avoid analog signal cables. A three-layer control system will be used. The equipment layer uses RS485 serial networks, running at 10Mbps, with a light proprietary protocol, over a proprietary hardware, in order to achieve good performance. The middle layer, interconnecting these serial networks, is based on Beaglebone Black single board computer and commercial switches. Operation layer will be composed of PC's running EPICS client programs. Special topology will be used for Orbit Feedback with a dedicated commercial 10Gbps switch. The lower layers software implementation may use either (a) distributed EPICS conventional servers, the traditional approach, or (b) centralized EPICS server, using data servers and light proprietary protocol over Ethernet. Both cases use the same hardware and can run concurrently, sharing the control network. Measured performance with these two approaches will be presented.

The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) linear accelerator drives five user facilities: Isotope Production, Proton Radiography, Ultra-Cold Neutrons, Weapons Neutron Research, and Neutron Scattering. In 2011, we started an ambitious project to refurbish key elements of the LANSCE accelerator that have become obsolete or were near end-of-life. The control system went through an upgrade process that affected different areas of LANSCE. Many improvements have been made but funding challenges and LANSCE operational commitments have delayed project deliverables. In this paper, we will discuss our upgrade choices, what we have accomplished so far, what we have learned about upgrading the existing control system and what challenges we still face.

Los Alamos National Laboratory has defined a new signature science facility, Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes (MaRIE) that builds on the existing capabilities of the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). It will be the first multi-probe materials research center to combine high-energy, high-repetition-rate, coherent x-rays with electron and proton-beam charged-particle imaging to perform in-situ measurements of a sample in extreme environments. At its core, a 42-keV XFEL will be coupled with the LANSCE MW proton accelerator. A pre-conceptual design for MaRIE has been established. Technical risk reduction for the project includes an injector test-stand that is currently being designed. New accelerators are either planned, under construction, or currently in operation around the world, providing opportunities for the MaRIE project to leverage the instrumentation & controls (I&C) efforts of these facilities to minimize non-recurring engineering costs. This paper discusses possible MaRIE I&C system implementation choices and trade-offs, and also provides an overview of the proposed MaRIE facilities and the current design.

The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project aims at building the world's largest radio observatory to observe the radio sky with unprecedented sensitivity and collecting area. In the SKA1 phase of the project, two dish arrays are to be built, one in South Africa (SKA1-Mid) and the other in Western Australia (SKA1-Survey). Each antenna will be provided with a local monitor and control system, enabling remote operations to engineers and to the Telescope Manager system. In this paper we present the current status of the software system being designed to monitor and control the dish subsystem. An overview of the dish instrumentation is reported, along with details concerning the software architecture, functional interfaces, prototyping and the evaluated technologies.

The Belle II e+/e− collider experiment at KEK will include a new pixelated detector (PXD) based on DEPFET technology as the innermost layer. This detector requires a complex control and readout infrastructure consisting of several ASICs and FPGA boards. This paper present the architecture and EPICS-based implementation of the control, alarm, and interlock systems, their interface to the various subsystems, and to the NSM2-based Belle II run-control. The complex startup sequence is orchestrated by a statemachine. CSS is used to implement the user interface. The alarm system uses CSS/BEAST, and is designed to minimize spurious alarms. The interlock system consists of two main parts: a hardware-based system that triggers on adverse environmental (temperature, humidity, radiation) conditions, and a software-based system. Strict monitoring including the use of heartbeats ensures permanent protection and fast reaction times. Especially the power supply system is monitored for malfunctions, and all user inputs are verified before they are sent to the hardware. The control system also incorporates archiving, logging, and reporting in a uniform workflow for the ease of daily operation.

During the normal operation of the Large Hadron Collider, the high hadron flux level induced several Single Event Errors (SEE failure caused by a particle passing through) to the standard electronics installed. Such events perturbed LHC normal operation. As a consequence, a mitigation plan to minimise radiation-induced failures and optimise LHC operation was started: R2E mitigation project. This paper will deal with the mitigation problem for LHC/P8 equipment and the main improvements for the equipment in P4, with special focus on the controllers for the Active Magnetic Bearings used in the IHI-LINDE cold compressors. In addition, a new approach based on frequency response analysis to assess the cold compressor mechanical quality will be presented. The hardware and software design, implemented to increase the global reliability of the system, will be highlighted. A corresponding experiment protocol was developed at CERN in collaboration with the MECOS Company and the Universities of Sannio and Napoli Federico II. Preliminary experimental results showing the performance of the proposed approach on a case study for the cold compressor in P4 will be finally reported.

The Alba Controls Group develops and operates a diverse variety of controls software which is shared within international communities of users and developers. This includes: generic frameworks like Sardana* and Taurus**, numerous Tango*** device servers and applications where, among others, we can find PyAlarm and Panic****, and specific experiment procedures and hardware controllers. A study has commenced on how to improve the delivery process of our software from the hands of developers to laboratories, by making this process more reliable, predictable and risk-controlled. Automated unit and acceptance tests combined with the continuous integration, have been introduced, providing valuable and fast feedback to the developers. In order to renew and automate our legacy packaging and deployment system we have evaluated modern alternatives. The above practices were brought together into a design of the continuous delivery pipelines which were validated on a set of diverse software. This paper presents this study, its results and a proposal of the cost-effective implementation.

The laser beam (10 PW, 15 fs, 150 J, 1023 W/cm2) generated by APOLLON Laser System, now under construction on Magurele Platform near Bucharest may also be applied in radiotherapy. Starting from this potential application, location of malign tumors in patient may be situated, e.g., superficial (≤5 cm), semi-deep (5-10 cm) and profound (>10-40 cm). This paper presents the main physical parameters of a research project for a therapy based on hadrons controlled by laser, for the treatment of superficial and semi-deep tumors. Energies required for pin-pointing the depth of such tumors are 50-117 MeV for protons and 100-216 MeV/u for carbon ions. Hadron beams with such energies can be generated by the mechanism Radiation Pressure Acceleration (RPA). Besides, the control systems to provide the daily absorbed dose from the direct and indirect ionizing radiation at the level of the malign tumor of 2 Gy in 1 or 2 minutes with expanded uncertainty of 3% are presented.

A unified control design is proposed to simultaneously determine control actions for both fast and slow arrays of correctors used for orbit feedback. By determining the interaction of the spatial subspaces of each array of correctors, spatial modes which require both fast and slow correctors can be identified. For these modes, a mid-ranging control technique is proposed to systematically allocate control action for each corrector. The mid-ranging control technique exploits the different dynamic characteristics of the correctors to ensure that the two arrays of actuators work together and avoid saturation of the fast correctors. Simulation results for the Diamond Storage Ring are presented.

In 2016 Diamond Light Source will replace one double bend achromatic cell of the Storage Ring with two double bend achromatic cells in the same longitudinal space. This will create an additional straight section for an insertion device (ID), thereby converting a bending magnet source point into and ID source point. Installation of the two new cells and recommissioning of the SR will take place in an eight week shutdown. The additional components in the two new cells necessitate a substantial reworking of the interface layer of control system, together with changes to all applications dependent on the physics parameters of the storage ring. This paper will describe how it is planned to manage the control system aspects of the project.
Presented on behalf of the DDBA control and instrumentation team.

Closed loop stability of electron orbit feedback controllers is affected by mismatches between the accelerator model and the real machine. In this paper, the small gain theorem is used to express analytical criteria for closed loop stability in the presence of spatial uncertainty. It is also demonstrated how the structure of the uncertainty models affects the conservativeness of the robust stability results. The robust stability criteria are applied to the Diamond Light Source electron orbit controller and bounds on the allowable size of spatial uncertainties which guarantee closed loop stability is determined.

Electron orbit feedback controllers are based on the inversion of the response matrix of the storage ring and as a result, mismatches between the accelerator model and the real machine can limit controller performance or cause the controller to become unstable. In order to perform stability analysis tests of the controller, accurate uncertainty descriptions are required. In this paper, BPM scaling errors, actuator scaling errors and drifts in tune are considered as the main sources of spatial uncertainties and because most electron orbit feedback systems use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decouple the inputs and outputs of the system, the uncertainty can be expressed in terms of this decomposition. However SVD does not allow the main sources of uncertainty to be decoupled so instead, a Fourier-based decomposition of the response matrix is used to decouple and model the uncertainties. In this paper, both Fourier and SVD uncertainty modelling methods are applied to the Diamond Light Source storage ring and compared.

The Solaris is a synchrotron light source starting just now in Kraków, Poland. It is built with strong collaboration with other European accelerator facilities. The MAX-IV project in Lund, Sweden and Tango Community are the most important partners in the project. Solaris has built a twin copy of MAX-IV 1.5GeV ring and linear accelerator based on the same components as the ones of MAX-IV. Thus, both facilities share know-how and apply similar technologies for the control system, among them the Tango CS is used for software layer. Status of the control system in Kraków as well as collaborations and technological choices impact on its success will be presented.
