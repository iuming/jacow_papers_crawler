The UNIversal Linear Accelerator (UNILAC) at GSI has served as injector for all ion species from protons for uranium for the past four decades. Especially its 108 MHz Alvarez type DTL providing acceleration from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u has suffered from material fatigue. The DTL will be replaced by a completely new section with almost the same design parameters, i.e. pulsed current of up to 15 mA of 238U28+ at 11.4 MeV/u. However, operation will be restricted to low beam duty cycles as 200 μs at 10 Hz. Since preservation of beam quality is mandatory, a regular focusing lattice, as along an Alvarez section for instance, is aimed for. A new source terminal & LEBT dedicated to operation with 238U4+ is under design. The uranium sources need to be upgraded in order to provide increased beam brilliances and for operation at 3 Hz. Revision of the subsequent 36 MHz RFQ electrode design has started as well as the layout activities of the section providing transition from the 36 MHz section to the 108 MHz DTL.

As an upgrade project of the existing HI-13 tandem accelerator facility, the Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility (BRIF) is being constructed in China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). This project consists of a 100MeV proton compact cyclotron, a two-stages ISOL system, a superconducting linac booster and various experimental terminals. In this talk, the construction progress of BRIF will be presented in detail. The beam commissioning of the cyclotron is in progress and we got the first 100 MeV beam on July 4, 2014. The beam current was stably maintained at above 25 uA for about 9 hours on July 25, 2014, which is ready for providing CW beam on target for RIB production. The installation of ISOL system is finished and the stable ion beam test shows it can reach a mass resolution better than 10000. It is expected to generate dozens of RIB by 100 MeV proton beam. In additions, this talk also introduce the recent progress of the pre-study of a 800 MeV, 3-4 MW separate-sector proton cyclotron, which is proposed to provide high power proton beam for various applications, such as neutron and neutrino physics, proton radiography and nuclear data measurement and ADS study as well.

FRIB will deliver heavy ion beams at a power level of 400 kW on the production target. The high beam power requires understanding of processes involved in the production of ion beams by ECR ion sources and defining the beam quality. Also, careful control of the beam phase space is required during transport and acceleration of the beam from ion sources to the SRF linac. In this paper, we describe features of the FRIB front end related to the beam production and control of the beam phase space. Where possible we discuss parallels with other facilities.
