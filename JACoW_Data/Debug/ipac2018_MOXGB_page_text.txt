The SuperKEKB electron-positron collider is being commissioned at KEK in three phases. The first phase was successfully completed in 2016, focusing on vacuum scrubbing and single beam studies without final focus optics. The second phase will start in March 2018 and until mid of July 2018. It will be dedicated to achieving the target specific luminosity larger than 4x1031 cm-2s-1/mA2, using the novel "nano-beam" collision scheme. Final focus optics will be installed, as well as the Belle-II detector, but without the vertex detector. The second phase of commissioning will also serve to assess and learn to control backgrounds induced by beam losses near the interaction region, expected to be larger than at KEKB in the past, as a result of the much smaller beams. This will be important before installing the vertex detector for the final phase of commissioning, due to start at the beginning of 2019, when high luminosity needed for data taking with the Belle-II detector should be achieved. The speaker will present the recent progress and performance of SuperKEKB that is enabled by these upgrades.

The Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) is TRIUMF's flagship project to create isotopes for science, medicine and business. ARIEL will triple TRIUMF's rare isotope beam capability, enabling more and new experiments in materials science, nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental symmetries, as well as the development of new isotopes for the life sciences. Beams from ARIEL's new 35 MeV, 100kW electron linear accelerator and from TRIUMF's original 500 MeV cyclotron will enable breakthrough experiments with the laboratory's suite of world-class experiments at the Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) facility. This invited talk will present an overview of TRIUMF, the ARIEL project, and the exciting science they enable.
