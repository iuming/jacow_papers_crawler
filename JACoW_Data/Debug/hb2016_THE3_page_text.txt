The China Accelerator Driven Subcritical system (C-ADS) linac, which is composed of an ECR ion source, a low energy beam transport line (LEBT), a radio frequency quadrupole accelerator (RFQ), a medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) and cryomodules with SRF cavities to boost the energy up to 10 MeV. The injector linac will be equipped with beam diagnostics to measure the beam position, the transverse profile and emittance, the beam phase as well as beam current and beam losses. Though many are conventional design, They can provide efficient operation of drive linac. This paper gives an overview and detail in beam commissioning of C-ADS linac beam instrumentation.

Because several of the SNS targets have had a shorter lifetime than desired, a new target has been instrumented with strain sensors to further our understanding of the proton beam’s mechanical impact. The high radiation and electrically noisy environment led us to pick multi-mode fiber optical strain sensors over other types of strain sensors. Special care was taken to minimize the impact of the sensors on the target’s lifetime. We also placed accelerometers outside the target to try correlating the outside measurements with the internal measurements. Remote manipulators performed the final part of the installation, as even residual radiation is too high for humans to come close to the target’s final location. The initial set of optical sensors on the first instrumented target lasted just long enough to give us measurements from different proton beam intensities. A second set of more rad-hard sensors, installed in the following target, lasted much longer, to give us considerably more data. We are developing our own rad-hard, single-mode fiber optic sensors. This paper describes the design, installation, data-acquisition system, the results of the strain sensors, and future plans.

Before approaching the micro-loss monitor concept, we propose to present the high intensity Linac for which the R&D program was done, LIPAc (Linear IFIMIF Prototype Accelerator). This later is the feasibility accelerator demonstrator for the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF). IFMIF aims at providing a very intense neutron source (1018 neutron/m2/s) to test materials for the future fusion reactors, beyond ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor). LIPAc (1.125 MW deuteron beam) is in installation progress at Rokkasho (Japan). Then, we will focus on the feasibility study of the beam optimization inside the SRF Linac part. Commissioning of such high beam intensity has to be done with a different approach based on detection of micro-losses, CVD diamonds, set inside the cryomodule linac.

The beam collimation system of J-PARC main ring has been prepared in order to localize the beam loss into the specified area, especially during the injection period. At the first time, it was constructed as a scraper-catcher system in horizontal and vertical planes which consisted of one halo-scraper and two scattered protons catchers, whose the maximum beam loss capacity was designed to be 450W in the beam injection straight of the ring. In 2012, the scraper was replaced by two collimators with a movable L-type jaw for both planes. Two catchers remained at the same places, and they were used as collimators. This large change of design concept of main ring collimation system was required in order to increase the beam loss capacity more than 3kW. The system worked well but unexpected loss spots still remained in the following arc and straight sections. The four-axis collimator was developed with movable jaw in horizontal, vertical and skew configurations which has high cleaning efficiency. We have four four-axis collimators, two non-skew collimators, and one original catcher. The most effective arrangement of collimators was investigated in this report.
