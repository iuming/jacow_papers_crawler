We discuss beam-beam limit in Higgs factories for luminosity limit and beam lifetime. Higgs factory is very high energy circular collider. The damping time is order of 100 turns. A high beam-beam tune shift (~0.1) is achieved in LEP, and is adopted as design value based on the experience. We now review this point, beam-beam limit vs. damping rate.

CESR has operated since 1983 with multi-bunch pretzel orbits to realize substantial improvements in luminosity. Building on this experience, we suggest what aspects of the CESR pretzel experience are relevant in the design of a circular e+e− Higgs Factory as well as possible new phenomena.
