The superconducting Darmstadt linear accelerator S-DALINAC is a 130 MeV thrice-recirculating linac for electrons, running at 3 GHz in cw [1]. It can be operated in a conventional acceleration scheme for an experimental program in nuclear physics and as an energy recovery linac (ERL) [2]. Since 1991, the S-DALINAC was mainly developed and operated by students and junior researchers, e.g., within their thesis works. Recent upgrades include measures for improved beam quality and diagnostics. The previous five-cell capture cavity in the superconducting injector with a beta of 1 was, for example, replaced by a 6-cell capture cavity with an injection-matched beta of 0.86. Other projects address the treatment and development of SRF cavities (N-doping, surface preparation, Nb3Sn coating) or the improvement of diagnostics, including the installation of a diagnosis beam-line upstream of the injector and dedicated RF control for the quantification of ERL performance. An overview on the facility and recent projects will be given. Latest operational experience on the conventional and on the ERL mode will be presented. A focus will be on the 6-cell cavity from design to commissioning.
