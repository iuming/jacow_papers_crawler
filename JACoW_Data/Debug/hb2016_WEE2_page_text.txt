The LHC achieved in 2015 record stored beam energies of about 280MJ with 6.5TeV proton beams, surpassing by about 2 orders of magnitudes achieved in previous superconducting colliders. The LHC collimation system played a key role in this achievement, ensuring a safe operation well below quench limits of superconducting magnets. In this paper, the collimation system for the LHC Run II is presented. Accelerator physics and operational challenges for controlling LHC beam losses are discussed and the collimation performance is reviewed. Limitations of the system and requirements for operating the LHC beyond Run II are also reviewed.

We present a study of the halo collimation of ion beams from proton up to uranium in the projected FAIR heavy ion synchrotron SIS100. The design concepts are separated into fully stripped and partially stripped ion collimation. An application of the two stage betatron collimation system is intended for fully stripped ions and protons. Interaction of the particles with the primary collimator material was simulated using FLUKA. Particle tracking simulations and beam loss maps were obtained using MAD-X. The concept for the collimation of partially stripped ions is based on a stripping foil in order to change their charge state. These ions are subsequently deflected towards collimators using a quadrupole magnetic field. The charge state distribution of the stripped ions was calculated using GLOBAL. The particle tracking simulations downstream of the foil were performed using MAD-X. Inelastic nuclear interaction and consequently hadronic fragmentation and electromagnetic dissociation of heavy ions were simulated using FLUKA. The fragments with a significant abundance were tracked through the accelerator lattice and their contribution to the overall beam loss distribution was estimated.

The robust conjugate direction search (RCDS) method, which is developed by X. Huang from the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, has high tolerance against noise in beam experiments and thus can find an optimal solution effectively and efficiently. In this paper, the RCDS method is used to optimize the beam collimation system for Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). A two-stage beam collimation system was designed to localize the beam loss in the collimation section in CSNS/RCS. The parameters of secondary collimators are optimized with RCDS algorithm based on detailed tracking with the ORBIT program for a better performance of the collimation system. The study presents a way to quickly find an optimal parameter combination of the secondary collimators for a machine model for preparation for CSNS/RCS commissioning.

As a multi-charge-state, heavy-ion, superconducting accelerator with a folded geometry, FRIB faces unique beam loss detection and collimation challenges to protect superconducting cavities from beam-induced damage. Collimation is especially important in the Folding Segment 1 where the multiple charge states are created by a charge stripper and selected by a charge selector. The transported ECR contaminants, interaction with the residual gas, and beam halo due to stripping could induced significant beam losses in this region. We have simulated the potential beam losses and planned collimation accordingly. A layered loss detection network is also specifically designed to visualize potential blind zones and to meet the stringent requirements on loss detection. The related sub-systems are designed and procured and are introduced in this paper.
