Synchrotrons need robust products. That is why the association of piezo actuator technology and CEDRAT TECHNOLOGIES (CTEC) know-how has been successful for synchrotron mechanisms projects. The technological brick is the "Amplified Piezo Actuator" (APA®) tested and widely used in space applications, it is often implemented in CTEC piezo mechanisms and provides a high level of robustness. Modifying the layout and the number of APA® allows several needs to be addressed within beamlines. Three applications developed in collaboration with the EMBL, PAL and SOLEIL will be presented in this paper. The first application consists of cutting a beam with a piezo shutter. The maximum beam diameter is 3 mm. The second mechanism allows the energy of a beam to be modified by using a series of piezo actuated filters. And the last mechanism aims at modifying the beam section shape with an active piezo micro-slits mechanism.

The Advanced Photon Source (APS) is currently in the process of upgrading to a 4th generation high-energy light source. A new multi-bend achromat storage ring will provide increased brightness and an orders-of-magnitude improvement in coherent flux over the current facility. To take advantage of these new capabilities, we will be building nine new feature beamlines and implementing numerous additional beamline enhancements, all while ensuring the compatibility of existing programs. Clear challenges exist in advancing state-of-the-art optics and developing nano-resolution instrumentation. We also need to recognize and address project scheduling, labor resources, existing infrastructure, bending magnet param-eters, and possible modifications to radiation shielding in order to achieve project success.
Sub Classification should be something like General Beamline Design but option not available.

PtyNAMi: Ptychographic Nano-Analytical Microscope at PETRA III  -How to Achieve Sub-nanometer Sample Stability

In recent years, ptychography has been established as a method in X-ray microscopy to achieve a spatial resolution even below the diffraction limit of x-ray optics, down to a few nm. This requires, among other things, an extremely high degree of mechanical stability, a low background signal from the x-ray microscope and highest demands on the beam guiding and focusing optics. PtyNAMi is the new generation hard x-ray scanning microscope at beamline P06 of PETRA III at DESY combining a sample scanner designed for maximal stability, a new detector system designed to reduce background signals, and an interferometric position control of sample and X-ray optics. The interferometer system enables tracking the sample position relative to the optics in scanning microscopy and tomography on all relevant time scales. This is crucial for high-resolution scanning x-ray microscopy to track vibrations and long-term drifts in the noisy environment of a synchrotron radiation source in user operation. We present the design concept in detail with a special focus on real-time metrology of the sample position during 3D x-ray scanning microscopy using a ball-lens retroreflector.

A New Procurement Strategy to Challenge the Supplier Constraints Created When Using a Fully Developed Reference Design
327

A common procurement strategy is to produce a fully optimised reference design that makes assumptions about the manufacturing process and supplier capability. This approach can restrict the opportunities for some companies to include their own specialist manufacturing capability to provide a more effective and cost efficient solution. A new approach is suggested following the recent experience at Diamond Light Source. The manufacture of high stiffness welded fabrications up to 13m in length for the I21 RIXS Spectrometer is used as an example. The I21 RIXS Spectrometer design was optimised for stiffness and control of vibration. The use of Finite Element Analysis enabled different design options and compromises to be explored utilising the supplier's capabilities. The final design was tested during manufacture to verify the FEA model. With the I21 RIXS Spectrometer commissioned the data collected shows the final stability performance of the system including detector stability over full experiment durations has met the scientific goals of the design.

With the onset of high power XFELs and diffraction limited storage rings, there is a growing demand to maintain sub nanometer mirror figures even under high heat load. This is a difficult issue as the optimum cooling design for an optic is highly dependent on the power footprint on the mirror, which can be highly dynamic. Resistive Element Adjustable Length cooling can be utilized to change the cooling parameters during an experiment to adapt for changing beam parameters. A case study of the new soft x-ray monochromator for the LCLS L2SI program is presented that utilizes this new capability to allow the beam to translate across the mirror for different operation modes, greatly simplifying the monochromator mechanics.

Cooling of in-vacuum beamline components has always been problematic.  Water cooling lines can transfer vibrations to critical components, and often require complex air guarding systems to ensure that the vacuum envelope is not breached in the event of a leak. These constraints increase design complexity, limit options, and provide challenges for assembly and maintenance. Commercial heat pipes are inexpensive and readily available.  Custom assemblies can be fabricated into vacuum flanges and may use non-water based cooling mediums if required.  A mockup of an optical assembly has been used to explore vibration reduction and cooling capacity.  Other example beamline components such as a heat generating  electromagnetic shutter demonstrate the cooling capability of these heat pipes.
