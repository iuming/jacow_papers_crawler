After many years of development, current preparation methods for niobium SRF cavities regularly achieve performance levels very close to the fundamental limitations of the material. Continued progress requires looking to alternative superconductors, but fabricating a high quality RF surface from these materials has proven uniquely challenging. In this talk, I will discuss the worldwide progress towards fabricating SRF cavity surfaces with alternative materials such as Nb3Sn, NbN, and MgB2. I will also discuss thin films and multilayer films of alternative materials, proposed as an alternative to bulk superconductors. I will present an improved theoretical understanding of the potential of such films. I will discuss new results and make suggestions for future directions beyond niobium.
