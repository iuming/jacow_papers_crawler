Fast beam-based alignment (BBA) of BPMs and quadrupole magnets was evolved and demonstrated at ALBA*. A conventional BBA method makes a local bump, change quadrupole strength, and measure COD by the quadrupole, which is very time-consuming. However, the fast BBA using AC excitations of corrector magnets can quickly measure the displacement between a BPM and a quadrupole. In the case of ALBA, the BBA duration was reduced from 5 hours to 10 minutes. The accuracy was the same as the conventional BBA (~10 um). This fast BBA method will help the alignment of BPMs in 3rd and 4th generation light sources.

As synchrotron beamlines increasingly use micro-focus techniques with detectors sampling at kHz rates, the need for real-time monitoring of the beam position at similar bandwidths is vital. Commercially available single-crystal CVD diamond X-ray diagnostics are well established as excellent non-destructive monitors for synchrotron X-ray beamlines. Silicon carbide (4H-SiC) X-ray beam position monitors (XBPMs) are a recent development with the potential to provide the same benefits as their diamond counterparts with larger usable apertures and lower cost. At Diamond Light Source a comparison between single-crystal CVD diamond and 4H-SiC XBPMs has been carried out. The sc-diamond and 4H-SiC beam position monitors are mounted in-line along the beam path, so that synchronous kHz measurements of the synchrotron X-ray beam motion can be measured. Several tests of the two position monitors performance are presented: comparing kHz beam position measurements from the detectors, temporal response, and signal uniformity across the face of the detectors. Each test is performed with varying bias voltages applied to the detectors. A discussion of the benefits and limitations of 4H-SiC and diamond detectors is included.

SXFEL is a soft X-ray free electron laser user facility that is current being commissioned in Shanghai. It is based on a 1.5 GeV normal conducting high gradient C-band (linear accelerator) LINAC and contains two FEL beamline, a seeded FEL beamline and a SASE beamline, and five experimental stations. The performance of X-ray FEL depends strongly on the quality of the electron beam and single shot stability. We have developed a BPM system including SBPM and CBPM. The resolution of SBPM is better than 4μmeters, and the resolution of CBPM is better than 176 nm. Because of its excellent position resolution, it plays an important role in the SASE beamline commissioning. The beam adjusters rely on this system to find and maintain an ideal track, and complete the debugging of the SBP beamline within 21 days. This paper presents the system design, methods used to determine the resolution, the performance, and the applications of those BPMs.
