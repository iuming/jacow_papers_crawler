In the last 43 years, the performance of high charge state ECRIS has improved dramatically as a result of improvements to the magnetic field confinement, increases in the microwave heating frequency and techniques to stabilize the plasma at high densities. For example, in 1973 15 eμA of O6+ was produced in an ECRIS and now it is possible to produce as much as 4500 eμA. In this paper the parameters and performance of ECRIS are reviewed and compared to empirical scaling laws* to see what can be expected when fourth generation ECRIS begin to operate.
