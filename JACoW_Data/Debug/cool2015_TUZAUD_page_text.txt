Compared to other cooling techniques laser cooling potentially provides a cooling force that increase with increasing beam energy. Thus, laser cooling will be adopted at future high energy ion storage rings such as SIS 100 at FAIR. In the talk we discuss the fundamentals of laser cooling and the prospects of the technique in the light of recent developments in laser technology and new theoretical investigations on cooling transitions. We present our analysis on the choice of ions for initial test experiments in the light of recent results at ESR and CSRe. The presentation will conclude by analysing the beam dynamics of laser cooled ion beams and from these show how optical diagnostics can complement conventional beam diagnostics.

Electronic and nuclear wave functions significantly overlap for inner-shell electrons. Their quantum state is strongly influenced by the resulting enhancement of relativistic, QED and nuclear size effects. In highly charged ions (HCIs), the relative reduction of electronic correlations contributions improves the visibility of the underlying physics phenomena. These facts have driven research efforts with HCIs, yet the typically high temperatures (MK) at which they are produced and trapped in the laboratory constitute a hindrance for application of laser spectroscopic methods. To overcome this, we have interfaced an electron beam ion trap source for HCIs with a cryogenic linear Paul trap (*) that can also store laser-cooled Be+ Coulomb crystals. Those are used for sympathetic stopping and cooling of the incoming precooled and decelerated HCI bunches, inducing the formation of stable mixed-species crystals (**). The strongly suppressed thermal motion (mK scale) of the co-crystallized HCIs offers novel possibilities for investigation of questions regarding the time variation of fundamental constants (***), parity non-conservation effects, and quantum electrodynamics.

Within the FAIR project, laser cooling of highly intense, ultra relativistic ion beams will be attempted for the first time, and in a large (circumference 1084 m) and strong (max. magnetic rigidity 100 Tm) synchrotron, called "SIS100". Laser cooling of such ion beams should result in a further increase of the longitudinal phase space density and in non-Gaussian longitudinal beam profiles. For stable operation of such ion beams, and for optimization of the cooling process, both the laser force and the high-intensity effects have to be studied numerically in advance. The efficiency of laser cooling has been analyzed for different synchrotron frequency regimes. At high beam intensities, intra-beam scattering and space-charge effects have been found to counteract the laser cooling force. We will discuss how they influence the laser cooling efficiency and thus affect the cooling time.
