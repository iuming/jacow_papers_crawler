The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is based upon the CW, SC driver linac to accelerate all the stable isotopes up to more than 200 MeV/u with a beam power of 400 kW. The front end (FE) commissioning shall start in 2017. This invited talk presents the FRIB front end design, and current status of FRIB front end commissioning, including beam properties and energy, and their relationship to FRIB operational requirements.

The realization of the new Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, FAIR at GSI, Germany, has advanced significantly. The civil construction process of the Northern part of the building complex, including the excavation of the SIS100 synchrotron tunnel has been launched end of 2017. On site of the GSI campus, major preparations and upgrade measures for the injector operation of the existing accelerator facilities are ongoing and will be completed mid of 2018. The shielding of the SIS18 accelerator tunnel has been enhanced for the booster operation at high repetition rates and high intensity Proton beams. Two new transformer stations were set-up and commissioned which will provide the required pulse and common power for FAIR. All major contracts for series production of SIS100 components have been signed and a large number of the superconducting SIS100 magnets has been produced and accepted. Major testing infrastructures for superconducting magnets of SIS100 and Super-FRS have been set-up at JINR, CERN and GSI. Also for all other FAIR accelerator systems, the procurement of the components is progressing well

40 Years of Electron Cooling at CERN

For nearly 40 years electron cooling has been used extensively on the storage rings of the CERN accelerator complex for the accumulation of ions or for the improvement of beam quality for precision experiments. Since the first cooling experiments on ICE the coolers have evolved to incorporate the latest advances in electron cooling technology and many unique experiments have also been performed when the coolers are not used for everyday operation. The trapping of anti-hydrogen atoms and more recently lead-lead and proton-lead ion collisions in the LHC have been made possible thanks to cooling in the AD and cooling and accumulation of lead ions in the LEIR respectively. The next cooler to be built at CERN will be installed on ELENA and will operate at electron energies below 350 eV. Many challenges lie ahead in operating at such a low energy with minimum perturbation to the storage ring. The present AD cooler, which has already seen two re-incarnations, will also be replaced with a new state-of-the-art device operating at higher energies in order to improve the quality of the antiproton beam in this ring.

The SNS linac output energy has increased since the start of neutron production in FY2007. The various improvements that contributed to the increase of the linac output energy are LLRF/control system improvement, high voltage converter modulator system improvement, high-power RF system improvement, cryomodule repairs, spare cryomodule development and accelerating gradient improvement through in-situ plasma processing. In this paper, the history of the SNS SCL output energy is reported, and plans for the near-term future and for the Proton Power Upgrade (PPU) project are also presented.

There are polarization losses in RHIC store due to various sources, such as emittance growth and higher order spin resonances. The beam polarization was measured several times over a store by the p-carbon polarimeters situated in both rings. These provide information on the polarization decay over time and also polarization profile development over time. A polarized jet was also used to monitor the polarization continuously through store, though with limited statistical accuracy. These polarization measurements and emittance measurements from the IPM are analyzed and the polarization loss from different sources are reviewed.
