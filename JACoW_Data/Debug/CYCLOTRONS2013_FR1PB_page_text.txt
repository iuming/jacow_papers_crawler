Computational and experimental results concerning acceleration and extraction of the 60-MeV proton beam at AIC-144 cyclotron of the Institute of Nuclear Physics (Kraków, Poland) are considered. A proton beam of the AIC-144 cyclotron is accelerated without large losses in the radial region of 12-62 cm and is extracted from the cyclotron with a pretty good overall efficiency of ~35%. The beam was used for successful treatment of 15 patients in 2011-2012.

High- and intermediate-energy protons are not able to directly form a track in a CR-39 etch detector (TED). Such detectors, however, can be used for the detection and dosimetry of the beams of these particles through the registration of secondary charged particles with sufficiently high values of linear energy transfer (LET). The studied were realized in a clinical proton beam of the NCC Korea, with primary energy of 72 to 220 MeV (1.1 to 0.4 KeV/ μm). The contribution of the secondary particle dose and the value of RBE both increase with decreasing proton energy. A strong agreement between experimentally obtained results and the predicted total cross sections was verified by the Alice code. Stimulation of the secondary particle dose by the Geant4 code also predicted results in agreement by experimental results. It is clear that higher cross sectional values lead to an increased production of secondary particles. This secondary particle dose is highly important for applications such as radiotherapy, radiobiology, and radiation protection.

Rare isotope beams produced by fragmentation of fast heavy ion beams are commonly separated using a combination of magnetic rigidity selection (mass to charge ratio) and energy-loss selection (largely dependent on proton number) using magnetic fragment separators. This method offers isotopic selection of the fragment of interest, however, the purity that can be achieved depends on the rigidity of the rare isotope with respect to more abundant fragments. This poses a problem specifically for neutron-deficient isotopes (towards the proton drip line) where much more abundant isotopes closer to stability can not be separated out. A separation by time-of-flight can further suppress such isotonic contaminants. The Radio Frequency Fragment Separator* deflects isotopes based on their phase relative to the cyclotron RF using a transverse electric RF field, effectively separating by time-of-flight. This method is in use for the production of neutron deficient rare isotope beams at NSCL.

The GANIL facility (Grand Accélérateur National d’Ions Lourds) at Caen produces and accelerates stable ion beams since 1982 for nuclear physics, atomic physics, radiobiology and material irradiation. Nowadays, an intense exotic beam is produced by the Isotope Separation On-Line method at the SPIRAL1 facility. It is running since 2001, producing and post-accelerating radioactive ion beams of noble gas type mainly. The review of the operation from 2001 to 2013 is presented. Due to a large request of physicists, the facility will be enhanced within the frame of the project Upgrade SPIRAL1. The goal of the project is to broaden the range of post-accelerated exotic beams available especially to all the condensable light elements as P, Mg, Al, Cl etc The upgrade of SPIRAL1 is in progress and the new beams would be delivered for operation by the end of 2015.
