The initial transverse distribution of a space charge dominated electron beam from low energy sources (100s of kV) can have a significant impact on the downstream emittance evolution. Using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator and visible light, the transverse laser distribution can be shaped to high accuracy with good efficiency. Using this shaped transverse distribution, adaptively shaped electron beams of high accuracy from a high voltage DC photoemission gun are presented.

An alkali antimonide photocathode was tested in BNL 704 MHz SRF gun. The cathode QE and lifetime were measured inside the gun. We also observed a reduction on the QE upon cooling down to cryogenic temperature. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and present a Monte-Carlo simulation code to explain this QE decrease. Both results compared with experiments. Effect of cooling the cathode to cryogenic temperature and Schottky effect on QE will be discussed.

Multialkali antimonide photocathodes have been shown to be excellent electron sources for a wide range of applications because of high quantum efficiency, low emittance, good lifetime, and fast response. In recent years, synchrotron X-ray methods have been used to study the growth mechanism of K2CsSb photocathodes. The traditional sequential growth of CsK2Sb has been shown to result in rough surface, which will have an adverse impact on the emittance of the electron beam. However, co-evaporation of alkali metals on the evaporated Sb layer and sputter deposition may offer a route to solving the roughness problem. Recent studies on K2CsSb grown by these methods are presented and surface roughness is determined by X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and results are compared.
