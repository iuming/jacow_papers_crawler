Future beamline development at the Australian Synchrotron requires free floor space within the straights for a short undulator and relocation of diagnostics. Our current injection method uses a four-dipole kicker configuration that perturbs the stored beam during injection while also taking up approximately 4 meters of valuable space. To free this valuable space and provide transparent injections to the beamlines, a single pulsed nonlinear magnetic field kicker (NLK) will be deployed. The NLK has a flat and zero field at the stored beam but maximum field where the injected beam is located off-axis. NLKs deflect only the injected beam, leaving the stored beam undisturbed. NLKs have been extensively prototyped by many facilities around the world already and can produce injection efficiencies of 99 % (see e.g. *). This paper presents the preliminary magnet design for installation of a NLK at the Australian Synchrotron. We discuss the beam dynamics and thermal transfer constraints on kicker placement, field-flatness and the magnet and ceramic chamber design for adaptation to our 3 GeV beam. Installation plans and other constraints for future deployment are also outlined.

MYRRHA will be a research infrastructure highlighted by the first prototype of a sub-critical nuclear reactor driven by a 600 MeV particle accelerator (ADS). This project aims at exploring the transmutation of long-lived nuclear wastes. A first phase is planned to validate the reliability of a 100 MeV/4 mA Protons LINAC carrying the beam toward an ISOL facility, prefiguring the real MYRRHA demonstrator at 600 MeV. This project is called MINERVA. This paper presents the status of the beam dynamic studies for the high energy beam transport lines at 100 MeV. In agreement with the project require-ments, we describe the specificities of these beam lines for which it is needed to implement a fast kicker-septum. This system will separate the beam between two main lines: toward the beam dump or the ISOL facility. We also describe the studies on the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) selected for MYRRHA. Part of this work was sup-port by the MYRTE project of the European Union.

The present study focuses on the beam line optimization from the heavy-ion synchrotron SIS18 to the HADES experiment. BOBYQA (Bound Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation) solves bound constrained optimization problems without using derivatives of the objective function. The Bayesian optimization is an other strategy for global optimization of costly, noisy functions without using derivatives. A python programming interface to MADX allow the use of the python implementation of BOBYQA and Bayesian method. This gave the possibility to use tracking simulation with MADX to determine the loss budget for each lattice setting during the optimization and compare both optimization methods.

A 30 GeV proton beam accelerated in the J-PARC Main Ring (MR) is slowly extracted by the third integer resonant extraction and delivered to the hadron experimental hall. The slow extraction (SX) from the MR has unique characteristics that can be used to obtain a low beam loss rate. A dynamic bump scheme under achromatic condition drastically reduces beam hit rate on the septa devices. We have attained 50 kW SX operation at 5.2s cycle in current physics run. Slow extraction efficiency has been achieved to be very high, 99.5%. A beam instability during debunching with beam loss can be suppressed by a unique RF phase offset technique at MR injection. A spill duty factor indicating a uniformity for time structure of the extracted beam is typically 50%, which can be obtained by a feedback system using fast response quadrupoles, applying transverse RF field and so on. Future plans to improve present SX performances will be introduced.

A 30 GeV proton beam accelerated in the J-PARC Main Ring (MR) is slowly extracted by the third integer reso-nant extraction and delivered to the hadron experimental facility. Increasing the duty of beam spill is one of the important issues in the slow extraction system. In the MR, the spill feedback system utilizing a digital signal processor (DSP) combined with EQ and RQ magnet is used to smooth the spill, where EQ defines a rough out-line of the slow extraction shape and RQ is used for the ripple cancelling. In this study, frequency domain charac-teristics between the current of RQ magnet and the beam spill was investigated by driving the RQ magnet with sinusoidal current, so that the transfer function from the current of RQ magnet to the spill signal is delivered.

Photon sources are looking for performance upgrades by pursuing higher photon brilliance and coherence these years. The trend is pushing the lattice design to lower the beam emittance, which naturally results in the narrower dynamic aperture. One bottleneck in the upgrades is a beam injection system capable of accumulating required beam intensity and keeping top-up operations with such narrow apertures. Beam injection with a nonlinear kicker and transverse/longitudinal on-axis injections are now in the limelight. However, these techniques still need time to be put into practical use. We take an alternative approach for the SPring-8 upgrade, SPring-8-II, renovating the off-axis beam injection scheme to address the following requirements for the coming diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs): minimizing of both injection beam amplitude and perturbation to stored beam, and topping-up functionality. This presentation will overview the renewed off-axis beam injection scheme and report the development status of the following three key components: 1) permanent magnet based DC septum magnet, 2) in-vacuum pulse septum magnet, and 3) twin kickers driven by a single solid state pulser.

A muon to electron conversion search experiment (COMET) planned at J-PARC needs 8 GeV bunched proton beams with a continuous 1 MHz pulse structure. In this experiment, an intensity ratio of the residual to the main pulsed beam, which is expressed as extinction, should be less than the level of 10-10. In RUN78 (Jan. to Feb., 2018), we have succeeded in slow extraction of 8 GeV protons with 7.3×1012 ppp, satisfies the COMET phase-I requirement, and the extinction derived from a timing measurement of secondary particles from the target shows a promising result. A mechanism to explain the measured extinction will be also described in this paper.

There are three bumps (one chicane bump and two painting bumps) in the injection system of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). They are the core parts of the injection system and the important guarantee that the Linac beam injecting into the rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). During the beam commissioning, to check the effect of the residual orbits of the three bumps in the injection region was an important problem. In this paper, the residual orbits of BH and BV painting bumps were studied and estimated in the beam commissioning. The data analysis results showed that the residual orbits of BH and BV painting bumps were very small and they didn’t need to be corrected.

The injection beam loss is the main beam loss of the rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) for the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). After the optimization of injection system during the beam commissioning, the current injection beam loss for CSNS/RCS is approximately 1%. There are several sources of injection beam loss. In order to distinguish these different sources, the stripping efficiency of the main stripping foil should be studied and measured accurately. In this paper, a scheme for the accurate measurement of the stripping efficiency for CSNS will be proposed and studied. It can not only reduce the injection beam loss, but also be used to estimate the operation state and lifespan of the main stripping foil accurately. This method will be applied in future beam commissioning.

The spill continuously extracted from synchrotron by using resonance sextupoles plays a key role in multidisciplinary application. The intensity of virtual sextupole and the spiral step for the typical synchrotron are obtained theoretically. A customized synchrotron of extraction components placed in dispersion section is designed and the tracking code of slow extraction is developed, thus the theoretical spiral step is comparative studied. To study the beam loss, three layouts of extraction are also designed based on the synchrotron. The result shows that the beam losses at extraction point are different for three cases and it is advantage to beam loss for extraction components placed in dispersion-free straight section.

Stripline kicker is an important components of both on-axis longitudinal accumulation and on-axis swap out injection schemes in HALS (Hefei Advanced Light Source). After more than one year of R&D, construction of the first prototype is completed. The kicker performance is simulated by CST. The results show that in the range of 0~1GHz, on differential mode, S11 is less than - 23.7dB. In order to facilitate installation, the extension part and PTFE bracket were designed. The assembly of kicker and feedthrough has been tested with pulse generator and network analyser.

For the beam injection of HALS, a feasible injection scheme is proposed and a single-pulse nonlinear kicker has been designed for off-axis injection. The kicker has been improved on the basis of the previous designed one, and the structure of the kicker was simulated by OPERA, and the prototype has been processed and measured. The results showed that the kicker designed in this paper has less influence on stored beam and lower difficulty in location.

The next generation storage ring-based light sources adopt multi-bend achromat lattices to achieve a low emittance. The dynamic apertures of these machines are usually less than 10 mm so that the traditional pulsed local bump injection is difficult to achieve. Off-axis injection with a pulsed multipole or a non-linear kicker could be a viable solution which requires a moderate dynamic aperture of a few mm. In this paper, a novel non-linear kicker design is presented. Unlike pulsed sextupole or nonlinear kicker magnet, the nonlinear kicker we proposed is a traveling wave kicker with 2 strip-line electrodes driven by a nanosecond-level fast pulser in common mode. The disturbance to the stored beam is minimal since the perturbation is limited to the target bunch alone.

he High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), a kilometre-scale storage ring based light source, with emittance less than 60 pm.rad, will be constructed in Beijing, China. It con-sists of a 500 MeV linac, a 500 MeV low energy transport line, a full energy booster synchrotron, two 6- GeV transport lines, a 6 GeV ultra-low emittance storage ring, and the beam line experimental stations. The low energy transport line connecting the linac and the booster. Based on the construction layout restrictions, the beam enve-lopes of the linac and the booster should be matched, and the beam produced by the linac is high efficiently trans-mitted to the booster injection point. HEPS low energy transport line has three functional sections, the achromat injection matching section, the optics matching section and the output matching section. In order to correct the error effects on the beam, 8 BPM are set in the low energy transport line. There are also 6 horizontal correctors and 6vertical correctors for beam trajectory correction. This paper will show the detailed design of HEPS low energy transport line.

The Ion Source and the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) have been installed in the European Spallation Source tunnel, in Lund, Sweden, during the summer 2018. The first proton beam was extracted on September. In this paper we present the first set of measurements of protons transmission in combination with the analysis of the species (H+, H+2, H+3) extracted by the source. We show that our measurements are compatible with a fraction of 80\% of protons transported along the LEBT, as measured at the INFN-LNS, Catania, Italy during the commissioning in 2016-17.

Transverse space charge effects in the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) at CERN have been shown to be a major source of particle losses, which can be mitigated with a larger RMS longitudinal emittance. However, due to electron cooling during the injection plateau, the longitudinal density is very high prior to RF capture. In addition there is an uncontrolled cycle to cycle variation in the revolution frequency of the coasting beam on the flat bottom, which degrades the beam quality at capture. In this paper we show that applying an RF frequency modulation during the capture process allows both a controlled blow-up of the longitudinal emittance and a very good reproducibility in the longitudinal distribution, which in turn improves beam transmission through the machine.

At CERN, the SPS synchrotron is equipped with two fast extraction channels towards the LHC. As a part of the LHC injector upgrade project (LIU), the protection devices upstream of the septa in both extraction channels will be upgraded. Various failure scenarios have been studied and presented in the past, but the definitive approach for the equipment protection upgrade for each channel has now been determined. This paper describes the consequences of the most significant failure scenarios and the impact of the heat deposition in the diluter. The resulting material stresses are evaluated. The detailed layout for the extraction protection equipment for each extraction channel is outlined. The final layout consists of a extended diluter in Long Straight Section (LSS) 6 (TPSG6) and the installation of an additional movable absorber (TPSC4) upstream of the quadrupole in front of the existing protection equipment in LSS 4. The detailed mechanical design of the TPSC4 and the construction status of both TPSC4 and TPSG6 are discussed.

At CERN, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is equipped with a resonant slow extraction system in Long Straight Section 2 (LSS2) towards the fixed target (FT) beam lines in the North Area. The extraction region provides the physics experiments with a quasi-DC flux of high-energy protons over a few seconds, which corresponds to tens of thousands of turns. The resonant slow extraction process provokes beam losses and is therefore the origin of radiation damage and the production of induced radioactivity in this region of the machine. This induced radioactivity imposed high constraints on the equipment design to be reliable to minimise the radiation exposure to personnel during machine maintenance. A detailed FLUKA model was developed in order to better understand the beam loss patterns, activation of the machine and to identify equipment components that could be optimised to reduce the residual dose related hazards. Simulations identified multiple alternative materials for extraction equipment components as well as shielding locations, which implementation could reduce residual activation hazards.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project, the investigation and quantification of the optics mismatch between the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) and PS is a crucial step in understanding the source of horizontal emittance growth between the two machines. Extensive studies were carried out to estimate the mismatch from single-pass measurements in the transfer line and to rematch the transfer line to reduce the dispersive mismatch at PS injection while keeping the betatron matching unaltered. This paper presents the results of the data analysis of more recent multi-turn measurements, which profited from a new turn-by-turn beam profile monitor in the PS ring, to assess the achieved level of matching and corresponding emittance growth. The results confirm the improved matching and demonstrate the feasibility of the multi-turn technique as a fundamental tool that will be important for the recommissioning of the renovated transfer line after Long Shutdown 2.

Understanding the different sources of emittance dilution along the LHC injector chain is an important part of providing the high brightness proton beams demanded by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project. In this context, the first beam-based measurements of the magnetic waveforms of the Proton Synchrotron Booster’s (PSB) extraction kickers were carried out and used to quantify the transverse emittance blow-up during extraction and transfer to the Proton Synchrotron (PS). In this contribution, the waveform measurement technique will be briefly outlined before the results and their implications for the LIU project and beam performance reach are discussed.

The SPS Beam Dump Facility (BDF) being studied as part of the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) CERN project has recently reached an important milestone with the completion of the comprehensive feasibility study. The BDF is a proposed fixed target facility to be installed in the SPS North Area, to accommodate experiments such as SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles), which is most notably aiming at studying hidden sector particles. This experiment requires a high intensity slowly extracted 400 GeV proton beam with 4·1013 protons per 1 s spill to achieve 4·1019 protons on target per year. The extraction and transport scheme will make use of the first 600 m of the existing North Area extraction line. This contribution presents the status of the design work of the new transfer line and discusses the challenges identified. Aperture studies and failure scenarios are treated and the results discussed. In particular, interlock systems aiming at protecting critical components against the uncontrolled loss of the high energy proton beam are considered. We also present the latest results and implications of the design of a new laminated Lambertson splitter magnet to provide fast switching between the current North Area experiments and the BDF.

The use of a bent crystal was investigated in order to reduce the losses at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) electrostatic septa (ZS) during the slow extraction of 400 GeV protons toward the North Area. The crystal, installed a few meters upstream the ZS, bends protons that would otherwise impinge on the ZS wires. Since particle deflection with good efficiency is achieved only when the crystal lattice is aligned within ~10 urad to the trajectory of the particles (at p = 400 GeV/c), a compact goniometer was built to allow the correct angular alignment of the crystal with respect to the incoming beam with a precision of few urad. In this paper, we report on the crystal features measured during a dedicated beam test by the UA9 experimental installation in the CERN H8 beam line. Details of the goniometer and its installation are also reported. The first results achieved during dedicated Machine Development (MD) sessions are finally presented.

The commissioning of the AWAKE electron beam line was successfully completed in 2018. Despite a modest length of about 15 m, this low-energy line is quite complex and several iterations were needed before finding satisfactory agreement between the model and the measurements. The work allowed to precisely predict the size and positioning of the electron beam at the merging point with the protons inside the plasma cell, where no direct measurement is possible. All the key aspects and corrections which had to be included in the model, precautions and systematic checks to apply for the correct setup of the line are presented. The sensitivity of the ~18 MeV electron beam to various perturbations, like different initial optics parameters and beam conditions, energy jitter and drifts, earth’s magnetic field etc., is described.

The LHC turn-around time is impacted by the control of injection losses and trajectories. While shot-to-shot trajectory variations dominated the injection efficiency during LHC Run 1, several improvements of hardware and operational settings allowed for a high rate of successful injections during Run 2. Injection losses and trajectories are analysed and presented for the high intensity proton runs, as well as for different beam types used from the injectors. Based on this analysis, an outlook is shown for the HL-LHC era, where double the bunch intensity will have to be injected.

Annual high intensity requests of over 1019 protons on target (POT) from the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) Fixed Target (FT) physics program continue, with the prospect of requests for even higher, unprecedented levels in the coming decade. A concerted and multifaceted R&D effort has been launched to understand and reduce the slow extraction induced radioactivation of the SPS and to anticipate future experimental proposals, such as SHiP* at the SPS Beam Dump Facility (BDF)**, which will request an additional 4·1019 POT per year. In this contribution, we report on operational improvements and recent advances that have been made to significantly reduce the slow extraction losses, by up to a factor of 3, with the deployment of new extraction concepts, including passive and active (thin, bent crystal) diffusers and extraction on the third-integer resonance with octupoles. In light of the successful tests of the prototype extraction loss reduction schemes, an outlook and implications for future SPS FT operation will be presented.

The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) slow extraction is a third integer resonant extraction and hence suffers from high losses at the electrostatic septum (ZS). This is one of the main limiting factors for the maximum number of Protons On Target (POT) deliverable from the SPS to the North Area (NA). A concept to significantly reduce the extraction losses via shadowing of the electrostatic septum wires using an upstream bent crystal has been proposed in *, predicting a loss reduction of up to 50% for the prototype system installed in 2018. Following the successful experimental demonstration of the concept with beam **, detailed tracking simulations have been performed to fully understand the results obtained. Further insights, such as the effective ZS width and its alignment, could be deduced by exploiting the response of the extraction loss as a function of the two degrees of freedom of the crystal (position and angle). In this paper, the beam dynamics simulations are discussed together with the implementation of the bent crystal into the simulation framework. A comparison with measurements is presented before proposals for new configurations and parameters are discussed.

The powering of octupoles during third-integer resonant slow extraction has been studied and recently tested with beam at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in order to increase the extraction efficiency and reduce the induced radioactivity of the extraction straight. The octupoles distort the particle trajectories in phase space in such a way that the extracted separatrix is folded, which decreases the particle density impinging the wires of the extraction septum at the expense of increasing the extracted beam emittance. During experimental SPS machine studies a reduction of over 40% in the specific (per extracted proton) beam loss measured at the extraction septum was demonstrated. In this paper, the prerequisite studies needed to safely but efficiently deploy the new extraction scheme in a limited time-frame are described, the experimental results are presented and an outlook is given towards the next steps to bring slow extraction with octupoles into routine operation.

The main physics users of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) are the experiments installed in the North Area (NA). They are supplied with slowly extracted protons or heavy ions, exploiting a third integer slow extraction to provide a 4.8 s spill. High duty cycle and constant particle flux are the main requirements. Frequent super cycle changes induce variation of the spill macro structure which directly deteriorate the final spill quality. In this paper, the source of such an effect are investigated. Results of both beam based measurements and direct magnetic measurements on the SPS reference magnets are presented. Finally, a possible strategy to counteract this effect is discussed, in order to try to remove the super cycle changes variation as cause for spill quality deterioration.

The ENUBET ("Enhanced NeUtrino BEams from kaon Tagging") Project aims at reaching a new level of precision of the short-baseline neutrino cross section measurement by using an instrumented decay tunnel. The North Area (NA) experimental facility of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) offers the required infrastructure for the experiment. A new slow extraction type, consisting of bursts of many consecutive millisecond spills within one macro spill, has been modeled and tested for the ENUBET Project. The burst-mode slow extraction has been tested for the first time at CERN-SPS, and MADX simulations of the process have been developed. In this paper the experimental results obtained during the test campaign are presented along with the results of the quality of the produced spill and comparing it with predictions from simulations.

With a nominal beam power of nearly 1.4 MW, the PSI High Intensity Proton Accelerator (HIPA) complex is currently at the forefront of the high intensity frontier of particle accelerators. A key issue of such facilities is the minimization of beam losses that could lead to excessive activation of beam line components. At HIPA, the SINQ beam line is particularly subject to relatively large losses since it receives the highly divergent beam scattered off a 40 or 60 mm thick muon production graphite target (TE). So far, for HIPA, beam line simulations have been carried out only by means of the matrix multiplication codes TRANSPORT and TURTLE. Although very efficient, such tools do not allow a precise determination of beam losses whenever targets and collimators are substantially affecting the beam optics. A true understanding of how beam halo and the low momentum tail contribute to the measured losses can only be achieved by complementing the traditional simulations techniques by a tool that can transport beam particles in different materials and, at the same time, handle complex geometries like the ones of collimators situated in the beam line. Moreover, such an improved beam line simulation would give a significant contribution in evaluating the feasibility of the SINQ beam rotation system currently under study. In this paper we present a simulation of the SINQ beam line combining MCNP models of TE and collimator sections with the TURTLE computation of the magnetic channel.

During the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) at CERN, the new Linac4 (L4) accelerator will be connected to the PS Booster (PSB) to inject 160 MeV H− beam into the 4 superposed PSB rings. In order to achieve this, we have designed, built and pre-assembled a completely new H− charge-exchange injection chicane system, with a carbon stripping foil unit to convert the negative hydrogen ions into protons by stripping off the electrons. In parallel, we have built and installed a test stand in the L4 transfer line enabling us to gain valuable experience with operation of the stripping foil system and to evaluate different foil types during the L4 reliability runs. This paper describes the final design of the new PSB injection region and reports on the important test results obtained with the stripping foil test stand.

The LHC Beam Dump System is required to safely dispose of the energy of the stored beam. In order to reduce the energy density deposited in the beam dump, a dedicated dilution system is installed. On July 14, 2018, during a regular beam dump at 6.5 TeV beam energy, a high-voltage flashover of two vertical dilution kickers was observed, leading to a voltage breakdown and reduced dilution in the vertical plane. It was the first incident of this type since the start of LHC beam operation. In this paper, the flashover event is described and the implications analysed. Circuit simulations of the current in the magnet coil as well as simulations of the resulting beam sweep pattern are presented and compared with the measurements. The criticality of the event is assessed and implications for future failure scenarios are discussed.

In the FCC-ee pre-injector complex, a slightly modified SPS can serve as pre-booster. The baseline design foresees injecting the low-emittance electron and positron bunches off-axis into the SPS, and deploying strong wigglers to greatly enhance the radiation damping at the injection energy. We here compare the damping of large injection oscillations by means of radiation damping with the effect of other possible damping mechanisms such as a fast bunch-by-bunch feedback system and/or head-tail damping via nonzero chromaticity. As a by-product, we investigate the transverse beam stability.

At Diamond injection is performed by means a of a four kicker off-axis system, relying on a perfect timing and amplitude setting to produce a closed bump. Ageing of some of the kicker vessel components has progressively spoiled the performance of the system, causing oscillations in the stored beam. Various schemes to control these oscillations have been considered including introducing an additional compensating kicker, and installing a non-linear injection kicker. Results of simulations analysing these schemes are presented, along with measurements taken in the storage ring using an existing pinger magnet. The effects of the reduction on the quality of beam seen by beamlines is also considered.

The baseline design for the Diamond-II storage ring consists of a Modified-Hybrid 6-Bend Achromat, combining the ESRF-EBS low-emittance cell design with the DDBA mid-straight concept*,**. This cell design provides sufficient dynamic aperture to permit an off-axis injection scheme, provided the emittance of the injected beam is sufficiently low. In this paper we present simulations of an injection scheme using the anti-septum concept***, along with the design of an upgrade to the existing booster synchrotron. Alternate injection strategies are also discussed.

Two electrostatic septa (ESS) are being designed for the slow extraction of 8 GeV proton beam for the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab. Special attention is given to the high voltage feedthrough (HVF), which energizes the cathode creating the bending field. The FC-40 dielectric fluid, surrounding the HV cable breaks down from radiation exposure, which reduces its insulating capabilities. The new HVF design focuses on effective replacement of the exposed fluid and eliminating the stagnant areas of low exchange rate. A preliminary test using a fully transparent prototype HVF and water was conducted to understand the volumetric exchange rate of the high radiation region. Here we discuss the results of these tests and further studies using the FC-40.

The efficiency of slow extraction is becoming a limiting factor, as the demand for delivered beam power is constantly growing. New methods for improving extraction efficiency include folding the extraction separatrix using the higher multipoles. In this report we discuss a simple and effective approach to determine an optimal placement of those multipoles in the storage ring. This allows reduction of the beam losses and therefore, the level of prompt and residual radioactivity in the accelerator components and surrounding buildings by as much as 40% or more. We also explore here manipulating the higher order effects produced in the pure sextupole configurations for the same purpose and demonstrate that similar results can be achieved by only rearranging the sextupole magnets in the lattice.

EBIS Preinjector will provide longitudinally polarized 3He++ ions with about 80% polarization and 5.1011 particles per bunch at 6 MeV, which must be rotated to vertical direction before it ions are injected into the Booster. The 3He++ longitudinal polarization is first rotated to the transverse direction by the 21.5° bending magnet. Then the solenoid spin-rotator rotates the spin to the vertical direction. The spin-rotator will be a pulsed solenoid with a reversible field to enable spin flips. The vertically polarized beam will be returned back to the straight HEBT line by the system of three dipole magnets after the spin rotator solenoid. The low-energy polarimeter can be installed in the straight beam line section after the second dipole magnet. To measure transverse (vertical) polarization of the 3He beam at 5-6 MeV, the spin correlated asymmetry of 3He scattering on a 4He gas target (~5 Torr) will be measured with left/right symmetric strip detectors. Paper will present status of the project.

A new transfer beamline, called S30XL, and an experimental facility are proposed to be built at SLAC, taking advantage of the LCLS-II free electron laser (FEL) under construction. The S30XL will operate parasitically to the FEL by extracting the unused low intensity 4-GeV LCLS-II bunches into the existing A-line and the End Station-A (ESA). This provides a unique capability of multi-GeV nearly continuous electron beam for a variety of HEP experiments, in particular the dark matter search experiments. The latter require a very low beam current ranging from pA to micro-A, as well as a large beam spot at the detector. The necessary beam shaping will be performed using spoilers and collimators in the A-line, and by optimizing the optics. FLUKA and elegant codes are used to generate and track the beam into the ESA.

A new Septum magnet and chamber has been designed for the storage ring as a part of the accelerator improvement plan for operating a lower emittance lattice in SPEAR3. Therefore it is necessary to analyze the impedance effects on the beam from the new Septum chamber. Due to the complex design at the downstream transition of the Septum chamber, the longitudinal impedance is particular of concern. In this paper, we will present numerical simulation results for this particular component as well as the general analysis for the impedance effects of the whole chamber.

The future eRHIC collider * will collide 5, 10, and 18 GeV polarized electrons with 250 GeV polarized protons, 210 GeV/u polarized 3He ions and other heavy ion species which are already produced by the RHIC accelerator. To increase the luminosity during collisions the number of circulating hadron bunches will increase to 330 and this requires a modification of the injection hadrons into the RHIC accelerator. This paper describes this injection scheme which is compatible with a design option which uses two hadron rings, one ring for accelerating the hadron beam and the other ring for storing the circulating beam to increase even further the integrated luminosity of the electron-hadron collisions. This two-hadron-rings option will be presented in the conference.

A concept for simultaneous beam delivery to all four CEBAF experimental halls from a single injector and a single main accelerator for the 12 GeV era was proposed in 2012. The original 12 GeV beam delivery plan was for a maximum of three experimental halls at a time as in the 6 GeV era. Therefore, the new concept increases the po-tential beam time for the experiments up to 33%. This change, although a major improvement in operational capabilities, required only limited modifications to the existing machine. The modifications were mainly timing and pattern changes to the beams in the injector, adding a fourth laser to the photo-cathode gun, and the addition of new RF separators to the highest pass of CEBAF. These changes are now complete and, for the first time, the full system is operating, producing four simultaneous beams through the accelerator to four different destinations. In this paper, in addition to presenting the results of the full system commissioning, we will discuss important details about the new configuration plus some of our operational challenges.
