Alkali antimonide photocathodes are a strong contender for the cathode of choice for next-generation photon sources such as LCLS II or the XFEL. These materials have already found extensive use in photodetectors and image intensifiers. However, only recently have modern synchrotron techniques enabled a systematic study of the formation chemistry of these materials. Such analysis has led to the understanding that these materials are inherently rough when grown through traditional sequential deposition; this roughness has a detrimental impact on the intrinsic emittance of the emitted beam. Sputter deposition may provide a path to achieving a far smoother photocathode, while maintaining adequate quantum efficiency. We report on the creation and vacuum transport of a K2CsSb sputter target, and its use to create an ultra-smooth (sub nm roughness) cathode with a 2% quantum efficiency at 532 nm.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is a state of the art 3 GeV third generation light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The SR is designed to work in top-off injection mode. The injection straight includes a septum and four fast kicker magnets with independent amplitude and timing control. The beam injection is designed as 9.5 mm off-axis in x plane and on-axis injection in y plane. To capture the injected beam within the SR acceptance for high injection efficiency, it requires 6-D phase space match. Besides that, the fast kickers formed local bump is also required to be locally to minimize the injected beam extra betatron oscillation and keep the stored beam disturbance within the specification, 10% beam size to minimize the injection transient. This paper will present the beam results before and after optimization.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is a state of the art 3 GeV third generation light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. As many facilities worldwide, NSLS II uses the EPICS control system to monitor and control all accelerator hardware. Control system studio (CSS) is used for simple tasks such as monitoring, display, setting of PVs. browsing the historical data, et. al. For more complex accelerator physics applications, a collection of scripts are mainly written in Python and part from Matlab during commissioning. With the close collaboration and fully support from control group, more and more CSS features were developed for operation convenience and several high level applications are interfaced with users in CSS panels for daily use based on softiocs. This paper will present the tools that we have been using for commissioning.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is a state of the art 3 GeV third generation light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In the spring 2014, the storage ring was commissioning up to 50 mA without insertion device. In the fall, the project beamlines, includes seven insertion devices on six ID ports were commissioned within two and a half months. These beamlines consist of IXS, HXN, CSX-1, CSX-2, CHX, SRX, and XPD-1, from the radiation sources elliptically polarizing undulator (EPU), damping wiggler (DW) and in vacuum undulator (IVU) to cover the VUV through the very hard x-ray range. In this paper, a number of commissioning and operation experiences are discussed here, such as injection, lifetime, ID residual field and compensation, source point stability, beam alignment and tools for control, monitor and beam protection.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is a state of the art 3 GeV third generation light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. While the installation activities in the booster-synchrotron are nearly completed and waiting for the authorization to start the booster commissioning, the injector and accelerator physics group have engaged into the Integrated Testing phase. We did the booster commissioning with simulated beam signals, called extended integrated testing (EIT) to prepare for the booster ring commissioning. It is to make sure the device function along with utilities, timing system and control system, to calibrate diagnostics system, debug High Level Applications, test and optimize all the operation screens to reduce the potential problems during booster commissioning with beam.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is a state of the art 3 GeV third generation light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The injection system consists of a 200 MeV linac, a 3 GeV booster synchrotron and transfer lines in connection of linac, booster and storage ring. The transfer lines, designed and built from BNL, are equipped with sufficient diagnostics to commission to characterize the beam parameters from linac and booster. In the paper, we summarized the high level applications tools, beam emittance, energy and energy spread measurement, developed during the injector commissioning.

The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is a state of the art 3 GeV third generation light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. To achieve the goal, 8 pm level vertical beam emittance, the coupling due to the misalignment in quads and vertical beam offset in sextuples must be corrected. Traditional method, based on response matrix, such as LOCO, is wildly used measure and corrects the coupling. In this paper, we present a new method to measure and correct the coupling with BPMs TBT data from fast kickers or pingers excited betatron oscillation. Besides the TBT data, other method, is also used to characterize the coupling.

The NSLS-II accelerators finished commissioning in the fall of 2014, with beamline commissioning underway. Part of the design for the NSLS-II is to operate in top off mode. The Top Off Safety System (TOSS) is presently under design. In this report we discuss the Top Off Safety System design and implementation, along with the necessary tracking results and radiological calculations.

During the short run in early July, 2014, we made changes to the Matlab LOCO setup for NSLS-II and applied LOCO successfully to the machine. The MML setup was verified with I/O tests for all quadrupole families. The LOCO setup was further tested with an intentional quadrupole error. After the successful LOCO correction, the rms beta beat was reduced from the initial values of 5.5% x and 5.6% y, to 1.9% x and 1.0% y, respectively. The rms horizontal dispersion error was reduced from 21 mm to 6 mm. It is critical to keep the same closed orbit for LOCO correction to take effect. Because presently some correctors are nearly saturated, closed orbit cannot be controlled for additional iterations. We expect LOCO to achieve better optics correction after the orbit control is improved.

Muon beam ionization cooling is a key component for the next generation of high-luminosity muon colliders. To reach adequately high luminosity without excessively large muon intensities, it was proposed previously to combine ionization cooling with techniques using a parametric resonance (PIC). Practical implementation of PIC proposal is a subject of this report. We show that an addition of skew quadrupoles to a planar PIC channel gives enough flexibility in the design to avoid unwanted resonances, while meeting the requirements of radially-periodic beam focusing at ionization-cooling plates, large dynamic aperture and an oscillating dispersion needed for aberration corrections. Theoretical arguments are corroborated with models and a detailed numerical analysis, providing step-by-step guidance for the design of Skew-quad PIC (SPIC) beamline.
