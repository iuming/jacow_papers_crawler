The performance of electron cyclotron resonance ion sources (ECRIS) is critically dependent on the resonant absorption efficiency of microwave power. Over-sized round waveguide with a diameter about Ø33.0 mm excited in the TE01 mode has been typically adopted for microwave coupling to the ECR plasma with the superconducting ECRIS operated at 24 or 28 GHz, such as SECRAL and VENUS. However, it should be realized that this is not necessarily the optimal scheme for microwave power injection. In order to study the impact of different microwave power distribution on ECRH efficiency and especially the production of highly charged ions, a set of compact and efficient mode convertors and mode transitions with different diameters applicable to 24 GHz SECRAL has been designed, fabricated and tested. SECRAL has been tested with the different microwave power injection schemes for the production intense highly charged heavy ion beams of Ar and Xe. A general comparison of the performance working at the different injection schemes with SECRAL will be given, and a preliminary analysis will be made in this paper.
