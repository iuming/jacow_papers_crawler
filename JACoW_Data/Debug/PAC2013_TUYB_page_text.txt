In recent studies a metallic pipe with small corrugations has been considered for two applications: as a beam-based method of generating pulses of terahertz radiation, and for simply and cheaply removing unwanted energy chirp in linac-based X-ray FEL's. With a pipe of length ~10 cm and aperture ~1 mm, narrow-band, multi-cycle pulses of radiation can be generated, with frequency ~1 THz and pulse energy of a few mJ. In linac-based FEL's, after the final bunch compressor, the electron bunch typically is left with an energy chirp. An inexpensive way for dechirping is to have the beam pass through ~10 m of corrugated pipe. This report presents and analyzes the performance of the corrugated structure for both mentioned purposes. Experimental tests are also discussed.

This presentation should describe new measurement techniques used to understand linac beam dynamics, and the results of their application in the SNS superconducting linac.
