Euclid Techlabs is developing a superconducting traveling wave (SCWT) cavity with a feedback waveguide [1] and has demonstrated a traveling wave at room temperature [2] in a 3-cell SCTW cavity [3]. A special method described in this paper was developed for cavity evaluation. It is based on an S-matrix approach. The cavity tuning procedure based on this method is described.

The original design of the JLEIC pre-booster was a 3-GeV figure-8 shaped synchrotron with a circumference of about 240 m. In the current baseline design, the 3-GeV pre-booster was converted into an 8-GeV booster of the same shape and size but using super-ferric magnets with fields up to 3 Tesla. In order to limit the foot-print of the JLEIC ion complex and reduce its total cost, we have designed a more compact and cost-effective octagonal 3-GeV ring about half the size of the original one. At 3 GeV, the figure-8 shape is not required to preserve ion polarization; Siberian snakes with reasonable magnetic fields can be used for spin correction. As the ion collider ring requires an injection energy of at least 8 GeV, we propose to use the existing electron storage ring, which is part of the electron complex, as a large booster for the ions up to 11 GeV. The design optimization of the pre-booster ring will be presented leading to the final octagonal ring design. Preliminary beam simulations will also be presented and discussed.

The current baseline design for the JLab EIC (JLEIC) ion accelerator complex is based on a pulsed superconducting linac, an 8-GeV booster followed by a dual function 20-100 GeV booster and collider ring. Both the 8-GeV booster and collider ring will use super-ferric magnets with fields up to 3 Tesla. We here propose an alternative cost-effective and low-risk design where the 8-GeV booster is replaced with a more compact 3-GeV booster using room-temperature magnets. The electron storage ring, which is part of the electron complex, will also serve as large booster for the ions, up to 11 GeV. We also propose two stages for the JLEIC. A first low-energy stage up to 60 GeV, where room-temperature magnets (up to 1.6 Tesla) will be used for the ion collider ring, to be later replaced with 6 Tesla superconducting magnets in a second stage of the project providing up to 200 GeV energy. In this second stage, the 1.6 T room-temperature magnets will replace the PEP-II magnets in the electron storage ring to boost the ions to higher energies (25 GeV or higher) for appropriate injection into the higher energy collider. Details and feasibility of the proposed plan will be presented and discussed.

The Muon Accelerator Program has completed a four-year study on the feasibility of muon colliders and on using stored muon beams for neutrinos. That study was broadly successful in its goals, establishing the feasibility of lepton colliders from the 125 GeV Higgs Factory to more than 10 TeV, as well as exploring using μ storage rings for neutrinos. The key components of the muon collider scenarios are a high-intensity proton source, a multi MW target and transport system for π capture, a front end system for bunching, energy compression and initial cooling of μ's, muon cooling systems to obtain intense μ+ and μ- bunches, acceleration up to multiTeV energies, and a collider ring with detectors for high luminosity collisions. For a neutrino factory a similar system could be used but with a racetrack storage ring for ν production and without the cooling needed for high luminosity collisions. Feasible designs and detailed simulations of all of these components have been obtained, including some initial hardware component tests, setting the stage for future implementation where resources are available and clearly associated physics goals become apparent.

The future of the world-wide HEP community critically depends on the feasibility of possible post-LHC colliders. The concept of the feasibility is complex and includes at least three factors: feasibility of energy, feasibility of luminosiity and feasibility of cost. The talk will give on overview of all current options for post-LHC colliders from such perspective (ILC, CLIC, Muon Collider, plasma colliders, CEPC, FCC, HE-LHC, etc) and discuss major challenges and accelerator R&D required to claim these machines feasible.

The transfer line for beam extraction from the Recycler ring to P1 line provides a way to deliver 8 GeV kinetic energy protons from the Booster to the Delivery ring, via the Recycler, using existing beam transport lines, and without the need for new civil construction. It was designed in 2012. The kicker magnets at RR520 and the lambertson magnet at RR522 in the RR were installed in 2014 Summer Shutdown, the elements of RR to P1 Stub (permanent quads, trim quads, correctors, BPMs, the toroid at 703 and vertical bending dipole at V703 (ADCW) ) were installed in 2015 Summer Shutdown. On Tuesday, June 21, 2016, beam line from the Recycler Ring to P1 line was commissioned. The detailed results will be presented in this report.

Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) has designed, built, and demonstrated a prototype pulse amplifier for stripline kicker service capable of less than 5 ns rise and fall times, 5 to 90 ns pulse lengths, peak power greater than 13.7 MW at pulse repetition rates exceeding 100 kHz, and measured jitter under 100 ps. The resulting pulse is precise and repeatable, and will be of great interest to accelerator facilities requiring electromagnetic kickers. The pulse generator is based on the original specifications for the NGLS fast deflector. DTI's planar inductive adder configuration uses compensated-silicon power transistors in low inductance leadless packages with a novel charge-pump gate drive to achieve unmatched performance. The unit was brought to LBNL, compared with other researcher's efforts, and was judged very favorably. A number of development prototypes have been constructed and tested, including a successful 18.7 kV, 749 A unit. The modularity of this design will enable configuration of systems to a wide range of potential applications in both kickers and other high speed requirements, including high performance radars, directed energy systems, and excimer lasers.

The intensity frontier is limited by the ability to propagate substantial amounts of beam current without resulting in particle scrapping and/or losses from resonant growth and halo formation. Modern accelerators are based on the theories developed in the 1950's that assume particle motion is bounded and subject to linear forces. Recent theoretical developments have demonstrated that a strongly nonlinear lattice can be used to stably transport an intense beam has resulted in a fundamental rethinking of the conventional wisdom. A lattice composed of strong nonlinear magnets is predicted by theory to damp resonances while maintaining dynamic aperture. Results of rotating coil measurements, magnetic field scans and simulations will be presented, quantifying the multi-pole moments and fringe fields in the 1st generation Printed Circuit Board (PCB) octupoles for UMER's nonlinear lattice experiments.

Nonlinear quasi-integrable optics is a promising development on the horizon of high-intensity ring design. Large amplitude-dependent tune spreads, driven by strong nonlinear magnet inserts, lead to decoupling from incoherent tune resonances. This reduces intensity-driven beam loss while quasi-integrability ensures a well-contained beam. In this paper we discuss on-going work to install and interrogate a long-octupole channel at the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). This is a discrete insert that occupies 20 degrees of the ring, consisting of independently powered printed circuit octupole magnets. Transverse confinement is obtained with quadrupoles external to this insert. Operating UMER as a non-FODO lattice, in order to meet the beam-envelope requirements of the quasi-integrable lattice, is a challenge. We discuss efforts to match the beam and optimize steering solutions. We also discuss our experiences operating a distributed strong octupole lattice.

Magnetized electron cooling at relativistic energies and Ampere scale current is essential to achieve the proposed ion luminosities in a future electron-ion collider (EIC). Neutralization of the space charge in such a cooler can significantly increase the magnetized dynamic friction and, hence, the cooling rate. The Warp framework is being used to simulate magnetized electron beam dynamics during and after the build up of neutralizing ions, via ionization of residual gas in the cooler. The design follows previous experiments at Fermilab as a verification case. We also discuss the relevance to EIC designs.

We are developing a new numerical integrator based on Picard iteration method for Coulomb collisions. The aim is to achieve a given prescribed accuracy most efficiently. The integrator is designed to have adaptive time stepping, variable order, and dense output. It also has an automatic selection of the order and the time step. We show that with a good estimation of the radius of convergence of the expansion, we can obtain the optimal time step size. We also show how the optimal order of the integration is chosen to maintain the required accuracy. For efficiency, particles are distributed over time bins and propagated accordingly.

The next generation of beam applications will require high-intensity beams with unprecedented control. For the new system designs, simulations that model collective effects must achieve greater accuracies and scales than conventional methods allow. The fast multipole method is a strong candidate for modeling collective effects due to its linear scaling. It is well known the boundary effects become important for such intense beams. We implemented a constant element fast boundary element method (FMBEM) * as our first step in studying the boundary effects. To reduce the number of elements and discretization error, our next step is to allow for curvilinear elements. In this paper we will present our study on a quadratic and a cubic parametric method to model the surface.

There are a number of projects that require magnetized beams, such as electron cooling or aiding in flat beam transforms. Here we explore a simple technique to characterize the magnetization, observed through the angular momentum of magnetized beams. These beams are produced through photoemission. The generating drive laser first passes through microlens arrays (fly-eye light condensers) to form a transversely modulated pulse incident on the photocathode surface. The resulting charge distribution is then accelerated from the photocathode. We explore the evolution of the pattern via the relative shearing of the beamlets, providing information about the angular momentum. This method is illustrated through numerical simulations and preliminary measurements carried out at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility are presented.

A demonstration experiment is planned in the present LHC machine starting in 2018. This paper summarizes the tracking studies of long range beam-beam effect compensation in the LHC aimed to aid in planning the demonstration experiment. The impact of wire compensators is demonstrated on the tune footprints, dynamic aperture, beam emittance and beam intensity degradation. The simulations are performed with SIXTRACK code. The symplectic transport map for the wire element, its verification and implementation into the code are also discussed.

Masking a dispersive beamline such as a dogleg or a chicane [1, 2] is a simple way to shape a beam in the longitudinal and transverse space. This technique is often employed to generate arbitrary bunch profiles for beam/laser-driven accelerators and FEL undulators or even to reduce a background noise from dark currents in electron linacs. We have been investigating a beam-modulation of a slit-masked chicane, which was deployed for crystal-channeling experiments at the injector beamline of the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility. With a nominal beam of 3 ps bunch length, Elegant simulations showed that a slit-mask with slit period 900 um and aperture width 300 um induces a modulation with bunch-to-bunch space of about 187 um (0.25 nC), 270 um (1 nC) and 325 um (3.2 nC) with 3 ~ 6% correlated energy spread: An initial energy modulation pattern has been observed in the electron spectrometer downstream of the masked chicane using a micropulse charge of 260 pC and 40 micropulses. Investigations of the beam longitudinal modulation are planned with a Martin-Puplett interferometer and a synchro-scan streak camera at a station between the chicane and spectrometer.

Abstract The Duke storage ring is a dedicated driver for the storage ring based free-electron laser (FEL) and the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HIGS). The high intensity gamma-ray beam is produced using Compton scattering between the electron and FEL photon beams. The beam displacement and angle at the collision point need to be maintained constant during the gamma-ray beam production. The magnetic field of the copper bussbars carrying the current to the FEL wigglers can impact the beam orbit. The compensation scheme in-general is complicated. In this work, we report preliminary results of a bussbar compensation scheme for one of the wiggler and power supply configurations. Significant reductions of the orbit distortions have been realized using this compensation.

MuSim is a user-friendly program designed to interface to many different particle simulation codes, regardless of their data formats or geometry descriptions. It presents the user with a compelling graphical user interface that includes a flexible 3-D view of the simulated world plus powerful editing and drag-and-drop capabilities. All aspects of the design can be parameterized so that parameter scans and optimizations are easy. It is simple to create plots and display events in the 3-D viewer, allowing for an effortless comparison of different simulation codes. Simulation codes: G4beamline 3.02, MCNP 6.1, and MAD-X; more are coming. Many accelerator design tools and beam optics codes were written long ago, with primitive user interfaces by today's standards. MuSim is specifically designed to make it easy to interface to such codes, providing a common user experience for all, and permitting the construction and exploration of models with very little overhead. For today's technology-driven students, graphical interfaces meet their expectations far better than text-based tools, and education in accelerator physics is one of our primary goals.

The Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA) has been utilized to probe the interaction of the electron cloud with a 2.1 GeV stored positron beam. Recent experiments have characterized any dependence of beam'electron cloud (EC) interactions on the bunch length (or synchrotron tune) and the vertical chromaticity. The measurements were performed on a 30-bunch positron train with 14 nsec spacing between bunches, at a fixed current of 0.75 mA/bunch. The dynamics of the stored beam, in the presence of the EC, was quantified using 20 turn-by-turn beam position monitors in CESR to measure the correlated bunch-by-bunch dipole motion. In this paper we report on the observations from these experiments and analyze the coupling of di-pole motion from bunches within the train to subsequent bunches, caused by the EC.

The Cornell Electron Storage Ring operations group is planning a major upgrade of the storage ring performance as an X-ray user facility. The principal modification foresees replacing the former e−e+ interaction region with six double-bend achromats, reducing the emittance by a factor of four. The beam energy will increase from 5.3 to 6.0 GeV and single-beam operation will replace the present two-beam e−e+ operation. The initial phase of the project will operate a single positron beam, so electron cloud buildup may contribute to performance limitations. This work describes a synchrotron radiation analysis of the new ring, and employs its results to provide ring-wide estimates of cloud buildup and consequences for the lattice optics.

The current interest for the next generation linear induction radiography accelerator (LIA) is to generate multiple electron beam pulses with high peak currents. The beam energy and current may vary from pulse to pulse. Conse-quently, the transport and control of multi-pulsing intense electron beams through a focus-ing lattice over a long distance on such machine becomes challenging. Simulation studies of multi-pulse LIAs using AMBER [1] and BREAKUP Code [2] are described. These include optimized focusing magnetic tune for beams with energy and current variations, and steering correction for corkscrew motion. The impact of energy variation and accelerating voltage error on radiograph performance are discussed.

The Flash X-ray Radiography (FXR) [1] line-ar induction accelerator at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory produces x-ray bursts for radiographs. The machine is able to produce x-ray spot sizes less than 2mm. Using the spot sizes measured from the magnet scanning, the beam parameters are unfolded by modelling the FXR LINAC with the simulation code AMBER [2] and the envelope code XENV [3]. In this study, the most recent spot size measurement results and techniques used to extract the beam parameters are described. Using the unfolded beam parameters as the initial condition, the backstreaming ions' neutralization factor f = 0.3 is found by comparing the calculated spot sizes with measured spot sizes at the target.

The presence of duodecapole components in quadrupole focusing field results in excitation of sixth-order single-particle resonance if the phase advance of the particles transverse oscillation is close to 60 deg. This phenomenon results in intensification of beam losses. We present analytical and numerical treatment of particle dynamics in the vicinity of sixth-order resonance. The topology of resonance in phase space is analyzed. Beam emittance growth due to crossing of resonance islands is determined. Halo formation of intense beams in presence of resonance conditions is examined.

The short lengths of colliding bunches in the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) allow for small beta-star values at the interaction point (IP) yielding a high luminosity. The strong focusing associated with the small beta-stars results in high natural chromaticities and potentially a beam smear at the IP. Rapid growth of the electron equilibrium emittances and momentum spread with energy further complicates the situation. We investigated nonlinear dynamics correction schemes that overcome these problems and allow for stable beam dynamics and sufficient beam lifetime at the highest electron energy. In this paper, we present and compare tracking simulation results for various schemes considering their emittance contributions.

The figure-8 JLEIC collider ring opens wide possibilities for manipulating proton and deuteron spin directions during an experiment. Using 3D spin rotators, one can, at the same time, efficiently control the polarization direction as well as the spin tune value. The 3D spin rotators allow one to arrange a system for reversals of the spin direction in all beam bunches during an experiment, i.e. a spin-flipping system. To preserve the polarization, one has to satisfy the condition of adiabatic change of the spin direction. When adjusting the polarization direction, one can stabilize the spin tune value, which completely eliminates resonant beam depolarization during the spin manipulation process. We provide the results of numerical modeling of a spin-flipping system in the JLEIC ion collider ring. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of organizing a spin-flipping system using a 3D rota-tor. The figure-8 JLEIC collider provides a unique capability of doing high-precision experiments with polarized ion beams.

The Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) is being designed to achieve a high luminosity of up to 1034 1/(cm2*sec). The latter requires a small beam size at the interaction point demanding a strong final focus (FF) quadrupole system. The strong beam focusing in the FF unavoidably creates a large chromaticity which has to be compensated in order to avoid a severe degradation of momentum acceptance. This has to be done while preserving sufficient dynamic aperture. An additional design requirement for the chromaticity compensation optics in the electron ring is preservation of the low beam emittance. This paper reviews the development and selection of a chromaticity correction scheme for the electron collider ring.

Skew Parametric-resonance Ionization Cooling (Skew PIC) is an extension of the Parametric-resonance Ionization Cooling (PIC) framework that has previously been explored as the final 6D cooling stage of a high-luminosity muon collider. The addition of skew quadrupoles to the PIC magnetic focusing channel induces coupled dynamic behavior of the beam that is radially periodic. The periodicity of the radial motion allows for the avoidance of unwanted resonances in the horizontal and vertical transverse planes, while still providing periodic locations at which ionization cooling components can be implemented. Properties of the linear beam dynamics have been previously reported and good agreement exists between theory, analytic solutions, and simulations. Progress on aberration compensation in the coupled correlated optics channel is presented and discussed.

In the JLab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC) project the traditional electron cooling technique is used to reduce the ion beam emittance at the booster ring, and to compensate the intrabeam scattering effect and maintain the ion beam emittance during the collision at the collider ring. Different with other electron coolers using DC electron beam, the proposed electron cooler at the JLEIC ion collider ring uses high energy bunched electron beam, provided by an ERL. In this paper, we report some recent simulation study on how the electron cooling rate will be affected by the bunched electron beam properties, such as the correlation between the longitudinal position and momentum, the bunch size, and the Larmor emittance.

Beam diffusion is an important measure of stability in high intensity beams. Traditional methods of diffusion characterization (e.g. beam scraping) can be very time-consuming. In this study, we investigate the transverse beam echo as a novel technique for measuring beam diffusion. Numerical analysis of maximum echo amplitude was compared with theoretical predictions with and without diffusion. We succeeded in performing a self-consistent measurement of the linear diffusion coefficient via a parameter scan over delay time. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of pulsed quadrupoles as a means to boost echo amplitude. Finally, multi-echo sequences were also briefly investigated. Results from this study will support planned experiments at the IOTA proton ring under construction at Fermilab.

MuSim is a new and innovative graphical system that allows the user to design, optimize, analyze, and evaluate accelerator and particle systems efficiently. It is designed for both students and experienced physicists to use in dealing with the many modeling tools and their different description languages and data formats. G4beamline [1] and MCNP [2] have been implemented into MuSim in previous studies. In this work, we implement MAD-X [3] into MuSim so that the users can easily use the graphical interface to design beam lines with MAD-X and compare the modeling results of different codes.

RadiaBeam Technologies is currently developing a non-linear magnet insert for Fermilab's Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA), a 150 MeV circulating electron beam storage ring designed for investigating advanced beam physics concepts. The physics requirements of the insert demand a high level of precision in magnet geometry, magnet axis alignment, and corresponding alignment of the vacuum chamber geometry within the magnet modules to maximize chamber aperture size. Here we report on the design and manufacturing of the vacuum chamber, magnet manufacturing, and kinematic systems.

A number of electron beam vacuum devices such as small radiofrequency (RF) linear accelerators (linacs) and microwave traveling wave tubes (TWTs) utilize slow wave structures which are usually rather complicated in production and may require multi-step brazing and time consuming tuning. Fabrication of these devices becomes challenging at centimeter wavelengths, at large number of cells, and when a series or mass production of such structures is required. A hybrid, metal-dielectric, periodic structure for low gradient, low beam current applications is introduced here as a modification of Andreev's disk-and-washer (DaW) structure. Compensated type of coupling between even and odd TE01 modes in the novel structure results in negative group velocity with absolute values as high as 0.1c-0.2c demonstrated in simulations. Sensitivity to material imperfections and electrodynamic parameters of the disk-and-ring (DaR) structure are considered numerically using a single cell model.

Transverse instability of a multi-bunch beam in the presence of a longitudinal magnetostatic field and hybrid dipole modes is considered analytically within a single-section model. It incorporates resonant interaction with beam harmonics and eigenmodes, degenerated waves of different polarizations, and the Lorentz RF force contribution. The analysis is performed in a very compact form using a bi-complex i,j-space including four-component collective frequency of the instability. Rotating polarization of the collective field is determined by ImiImj part of the bi-complex collective frequency in agreement with available data. The other three components represent detuning of the collective frequency ReiRej, the left-hand, and right-hand increments ImiRej±ReiImj of the gyro-magnetic BBU effect. The scalar hyper-complex toolbox can be applied to designing of non-ferrite non-reciprocal devices, spin transport, and for characterization of complex transverse dynamics in gyro-devices such as Gyro-TWTs.

In order to measure the momentum of particles produced by asymmetric collisions in the proposed Electron Ion Collider, a magnetic field should be introduced perpendicular to the path of the beam to increase momentum resolution without bending or depolarizing it. A magnetic cloak consisting of a superconducting magnetic shield surrounded by a ferromagnetic layer is capable of shielding the interior from a magnetic field – thereby protecting the beam – without distorting the field outside of the cloak – permitting detector coverage at high pseudorapidity.

Low emittance muon beam lines and muon colliders are potentially a rich source of BSM physics for future experimenters. A normalized transverse muon emittance of 280 microns has been achieved in simulation with short solenoids and a betatron function of 3 cm. Here we use ICOOL, G4Beamline, and MAD-X to explore using a flat 400 MeV/c muon beam and strong focusing quadrupoles to achieve a normalized transverse emittance of 100 microns and finish 6D cooling. The low beta regions, as low as 5 mm, produced by the quadrupoles are occupied by dense, low Z absorbers, such as lithium hydride or beryllium, that cool the beam. Equilibrium transverse emittance is linearly proportional to the beta function. Reverse emittance exchange with septa and/or wedges is then used to decrease transverse emittance from 100 to 25 microns at the expense of longitudinal emittance for a high energy lepton collider. Cooling challenges include chromaticity correction, momentum passband overlap, quadrupole acceptance, and staying in phase with RF.

A fast new linear lattice characterization / correction method based on turn-by-turn (TbT) beam position monitor (BPM) data in storage rings has been recently developed and experimentally demonstrated at NSLS-II. This method performs least-square fitting iteratively on the 4 frequency components extracted from TbT data and dispersion functions. The fitting parameters include the errors for normal/skew quadrupole strength and 4 types of BPM errors (gain, roll, and deformation). The computation of the Jacobian matrix for this system is very fast as it utilizes analytical expressions derived from the resonance driving terms (RDT), from which the method name DTBLOC (Driving-Terms-Based Linear Optics Characterization/Correction) originates. At NSLS-II, a lattice corrected with DTBLOC was estimated to have beta-beating of <1%, dispersion errors of ~1 mm, and emittance coupling ratio on the order of 10-4.

To combat triplets vibration, the global orbit feedback system with frequency about 10 Hz was developed and en- gaged in operation at injection and top energy in 2010, dur- ing beam acceleration in 2012 at RHIC. The system has performed well with keeping 6 out of 12 eigenvalues for the orbit response matrix. However, we observed correc- tor current transients with the lattice for polarized proton program in 2015 which resulted in corrector power supply trips. In this report, we will present the observation, an- alyze the cause and also optimize the feedback algorithm to overcome the newly emerged problem with the feedback system.

The ring-ring version of the eRHIC electron-ion collider design aims at providing electron-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 32 to 141 GeV at a luminosity reaching 1033 cm-2 sec-1. This design of the double-ring collider also supports electron-ion collisions with similar electron-nucleon luminosities, and is upgradeable to 1034 cm-2 sec-1 using bunched beam electron cooling of the hadron beam. The baseline luminosities are achievable using existing technologies and beam parameters that have been routinely achieved at RHIC in hadron-hadron collisions or elsewhere in e+e− collisions. This minimizes the risk associated with the challenging luminosity goal and is keeping the technical risk of the e-RHIC electron-ion collider low. The latest design status will be presented.

We re-consider stochastic cooling as type of information engine using the Adami definition of information *. We define information as data which can permit the cooling system to predict the individual trajectories better than purely random prediction and then act on that data to modify the trajectories of an ensemble of particles. In this study we track the flow of this type of information through the closed system and consider the limits based on sampling and correction as well as the role of the underlying model.

The proposed eRHIC accelerator1 will collide 20 GeV polarized electrons with 250 GeV polarized protons or 100 GeV/n polarized 3He ions or other unpolarized heavy ions. The electron accelerator of the eRHIC will be based on a 1.665 GeV Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) placed in the RHIC tunnel and two Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) recirculating rings placed alongside the RHIC accelerator. The electron bunches reach the 20 GeV energy after passing 12 times through the ERL by recirculation in the FFAG rings. The FFAG rings consist of FODO cells comprised of one focusing and one defocusing quadrupoles made of permanent magnet material. Similarly other sections of the electron accelerator will utilize permanent magnets. In this presentation we will discuss details on the design of these magnets and their advantages over the current-excited magnets.

The Android application TAPAs, the Toolkit for Accelerator Physics on Androids, was released in 2012 and at present has over 300 users. TAPAs provides over 50 calculations, many of which are coupled together. Updates are released about once a month and have provided many new capabilities. Calculations for electron storage rings are a particular emphasis, and have expanded to include CSR threshold, ion trapping, Laslett tune shift, and emittance dilution. Other additions include helical superconducting undulators, rf cavity properties, Compton backscattering, and temperature calculations for mixing water.

The Fermilab accelerator complex is currently undergoing an upgrade from 400kW to 700kW. This intensity could push operations into the region where electron cloud (e-cloud) generation could be observed and even cause instabilities. The POSINST simulation code was used to study how in- creasing beam intensities will affect electron cloud genera- tion. Threshold simulations show how the e-cloud density depend on the beam intensity and secondary electron yield (SEY) in the Main Injector (MI) and Recycler Ring (RR).

This paper presents the main results obtained during a series of beam measurements performed on the PIP-II Injector Test LEBT from November 2014 to June 2015. The measurements which focus on beam transmission, beam size and emittance at various locations along the beamline are compared with the beam dynamics code TRACK. These studies were aimed at preparing the beam for optimal operation of the RFQ, while evaluating simulation tools with respect to experimental data.

Procedure for the Alignment of the Beam in the Electrical Axes of the Pi-Test RFQ

The PI-Test Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) has been in operation with beam at Fermilab since March 2016. The RFQ accelerates H− beam from 30 keV to 2.1 MeV currently with 20 mus pulses and a maximum current of 10 mA. Once fully conditioned, the RFQ is expected to enable CW operation. Simulations with the beam dynamics code TRACK predict that a misalignment of the beam at the RFQ entrance can possibly deteriorate the transverse and longitudinal emittance at the RFQ exit without necessarily impacting the beam transmission. This paper discusses the procedure developed at Fermilab to align the beam in the electrical axes of the RFQ. Experimental results are shown together with predictions from TRACK.
