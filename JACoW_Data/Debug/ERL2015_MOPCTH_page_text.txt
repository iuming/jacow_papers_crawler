The Compact ERL (cERL) is a superconducting test accelerator aimed at establishing technologies for the ERL-based future light source. After its construction during 2009 to 2013, the first CW beams of 20 MeV were successfully transported through the recirculation loop in February 2014*. Since then, various accelerator studies have been carried out. We have so far succeeded in recirculating CW beams of 30 uA through the loop with very-small beam losses. Initial emittance measurements were carried out in the recirculation loop. We also carried out commissioning of a X-ray source using the laser Compton scattering**. During these studies, both a photocathode DC electron gun and superconducting cryomodules have been worked very stably. We present our results of cERL commissioning, measured beam properties, operational status, and future prospect.

We present the results of transverse emittance and longitudinal current profile measurements of high bunch charge (>100 pC) beams produced in the dc gun-based Cornell photoinjector. In particular, we show that the cathode thermal emittance dominates the final emittance at charges up to 300 pC. Additionally, we demonstrate excellent agreement between optimized 3D space charge simulations and measurement, and show that the quality of the transverse laser distribution limits the optimal simulated and measured emittances.

ALICE (Accelerators and Lasers in Combined Experiments) is a 26 MeV energy recovery linac driving a tuneable infra-red free-electron laser (FEL) at Daresbury Laboratory in the UK. Formerly known as ERLP (Energy Recovery Linac Prototype), the machine has developed over ~10 years into an operational user facility. ALICE is currently in the middle of a three year funded programme utilising the FEL radiation to investigate new diagnostic techniques for various forms of cancer in humans. ALICE consists of a 350 keV DC photoinjector, two 1.3 GHz pulsed superconducting linac modules, energy recovery transport and bunch compressor, FEL oscillator cavity, variable gap undulator, radiation beamlines and user stations. We give an overview of the conception, development and current operational status of ALICE.

Energy recovery linac(ERL)-based free electron lasers(FELs) are promising candidates for high-power EUV sources. They can recover most acceleration energy from the electron beams and greatly reduce the dumped beam power and activation compared with those based on ordinary linear accelerators. We have investigated a feasible design of a 10-kW class ERL-FEL operated at 13.5 nm for EUV lithography applications. In this talk, we will present the design work of the ERL-FEL as the high-power EUV source.
