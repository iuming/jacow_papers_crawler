Prototype Cryomodules for the SHINE Free Electron Laser at Shanghai

SARI at Shanghai is currently building the prototype cryomodules for the SHINE Free Electron Laser. Accelerating structures from new vendors, also in China, are used. The technology transfer to this now third large scale facility (after European XFEL and LCLS-II) using superconducting technology is challenging but at the same time interesting due to the inclusion of new sources for criticaal components.

We present here an overview of the ESS cryomodule production, test and preparation to tunnel installation, covering both families of modules: spoke and elliptical. Cryomodules and cavities for the ESS linac are in-kind contribution by several of the project partners.

Successful Beam Operation at 33 MV/m in STF-2 Cryomodule at KEK for ILC

In STF at KEK, as the operational demonstration of the SRF accelerator for ILC, the STF-2 cryomodules (CM1+CM2a: one and half size CM with 12 cavities) have achieved 33 MV/m as average accelerating gradient estimated from the beam energy with 7 cavities in Mar/2019. After that, one cavity with the lowest performance installed in CM2a was replaced with one nitrogen-infused cavity developed for High-Q/High-G R&D between Japan and US. From Apr/2021, the beam operation started again and those CMs achieved 33 MV/m as average accelerating gradient with 9 cavities including one nitrogen-infused cavity. This is the very important milestone for ILC. In this report, the detailed results will be presented.
