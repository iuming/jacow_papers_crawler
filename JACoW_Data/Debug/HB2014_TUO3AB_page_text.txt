The CPHS (Compact Pulsed Hadron Source) linac at Tsinghua University, is now in operation as an achievement of its mid-term objective. The 3 MeV proton beam with the peak current of 22 mA, pulse length of 100 μs, and repetition rate of 20 Hz has been delivered to the Beryllium target to produce the neutron beam from the year of 2013. We present in this paper the development and application of the high current linac, together with the measurement of the proton and neutron beams. The beam energy of the CPHS linac will be enhanced to 13 MeV after the DTL is ready in 2015.

The Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (ATLAS) recently completed a significant upgrade and reconfiguration. Along with the major additions of a new CW room temperature RFQ and a new cryostat of quarter wave resonators optimized for = 0.077, the transverse and longitudinal optics were reconfigured to optimize the performance of these new components. Beam commissioning investigations showed an improvement of 15% – 20% in transmission efficiencies and an increase of up to 50% in maximum beam intensities. The details of the upgraded facility and the commissioning results will be presented.

The official reception of the SPIRAL2 accelerator building occurred in October 2014. In parallel, the installation of the accelerator components has started in June 2013. The first part of the beam commissioning, including the ECR sources, the LEBTs and the 88 MHz RFQ should start in December, with an injection in the Linac by mid-2015. This paper describes the status of the accelerator components and installation, and the philosophy retained to commission the light and heavy ion beams at various required final energies.
