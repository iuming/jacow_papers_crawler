We propose a method to measure and correct storage ring linear optics and coupling with turn-by-turn BPM data. The independent component analysis (ICA) is used to obtain the amplitudes and phase advances of the betatron normal modes, which are compared to their counterparts derived from the lattice model. By fitting the model to the data with quadrupole and skew quadrupole variables, the linear optics and coupling of the machine can be obtained. Simulation demonstrates that errors in the lattice and BPM parameters can be recovered with this method. Experiments on the NSLS-II storage ring show that it can find the same optics as the linear optics from closed orbit (LOCO) method.

Since quite some time, dynamic aperture studies have been undertaken with the aim of specifying the required field quality of the new magnets that will be installed in the LHC ring in the framework of the high-luminosity upgrade. In this paper the latest results concerning the specification work will be presented, taking into account both injection and collision energies and the field quality contribution from all the magnets in the newly designed interaction regions.

For the analysis of the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) induced microbunching gain in the low energy regime, such as when a high-brightness electron beam is transported through a low-energy merger in an energy-recovery linac (ERL) design, it is necessary to extend the CSR impedance expression in the ultrarelativistic limit to the non-ultrarelativistic regime. This paper presents our analysis of CSR impedance for general beam energies.

I present here a new ring-ring design of eRHIC. It utilizes high repetition rate colliding beams and is likely able to deliver the performance to meet the requirements of the science program with low technical risk and modest accelerator R&D. The expected performance includes high luminosities over multiple collision points and a broad CM energy range with a maximum value up to 2×1034 cm-2s−1 per detector, and polarization higher than 70% for the colliding electron and light ion beams. This new design calls for reuse of decommissioned facilities in the US, namely, the PEP-II high energy ring and one section of the SLAC linac as a full energy injector.

A method is implemented in Zgoubi that allows the computation of space charge effects in 2D distributions and with some restrictions in 3D distributions. It relies on decomposiing field maps or analytical elements into slices and applying a space charge kick to the particles. The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy of this technique, its limitations/advantages by comparisons with other linear/nonlinear computation methods and codes, and to apply it to high power fixed field ring design studies.

Particle accelerator and radiation modeling codes focus on specific problems, rely on complicated command-line interfaces, are sometimes limited to a small number of computing platforms, and can be difficult to install. There is also a growing need to use two or more codes together for end-to-end design or for complicated sub-systems. RadTrack is a lightweight cross-platform GUI for such codes, based on the Qt framework and PyQt bindings for Python. RadTrack is designed to support multiple codes, placing no burden on the corresponding development teams. Elegant and the Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW) are supported now in a pre-beta stage, and support for GENESIS 1.3 is under development. These codes are being containerized via the open source Docker platform for use in the cloud. The open source Vagrant and Virtual Box are used for MacOS and Windows. We discuss RadTrack and our vision for cloud computing.

A parallel particle-in-cell code SPACE has been developed for the simulation of electromagnetic fields, relativistic particle beams, and plasmas. The algorithms include atomic processes in the plasma, proper boundary conditions, an efficient method for highly-relativistic beams in non-relativistic plasma, support for simulations in relativistic moving frames, and special data transfer algorithm from the moving to the laboratory frame that collects particles and fields in the lab frame without time shift due to the Lorentz transform, enabling data analysis and visualization. Plasma chemistry algorithms implement atomic physics processes such as the generation and evolution of plasma, recombination of plasma, and electron attachment on dopants in dense neutral gas. Benchmarks and experimental validation tests are also discussed. The code has been used for the simulation of processes relevant to the eRHIC program at BNL and the high pressure RF cavity (HPRF) program at Fermilab.

Understanding of the interaction of muon beams with plasma in muon cooling devices is important for the optimization of the muon cooling process. SPACE, a 3D electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) code, is used for the simulation support of the experimental program on the hydrogen gas filled RF cavity in the Mucool Test Area (MTA) at Fermilab. We have investigated the plasma dynamics in the RF cavity including the process of power dump by plasma (plasma loading), recombination of plasma, and plasma interaction with dopant material. By comparison with experiments in the MTA, simulations suggest several unknown properties of plasma such as the effective recombination rate, the electron attachment time on dopant molecule, and the ion - ion recombination rate in the plasma.

One of the main challenges in the increase of luminosity of circular colliders is the control of the beam-beam effect. In the process of exploring beam-beam mitigation methods using plasma, we evaluated the possibility of plasma generation via ionization of neutral gas by proton beams, and performed highly resolved simulations of the beam-plasma interaction using SPACE, a 3D electromagnetic particle-in-cell code. The process of plasma generation is modelled using experimentally measured cross-section coefficients and a plasma recombination model that takes into account the presence of neutral gas and beam-induced electromagnetic fields. Numerically simulated plasma oscillations are consistent with theoretical analysis. In the beam-plasma interaction process, high-density neutral gas reduces the mean free path of plasma electrons and their acceleration. A numerical model for the drift speed as a limit of plasma electron velocity was developed. Simulations demonstrate a significant reduction of the beam electric field in the presence of plasma. Preliminary simulations using fully-ionized plasma have also been performed and compared with the case of beam-induced plasma.

We study decoherence effects due to second order chromaticity for small amplitude kicks, in order to estimate the energy spread from TbT data of the NSLS-II storage ring. The bare lattice case (no Damping Wigglers and Insertion devices) has been considered, due to the long transverse radiation damping time. To minimize the chromatic damping/antidamping from the slow-head tail effect, we used a short train of bunches distributed over consecutive rf-buckets with a high enough average current to obtain a good BPM signal. The vertical and horizontal betatron motion have been excited independently with pinger magnets. In this contribution we limit the discussion to the horizontal case.

I describe a generic formulation for the evolution of emittances and lattice functions under arbitrary, possibly non-Hamiltonian, linear equations of motion. The average effect of stochastic processes, which would include ionization interactions and synchrotron radiation, is also included. I first compute the evolution of the covariance matrix, then the evolution of emittances and lattice functions from that. I examine the particular case of a cylindrically symmetric system, which is of particular interest for ionization cooling.

The combined effects of space charge and wall impedance on transverse instabilities is an important consideration in the design and operation of hadron machines as well as an intrinsic academic interest. This study explores the combined effects of space charge and wall impedance using various simplified models in an attempt to produce a better understanding of their interplay.

As the emittance of synchrotron light sources moves towards diffraction limit, magnet tolerances for reaching dynamic aperture for high injection efficiency and long lifetime become more stringent. Once nonlinear families are designed and the machine is built a machine operator may ask to which accuracy the linear optics and orbit should be corrected so to achieve reasonable dynamic aperture. We also studied the relations of the non-linear elements and beta-beat to the dynamic apertures by simulating NSLS-II storage ring lattice and the paper shows the results.

As the newly constructed 3rd generation light source, NSLS-II is expected to provide the synchrotron radiation of ultra high brightness and flux with advanced insertion devices. To minimize the beam emittance, damping wigglers are used and the small aperture is located at the straight section with the damping wiggler and the corresponding vacuum camber is NEG coated. We used the local bump method to find the effect on the beam from the narrow aperture and the paper shows the results.

The potential upgrade of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to an electron ion collider (eRHIC) involves numerous extensive changes to the existing collider complex. The expected very high luminosity is planned to be achieved at eRHIC with the help of squeezing the beta function of the hadron ring at the IP to a few cm, causing a large rise of the natural chromaticities and thus bringing with it challenges for the beam long term stability (Dynamic aperture). We present our effort to expand the DA by carefully tuning the nonlinear magnets thus controlling the size of the footprints in tune space and all lower order resonance driving terms. We show a reasonably large DA through particle tracking over millions of turns of beam revolution.

Brookhaven National Laboratory Accelerator Test Facility (BNL ATF) is in the process of upgrading to ATF2 with higher electron beam energy thus expanding its capabilities. For the fully upgraded electron beam (500 MeV), it will be of great interest to compress the bunch to femto-seconds scale while maintaining high peak current (~7,800 amps) for users. A bunch compressor composed of magnetic chicanes can be utilized for this purpose. However, during such strong compression, beam quality can easily be deteriorated by Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR). In this paper, we present our study for a bunch compressor where this CSR effect is compensated through careful manipulation of phase space. We also show a beam with good quality is preserved through the system by presenting a start to end simulation.

The strengths of spin resonances for the polarized-proton operation in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider are currently calculated with code DEPOL, which numerically integrate through the whole ring based on analytical approximate formula. In this article, we calculate the spin resonance strength by performing Fourier transformation to the actual transverse magnetic field seen by a single particle travelling through the ring. Comparison is made between the results from this method and DEPOL and other approaches.

Symplectic integration for orbital motion had been adopted in SimTrack which has been extensively used for dynamic aperture calculation with beam-beam interaction for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Recently spin tracking for protons has been implemented on top of the orbit motion in this code. In this article, we will explain the implementation of spin motion using Thomas-BMT equation, and benchmark with other spin tracking codes currently used for RHIC. Possibility and remedy for very-long term particle tracking, such as on the RHIC energy acceleration, is also explored.
