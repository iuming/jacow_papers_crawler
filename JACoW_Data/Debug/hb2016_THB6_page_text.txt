The electron-ion collider being developed at JLAB requires a new ion accelerator complex which includes a linac capable of delivering any ion beam from hydrogen to lead to the booster. We are currently developing a linac which consists of several ion sources, a normal conducting (NC) front end, up to 5 MeV/u, and a SC section for energies > 5 MeV/u. The development work is focused on beam dynamics and electrodynamics studies to design efficient and cost-effective accelerating structures for both the NC and SC sections of the linac. Currently we are considering two RFQs following either heavy-ion sources or light-ion sources including polarized beams, and several different types of NC accelerating structures downstream of the RFQ. Quarter-wave and half-wave resonators can be effectively used in the SC section.

The collective mode instability in high intensity ion beam induced by space charge has been studied for several decades. Beam halo also will be formed if beam is located in the collective mode unstable stop band. In this paper, firstly we clearly show that the beam surface is distorted by the space charge potential perturbation; the formed n-fold structure is in particular to the nth order unstable collective mode. Secondly, the formed n-fold structure will lead to beam halo with beam evolution. The halo mechanism could be depicted by resonance between single particle and oscillation collective mode. Finally, we proved that the halo particles are those whose actions were modified significantly by the nonlinear space charge and resonance.

The IMPACT code suite is a self-consistent parallel three-dimensional beam dynamics simulation toolbox that combines the magnetic optics method and the parallel particle-in-cell method. It has been widely used to study high intensity/high brightness beams in many accelerators. In this paper, we will report on recent improvements to the code such as the capability to model RFQ in time domain and symplectic multi-particle tracking with a gridless spectral solver for space-charge simulation.

There’s presently a growing demand for cw high current proton and deuteron linear accelerators based on superconducting technology to better support various fields of science. Up to now, high order modes (HOMs) studies induced by ion beams with current higher than 10mA and even 100 mA accelerated by low β non-elliptical Superconducting rf (SRF) cavities are very few. One of the main HOM related issues of the SRF linac is the HOM-induced power. HOM power is the important part of beam energy loss which is used to estimate the cryogenic losses. In this paper, we compare the beam energy loss induced by 100 mA beam passing through a β=0.09 HWR SRF cavity calculated from time domain solver and frequency domain cavity eigenmodes spectrum method.

A multi-stage programm for the developmnet of a heavy ion superconducting (SC) continuous wave (CW) linac is in progress at HIM (Mainz, Germany), GSI (Darmstadt, Germany) and IAP (Frankfurt, Germany). The main beam acceleration is provided by up to nine multi-gap CH cavities. Due to variable beam energy, which coud be provided by each cavity separate, a longitudinal beam matching to each cavity is extremely important. The linac should provide the beam for physics experiments, smothly varying the output particle energy from 3.5 to 7.3 MeV/u, simultaneously keeping high beam quality. A dedicated algorythm for such a complicate matching, providing for the optimum machine settings (voltage and rf phase for each cavity), has been developed. The description of method and the obtained reasuts are discussed in this paper.
