Recently there have been important advances in Energy Recovery Linac technology. Photoemission guns can now produce high currents, low emittance and long lifetimes, and injectors have accelerated large CW currents with little emittance degradation. One challenge of high current energy recovery linacs has been the superconducting RF linacs, which require very high quality factors in order to limit power consumption. Recently, cavities in cryomodules with the needed performance have been demonstrated. Together, these advances open the door to new applications for energy recovery linacs, from colliders to light sources. This talk reviews progress in ERLs around the world.
