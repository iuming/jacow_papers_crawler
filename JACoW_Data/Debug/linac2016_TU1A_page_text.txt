Review on Trends in Normal Conducting Linacs for Protons, Ions and Electrons, With Emphasis on New Technologies and Applications

In recent years a lot of attention was given to developments in the field of superconducting cavities. While these cavities can save operating costs and shorten the length of linacs, there are many applications and circumstances where normal conducting cavities are superior. This talk reviews some of the normal conducting linacs, which have been either recently commissioned, or which are currently under construction or in the design phase. Focus will be given to the choice between normal and superconducting cavities and to emerging normal conducting technologies and their applications.

Reaching Beyond Conventional Accelerator Capabilities with Laser-Plasma Ion Accelerators

For the past few decades, nuclear research has been exclusive to large accelerator and reactor facilities. The availability of tabletop particle sources based on high intensity lasers opens venues for new research methods in nuclear physics, both at large facilities and at university-scale laboratories. It has been demonstrated in many experiments that the kinetic energy of a particle radiated by a high intensity laser-plasma interaction is sufficient to induce nuclear reactions. These achievements, however, duplicated experimental results achieved decades ago with conventional accelerator. While often smaller and cheaper, laser systems to-date have shown no technical advantage over conventional accelerators. This talk will review the state-of-the-art in laser-ion acceleration, and discuss how next generation laser systems can go beyond conventional accelerator capabilities. Specifically, the talk will present a novel, ultrashort pulsed laser-driven neutron generator developed at U. Texas (I. Pomerantz et al., Ultrashort pulsed neutron source, Phys. Rev. Lett 2014, 113:184801), generating a peak flux of 1018 n/cm2/s, thus exceeding any other pulsed or CW neutron source.

Experience with the Construction and Commissioning of Linac4

In the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade program, CERN is presently commissioning Linac4, a 160MeV H− ion linac, which will replace the present 50 MeV proton linac (Linac2) as injector to the PS Booster during the next LHC long shut-down. The installation of the machine has proceeded in parallel with a staged beam commissioning at the energies of 3, 12, 50, 100 MeV and finally 160 MeV, foreseen for fall 2016. A seven month long reliability run will take place during 2017 to access potential weak points and find mitigations. The lessons learnt during its construction, the main outcomes of the beam commissioning and the remaining steps toward its connection to the PS Booster are presented in this paper.

Funding: Work performed at (or work supported by) Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is managed by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 for the U.S. Department of Energy.
The SNS superconducting linac (SCL) provides 972 MeV, 1.5 MW H− beam for the storage ring and neutron spallation target. It has now been in operation for 11 years, and we have gained some experience in long-term operational issues. Three inter-related issues are gradient changes, errant beams, and trip rates. In this presentation we will provide an update on our progress to mitigate these issues, and also report on the overall status of the SCL.
