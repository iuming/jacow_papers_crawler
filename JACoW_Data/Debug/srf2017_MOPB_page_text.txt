In the design of eRHIC at BNL, HOM power plays a major role for the SRF installation. Depending on the final accelerator design and choice of cavity, up to 100kW of HOM power is estimated to be generated, presenting a big challenge for the HOM damping concept. Due to this high amount of HOM power, all current concepts for eRHIC would use room temperature beam line absorbers equipped with silicone-carbide dielectrics to absorb HOM power. Concepts, designs and simulations for these beam line absorbers will be presented.

The future electron ion collider eRHIC adopts large crossing angle (22 mrad) to allow fast separation of two beams in the ring-ring scheme. Crab cavities are required to recover the luminosity from geometric losses. Initial calculation shows that the frequency of the cavities for the ion beam is no more than 336MHz. In this paper, we discuss the crab cavity related lattice parameters for both ion and electron beams in ring-ring design, the frequency choice, and the cavity design considerations.

Optical inspection of the inner surface of superconducting resonators was established during European XFEL cavity production by usage of the so called OBACHT optical inspection. In addition to the surface inspection by OBACHT a new optical inspection system with integrated high resolution camera is set up at DESY. It allows inspection of multi-cell resonators as well as gun cavity resonators with only single side accessibility to the inner surface. A prototype was commissioned and optical inspections were done with OBACHT and the new system in parallel. Two SRF gun cavities were inspected by this optical system and origin of limitations of the resonators were identified.

The design and optimization of a quadrupole resonator for transverse Landau damping in the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is presented. Two different cavity types are considered whose shape is determined by quadrupolar strength, surface peak fields, and beam coupling impedance. The lower order and higher order mode (LOM and HOM) spectra of the optimized cavities are investigated and different approaches for their damping are proposed. Along an example, the required RF power and optimal external quality factor for the input coupler is derived.

For future experiments with heavy ions near the coulomb barrier within the super-heavy element (SHE) research project a multi-stage R&D program of GSI, HIM and IAP is currently in progress. It aims at developing a superconducting (sc) continuous wave (CW) LINAC with multiple CH cavities as key components downstream the upgraded High Charge Injector (HLI) at GSI. The LINAC design is challenging, due to the requirement of intense beams in CW-mode up to a mass-to-charge ratio of 6 while covering a broad output energy range from 3.5 to 7.3 MeV/u with minimum energy spread. After sucessful tests with the first CH cavity in 2016 demonstrated a promising maximum accelerating gradient of Ea = 9.6 MV/m, recently first beam tests have been started as next milestone at GSI, confirming its flawless functionality*.

A heavy ion accelerator facility (HIAF) is under development in the Institute of Modern Physics. For the low energy superconducting accelerating section, two types of quarter wave resonators with frequency of 81.25 MHz and β of 0.05 and 0.10 have been proposed. The electro-magnetic design has been optimized in order to reach the high accelerating voltage, and the optimization also included the drift tube face tilting to compensate for the beam steering caused by the asymmetry in the quarter wave resonator geometry.

New coaxial power coupler research and development results are presented and discussed. Coupler is proposed for superconducting QWR cavities being under consideration now as option for planned Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) injector upgrade. The goal was to develop power coupler operating at 162 MHz and feeding SC cavity with about 20 kW RF power. It provides Qext tuning range (1.5-3)E5 by inner conductor movement. Conservative design with two identical disk ceramic windows was chosen. Electrodynamic, thermal and mechanical simulations were carried out.

CEA is committed to delivering a Medium Energy Beam Transfer line and a superconducting linac (SCL) for SARAF accelerator in order to accelerate 5mA beam of either protons from 1.3 MeV to 35 MeV or deuterons from 2.6 MeV to 40.1 MeV. The SCL consists in 4 cryomodules separated by warm diagnostics housing beam diagnostics. The first two identical cryomodules host 6 half-wave resonator (HWR) low beta cavities (β = 0.091), 176 MHz. The last two identical cryomodules are equipped with 7 HWR high-beta cavities (β = 0.181), 176 MHz. The beam is focused through superconducting solenoids located between cavities housing steering coils. A Beam Position Monitor is placed upstream each solenoid. A diagnostic box containing a beam profiler and a vacuum pump will be placed at the end of each cryomodule. The cryomodules and the warm sections are being designed. These studies will be presented in this poster.

102 European XFEL accelerating modules with 816 superconducting cavities and main input RF power couplers were assembled and then tested at DESY prior to installation in the European XFEL tunnel. In the Accelerating Module Test Facility (AMTF) warm and cold RF tests were done. The test results went directly to the operational setup for the LINAC. Main input couplers did present several problems during the tests, resulting in some minor coupler design changes as well as in a few repair actions. The experience got from the said testing operation is worth to be shared and is presented here together with a discussion.

The Diamond Light Source storage ring has been in operation using superconducting RF cavities since 2007. Diamond has four superconducting cavity modules with two usually installed at any one time. The four cavities perform differently in many aspects such as reliable operating parameters and time in service, with the longest in continuous service for 7 years without failure and the shortest failing after only 8 months. All Diamond superconducting RF cavities suffered many fast vacuum trips in their early years, but after many years of efforts, the performance of the cavities have now been effectively managed by weekly conditioning, partial warm-up during shut down and cavity voltage level control. We will discuss our experience with superconducting RF cavities and our future plan.

In the frame of a FCC study a first prototype of a compact superconducting crab-cavity, using Nb-on-Cu-coating technique is being manufactured and investigated. The design, which is based on the ridged waveguide resonator, is subjected to multipacting and pressure sensitivity simulations. First results of theses simulations are presented and compared to those of other SRF cavities. Furthermore, several aspects related to the design of the fundamental mode coupler and HOM dampers are presented.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is currently under construction in Lund, Sweden. The ESS linear accelerator aims to deliver a 62.5 mA , 2.86 ms long proton beam onto a rotating tungsten target, at 14 Hz repetition rate, thus achieving an energy of 2 GeV and 5 MW power. Most of the beam acceleration happens in the superconducting fraction of the linac, which is composed of three sectors of cryomodules named after the cavities housed within. The first sector of the SRF linac is composed of 13 Spoke cryomodules containing 2 double-spoke cavities with a geometric beta of 0.5, the second is composed of 9 medium beta cryomodules each housing four elliptical cavities (β=0.67) and finally 21 high beta cryomodules enclosing four elliptical cavities (β=0.86). ESS has strategically built up a SRF collaboration with other European institutions, these partners will deliver through In-Kind agreements cavities and cryomodules performing within the ESS specification. This article describes the process leading to the acceptance of cavities and cryomodules received from the different partners and the necessary testing required prior to the final installation in the ESS tunnel.

The European Spallation Source is currently under construction in Lund in southern Sweden. The main part of the accelerator will consist of two different types of cryomodules housing three different types of cavities ' double spoke cavities and two different elliptical cavities. The spoke cavities as well as the cryomodules will be provided by IPN Orsay, thus the external interfaces to the other accelerator systems have to be verified. While the procurement and assembly of the elliptical cryomodules will be performed by CEA Saclay, the cavities will be provided by INFN Milano and STFC Daresbury. Thus in addition to the external cryomodule interfaces, also the internal interfaces between cavities and cryomodules have to be taken care of. This contribution presents the challenges related to this work.

An optimal procedure for coupler and cavity conditioning is proposed for the ESS superconducting cavities, which is applicable for different test stands and following installation in the ESS tunnel. A preliminary procedure has been developed and successfully tested at FREIA facility, Uppsala. The preliminary procedure will now be improved by integrating it into LLRF and EPICS control. This will be a joint effort between FREIA and ESS and will be used at the test stands in Lund and on the couplers installed in the tunnel. Developing the conditioning procedures on a common platform offers ESS significant advantages by allowing the procedures to be reused at different sites and by recording data in a consistent format. The details of the procedure, its development and testing will be reported and the future activities will be described.

Very compact accelerating-focusing structures, as well as short focusing periods, high accelerating gradients and very short drift spaces are strongly required for superconducting (sc) accelerator sections operating at low and medium beam energies. To keep the GSI-Super Heavy Element program competitive on a high level and even beyond, a standalone sc continuous wave Linac in combination with the GSI High Charge State injector, upgraded for cw-operation, is envisaged. The first LINAC section (financed by HIM and GSI) as a demonstration of the capability of 216 MHz multi gap Crossbar H-structures (CH) is still in the beam commissioning phase, while an accelerating gradient of 9.6 MV/m (4 K) at a sufficient quality factor has been already reached. Recently the overall Linac design, based on a standard cryomodule, comprising three CH cavities, a rebuncher section and two 9.3 T-solenoidal lenses, has to be fixed. This paper presents the status of the Linac layout studies as well as the integration in the GSI accelerator facility.

A superconducting (sc) cw-Linac at GSI should ensure competitive production of Super Heavies in the future. Further R&D for this cw-Linac, a so called 'Advanced CW-Demonstrator', with maximal energy of 3.5 MeV/u is ongoing. As a first step, the demonstrator project with one sc CH-cavity is near its completion, the beam tests are scheduled for mid-summer 2017. The completion of the 'Advanced CW-Demonstrator' includes successive construction of two new cryogenic modules comprising four CH-cavities and two solenoids each. In this contribution the layout of the cryomodules and the Helium distribution system are presented.

In this paper，it will be presented the higher order mode (HOM) coupler design for the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) 650 MHz 2-cell cavity. The higher order modes excited by the intense beam bunches must be damped to avoid additional cryogenic loss and multi-bunch instabilities. To keep the beam stable, the impedance budget and the HOM damping requirement are given. A double notch coaxial HOM coupler, which will be mounted on the beam pipe, is planned to extract the HOM power below the cut-off frequency of the beam pipe. This paper summarizes the RF design of the HOM coupler, tolerance analysis, thermal analysis as well as mechanical structures.

With a growing effort in research and development of an alternative material to bulk Nb for a superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity, it is important to have a cost effective method to benchmark new materials of choice. At Old Dominion University's Center for Accelerator Science, a cryogenic probe station (CPS) will be used to measure the response of superconductor samples under RF fields. The setup consists of a closed-cycle refrigerator for cooling a sample wafer to a cryogenic temperature, a superconducting magnet providing a field parallel to the sample, and DC probes in addition to RF probes. The RF probes will extract a quality factor from a sample patterned in a coplanar waveguide resonator structure on a 2' wafer. From the measured quality factor, the surface resistance and the penetration depth as a function of temperature and magnetic field will be calculated. This paper will discuss the design and measurement procedures of the current CPS setup.

The 352 MHz SOLEIL SRF systems consist in two cryomodules, each containing a pair of SC Nb/Cu cavities, cooled with LHe at 4K from a single 350 W cryogenic plant. In order to store 500 mA, a power of 575 kW and an accelerating voltage of 3-4 MV are required. The RF power is provided by 4 SSPA's delivering up to 180 kW each. The original cavity input power couplers, which are LEP-type antennas designed to handle up to 200 kW, are being replaced by upgraded versions, able to operate at 300 kW CW. This will open the possibility to operate at full beam current with only one active cryomodule. The SRF system operational experience over the past ten years as well as the different upgrades will be reported here.

The collaboration on superconducting electron Linac for rare ion beam facilities ARIEL (Advanced Rare Iso-topE Laboratory) [1-4] and ANURIB [5] (Advanced Na-tional facility for Unstable and Rare Isotope Beams) has resulted in production of a superconducting Injector Cryomodule (VECC ICM) at TRIUMF for VECC. The cryomodule design utilizes a unique box cryomodule with a top-loading cold mass. The hermetic unit consists of a niobium cavity which operating at 1.3GHz and connected with two symmetrically opposed couplers which can deliver 100kW RF power to the beam. Liquid helium supplied at 4.4 K is converted to superfluid helium-II through a cryogenic insert on board which includes 4 K phase separator, 4K/2K heat exchanger and Joule-Thompson valve. In 2016, the VECC ICM has been tested at TRIUMF and demonstrated 10.5 MeV acceleration. A summary of the VECC ICM commissioning are presented.

Pansophy is an Engineering Data Management System that provides a comprehensive solution for managing information in the production and testing of cryomodules. It is especially suited to supporting the Data & Quality Management Systems for large projects like LCLS-II. With extensive amounts of data collected for an individual project, data retrieval to facilitate feedback and enhancement of production and processing activities is a high priority. The priority shares importance with the needs of managing the project, including production status, NCR, and Quality Management reports. Recent Pansophy enhancements have been to Data and Quality management reports and statistical analysis. Such enhancements include a database driven menu system, extended MSWord macro and preprocessing of travelers, and an extensive reporting system. The reporting system allows managers and group leaders to quickly respond to the needs of the project in areas of cavity and cryomodule production, data collection, NCR, Quality Management and schedule. Extensions include integration with the SRF inventory system PRIMeS, allowing traceability from receiving of manufactured parts to final cryomodule product.

Jefferson Lab (JLab) is in collaboration with Fermi Na-tional Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) to build 18 cryomodules to install at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's tunnel as part of the Linac Coherent Light Source upgrade project (LCLS-II). Each LCLS-II cry-omodule hosts 8 superconducting niobium cavities that adopt the nitrogen doping technique, which aims to en-hance the cavity quality factor Qo to reduce the consumption of liquid helium used to cool down the cavities. It is known that the Qo of niobium cavities is affected by cavity surface magnetic field. Traditionally, magnetic shields made of high magnetic permeability mu-metals are employed as a passive shielding of the ambient magnetic fluxes. During the LCLS-II cryomodule development, magnetic hygiene control that includes magnetic shielding and demagnetization of parts and the whole-machine is implemented. JLab and Fermilab worked closely on developing magnetic hygiene control procedures, identifying relevant tools, investigating causes of magnetization, magnetic field monitoring, etc. This paper focuses on JLab's experiences with LCLS-II cryomodule magnetic hygiene control during its fabrication.

A new Injector Cryomodule (INJ CM) aimed to replace the existing Quarter Cryomodule in the CEBAF tunnel has been developed at Jefferson Lab (JLab). It is sched-uled to be first tested in the Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) for module performance then the Upgraded Injector Test Facility (UITF) with electron beam. This new cryomodule, hosting a 2-cell and 7-cell cavity, is designed to boost the electron energy from 200 keV to 5 MeV and permit 380 uA - 1.0 mA of beam current. The 2-cell cavity is a new design whereas the 7-cell cavity is refurbished from a low loss cavity from the retired JLab Renascence Cryomodule. The INJ CM adopts quite a few designs from the JLab 12 GeV Upgrade Cryomodule (C100). Examples of this include having the cold mass hung from a spaceframe structure by use of axial and transverse Nitronic rods, cavities to be tuned by scissor-jack style tuners and the end cans are actually modified from C100 style end cans. However, this new INJ CM is not a quarter of the C100 Cryomodule. This paper focuses on the major design features, fabrication and alignment process and testing of the module and its components.

The LCLS-II cryomodule construction program leverages the mature XFEL cryomodule design to produce technologically sophisticated cryomodules with a minimum of R&D according to an accelerated manufacturing schedule. Jlab, as one of the partner labs, is producing 18 cryomodules for LCLS-II. To meet the quality and schedule demands of LCLS-II, many upgrades to the JLAB cryomodule assembly infrastructure and techniques have been made. JLab has installed a new cleanroom for string assembly and instituted new protocols to minimize particulate transfer into the cavities during the cryomodule construction process. JLab has also instituted a set of magnetic hygiene protocols to be used during the assembly process to minimize magnetic field impingement on the finished cavity structure. The goal has been to have gradients, both maximum and field emission onset, that do not degrade between the cavity vertical test and final cryomodule qualification, while maximizing the Q0 of each finished cavity. Results from the prototype cryomodule assembly are presented.

The CEBAF cryomodule rework program has been a successful tool to recover and maintain the energy reach of the original baseline 6 GeV accelerator. The weakest original modules with eight five-cell cavities assembled in four 'pairs', with a specification when new of 20 MV per cryomodule (5 MV/m), are disassembled, re-cleaned with modern techniques and re-qualified to at least 50 MV (12.5 MV/m), (leading to the acronym 'C50'). The cost per recovered MV is much less than building new modules. However over time the stock of weak modules is being used up and the voltage gain per rework cycle is diminishing. In an attempt to increase the gain per cycle it is proposed to rework the cavities by replacing the original accelerating cells with new ones of an improved shape and better material. The original CEBAF HOM and FPC end groups are retained. The goal is to achieve up to 75 MV (18.75 MV/m) for the reworked module ('C75'). We report on the fabrication experience and test results of the first trial pair, containing two such reworked cavities.

To increase the real estate gradient in the eRHIC electron accelerator waveguide HOM couplers are being considered. These significantly reduce the length of individual cavities and address inter-cavity trapped modes, allowing for an increased number of cavities per cryomodule, which would increase the real estate gradient. The choice of waveguide went to a dual ridge waveguide due to a smaller size compared to rectangular waveguides. The waveguide termination, to convert the RF energy into thermal energy, is a custom designed load based on a silicon carbide dielectric that is already being used in beamline absorbers. Simulations of the RF properties of the load are presented as well as first measurements on a prototype.

In an accelerator cavity, Higher Order Modes (HOM) are generated by the current of the beam. The HOM power can reach tens of kilowatts in a high current accelerator, depending on the details of the beam and cavity design. In this report, we propose a novel RF harvesting system to recover the HOM power into DC power which can further used for various purposes such as driving a solid state or klystron RF amplifier to supply fundamental RF power at other frequencies, charge batteries etc. The efficiency would be a product of the energy recovery and regeneration efficiencies, where the state of art is 90%. The proposed HOM power recycling system contains a multiple band harmonic RF coupler, broadband RF antenna system, a high power rectifier diode circuit and a DC load.

A single-window coaxial coupler at warm has been designed for high intensity heavy-ion accelerator. The coupler is designed to handle 100 kW CW power of 325 MHz and is currently being fabricated. T-bend transition and doorknob have been taken into account. The length of the T-bend short circuit is sensitive to S parameters and contributes to the online adjustment of VSWR in RF conditioning. The doorknob type is adopted to realize the transition from a half-height WR 2300 waveguide to a coaxial line ended with a coupling antenna. This paper describes the RF design, thermal stress and heat load analysis of the coupler as well as multipacting simula-tions.

Purity of thin copper plating using in input power couplers for superconducting cavities is one of important characteristics for considering thermal losses at low temperature. Various samples of thin copper plating on stainless sheets was fabricated by three companies with their own plating techniques. The RRR values of the samples with different thickness of copper plating were compared in the condition before and after heat treatment at 800oC in a brazing furnace. Deterioration of the RRR was observed in all of samples after heat treatment. The results of the RRR measurements and sample analysis of impurities will be reported in this paper.

Higher Order Modes (HOM) absorbers for superconducting cavities have been developing at TOSHIBA in collaboration with High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) since 2015. Prototype HOM absorbers for 1.3 GHz 9-cell superconducting cavity were fabricated. An AlN lossy dielectrics cylinder was brazed with a copper cylinder, and the cool-down tests by nitrogen gas was carried out. Copper cylinders and SUS flanges were joined by electron beam welding to fabricate a whole prototype HOM absorber. Fabrication process of the prototype HOM absorber will be presented in this paper.

Moreover, from the view point of the cost reduction for the ILC, another type of power couplers with TiN coating-free ceramic were also fabricated and high-power-tested by the collaboration between CERN and KEK. In this paper, the detailed results for the both power couplers will be presented.

High power, low emittance electron beams require superconducting RF photoinjectors, typically made of pure Nb, and a superconducting photocathode is desired. However, superconductivity and high photocathode quantum efficiency (QE) are not compatible, e.g. QE for pure Nb is only 10-5 at 260 nm wavelength. Here is presented the current status of the development of hybrid superconducting photocathodes by the deposition of thin films of a high QE metal or semiconductor on Nb. Nb plugs coated with 10-100 nm of Mg have been tested for adhesion and dark current under RF fields as high as 60MV/m. QE measurements show significant enhancements over Nb. In another test, ultra thin films of the high QE material Cs2Te deposited on Nb are reported. Using the standard deposition procedure, QE ~12% is found for films ~ 200Å. As the thickness is reduced QE maintains a high value ~ 6% for films as thin as 2.0 nm. These results are quite promising for future superconducting photocathodes.

The recent development of semiconductor technology has proved that solid-state RF amplifier is a quite effective alternative high power RF source for numerous accelerator applications. To develop a high power SSPA system, high power combiner is required to combine the RF power from a lot of solid-state RF module. The parallel plate RF power combiner, which is designed to combine various high power modules, is developed for RAON(Rare the rare isotope accelerator complex for on-line experiment). In this presentation, the status of developed 81.25 MHz 20 kW power combiner will be described.

The main ring cavities of CEPC project are two-cell el-liptical superconducting cavities operating at 650 MHz in CW mode. Each cavity equips with one high power input coupler and each coupler has to deliver at least 300 kW of CW RF power to the beam. A variable coupling from 105 to 2·106 is required to meet different operation modes. Considering the cavities working with high quali-ty factor up to 2·1010, the coupler assembled with cavity in class 10 clean room is strongly recommended to protect the cavity from contamination. Also, low cryogenic heat loss is one of the important issues for a large scale CW operation machine. Some of the above requirements should be compromise. Therefore, it's a big challenge to design a high power input coupler fulfilling the above requirements simultaneously. A new coupler that employs 75 Ω coaxial line sections, a planar ceramic disk win-dow, a coaxial to waveguide transition and a coupling adjusting actuator has been designed. In this paper, the RF design, thermal stress analysis and preliminary me-chanical design of the coupler are presented.

Twenty superconducting spoke cavities mounted in three cryomodules (CM1, CM2 and CM4) were in-stalled in the CADS, a test facility of 10 mA, 25 MeV CW proton linac. Each cavity was equipped with one coaxial type fundamental power coupler (FPC). Fatal window crack was observed during the test cryomod-ule (TCM) commissioning. A series of experiments were subsequently implemented and eventually at-tributed the window crack to the electron bombard-ment from cavity field emission (FE). Improvements covering the coupler cleaning and assembly proce-dure, the structure and position modifications were thus implemented, aiming to reduce the cavity contam-ination and avoid the window damaged by cavity FE electrons. This paper will describe how the coupler window damaged by cavity field emission and the improve-ments for cure. In addition, the performances of FPCs for CM1, CM2 and CM4 were compared.

For high current accelerator, the efficient higher-order mode (HOM) damping is always an important issue. HOM damper with microwave absorbing material is a key component for high power and broadband HOM damping application. To pursue the high damping efficiency, some ideal material with good microwave absorbing capacity is essential during the RF design and fabrication phase. Sometimes the selection and test of material is the first step and also a long step. This paper will present the recent work on HOM dampers for BEPCII 500MHz cavity and CEPC 650MHz cavity in IHEP.

RF power conditioning is an effective way to suppress multipacting in fundamental mode power couplers. Room temperature test-stand conditioning is an essential step that can be hardly circumvented before couplers are installed on SC cavities. Based on our original one, a new test-stand has been designed and being assembled at IMP. It can work as a multi-task platform conditioning different couplers, including couplers for HWR010 cavities and HWR015 cavities. It is also featured with the capacity to flexibly change β according to different specifications. A variety of conditioning modes have been incorporated into the LLRF system, including frequency sweeping mode, amplitude sweeping mode, arbitrary-duty-cycle mode and triangle-wave mode. In addition, smartly-conditioning has been achieved because of the accomplishment of smart interlocks and automatic reset in the system.

The front-end demo superconducting Linac for Chinese ADS (Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System) project is under construction at institute of modern physics(IMP) in Lanzhou. It will demonstrate the key technologies and the feasibility of a high power beam for the future national project " the Chinese Initiative Accelerator Driven Subcritical System(CIADS)". In this system, there are about 60 superconducting magnets, including solenoids, vertical correction and horizontal correction. They are utilized to focus and correct the proton beam. Quench protection of the superconducting magnets is key to reliability of the facility. A full digital power supply is developed and employed as excitation source for all of these superconducting magnets. In this paper, an FPGA-based quench protection plan implemented in the power supplies is mainly described. The commissioning results show that it is feasible.

In the European-XFEL superconducting linac, mechanical frequency tuners equipped with stepper motors and piezoelectric actuators provide cold tuning of each of the 768 1.3 GHz cavities. More than 820 complete tuning systems were fabricated and pre-assembled in industry, tested at several stages before and after assembly and successfully commissioned during cryo-module cold tests at AMTF (DESY). Quality control strategy adopted to preserve the well-assessed tuner reliability through such a large-scale industrial production is critically reviewed and the lessons learned are presented in this paper. The statistical analysis of the large set of data acquired up to the recent commissioning of the entire linac is then summarized.

The European-XFEL injector hosts a third-harmonic section composed by a module with eigth 3.9 GHz cavities equipped with a coaxial frequency tuner inspired by INFN-LASA Blade Tuner design. The 3.9 GHz tuning system met specifications during all the injector runs in 2016 up to the recent commissioning of the entire linac; it matched the required tuning range and frequency sensitivity although higher than expected cavity detuning was experienced during pressure transients in the cryogenic system. An analysis of all collected experimental data is reported in this paper together with the strategy developed to provide a sound and effective retuning routine to the control room operator.

The LUCRECE project aims at developing an elementary RF system (cavity, power source, LLRF and controls) suitable for continuous (CW) operation at 1.3 GHz. This effort is made in the framework of the advanced and compact FEL project LUNEX5 (free electron Laser Using a New accelerator for the Exploitation of X-ray radiation of 5th generation), using superconducting linac technology for high repetition rate and multi-user operation (http://www.lunex5.com). In this context, based on its large experience on coupler design and RF conditioning, LAL Laboratory is in charge of the design and the fabrication of RF couplers that could operate at up to 15-20 kW in CW mode. For this purpose, couplers based on CORNELL 65kW CW couplers (RF power couplers for the Cornell ERL injector) are under consideration and will be adapted to the LUCRECE needs. Electromagnetic simulations and associated thermal heating will be discussed. Methods to decrease the thermal impact will be considered.

As part of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project, 16 crab cavities are to be installed in the LHC in 2025. The two crab cavity designs are the Double Quarter Wave (DQW) and Radio Frequency Dipole (RFD). Preliminary beam tests in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) are planned for both cavity types, with the DQW scheduled for testing in 2018. In reference to to Higher Order Mode (HOM) damping, the DQW has three identical on-cell HOM couplers. These HOM couplers provide a band-stop response at the frequency of the fundamental mode and act as a transmission path for the cavity HOMs. For the SPS cavity design, several geometric constraints exist. These give rise to dimensional limitations which in-turn impose limitations on the RF performance of the HOM couplers. As such, for the LHC assembly, the HOM coupler design is re-visited to take into account the relaxed geometric limitations, hence allowing the feasibility of an increased RF performance to be investigated. In addition to the RF performance, several geometric alterations were incorporated to ease manufacturing processes, tolerances and costs.

The concept of micro-pulse electron gun(MPG) was proposed decades ago. It can provide electron beam with high current, short pulse and low emittance. But it is still not put into practical use as electron source because of its unsteady operating state. This paper presents an experimental result of the steady running of MPG which can operate stably for more than ten hours. The energy spread of the electron beam is also measured, the peak is located at near 20eV and half width is less than 15eV .

X-ray is now widely used in many areas of physics, biology, chemistry and materials. And how to achieve emission, monochrome, and focusing of x-ray is of great significance to study. Micro-pulse electron gun (MPG) is a new type of electron source, with characteristics of high repetition frequency, short-pulse and low cost. Generating x-ray with better monochromaticity is one of the potential applications of MPG. And a preliminary scheme of X-ray based on MPG is proposed in this paper. The scheme is designed by comparing different anode materials and the thickness of filters. The simulation results based on the software MCNP5 show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the monotonicity of the generated X-rays.

The SaTHoRI test stand (Satellite de Tests Horizontal des Résonateurs IFMIF) aims to characterize a jacketed and fully dressed cavity with its coupler and tuner. A dedicated test cryostat has been manufactured and is connected to an existing horizontal test cryostat which provides the cryogenic coolant. A RF source ' provided by the IFMIF collaboration, one of the four RF sources which will be used for the cryomodule at Rokkasho ' has been installed and commissioned at CEA. This paper describes the test stand and presents the first results.

All components installed to the European XFEL cavity string modules underwent an intensive inspection and quality control before acceptance for installation to cavities or modules. Even though some RF feed throughs for HOM coupler- and Pick Up antennas showed leaks at the ceramic insulation after module test at 2 K. Due to time restriction and continuity of production the exchange of these parts needed to be done without reentering the cleanroom. Successful repair of these modules took place by setting up a local cleanroom onto the cavity string. In collaboration with Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), a cavity string for the ELBE project was assembled at DESY and transported to HZDR for installation to the vacuum vessel. A spare module with 3.9 GHz Resonators for the European XFEL was set up at DESY and will be tested and qualified for the European XFEL. Due to delay in delivery of the power couplers, four power couplers were installed after string assembly.

To guarantee optimum performance, the crab cavities for the high-luminosity upgrade of CERN's LHC need to be shielded from external magnetic fields. Consequently, they will be enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding, of which the inner is immersed in superfluid helium at 2 K. A Ni-based high-permeability material with a tailored composition and a designated heat treatment is applied. Its magnetic properties at cryogenic temperature are however not yet fully assessed. Especially the effect of deformation on magnetic properties has not been thoroughly investigated, however strain effects may have severe consequences. A magnetic measurement set-up has been developed, and the magnetic permeability at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures is evaluated, showing that the maximum relative permeability at 4 K exceeds the design criteria of 100, 000. Measurements of the magnetic permeability after introduction of uniaxial plastic deformation between 0% and 3% are conducted by means of an Epstein frame. Results show that deformation induces significant decrease of the magnetic performance, underlining that particular care must be taken during all stages of handling and operation.

In the framework of the High-Gradient R\&D program at CERN a cryomodule, consisting of four superconducting 5-cell cavities, has been designed. In order to reduce flux trapping in the surface of the superconductor and to minimize Q degradation during a quench, highly effective magnetic shielding is needed. The solution proposed includes cold and warm passive shielding enhanced by four compensating coils. In this paper the magneto-static simulation results are presented illustrating different design considerations that led to a final design. Finally the shielding ability of the vacuum vessel is investigated experimentally through ambient magnetic field measurements.

The cw - Linac - demonstrator is a prototype of the first section of the proposed cw-LINAC@GSI, comprising a superconducting CH-cavity embedded by two superconducting solenoids. The sc CH-structure is the key component and offers a variety of research and development. The beam focusing solenoids provide maximum fields of 9.3 T at an overall length of 380 mm and a free beam aperture of 30 mm. The magnetic induction at the fringe is minimized to 50 mT at the inner NbTi-surface of the neighboring cavity. The fabrication of the key components is finished, as well as the cold performance testing of the RF cavity. The cryostat is ready for assembling and the test environment is completely prepared. After successful testing of the RF-Power coupler, the components will be assembled to the suspended frame under cleanroom conditions. Alignment, assembly, under cleanroom condition issues will be presented.

Precise alignment of accelerator cavities is important in realizing a low emittance beam. Especially in the cases of superconducting cavities installed in a cryomodule, it is difficult to mechanically measure the position of the cavities. By measuring higher-order-modes (HOM) excited by a beam, the electrical center of the cavities can be estimated. We have developed a HOM measurement system for the injector superconducting accelerator cavities of KEK ERL test accelerator (cERL).Comparing the HOM signals of the three independent cavities in the cryomodule, we estimated the relative positioning errors of the three cavities.

Injector cryomodule for cERL consists of three 2-cell cavities equipped with double-feeds input couplers, five antenna-type HOM couplers and a slide-jack tuner with two piezo actuators. After cryomodule assembly and first cool-down tests in 2012, the cERL injector cryomodule has been stably operated with beam for four years. Gradual increases of x-ray radiation levels due to field emission were observed during long term beam operation. High power pulsed RF conditioning as a cure method was applied in the cool-down period in 2016 and 2017, so that degraded cavity performances have almost recovered up to the original levels. Performance recovery status in three 2-cell cavities will be reported in this paper.

The Chinese Accelerator Driven Sub-critical system (C-ADS) uses a high energy proton beam to bombard the metal target and generate neutrons to deal with the nuclear waste. The Chinese ADS proton linear has two 0~10 MeV injectors and one 10~1500 MeV superconducting linac. Injector-I is studied by the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) under construction in the Beijing, China. The linear accelerator consists of two accelerating cryomodules operating at the temperature of 2 Kelvin. This paper describes the structure and thermal performances analysis of the cryomodule. The analysis takes into account all the main contributors (support posts, multilayer insulation, current leads, power couplers, and cavities) to the static and dynamic heat load at various cryogenic temperature levels. The thermal simulation analysis of the cryomodule is important theory foundation of optimization and commissioning.

A 100 MeV proton linac based on the radio frequency quadrupole and conventional drift tube linac has been operating for user service at KOMAC (Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex). A superconducting linac based on the half-wave resonator is studied in order to increase the proton energy from 100 MeV to 160 MeV for secondary particle generation such as neutron. A cryomodule and its cryogenics were designed. The operating temperature of the HWR is 2 K. One cryomodule contains four HWR cavities and it didn't have superconducting solenoid because a doublet lattice using normal conducting magnet was considered as focusing elements. A thermal design was conducted and the structure was designed based on the existing well proven technologies. The results of the design on the cryomodule and cryogenics for KOMAC HWR are summarized and discussed in the conference.

Compact SRF Crab Cavities are integral to the HL-LHC upgrade. This paper details the design of support structures within the SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) Crab Cavity Cryomodule. For ease of alignment each cavity is supported with the mechanical tuner and RF Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) via a common support plate. To reduce heat leak and remove bellows in the FPC it was determined that this would be the fixed support for the cavity (V. Parma, 2013). In addition, novel flexural blades were designed to give increased stiffness yet allow for thermal contraction of the cavity towards the fixed point of the FPC. This approach was superior when compared via simulation to several alternative techniques. A detailed simulation model was used for optimisation of directional stiffness, identification of vibration modes and minimising thermal stresses. A transmission matrix was developed in MS Excel to assess modal deflection for given ground vibration conditions. The spreadsheet gives an instantaneous yet comparable result to time consuming random vibration FE Analyses. The final engineering design of the supporting system is now complete and will also be described in this paper.

The Cryomodules (CM) for the Linear Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) will be shipped to SLAC (Menlo Park, California) from JLab (Newport News, Virginia) and FNAL (Batavia, Illinois). A transportation system has been designed and built to safely transport the CMs over the road. It uses an array of helical isolator springs to attenuate shocks on the CM to below 1.5g in all directions. The system rides on trailers equipped with Air-Ride suspension, which attenuates vibration loads. The prototype LCLS-II CM (pCM) was driven 750 miles to test the transport system; shock loggers recorded the shock attenuation on the pCM and vacuum gauges were used to detect any compromises in beamline vacuum. Alignment measurements were taken before and after the trip to check whether cavity positions had shifted beyond the ± 0.2mm spec. Passband frequencies and cavity gradients were measured at 2K at the Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) at JLab to identify any degradation of CM performance after transportation. The transport system was found to have safely carried the CM and is cleared to begin shipments from JLab and FNAL to SLAC.

An Accelerated Life Test (ALT) of the Phytron stepper motor used in the LCLS-II cavity tuner has been conducted at JLab. Since the motor will reside inside the cryomodule, any failure would lead to a very costly and arduous repair. As such, the motor was tested for the equivalent of 30 lifetimes before being approved for use in the production cryomodules. The 9-cell LCLS-II cavity is simulated by disc springs with an equivalent spring constant. Plots of the motor position vs. tuner position ' measured via an installed linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) ' are used to measure motor motion. The titanium spindle was inspected for loss of lubrication. The motor passed the ALT, and is set to be installed in the LCLS-II cryomodules.

96 accelerating modules with 768 TESLA/European-XFEL type superconducting cavities were installed in the European XFEL LINAC tunnel (XTL) in the fall 2016. Warm conditioning of the RF system - High/Low Level RF System and main input couplers - begun even before finishing the accelerator installation works. All modules were conditioned and tested prior to the installation in the tunnel in the AMTF test stand at DESY. Nevertheless, due to some repair activities on warm input coupler parts, warm conditioning was needed on a few modules/couplers. Cooling down to 2K begun in December 2016 and was finished in January 2017. Since then cold conditioning and tests are running. Several cavities in a few modules did show the multipacting (MP) effects, mostly because a cavity vacuum was filled with a dry nitrogen for before mentioned repairs on couplers in some modules. Said MP effects were seen in AMTF as well. All MP effects were successfully conditioned until now. The warm/cold RF system conditioning and its results/experiences/limits are described and discussed.
