A wide range of experiments are being held at AREAL accelerator in the fields of materials science and life sci-ence by generating ultra-short 5 MeV electron beams. Beam parameter formation and stability preservation during the experiments are one of the key tasks of stable operation of the accelerator. Laser spot displacement on the photocathode could be one of the beam parameter distortion sources, which causes off-axis bunch travel also through the solenoid. The influences of laser spot horizontal displacement and the solenoid horizontal misalignment on the beam position at the experiment location are investigated separately via computer simulations. Using a laser spot mover and solenoid movers, an experiment has been carried out to compare simulation results with experiment.

Sirius is the new 4th generation storage ring based synchrotron light source built and operated by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). In this work, we report on the implementation at Sirius of a fast method for orbit response matrix (ORM) measurement which is based on sine-wave parallel excitation of orbit corrector magnets’ strength. This ‘‘AC method" has reduced the ORM measurement time from  ∼ 25 minutes to 2.5-3 minutes and displayed increased precision if compared to the standard serial measurement procedure. When used as input to the Linear Optics from Closed Orbits (LOCO) correction algorithm, the AC ORM yielded similar optics corrections with less aggressive quadrupoles strength changes.

Existing electron photogun facility at the CANDLE SRI currently can provide electron beam with the energy up to 5 MeV. The beam is being used as an irradiation source in the number of material science and life science experiments. Performed beam particle tracking simulations along with intensive application of the beam diagnostic instruments (bending magnet, YAG stations, Faraday cups) allow control of the experimental samples’ irradiation parameters, particularly exposure times for given dose as well as absorbed dose spatial distribution. Direct application of the electron beam for the irradiation experiments allows achievement of high absorbed dose. For the calculation of the irradiation parameters of the experimental samples’ particle transport simulation results should be combined with the beam current measurements by Faraday Cup (FC). Dose measurements and the comparison with numerical simulations using various initial parameters (Transverse size, divergence and energy spread) permit to pin down their actual values.

The SOLEIL synchrotron has entered its Technical Design Report (TDR) phase for the upgrade of its storage ring to a fourth generation synchrotron light source. Verification of the equipment specifications (alignment, magnets, power supplies, BPMs), and the methodology for optics corrections are critical in order to ensure the feasibility of rapid commissioning restoring full performance for daily operations. The end-to-end simulation, from beam threading in the first turns to beam storage and stacking, should be handled with a comprehensive model close to the actual commissioning procedure, taking into account all practical steps. During 2021 and 2022, the CDR lattice has undergone significant modifications in response to additional constraints. In this paper, we present an update of the robustness studies for the TDR baseline lattice.

The ESRF-EBS is the first 4th generation source making use of the Hybrid Multi-Bend Achromat (HMBA) lattice cell, reaching an equilibrium horizontal emittance of 140 pm.rad in user mode (insertion devices (ID) gaps open). The injection in the storage ring (SR) is conducted with a short booster, operated off-energy. The RF frequency is increased compared to the nominal one to put the beam on a dispersive orbit, thus going off-axis in quadrupoles. The induced dipolar feed down effects reduce the booster horizontal emittance. The same strategy is extended to the ESRF-EBS SR, for an expected emittance reduction of about 20 pm.rad. A first approach shifts the RF frequency by +300 Hz to operate at -1% energy offset. Optimal quadrupole and sextupole settings are defined for this off-energy operation based on simulations. The settings are then tested in the SR in terms of dynamic aperture and injection efficiency.

Several high-energy synchrotron facilities adopted the Hybrid Multi-Bend Achromat scheme (HMBA) developed at and for the ESRF-EBS [LATTICE]. The considered lattice has been developed for a generic 6 GeV storage ring (SR) of 1100m circumference. It includes a short bending (SB) magnet at the center of the cell, and achieves a  ∼ §I{70}{πco\metre\radian} equilibrium horizontal emittance. The optics of such SR are modified introducing reverse bending magnets to further reduce the natural horizontal emittance to §I{53}{πco\metre\radian}. The impact of such modification on dynamic aperture and lifetime is assessed and optimized.

The EBS 6 GeV electron storage ring recently commissioned at ESRF, in Grenoble, France, is still operated using the old injector hardware. It is now one of the limiting factor of the facility. The large horizontal emittance of the booster beam affects injection efficiency, preventing from reaching 100% transfer efficiency between the 299.8 m long booster and the storage ring. Different lattice modifications going from minor optics changes to full machine renewal are considered . In this paper we will discuss different options of a "light" upgrade of the FODO lattice, keeping the RF system, vacuum chamber, power supplies, and most of the magnets. The upgrade then consists in creating a few new quadrupole families in the straight section vicinity and remove them from the main QF/QD families.

Lattice development efforts for the 2.5GeV, low emittance successor of BESSY II, are ongoing at HZB for 2 years. The basic choice of a multi-bend achromat lattice is indispensable due to the emittance goal of 100pm, required to generate diffraction limited radiation up to 1keV. Hard boundary conditions for the design are a reasonably short circumference of ~350m due to the accessible construction properties in vicinity to Bessy II and 16 super-periods to not step behind the number of existing experimental stations. Additionally, the Pysikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt, the long-term partner of HZB, requests homogeneous dipoles as a calculable and traceable source of radiation for metrology applications. The configuration of the two building blocks of MBA lattices - unit cell and dispersion suppression cell - has been thoroughly studied from basic principles. It was found that gradient free bending dipoles are the better choice for the BESSY III lattice, opposite to the concepts of comparable projects. This work summarizes and explains the findings of our investigations.

The GLC algorithm allows the construction of efficient transfer lines with defined imaging properties using a minimum number of quadrupole elements. This work describes a generalization of this algorithm to make it applicable to the use of arbitrary beam optical elements. This includes an extension to longitudinal phase space.

Positron beams would provide new and meaningful probes for the experimental program at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), including but not limited to future hadronic physics and dark matter experiments. Critical requirements involve generating positron beams with a high degree of spin polarization, sufficient intensity and a continuous-wave (CW) bunch train compatible with acceleration to 12 GeV at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). To address these requirements, a polarized positron injector based upon the bremsstrahlung of an intense CW spin polarized electron beam is considered*. First a polarized electron beam line provides >1 mA of polarized electrons at ~120 MeV to a high-power target for positron production. Next, a second beam line collects, shapes and aligns the spin of positrons for users. Finally, the positron beam is matched into the CEBAF acceptance for acceleration and transport to the end stations with energies up to 12 GeV. An optimized layout to provide positrons beams with intensity >100 nA (polarized) or intensity >3 µA (unpolarized) will be discussed in this poster.

Beam optics matching is a daily routine in the operation of an X-ray free-electron laser facility. Usually, linear optics is employed to conduct the beam matching in the control room. However, the collective effects like space charge dominate the electron bunch in the low-energy region which decreases the accuracy of the existing tool. Therefore, we proposed a scheme to construct a surrogate model with nonlinear optics and collective effects to speed up the optics matching in the European XFEL injector section. This model also facilitates further research on beam dynamics for the space-charge dominated beam.

Optics of a Recirculating Beamline for MESA

The Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) is an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) facility under construction at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz. It provides the opportunity for precision physics experiments with a 1 mA c.w. electron beam in its initial phase. In this phase experiments with unpolarised, high-density 1019 atoms per cm2 gas jet targets are foreseen at the Mainz Gas Internal Target Experiment (MAGIX). To allow experiments with thin polarised gas targets with sufficiently high interaction rates in a later phase, the beam current must be increased to up to 100 mA, which would pose significant challenges to the existing ERL machine. Thus, it is proposed here to use MESA in pulsed operation with a repetition rate of several kHz to fill a recirculating beamline, providing a quasi c.w. beam current to a thin gas target. The optics necessary for this recirculating beamline are presented here.

In order to study the remaining open questions concerning CP violation and neutrino mass hierarchy, as well as to search for physics beyond the Standard Model, future experiments require precise measurements of the neutrino interaction cross-sections in the GeV/c regime. The absence of a precise knowledge of the neutrino flux currently limits this measurement to a 10-20% uncertainty level. The ENUBET project is proposing a novel facility, capable of constraining the neutrino flux normalization through the precise monitoring of kaon decay products in an instrumented decay tunnel. The collaboration has conducted numerous studies using a beam-line with a central Kaon momentum of 8.5 GeV/c and a ±10% momentum spread. We present here the design of a new beam-line, broadening the range of Kaons to include momenta of 4, 6, and 8.5 GeV/c, thus allowing ENUBET to explore cross-sections over a much larger energy range. In this contribution, we discuss the status of this design, the optimization studies performed, the early results, and the expected performance in terms of kaon and neutrino rates. We also present the first estimations of the background expected to be seen by the experiment.

ACTIS (Arc Compressor Test In a Synchrotron) is an experiment aimed to demonstrate the reliability of arc compressors as lattices capable to increase peak current and brightness of an electron beam as it is bent at large angles. This kind of devices has been proposed at theoretical level in several works over the past decades and could be the key to achieve compact and sustainable Free Electron Lasers in the near future. The experiment has been developed since 2019 in the joint effort between INFN, Solaris National Synchrotron Radiation Center and Elettra - S.T. S.C.p.A. The experiment will take place at Solaris (Kraków). Solaris is a synchrotron whose ring is injected by a 550 MeV linac that will be used to prepare the beam with a proper chirp. ACTIS involves also the commissioning of two beam length detectors to be installed downstream of the linac and of the first ring lap. In addition, the low energy model of the machine was built to identify the optimal working point for the experiment and to foresee the longitudinal profile of the beam that will be measured. In this work we present the experiment and report first results obtained in the study phase.

The storage ring lattice of SPring-8-II has been under optimization towards a low emittance of around 50 pmrad, which was initially set at 150 pmrad*. The optimization concept is based on the effective use of extra-radiation damping from damping wigglers installed in the four long straight sections each 30 m long in length. For this purpose, we have been re-optimizing the linear and nonlinear optics so as to reduce the radiation loss from the bending magnets. In parallel, since the emittance variation due to the gap change of the IDs can be an obstacle for conducting precise experiments, we are investigating a new passive method to suppress the emittance variation without any feedback system. In the paper, we report on these details.

Radia 3D magnetostatics code has been used for the design of insertion devices for light sources over more than two decades. The code uses the magnetization integral approach that is efficient for solving permanent magnet and hybrid magnet structures. The initial version of the Radia code was sequential, its core written in C++ and interface in the Mathematica language. This paper describes a new Python-interfaced parallel version of Radia and its applications. The parallelization of the code was implemented on C++ level, following a hybrid approach. Semi-analytical calculations of interaction matrix elements and resultant magnetic fields were parallelized using the Message Passing Interface, whereas the parallelization of the "relaxation" procedure (solving for magnetizations in volumes created by subdivision) was executed using a shared memory method based on C++ multithreading. The parallel performance results are encouraging, particularly for magnetic field calculation post relaxation where a ~600 speedup with respect to sequential execution was obtained. The new parallel Radia version facilitates designs of insertion devices and lattice magnets for novel particle accelerators.

This work presents a design study of a 200 MeV electron linear accelerator consisting of an electron gun, bunchers, and accelerator structures. We aimed to design the linac with low emittance and low energy spread. A coasting beam from a thermionic electron gun is bunched using a series of buncher cavities: sub-harmonic buncher (SHB), a pre-buncher (PB), and a Buncher. The bunched beam is then accelerated up to 200 MeV with 4 cascaded accelerating structures. The SHB was designed with one-cell standing wave structure for improving the bunching efficiency. The two types of the 500 MHz SHB were considered: elliptical and coupled-cavity linac types. We also investigated constant-gradient and constant-impedance types of 3 GHz multi-cell traveling wave resonators for following buncher cavities and accelerating structures. Depending on the type, geometries of each traveling wave structure (TWS) cavity were determined, and then the electromagnetic fields were calculated. RF powers and phases of each cavity along this linac system were optimized using beam dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the beam distributions in the transverse direction are adjusted using solenoid magnets in the lowenergy section as well as quad triplets in the high-energy section.

Electron beams with ultra-high dose rates (>40 Gy/s), which enable effective radiotherapy to act on deep-seated tumors in less than a second, can be generated by linear accelerators. To successfully achieve FLASH radiotherapy, we have performed the 50 MeV linear accelerator design studies. The designed electron accelerator consists of a thermionic electron gun, sub-harmonic buncher, buncher and 2.856 GHz traveling wave structure. In this report the design layout and particle tracking simulation results of the 50 MeV electron linac with high beam current are presented in detail.

The "frozen spin" method is based on the fact that at a certain parameters of the ring, the particle spin rotates with the frequency of the momentum, creating conditions for the continuous growth of the electric dipole moment signal. Since a straightforward implementation of the frozen spin regime at NICA is not possible, we suggest an alternative quasi-frozen spin approach concept. In this new regime, the spin oscillates about particle orbit with the spin phase advance pi*gamma*G/2, locally recovering the longitudinal orientation at the location of the electric-magnetic Wien filters in the straight sections. In the case of deuterons, thanks to the small magnetic anomaly G, the spin continuously oscillates relative to the direction of the momentum with a small amplitude of a few degrees and the expected EDM effect is reduced only by a few percent. In this paper, we study the spin-orbital motion with the aim of using the NICA collider to measure the EDM. We also comment on the potential of NICA as an axion antenna in both the quasi-frozen spin regime and beyond.

Ultrafast electron diffraction imposes stringent constraints on the full 6D brightness of the probe electron beam. The desired normalized emittance, often in the few-nanometer regime and below, renders the beam very sensitive to field aberrations and space charge effects. In this proceeding, we report the correction of normal quadrupole, skew quadrupole, and sextupole aberrations in the MEDUSA ultrafast electron micro-diffraction beamline and measurements of the subsequent emittance. This low emittance is enabled by alkali-antimonide photocathodes driven at the photoemission threshold. We demonstrate that the measured emittance is consistent with that of optimized simulations with these cathodes, indicating that low emittance beams from high quality photocathodes can be preserved and used in practical applications.

Photoemission properties (quantum efficiency, spectral response, and lifetime) of various GaN based photocathodes are summarized, including p-doped samples in its hexagonal phase, cubic GaN and a more exotic 2-D hole gas sample. The 2-D hole contains no dopant impurity but achieves high conductivity via polarization fields produced at the heterojunction of GaN and AlN. For efficient electron production, cesium is used to achieve Negative Electron Affinity.

In modern particle accelerators, the horizontal dispersion function is forced to zero at locations with instrumentation measuring the transverse beam distribution, in order to remove the dispersive contribution to the horizontal beam size. The design of the CERN Proton Synchrotron did not foresee such a zero-dispersion insertion, making it challenging to get a good precision on the beam size measurements. In this contribution, we present a new optics configuration, which allows to reach zero horizontal dispersion at the locations of different beam size measurement locations. This can be achieved by powering a set of trim quadrupoles, the so-called Low Energy Quadrupoles (LEQ). We investigate how the resulting optics perturbation affects beam parameters.

Preservation of the transverse emittances across the CERN accelerator chain is an important requirement for beams produced for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS), high brightness LHC-type beams are stored on a long flat bottom for up to 1.2 seconds. During this storage time, direct space charge effects may lead to resonance crossing and subsequent growth of the transverse emittances. Previous studies showed an important emittance increase when the PS working point is moved near integer tune values. Subsequent simulation studies confirmed that this observation is caused by an interplay of space charge effects and the optics beatings induced by the Low Energy Quadrupoles (LEQ). A new optics configuration using these quadrupoles to reduce the optics beating and the emittance growth was developed and experimentally validated. The results of simulation and experimental studies are presented in this contribution.

As the beam is injected and extracted from the CERN Proton Synchrotron, it passes through the fringing magnetic fields of the main bending units (MUs). In this study, tracking simulations using field maps created from a 3D magnetic model of the MUs are compared to beam based measurements made through the fast injection and slow extraction regions. The behaviour of the fringe field is characterised and its implementation in the MAD-X model of the machine is described.

A Muon collider can provide unique opportunities in high-energy physics as an energy frontier machine. However, a number of challenges have to be addressed during the design process primarily due to the short lifetime of muons. In this work, a lattice for a §I10{TeV} center-of-mass energy collider is presented. Some of the more important challenges faced are: the design of an interaction region with β* values of the order of a few millimeters and an adequate chromatic compensation without sacrificing the physical and dynamic aperture, the flexibility to control the momentum compaction factor and the radiation generated where neutrinos from muons decays reach the surface. These issues are addressed with the development of a new chromatic correction scheme, the extensive use of flexible momentum compaction factor cells and the efficient control of the optical parameters.

The measurement and control of linear transverse coupling is important for the operation of an accelerator. The calculation of the linear transverse coupling resonance driving terms (RDTs) ’1001 and ’1010 relies on the complex spectrum of the turn-by-turn motion. To obtain the complex signal, a reconstruction of the particle motion is needed. For this purpose, the signal of a second BPM with a suitable phase shift is usually used. In this work, we explore the possibility of including more BPMs in the reconstruction of the transverse momentum, which could reduce the effects of statistical errors and systematic uncertainties. This, in turn, could improve the precision and accuracy of the RDTs, which could be of great benefit for locations where an exact knowledge of the transverse coupling or other RDTs is important. We present the development of a new method to reconstruct the particle’s momentum that uses a statistical analysis of several nearby BPMs. The improved precision is demonstrated via simulations of LHC and HL-LHC lattices.

The High Intensity Muon Beams (HIMB) project at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) will provide muon intensities of the order of 1e10 muons/s for particle physics and material science experiments, two orders of magnitude higher than the state of the art, which is currently available also at PSI. In particle transport simulations for the HIMB, we use G4beamline with measured pi+ cross-sections and with variance reduction. We also use the codes COSY INFINITY, TRANSPORT, and TURTLE for some studies. We perform asynchronous Bayesian optimisation of the beamlines on a computing cluster using G4beamline and the optimisation package DeepHyper. We performed numerous studies for the design of the HIMB, and we produced various results, including the muon transmission, beam phase space, polarisation, and momentum spectrum.

In order to provide synchrotron light with higher photon energy and more brilliant synchrotron light than that of the existing Siam Photon Source (SPS) machine, the possibility of constructing the new 3 GeV SPS-II has been proposed. For SPS-II, the synchrotron source with in-tunnel booster is a good candidate. The booster synchrotron has been designed in order to accelerate an electron beam of 150 MeV to 3 GeV before extracted to storage ring. For a clean injection in top-up operation, the aim in the design of the booster is to achieve the electron beam with a small emittance less than 10 nm-rad and to obtain a large dynamic aperture. The energy ramping process and related effects during the energy ramp are discussed in this paper.

A portion of the Muon g-2 Storage Ring electric system, which provides vertical beam focusing, exhibited an unexpected time dependence that produced a characteristic evolution of the stored beam during Run-1 of the Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab (E989). A method to reconstruct the Run-1 electric guide fields has been developed, which is based on a numerical model of the muon storage ring and optimization algorithms supported by COSY INFINITY. This method takes beam profile measurements from the Muon g-2 straw tracking detectors as input, and it produces a full reconstruction of the time-dependent fields. The fields can then be used for the reproduction of detailed beam tracking simulations and the calculation of ring lattice parameters for acceptance studies and systematic error evaluations.

The Vertical Excursion Fixed Field Alternating Gradient Accelerator (VFFA) concept offers a number of advantages over existing accelerator archetypes, as discussed in previous works. However, the VFFA has nonplanar orbits by design and unavoidable transverse coupling. Hence, current understanding of the dynamics of this machine is limited; this paper presents some in-depth study of its behaviour using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

The DIAMOND-II lattice is based on the ESRF-EBS cell, with the centre dipole replaced by a (chromatic) mid-straight, and a -I transformer, higher order achromat (HOA) & dispersion bumps to control the nonlinear dynamics. The majority of insertion devices currently on operation in Diamond will be either retained or upgraded as part of the Diamond-II program, and the new mid straights allow the total number of ID beamlines to be increased from 28 to 36.Therefore, it is important to investigate how IDs will affect the emittance, energy spread and linear and nonlinear beam dynamics. The kickmap approach has been used to model all IDs, including APPLE-II and APPLE-II Knot with active shim wires. In this paper, the outcome of these investigations will be presented and discussed.

In particle accelerators, beam position monitors (BPMs) are used extensively as a non-intercepting diagnostic. Significant information about beam dynamics can often be extracted from BPM measurements and used to actively tune the accelerator. However, common measurement tools, such as measurements of kicked beams, may become more difficult when very strong nonlinearities are present or when data is very noisy. In this work, we examine the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) as a technique to extract measurements of the beam from simulated turn-by-turn BPM data. In particular, we show that VAEs may have the possibility to outperform other dimensionality reduction techniques that have historically been used to analyze such data. When the data collection period is limited, or the data is noisy, VAEs may offer significant advantages.

Iron-dominated superconducting magnets are one of the most popular and most used design choices for superconducting magnetic quadrupoles for accelerator systems. While the iron yoke and pole tips are economic and effective in shaping the field, the large amount of iron also leads to certain drawbacks, namely, unwanted harmonics from the sextupole correctors nested inside of the quadrupole. Additional problems include the nonlinear field profile present in the high-field regime engendered by the presence of steel, and the mechanical and cryogenic design challenges of the entire iron yoke being part of the cold mass. The presented work discusses these effects and challenges by comparing an iron-dominated quadrupole model to an equivalent coil-dominated quadrupole model. The comparison of their respective magnetic harmonics, integrated strength, multipole effects, and mechanical challenges demonstrates that the coil-dominated design is a more favorable choice for select accelerator systems.

Variations in strength of a sextupole magnet in a storage ring result in changes to the closed orbit, phase functions and tunes which depend on the position of the beam relative to the center of the sextupole and on the beam size. Such measurements have been carried out with 6 GeV positrons at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring. The initial analysis presented at IPAC21 has been extended to both transverse coordinates, introducing additional tune shifts and coupling kicks caused by skew quadrupole terms arising from the vertical position of the positron beam relative to the center of the sextupole. Variations of strength in each of the 76 sextupoles provide measurements of difference orbits, phase and coupling functions. An optimization procedure applied to these difference measurements determines the horizontal and vertical orbit kicks and the normal and skew quadrupole kicks corresponding to the the strength changes. Continuously monitored tune shifts during the sextupole strength scans provide a redundant, independent determination of the two quadrupole terms. Following the recognition that the calculated beam size is highly correlated with the calibration of the sextupole, a campaign was undertaken to obtain precise calibrations of the sextupoles and to measure their offsets relative to the reference orbit, which is defined by the quadrupole centers. We present the measured distributions of calibration correction factors and sextupole offsets together with the accuracy in their determination.

A method for searching for magnetic field noise has been developed using the CESR beam turn-by-turn data. The technique is tested using Monte-Carlo samples and turn-by-turn real data with induced noise in one of the CESR magnets. We estimate the analysis sensitivity for the noise sources slower than 4 kHz (or 100 CESR-turns) with the current CESR BPM system on the level of 1 microradian or 0.2 Gs×m field integral. In this work we report the observed noise sources and the improvements achieved by applying this technique. Long-term, several hours, beam stability analysis is also performed using the same method.

Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) is R&D facility to evaluate final focus technology for small beam required by ILC. The final focus beamline(ATF2) sets the goal to achieve 37 nm vertical beam size and 41 nm beam size had been demonstrated. Moreover, a significant intensity dependence on a nanometer beam size was observed and several studies of the wakefield had been conducted [*,**,***]. ATF2 is a proper beamline for wakefield studies with low emittance beam and nanometer resolution cavity BPMs and a nanometer beam size monitor. The simulation results were qualitatively cross-checked with experimental results and showed that the effects of some vacuum components and BPMs were significant. Further analysis of the wakefield will be done for flexible components (e.g. bellows). An upgrade of the ATF2 beamline is proposed by including minimization of the wakefield sources, to establish technologies for stable nanometer beam.

Experiments foreseen at FACET-II, including dielectric plasma wakefield acceleration and linear collider tests, call for electron beams with highly asymmetric transverse emittances - so called "flat beams". A canonical recipe for the generation of such beams is injecting a magnetized beam at a waist into an appropriately tuned skewed quadrupole triplet channel. However, due to the intense non-linear space-charge forces that dominate nC bunches, this method presents difficulties in maintaining the flatness. We proceed with generalized round-to-flat-beam (RTFB) transformation, which takes into account the non-negligible divergence of the beam at the channel entrance, using a quartet of skewed quadrupoles. Our analytical results are further optimized in ELEGANT and GPT simulation programs and applied to the case of the FACET-II beamline. Non-ideal cathode spot distributions obtained from recent FACET-II experiments are used for accurate numerical modeling. Tolerances to quadrupole strengths and alignment errors are also considered, with an eye towards developing hardware specifications.

In addition to the day-one primary Interaction Region (IR), the design of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) must support operation of a 2nd IR potentially added later. The 2nd IR is envisioned in an existing experimental hall at RHIC IP8, compatible with the same beam energy combinations as the 1st IR over the full center of mass energy range of ~20 GeV to ~140 GeV. The 2nd IR is designed to be complementary to the 1st IR. In particular, a secondary focus is added in the forward ion direction of the 2nd IR hadron beamline to optimize its capability in detecting particles with magnetic rigidities close to those of the ion beam. We provide the current design status of the 2nd IR in terms of parameters, magnet layout and beam dynamics.

The longitudinal and transverse emittance growth in hadron beams due to intra-beam scattering (IBS) and other heating sources deteriorate the luminosity in a collider. Hence, a strong hadron beam cooling is required to reduce and preserve the emittance. The cooling of high energy hadron beam is challenging. We propose a dual energy storage ring-based electron cooler that uses an electron beam to extract heat away from hadron beam in the cooler ring while the electron beam is cooled by synchrotron radiation damping in the high energy damping ring. In this paper, we present a design of a dual energy storage ring-based electron cooler. Finally, the cooling performance is simulated using Jefferson Lab Simulation Package for Electron Cooling (JSPEC) for proton beams at the top energy of 275 GeV for Electron-Ion Collider.

The beamline design of recirculating linacs requires special attention to avoid beam instabilities due to RF wakefields. A proposed high-energy, multi-pass energy recovery demonstration at CEBAF uses a low beam current. Stronger focusing at lower energies is necessary to avoid beam breakup(BBU) instabilities, even with this small beam current. The CEBAF linac optics optimization balances over-focusing at higher energies and beta excursions at lower energies. Using proper mathematical expressions, linac optics optimization can be achieved with evolutionary algorithms. Here, we present the optimization process of North Linac optics using multi-objective optimization.

Nb3Sn is a prospective material for future superconducting RF (SRF) accelerator cavities. The material can achieve higher quality factors, higher temperature operation and potentially higher accelerating gradients (Eacc 96 MV/m) compared to conventional niobium. In this work, we performed modeling of the Upgraded Injector Test Facility (UITF) at Jefferson Lab utilizing newly constructed Nb3Sn cavities. We studied the effects of the buncher cavity and varied the gun voltages from 200-500 keV. We have calibrated and optimized the SRF cavity gradients and phases for the Nb3Sn five-cell cavities energy gains with the framework of General Particle Tracer (GPT). Our calculations show the beam goes cleanly through the unit. There is full energy gain out of the second SRF cavity but not from the first SRF cavity due to non-relativistic phase shifts.

The Jefferson Lab KL experiment will run at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility with a much lower bunch repetition rate (7.80 or 15.59 MHz) than nominally used (249.5 or 499 MHz). While the proposed average current of 2.5 - 5.0 muA is relatively low compared to the maximum CEBAF current of approximately 180 muA, the corresponding bunch charge is atypically high for CEBAF injector operation. In this work, we investigated the evolution and transmission of low-rep-rate, high-bunch-charge (0.32 to 0.64 pC) beams through the CEBAF injector. Using the commercial software General Particle Tracer, we have simulated and analyzed the beam characteristics for both values of bunch charge. We performed these simulations with the existing injector using a 130 kV gun voltage. We have calculated and measured the transmission as a function of the photocathode laser spot size and pulse length. We report on the findings of these simulations and optimum parameters for operating the experiment.

Recirculating Linear Accelerators (RLAs) provide an efficient way of producing high-power, high-quality, continuous-wave hadron and lepton beams. However, their attractiveness had been limited by the cumbersomeness of multiple recirculating arcs and by the complexity of the spreader and recombiner regions. The latter problem sets one of the practical limitations on the maximum number of recirculations. We present an RLA design concept where the problem of multiple arcs is solved using the Fixed-Field Alternating gradient (FFA) design as in CBETA. The spreader/recombiner design is greatly simplified using an adiabatic matching approach. It allows for the spreader/recombiner function to be accomplished by a single beam line. The concept is applied to the designs of a high-power hadron accelerator being considered at ORNL and a CEBAF electron energy doubling project, FFA@CEBAF, being developed at Jefferson lab.

Alignment and mechanical-stability specifications are essential to the performance of low-emittance storage rings. Beam dynamics simulations are usually performed to establish these specifications. However, the simulation procedures and the input parameters related to magnet positions are not well established which leads to differences in the final specifications. In this paper we discuss important parameters of the mechanical/structural systems of the storage ring that impact on the alignment and stability specification. Following a detailed review of the specifications and simulation procedures adopted at several facilities we propose a procedure to be used for a low-emittance upgrade of NSLS-II.

For some synchrotron light source beamline applications, a round beam is preferable to a flat one. A conventional method of obtaining round beam in an electron storage ring is to shift its tune close to a linear difference resonance. The linearly coupled beam dynamics is analyzed with perturbation theories, which have certain limitations. In this paper, we adopt the Solution by LInear Matrices (SLIM) analysis to calculate exact beam sizes to design round beam lattices. The SLIM analysis can deal with a generally linearly coupled accelerator lattice. The effects of various coupling sources on beam emittances and sizes can be studied within a self-consistent frame. Both the on- and off-resonance schemes to obtain round beams are explained with examples. Commonly used radiator devices, such as planar wigglers and undulators, can be incorporated.

A data-driven chaos indicator concept is introduced to characterize the degree of chaos for nonlinear dynamical systems. The indicator is represented by the prediction accuracy of surrogate models established purely from data. It provides a metric for the predictability of nonlinear motions in a given system. When using the indicator to implement a tune-scan for a quadratic Henon map, the main resonances and their asymmetric stop-band widths can be identified. When applied to particle transportation in a storage ring, as particle motion becomes more chaotic, its surrogate model prediction accuracy decreases correspondingly. Therefore, the prediction accuracy, acting as a chaos indicator, can be used directly as the objective for nonlinear beam dynamics optimization. This method provides a different perspective on nonlinear beam dynamics and an efficient method for nonlinear lattice optimization. Applications in dynamic aperture optimization are demonstrated as real world examples.

Computation of space charge fields in accelerator simulations is one of the most challenging tasks. The algorithm proposed by Hockney and Eastwood is the fastest method for numerically solving Poisson equations with open boundaries and has been implemented in various accelerator simulation codes. Recently, Vico-Greengard-Ferrando proposed a new hybrid fast algorithm for computing volume potentials. The new algorithm is promising higher accuracy and faster error convergence than that of Hockney-Eastwood. This study presents the implementation of the Vico-Greengard-Ferrando solver in Synergia and shows a comparison of results with these Poisson solvers.

The electron Ion Collider (eIC) project* has been approved by the Department of Energy to be built at the site of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Part of the eIC accelerator complex and more specifically the Rapid Cycling Syncrotron (RCS) which accelerates the electron beam up to 18 GeV and the electron Storage Ring (eSR) which stores the electron beam bunces for collisions with the hadrons, will be built inside the tunnel of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)**. This paper provides information on the electromagnetic design of the septa magnets which will be employed to inject and extract the beam to and from the two synchrotrons used for the acceleration and storage of the electron beam bunches. The type of the septum is of induction type made o laminated iron and it is similar to the one described in ref.[3] The electromagnetic study is performed by the use of the transient module of the OPERA computer code***.

The bead-pull method is a commonly used electromagnetic field measurement technique exploited to tune a radiofrequency cavity to achieve design specifications. The frequency of a resonant cavity is perturbed by inserting a metallic or dielectric bead. For a given electromagnetic field, the amplitude of the perturbation depends only on the geometry of the perturbing object. Therefore, the calibration of the bead can be done in different resonant structures without loss of generality. In this paper, a method to perform an accurate calibration of the bead with electromagnetic simulations is proposed. Compared to the common practice of measuring a reference cavity, the flexibility given by the simulation method to study different bead shapes and sizes could be advantageous to optimize the measurement setup. A calibrated bead-pull setup allows to quantify the electric field and, therefore, the shunt impedance of the resonant modes of the cavity. As experimental benchmark, the beam coupling impedance measured with the calibrated bead-pull setup is compared with electromagnetic simulations.

In this paper, we build upon previous work of designing RF structures that support modes with tailored multipolar fields by applying the concept to negate the transverse multipoles in accelerating RF cavities caused by the incorporation of waveguide slots and tuning deformations. We outline a systematic method for designing structures that minimise these transverse multipoles and present analysis of simulations of two different minimisation designs.

The current designs of future electron-positron linear colliders incorporate large and complex damping rings to produce asymmetric beams for beamstrahlung mitigation at the interaction point. This paper presents the design of an damping-ring-free electron injector capable of delivering flat electron beams with phase-space partition comparable to the electron-beam parameters produced downstream of the damping ring in the proposed international linear collider (ILC) design. The performance of the proposed configuration, its sensitivity to jitter along with its impact on spin-polarization is discussed.

The Argonne Wakefield Accelerator group (AWA) has been using high Charge bunch-trains (>450 nC) for structure wakefield RF power generation and high power testing (100 s of MW) for many years. These experiments involve fast beam-tuning for high charge transmission through small aperture wakefield structures over a large range of charge levels. The success of these experiments depends on real-time, non-destructive, fast charge measurements with devices that are robust in the high-charge and high-powered RF environment. AWA uses Bergoz Integrating Charge Transformers (ICT) which are ideal for these critical charge measurements. The devices used, the method developed and its application are detailed.
