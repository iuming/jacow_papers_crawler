Along with the rapid development of nuclear power plants in China, treatment of the nuclear waste has become a crucial issue. The roadmap of the nuclear transmutation with accelerator driven subcritical system (ADS) towards its demo in 2032 is set up in China. This presentation should first review world-wide ADS development, status and challenge, and then focus on the Chinese ADS program, roadmap and key technology R&D.
