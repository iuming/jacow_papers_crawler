SuperKEKB is an upgraded accelerator from KEKB, aiming at a luminosity of 1034. It is currently in operation, setting new luminosity records. We have completely redesigned the final focus-magnet system to achieve the target luminosity as upgrading from KEKB to SuperKEKB. After the completion of the system, it started its practical operation in 2018 after measuring the magnetic field in IR. The operation is generally stable, but some troubles have occurred. One of them is a quench. Radiation related to stored beam deposit energy on the superconducting coil. The beam suggested fluctuations in the main quadrupole magnetic field, and measurements using the R & D machine have demonstrated this. In addition, we are seeking a plan to upgrade the QCS for the long shutdown in 2026.

High gradient quadrupole magnets are required on both sides of the interaction points in the proposed Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). There are three double aperture superconducting quadrupoles with a crossing angle between two aperture centerlines of 33 mrad. It is challenging to meet stringent design requirements, including limited space, magnetic field crosstalk between two apertures, magnetic field gradients up to 142 T/m, etc. In this paper, status of superconducting magnets in CEPC interaction region in the technical design stage is described. Magnetic design of superconducting quadrupole magnet with three kinds of quadrupole coil structures, including cos(2theta) coil, CCT coil, and Serpentine coil is presented and compared. In addition, the development status of a single aperture short model quadrupole magnet with a magnetic length of 0.5 m is presented.

BNL Direct Wind technology provides extensive flexibility for manufacturing a wide variety of superconducting magnets. Direct Wind, an extension of the technique used to make RHIC correctors, was first applied to the HERA-II and BEPC-II IR magnet upgrades and has undergone extensive subsequent development driven by new applications. Here we report on the historical development of Direct Wind and its use in some existing and future accelerator projects such as the ILC, SuperKEKB, FCC-ee and EIC.

Since the circumference of Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is very large and has a double ring lattice, the CEPC collider will use the dual aperture dipole and quadrupole magnets to save about 50% power. The dual aperture quadrupole magnets have opposite polarities in the two apertures. A 1 m long dual aperture quadrupole prototype is designed, fabricated and measured. The preliminary magnetic measurement results showed a large crosstalk effect in the two apertures, thus the magnetic center in X axis has a large shift. Then a modification of the iron is done to compensated the field crosstalk effect. The magnetic center shift decreased an order. The detailed process is illustrated in this paper.
