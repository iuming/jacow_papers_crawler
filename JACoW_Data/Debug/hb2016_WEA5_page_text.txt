The international Future Circular Collider (FCC) study is designing hadron, lepton and lepton-hadron colliders based on a new 100 km tunnel in the Geneva region. The main focus and ultimate goal of the study are high-luminosity proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV, using 16 T Nb3Sn dipole magnets. Specific FCC beam dynamics issues are related to the large circumference, the high brightness - made available by radiation damping -, the small geometric emittance, unprecedented collision energy and luminosity, the huge amount of energy stored in the beam, large synchrotron radiation power, plus the injection scenarios. In addition to the FCC-hh proper, also a High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) is being explored, using the FCC-hh magnet technology in the existing LHC tunnel, which can yield a centre-of-mass energy around 25 TeV.

The paper describes studies of high intensity proton accelerators for a next-generation source of short-pulse spallation neutrons. Along with conventional designs using rapid cycling synchrotrons, the long-term nature of the project provides scope for novel accelerator designs and developing technological ideas. A range of FFAG options is under consideration for the main spallation driver. Theory and simulation in the UK are combined with experimental studies of FFAGs in Japan, and a small prototype FFAG ring is planned to go on the FETS injector at RAL for essential R&D. The paper covers the broad scope of the programme and details the success of the study to date.

Nonlinear Focusing in IOTA for Space-Charge Compensation and Landau Damping

In 1967 Edwin McMillan proposed the first stable nonlinear accelerator focusing system (Report UCRL-17795). Since then, there have been several additional theoretical proposals on how to implement a practical nonlinear accelerator focusing system, but none were ever tested experimentally. This presentation will describe several practical proposals to implement nonlinear focusing elements in the Fermilab IOTA ring. These nonlinear elements would employ magnetic fields and electron lenses to create a large betatron tune spread and may help increase beam intensities in present and future accelerators, by providing space-charge compensation and increasing Landau damping.

Two-plane Painting Injection in BRing of HIAF Project

HIAF-BRing is a high intensity heavy ion booster ring in which the particle number is designed up to 1.0·1011 (238U34+). In order to prevent the stored beam from being killed immediately by the electron-ion interaction (while accumulating with electron-cooling) and strong space charge effect, the incoming iLinac beam must be accumulated as fast as possible. The two-plane painting injection is consequently adopted. In this talk, the detailed mechanism of the two-plane painting injection is shown, the orbit design and simulation is performed, and the injection parameters are optimized according to the simulation results using PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorism.
