Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste is currently operating two light sources, Elettra, a third generation synchrotron, and FERMI, a free electron laser. Control systems are based on a number of diverse systems, such as VME-based front-end computers, small embedded systems, high performance rack-mount servers and control room workstations. Custom device drivers and hard real-time applications has been developed during the years, exploiting the technologies adopted such as RTAI and Adeos/Xenomai, which make a massive update demanding. Modern CI/CD tools are then not available for legacy platforms, and a custom tool, integrating git and a database back-end to build and deploy software components based on release tags has been developed.

With increasing popularity of Beckhoff devices in scientific projects, there is an increasing need for their devices to be integrated into EPICS control systems. Projects often want to use Beckhoff PLCs for applications that have to handle a large amount of signals with fast cycle times. So, how can we connect Beckhoff devices to EPICS control systems without sacrificing performance? Beckhoff offers multiple possibilities when it comes to interfacing with their PLCs or industrial PCs, such as modbus, OPC UA, or ADS protocols. While all of these could be used for the usual use cases, we believe that for more data intensive applications, ADS works best. For this reason, Cosylab developed an EPICS device support module that implements advanced ADS features, such as ADS sum commands, which provide fast read/write capabilities to your IOCs.

For the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), which is currently under construction, a new Control System is being developed and already used at major parts of the GSI facility. The central component for Settings Management within the FAIR Control System is based on CERN’s framework "LHC Software Architecture" (LSA) and enhanced by FAIR specific features. One of the most complex features is the control mechanism of storage ring operations, the so-called Storage Ring Mode. This operation mode allows to manipulate device settings while the beam is circulating in the ring. There are four different types of possible changes in the Storage Ring Mode: skipping, repetition, breakpoint and manipulation. The Storage Ring Mode was developed in late 2019 and first used with beam in 2020 at the existing heavy ion Storage Ring ESR at GSI. This contribution illustrates in detail how the Storage Ring Mode is implemented within LSA and other subsystems. It also shows how it is operated using the Expert Storage Ring Mode application.

The low-level RF (LLRF) system at the European XFEL, DESY, is of major importance for high-performant and reliable operation. Faults here can jeopardize the overall operation. Therefore, the trip event logger is currently developed, - a fault diagnosis tool to detect errors online, inform the operators and trigger automatic supervisory actions. Further goals are to provide information for a fault tree and event tree analysis as well as a database of labeled faultydata sets for offline analysis. The tool is based on the C++ framework ChimeraTK Application Core. With this close interconnection to the control system it is possible not only to monitor but also to intervene as it is of great importance for supervisory tasks. The core of the tool consists of fault analysis modules ranging from simple ones (e.g., limit checking) to advanced ones (model-based, machine learning, etc.). Within this poster the architecture and the implementation of the trip event logger are presented.

In this study we explore the optimization of laser pulse duration to obtain the shortest possible pulse. We do this by employing a feedback loop between a pulse shaper and pulse duration measurements. We apply to this problem several iterative algorithms including gradient descent, Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms, using a simulation of the actual laser represented via a semi-physical model of the laser based on the process of linear and nonlinear phase accumulation.

Guaranteeing that the X-Ray beam reaches the experimental station with optimal characteristics is a crucial task in a synchrotron beamline. One of the critical factors which can lead to beam degradation is the thermal drifts and the mechanical inertias present in the optical elements, such as a monochromator. This article shows a new functionality of the ALBA Electrometer (Em#), which ensures that the beamline receives the maximum possible beam intensity during the experiment. From the current reading of an ionization chamber and driving the piezo-actuator pitch of the monochromator, the Em# implements a Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm that detects the peak beam intensity while tracking it. This feature has been tested on NOTOS beamline and the preliminary results of the performance are shown in this paper.

The Electron Linac for beams with high Brilliance and low Emittance (ELBE) at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) is operated using the SCADA system WinCC by Siemens. The majority of ELBE systems is connected to WinCC via industrial Ethernet and proprietary S7 communication. However, in recent years there was a demand to provide a more open and platform independent access to ELBE machine data. The Industry 4.0 standard OPC UA has been chosen to implement such an interface. We will show how we use OPC UA as a common communication layer between industrial and scientific instruments as well as proprietary and open source control system software. Our solution makes use of commercially available hard- and software, namely Simatic STEP7, Simatic WinCC v7.x by Siemens and IBH Link UA by IBHsoftec. Combining these products we designed an OPC UA based user data interface, which features encrypted communication and access control from the control room via WinCC. It is available for internal use, e.g. for feedbacks, and external use, e.g to log ELBE data along with experiment data or to provide data to ELBE operators for machine optimizations.

The IT world is moving to the web and cloud. IC@MS is a web-based alarm management system. Every control system can face unexpected issues, which demand fast and precise reactions. As the control system starts to grow, it requires the involvement of more engineers to access the alarm list and focus on the most important ones. IC@MS allows the users to access the alarms fast, remotely via a web browser. According to current trends in IT, creating a web application turned out to be the most comfortable solution. IC@MS is the extension and web equivalent to the Panic GUI desktop application. There is no need to install it on the client’s computer. The access to the different functionalities can be restricted to the users provided just with appropriate roles. The web-based alarm management system provides a better user-friendly user interface for everyday use with Integration with Active Directory. Alarms can be easily added, edited, and managed from the web browser*. It has a Web API that can be used by 3rd party applications. The instance of IC@MS is available on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure clouds.

The particle accelerators hosted at the Institute for Beam Physics and Technology (IBPT) represent a complex infrastructure with a live control system interface, a data archive, measurement routines and storage and management of metadata, among other aspects. The ’IBPT Python tools’ were created to provide a unified interface to all aspects of the accelerator infrastructure for both short-term student projects and basic accelerator operations. Instead of creating another custom framework, these sets of tools focus on bridging the gap between well established libraries and our facility and accelerator specific needs. External and accelerator specific libraries are glued together to provide an interface in order to minimize the technical knowledge of the accelerator infrastructure needed by the end user. Well established software engineering workflows of continuous integration were implemented to provide automatic testing, packaging, API documentation and release management. This paper discusses the general motivation and approach taken to create and maintain such a set of Python modules.
