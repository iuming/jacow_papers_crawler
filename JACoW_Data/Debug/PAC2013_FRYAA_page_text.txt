FRYAA1
SNS Performance and the Next Generation of High Power Accelerators
1443


 

J. Galambos
                       ORNL, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA

 


 

Funding: ORNL is managed by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 for the U.S. Department of Energy.
The SNS accelerator at ORNL has been operating near the MW level for several years now. This presentation will discuss the successes and challenges, new insight gained and lessons learned with regard to the operation of a modern high power accelerator. In particular, issues with the RFQ, the target and the superconducting RF linac will be discussed.

The European Spallation Neutron Source project includes a 5 MW superconducting linac, and aims for initial operation at 1.5 MW in 2019 with 5 MW capacity installed for 2023. Design considerations including the work done to find the minimum cost for preserved beam quality at low beam loss will be discussed. This will include a discussions on lessons learnt from SNS regarding e.g. superconducting RF performance and RF power sources. The design and construction plans and status will be described including a description of how in-kind and contingency will be managed.
