Machine and personnel safety are increasingly important for high power hadron linacs as involved beam power increases. Design requirements and characteristic features of machine protection system and personnel protection system for operating and proposed high power hadron linacs, such as J-PARC, SNS, FRIB, ESS, and IFMIF, are reviewed.

This talk will review current online modeling tools used for proton linacs and then focus on a new approach that marries multi-particle beam dynamics with modern GPU technology to provide pseudo real-time beam information in a control room setting. Benefits to be discussed will include fast turnaround, accurate beam quality prediction, cost efficiency, test bed for new control and operation scheme development and operator training.

New particle accelerator based research facilities tend to be much more productive, but often in coincidence with much higher energy consumption. The total energy consumption of mankind is steeply rising, while some European countries decided to terminate nuclear power generation and to switch to renewable energy production. Also the CO2 problem gives rise to new approaches for energy production and in all strategies the efficiency of utilization of electrical energy plays an important role. For the public acceptance of particle accelerator projects it is thus very important to optimize them for best utilization of electrical energy and to show these efforts to funding bodies and to the public. Within the European accelerator development program Eucard-2 we organise a network EnEfficient that aims at improving the energy efficiency of accelerators. In this paper we give some background information on the political situation, we describe the power flow in accelerator facilities and we give examples for developments of efficient accelerator systems, such as magnets, RF generation and beam acceleration, heat recovery and energy management.
