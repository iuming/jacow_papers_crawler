This workshop on High-Intensity, High Brightness and High Power Hadron Beams, held in East Lansing, MI and hosted by Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), included a Working Group which combined the topics of Instrumentation and Beam Material Interactions. Continuing with the HB Workshop series tradition, progress, status and future developments of hadron accelerators in these subfields were presented and discussed. Leveraging off of experiences from existing accelerators including FNAL, IFMIF, JPARC, the LHC, RHIC and the SNS, this workshop provided occasion to discuss new technical challenges for beam instrument-ation and beam material interactions as relevant for future high power hadron beam facilities both approved (e.g. FRIB, ESS) and in planning (e.g. CADS). Discussions between this and the other working groups during this workshop were quite lively as necessitated by the need to seriously address strong interdependencies (between beam dynamics, technologies, instrumentation and interaction of the beams with materials such as targets, beam dumps and collimators) in the regime of megawatt beam powers as anticipated in approved and future accelerators.
