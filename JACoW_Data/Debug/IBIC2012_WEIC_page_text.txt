Beam size measurement in accelerator is very important to evaluate beam emittance.　SR interferometer has been used as one of powerful tools for measurement of small beam size through special coherence of visible SR. Recent progresses in this technique improve measurable range for smaller beam size less than 10μm. An application of reflective optics to eliminate chromatic aberration in focus system of SR interferometer makes it possible to measure the beam size down to 5μm range. The unbalanced input technique is developed in recent few years, and this technique magnifies beam size 2-3 times, and observation range is improved down to 2-3μm range. These progresses on SR interferometer will introduce in this talk.
