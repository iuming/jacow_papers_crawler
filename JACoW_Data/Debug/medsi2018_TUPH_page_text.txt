SESAME (Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) is the first international 3rd generation synchrotron light source in the Middle East region. This paper presents the method used for installing the Storage ring girders, magnets, vacuum chambers, straight sections, and how the alignment was done. The Installation have been done in a short time with few staff. It was hard and difficult, but went great. A substantial progress has been made in the design, construction and installation of the SESAME Mechanical Systems. All Storage Ring accelerator systems are ready and commissioned.

The function of the collimator is to localize the majority of the electron losses in the ESRF-EBS storage ring (SR). In addition, the collimator of the ESRF-EBS should absorb about 1200w of synchrotron radiation. For ESRF-EBS, the electron losses due to intra bunch scattering (Touschek scattering) will be higher than in the current ESRF SR. To control the level of radiation outside the storage ring tunnel and the activation level of the vacuum chambers, it is more efficient to localize the electron losses and block the radiations at one place rather than reinforce all of the SR tunnel shielding. The poster will show how the design has taken into account all the diverse requirements from a safety, accelerator physics, thermo-mechanical and mechanical point of view.

A 15 mm period PrFeB Cryogenic Permanent Magnet Undulator (CPMU) is under construction at SOLEIL in the frame of a collaboration with MAXIV, relying on the experience gained from the two PrFeB CPMU already installed at SOLEIL. The improved design includes a magnetic length of 3 m and a minimum gap of 3 mm, leading to a polyvalent device of interest for both synchrotron radiation sources and free electron lasers. A dedicated magnetic measurement bench is also under development to perform measurements at cryogenic temperature, based on the SAFALI system. The designs of both undulator and measurement bench will be explained, the construction progress will be detailed and first results will be given.

The final design phase is underway for the APS-Upgrade project's storage ring vacuum system. Many aspects of the design are being worked on to address challenging interfaces and to optimize vacuum system performance. Examples of recent work include updates to ray tracing and vacuum analysis, new developments in vacuum chamber and photon absorber design, and further refinement of vacuum pumping plans to achieve the best possible pressure distributions. Recent R&D work and results from a vacuum system sector mockup have also informed designs and installation plans. An overview of progress in these areas and remaining challenges is pre-sented.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) electron beam can damage YAG:Ce scintillation screens. After one year of use, the existing profile monitor has diminished fluorescence of the screen. The decrease in performance has resulted in distorted beam images which can com-promise the acquired data. Scheduling a YAG screen replacement is difficult, resulting in weeks of diminished performance. We have developed a unique profile moni-tor that incorporates multiple YAG screens (Ø40 mm, 50 um thick) and methods to reduce device downtime. This device uses unique geometry to direct coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) away from the optical path, which preserves the high resolution beam image. We are presenting the operational requirements, device design and installed device operational results.

A Twin-Helix Undulator (THU) with a period length of 24 mm was designed to produce strong and homogeneous helical fields within a 5 mm diameter aperture. A 10-period prototype was constructed to test mechanical and magnetic performance characteristics. The prototype is composed of four helically shaped magnet arrays, which are designed to produce helical and linear fields by shifting its diagonal magnet arrays. A quadrant and half of the magnetic arrays are evaluated to verify the magnetic field performance. Helical array girders were assembled in a rectangular box-like frame with a cross-roller guideway. Mechanical considerations and field analysis of the THU are discussed in this note.

The thermo-mechanical stability is crucial to the performance of an advanced light source. The effects of the temperature fluctuations, such as outdoor temperature, air temperature in the tunnel, surface temperature of the major components and the ground temperature in the accelerator building, to the position of the mechanical structure of the 3 GeV Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) were depicted. The correlations and routes of the thermo-mechanical effects were studied.

The ESRF is proceeding with the design and procurement of its new low emittance storage ring EBS (Extremely Brilliant Source project). This completely new storage ring requires a new vacuum system including UHV chambers with complex shape and strict geometrical and dimensional tolerances. In order to meet these requirements we decided to build about half of the chambers in aluminum alloy machined from the bulk, the only technology permitting to respect the requirements. The result are 128 chambers, 2.5m long, built in alloy 2219 with Conflat flanges custom made from the chamber supplier by explosion bonding. The production phase is nearly finished, the produced chambers satisfy completely the expectations. A second generation of experimental aluminum chambers was designed as a substitution of some steel ones in order to solve same geometrical difficulties. These chambers are very complex as they have steel-aluminum junctions in the body in order to accommodate bellows and beam position monitor buttons. The delivery of the first prototype of this type of chamber is previewed for June 2018.

Sirius, the new Brazilian fourth-generation synchrotron light source, is currently under construction. Due to the high brilliance and low emittance of its source, the pho-ton beam on each undulator beamline can have power densities as high as 55 W/mrad². To protect the compo-nents downstream, the Front-End power absorbers need to manage this power in a limited space, but also having precision in alignment and being reliable all over their lifetime. To achieve this behaviour, the selected alloy was the copper-chromium-zirconium (CuCrZr, commercially known as C18150) because of improved thermal and mechanical properties. In order to seal the vacuum cham-ber (path on which the cooling water flows), friction stir welding was the selected joining method. During the welding process, the material passes through a grain re-finement process which results in a high-resistance joint. The manufacturing process could also result on a reduc-tion of costs and lead times. Finally, it will be presented the final versions of the component with its support and the characterizations done to validate the welded joint under vacuum and water pressure requirements.

A critical time for the APS Upgrade Project is the twelve month dark period in which the current accelerator, front ends, and insertion devices will be removed and the new MBA will be installed. In addition to the technical interfaces, there are a significant number of operational support systems and utilities that will be affected. For the dark period to be a success, these additional interfaces need to be described and their interaction with the removal and installation processes defined. This poster describes many of these additional systems and their interfaces.

At the SOLEIL synchrotron, as in other accelerators, two canted sources can coexist on the same straight section for space and economic reasons. For its two long beamlines (ANATOMIX source upstream and NANOSCOPIUM source downstream) SOLEIL has made the choice to equip one of his long straight section with two canted insertion devices capable to operate simultaneously. That implies to take into account the degradation risk management of equipment, due to radiation. As the beam power deposition from the upstream undulator can seriously degrade the downstream one, or even other equipment. To handle these risks, Soleil first designed and installed in 2016 a retractable vertical absorber between both insertions to protect the downstream source from the upstream one. In 2017, Soleil then designed and installed a white beam imager, redundant an existing photon beam monitor (XBPM), to verify the correct positioning / alignment of equipment and beams relative to each other. For the vertical absorber as for the white beam imager Soleil had to meet some interesting technological and manufacturing aspects that we propose to present in a poster.

The cooperative MIK project SOLEIL / MAX IV started in 2012 and is part of the Franco-Swedish scientific collaboration agreement, signed in 2009 and followed by framework agreements signed in 2011. The MIK is a particular electromagnet using theoretical principles of the 1950s and recently used by the new generation of synchrotrons to significantly improve the Top-Up injection of electrons into the storage rings. Indeed, this type of magnet can drastically reduce disturbances on stored beams and also offers substantial space savings. The MIK is a real opportunity for synchrotrons wishing to upgrade their facilities. One of the first MIK developed by BESSY II in 2010 gave significant results. These results motivated SOLEIL and MAX IV to develop together their own MIK. Many technical challenges have been overcome in the area of mechanical design and manufacture as well as in magnetic and high voltage design of the MIK. Currently the first series is in operation at MAX IV and displays already outstanding performances. Optimization work is in progress.

An innovative design was developed for an 8-pole corrector magnet for the APS upgrade program. This is a combined function magnet consisting of horizontal and vertical correctors as well as a skew quadrupole. This paper describes technical challenges presented by both the magnetic design and the interface constraints for the magnet. A prototype magnet was built, and extensive testing on the magnet confirmed that all magnetic and mechanical requirements were achieved. Improvements were identified during the manufacturing and testing of the prototype magnet. The final design of the magnet which has incorporated these improvements is discussed in the paper.

The ALS-U conceptual design promises to deliver diffraction limited performance throughout the soft x-ray range by lowering the horizontal emittance to about 70 pm rad resulting in 2-3 orders of brightness increase for soft x-rays compared to the current ALS. The design utilizes a nine bend achromat lattice, with reverse bending magnets and on-axis swap-out injection utilizing an accumulator ring. This paper shows some aspects of the completed conceptual design of the accelerator, as well as some results of the R&D program that has been ongoing for the last years.

At DESY in Hamburg an investigation was started to join aluminum chambers with stainless steel flanges by friction stir welding. First results will be presented. It will be shown that there is only a small effect of hardening in the contact zone at the stainless-steel side, a small amount of particles are given and the diffusion zone is about 3 microns, but with a very irregular effect on the structured junction. Because of that, the influence of the surface and the welding parameters on the process will be investigated in the future.

Electron beam stability is very important for Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility(SSRF). One of the major players on beam stability is the vibration stability of magnet support systems. This paper describes several kinds of hammerhead magnet support prototypes with different structures, materials and ground fixation. Modal and response analyses of these prototypes are contrasted by finite-element analysis(FEA) and tests. The design can be applied to guide and improve the mechanical structures and the stability of magnet support systems at SSRF and other light source facilities.

Now that all of the original straight sections in the Diamond storage ring are occupied, novel ways of converting bending magnet beamline locations into insertion device beamlines have been considered. Recently one cell of the 24 cells was reconfigured in to a Double-Double Bend Achromat (DDBA) to provide a new location for an Undulator and enable a formerly designated bending magnet beamline to become an Insertion Device Beamline*. Extending this concept for the new Dual Imaging and Diffraction (DIAD) Beamline proved to have a strong impact on lifetime and injection efficiency, so instead it was decided to remove a Sextupole magnet in one cell and substitute it with a short fixed gap Wiggler. The accelerator physics, mechanical and electrical design aspects associated with the change are described.

To test the pumping performance of NEG coated Cu-CrZr absorber, we performed a comparative experiment on the two absorbers, one with NGE coating and the other one without coating. First, we run the Monte Carlo simu-lation by using MolFlow+ code to estimate the pressure inside test chamber at different thermal outgassing rate. And then two absorbers are mounted inside the chamber for the pressure vs. time profiles testing. The experimental set-up and pressure profiles will be presented here.

A PrFeB-based cryogenic permanent magnet undu-lator (CPMU) is under construction at the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) to generate brilliant X-rays. When magnets are cooled to 77 K, a CPMU with a period length of 15 mm can generate an effective magnetic field of 1.32 T in a gap of 4 mm. A main feature of the TPS CPMU is its low-intrinsic-phase errors by the installation of force-compensation modules on the out-of-vacuum girders in a four-support-points configuration. Moreover, adjusting the spring settings one can obtain very low undulator phase errors. In this paper, a mechanical frame design for the TPS-CPMU with force-compensating spring modules will be discussed. Observations of deformation effects of the out-of-vacuum girders on the CPMU will be presented.

The Photon Factory in the KEK has been operating two SR sources, the PF-ring and the PF-AR for over thirty years. Although even now the 2 rings are used extensively in the wide science fields, the aging problems are quite critical so that we started considering the upgrades of the rings and a new SR facility. Assuming an extremely low-emittance storage ring, we are studying in 5 items, beamline optics design, vibration reduction, heat-load management, beam control and beamline vacuum. In particular, the vibration reduction and heat-load management are quite important issues and we are antecedently conducting necessary R&Ds of the beamline and the related facilities, first mirror heat-load management with test chamber, vibration evaluation with fine encoder, development of the phase separator for stable nitrogen supply and the development of the GRIDCOP direct-cooling mirror system. Here, we will introduce our R&Ds.

Taiwan photon source is a third generation accelerator with low emittance and high brightness. The electric beam size is one of important parameters to indicate the stabil-ity and to measure the emittance and coupling of light source. The aperture size of beam slitter is a crucial part to calculate the value of beam size in the X-ray pine-hole system. In order to obtain the more precise result of beam size, the flexure mechanism on beam slitter is applied for the adjustment of the aperture. This paper shows that the design concept and the measurement of the beam size are obtained by the new adjustment system.

A superconducting undulator (SCU) prototpye with the period of 16 mm and the magnetic gap of 9.5 mm has been designed and fabricated at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics(SINAP) since late 2013. A set of cooling system is designed to cool down cold masses. This paper presents the details of their design, calculation and test: 4 small cryogenic refrigerators are used as cold sources, and the superconducting coil and beam pipe are independently cooled down; The 4.2 K superconducting coil is mainly cooled by the liquid helium tube of the thermosyphon loop with evaporation and recondensation; The 10~20 K ultra-high vacuum beam tube is cooled by heat conduction. The main sources and mechanism of thermal loads for SCU were analyzed. And experimental test of cooling technology for SCU prototype had been performed, the feasibility of cooling scheme and the rationality of the cooling structure for the SINAP SCU prototype were verified. The cryogenic test and operation of the SCU doesn't require the input of liquid helium from the outside, and is not limited by the liquid helium source. This is the characteristic of SINAP's SCU cooling technology.

Sextupole magnets are used extensively in particle ac-celerators, synchrotrons, and storage rings. Good magnet-ic field quality is needed in these magnets, which requires machining the magnet parts to high precision and is the primary driver of the high fabrication costs. To minimize the fabrication costs, a magnetic field quality study from tolerance analyses was conducted. In this paper, finite element analysis (FEA) using OPERA was performed to identify key geometric factors that affect the magnetic field quality and identify the allowable range for these factors. Next, geometric and dimensional tolerance stack-up analyses are carried out using Teamcenter Variation Analysis to optimize the allocation of the geometric tol-erances to parts and assemblies. Finally, the analysis re-sults are compared to magnetic measurements of a R&D sextupole magnet.

The Dual Imaging and Diffraction (DIAD) beamline X-ray source is a ten pole mini wiggler. By locating the mini wiggler in place of an existing sextupole magnet, the DIAD beamline is built at a bending magnet beamline position in Diamond. To accommodate the unusual beam trajectory, a new front end was designed for the DIAD beamline. The particular designs and specifications including an improved front end slits design, as well as the synchrotron and dipole ray tracing of the front end are presented in this paper. The development process of delivering the front end - the project challenges, approach and activities are also described along with the technical challenges.

Non-evaporable getter (NEG) coatings are ideal for maintaining an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) in the range 10'8 Pa and they are widely used for accelerators because they are oil free, magnetic-field free, vibration free, economical, space saving, and energy efficient. We recently fabricated new NEG coatings consisting of low-oxygen-content Ti or oxygen-free Pd/Ti by sublimation under a clean UHV in the range 10'8 to 10'7 Pa [*]. Here, we report the determination of the morphologies of these films by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The Ti and Pd films had almost uniform thicknesses of about 1.3 'm and 50 nm, respectively, and the Pd film completely overcoated the Ti film. Both the Pd and Ti thin films were uniformly deposited in plane on the stainless steel 304L substrate and they had polycrystalline structures. The interface between the Pd and Ti thin films was not abrupt.

A 2.8 m long quasi-periodic APPLE II type undulator has been commissioned at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) for the Electron Spectro-Microscopy (ESM) beamline in the framework of the NEXT (NSLS-II Experimental Tools) project. It provides high brilliance photon beams in circularly and linearly polarized radiation from VUV to soft X-Rays. The mechanical structure implemented to achieve the quasi-periodicity in the magnetic field profile is described together with the optimization techniques utilized to correct the undesirable phase-dependent errors. The final magnetic results are presented as well as the spectral performance of the device. Although this EPU (Elliptically Polarizing Undulator) was procured as a turn-key device, the vendor was only responsible for the mechanical frame and the control system. Sorting and assembly of the magnet modules and the magnetic field tuning - Virtual Shimming and Magic Finger - were performed at the NSLS-II Magnetic Measurement Lab.

Maintaining sub-micron-scale beam stability for the APS-U Multibend Achromat Lattice places strict requirements on the magnet support system. Historically, magnet vibration requirements have been based on physics simulations which make broad generalizations and assumptions regarding the magnet motion. Magnet support systems have been notoriously difficult to analyze with FEA techniques and as a consequence, these analyses have been underutilized in predicting accelerator performance. The APS has developed a procedure for accurate modeling of magnet support systems. The girder mode shapes are extracted from these analyses and exported to accelerator simulation code elegant to calculate the static beam amplification factor for each mode shape. These amplification factors, along with knowledge of damping coefficients and the character of the tunnel floor motion, may then be used to predict the effect of girder resonances on beam stability and validate the magnet support designs.

The Advanced Photon Source (APS) upgrade from double-bend achromats (DBA) to multi-bend achromats (MBA) lattice has increased the need for reliable diagnos-tic systems. This upgrade will decrease the size of the photon beam drastically and beam current will be in-creased from 100 mA to 200 mA. The small beam and intense heat loads provided by the upgraded APS requires unique and innovative approaches to beam position monitoring. To meet the need for a reliable diagnostic system for the APS upgrade, the next generation X-ray Beam Position Monitoring System (XBPM) is required which includes the first XBPM (XBPM1), the Intensity Monitor (IM1) and the second XBPM (XBPM2).

ALBA is a 3rd generation Synchrotron Light facility with: 8 operational Beam Lines (BLs), a 2nd BL of Phase II under construction and 3 first Phase III BLs in design phase. Some user experiments require Liquid Helium (LHe) as a coolant. The resulting LHe consumption at ALBA is about 650 l/week. Thus far the vaporized helium, which results from the refrigeration of experiments and equipment, has been released into the atmosphere without being reused. Due to the increasing price of LHe, ALBA agreed with ICN2 (Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology) to invest in a Liquefaction Helium Plant. Internal staff has carried out the project, installation and pressure equipment legalization of the plant, which is located in a new 80 m2 construction. Under operation the plant allows recycling up to 24960 litres of LHe per year, which is an 80% of the helium consumed at ALBA, by making the gaseous helium undergo through 3 main stages: recovery, purification and liquefaction. The plant, unique in Catalonia, will entail cost savings about 77% and will reduce vulnerability to supply disruptions. ICN2 will benefit from a part of the production due to their initial investment.

A revolver type undulator is developed for the SASE section of the FLASH Free-Electron Laser (FEL) at DESY. Currently, a 1,2GeV linear accelerator injects electrons into two undulator lines to provide fully coherent VUV light to different experimental stations in two experimental halls. The more recently built FLASH2 branch consists of 12 planar undulators with a fixed magnet structure of ~32mm period length. Within plans for refurbishment of the original FLASH1 undulator section and also to open up new operation schemes with an extended photon energy range, an undulator development was started that allows for a change of different magnet structures. Once installed, it will be possible to change the wavelength range or the FEL operation scheme within a short period of time. Magnet structures can then be switched at any time without any observable effect on the electron beam orbit or the photon beam position. The single design steps are described in the following article: profile of requirements, choice of an applicable changing mechanism, development of a new magnet structure, the position of the bearing points, a new floor assembly and improvement of the cantilever arm.

AM technology (3D Printing) in plastics and metals has now been in commercial use for over 30 years. However, the application of this technology in vacuum environments has been limited, due to the material porosity and additives used in the manufacturing techniques. This paper reports on the testing and use of FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) PEEK and DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) metal components inside a UHV environment. Specifically covering the use of DMLS to successfully produce a complex vacuum vessel operating at 10-6 mbar, as used on the new VMXm beamline at Diamond Light Source. Vacuum testing the vessel has demonstrated that this manufacturing technique has the potential to produce vessels that are capable of holding 10-10mbar.

The upgrade of the ESRF (ESRF-EBS) is a highly challenging project in many respects. One major challenge is to manufacture vacuum chambers within extremely tight tolerances. Indeed the chamber envelope is constrained by the very limited space available between the beam stay clear and the magnets pole tips, requiring profile tolerances of just 500 um over the full length of the chamber for a width of 55 mm. An additional challenge is guaranteeing the perpendicularity (up to 0.75 mrad) between the CF flanges and the chamber body. While a design using discrete removable absorbers was chosen, one family of chambers contains a distributed absorber required to protect the insertion devices from 600 W of upstream dipole X-rays. Two companies have been selected to produce a total of 296 stainless steel chambers. Given the unusual tolerance requirements, the manufacturers have been obliged to adapt and develop their production techniques to overcome the challenges. During manufacture, vacuum leaks were discovered on some of the BPM buttons. This paper will also present the two techniques that ESRF has developed in order to prevent the integration of potentially leaking buttons.

3D additive machining by selective laser melting (SLM) has great potential for widespread use in the field of accelerator instrumentation. However, as with any new process or material, it must be adapted and qualified for use in the specific in-vacuum accelerator environment. This paper outlines recent developments of this technology for beam instrumentation in CERN accelerators. It covers topological optimisation, design and production methods for SLM, validation and test of samples and components to qualify the production process. It also reports on experience of operation in multiple machines with beam.

The European-XFEL X-Ray laser facility is located in Hamburg. Since its commissioning in September 2017, this large X-ray laser opens new research opportunities for industrial users and scientists. For many beam diagnostic devices ultra-high vacuum components with high mechanical precision and additional strict requirements on particle cleanliness were produced. A vacuum chamber for the bunch compressor (BC) with a cross section of 400 mm*40.5 mm made of stainless steel blocks 1.4429 (316 LN) has been installed. These chambers have inte-grated flange-connections for large VATSEAL® gaskets. The tolerances for these flanges are extremely tight to ensure save vacuum tight sealing. This contribution will report of a new technology for such large rectangular or other large flange surfaces. Furthermore this contribution will compare the present with this new technology. This new technology can be used as well for other vacuum flange metals like alumini-um or titanium. Using of this technology for applications under special conditions, like particle free applications due to the non-lubricated conditions, are conceivable.

The Hefei Advanced Light Source (HALS) is a future soft X-ray diffraction-limited storage ring at National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) of China. This project aims to improve the brilliance and coherence of the X-ray beams and to decrease the horizontal emittance. The lattice of the HALS ring relies on magnets with demanding specifications, including combined function dipole-quadrupoles (DQs) with high gradients, dipoles with longitudinal gradients (DLs), high gradient quadrupoles and sextupoles. All these magnets have been designed using POSSION and Radia. Preliminary design of them are presented in this paper.

LCLS-II will produce very powerful photon beams. Unlike conventional synchrotrons, the LCLS-II beam containment components withstand not only the high average beam power and power density, but also the instantaneous thermal shocks from pulsed FEL beam, which can reach ~9mJ/pulse. With beam repetition rate up to 1MHz, regular metal based beam collimators and absorbers will no longer work, because of the likelihood of fatigue failure. And because of the poor thermal conductivity, the old LCLS B4C based absorber would need very shallow glancing angle and take valuable beamline space. Hence, a low-Z and high thermal conductivity CVD diamond based photon beam collimator and absorber systems have been developed in LCSL-II. The initial damage tests using LCLS FEL beam provided positive results that graphite coated CVD diamond can endure per pulse dose level to ~0.5eV/atom. For the beamline and personnel safety, in addition to the passive CVD diamond collimators and absorbers, newly developed photon diode beam mis-steer detection systems and conventional SLAC pressurized burnt-through monitors have been also introduced in the photon beamline system design.

Abstract Particle Accelerators require significant amounts of water to cool components and devices. Care are and planning are required to maintain these large systems. The purpose here is to provide insight into the operation and maintenance of water systems at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Low Conductivity Water (LCW) systems are integral in the design of particle accelerators. Initial design requirements often change over time to accommodate new requirements. Some of the issues seen over the 23-year operation of the APS are erosion, clogging, and the need for more precise temperature control. Water chemistry, flow velocity, type of control systems and sensors, along with maintenance practices all contribute to successful operation. We will discuss our successes and failures in regards to water quality, temperature stability, reliability and longevity of the system, as well as equipment maintenance and repair. These aspects of water system design and maintenance are all critical to reliable operations of the APS. This document will provide useful information for institutions that intend to design, build, and/or maintain a particle accelerator.

For the third or fourth generation synchrotron light sources, the brilliance of the x-ray beam is 2 to 3 order higher than other generations, and in the meanwhile the beam emittance is at least one order smaller. To ensure the stability of the beam, the vibration caused beam motion is usually controlled to be within 10% of the RMS beam size. Thus the smaller beam emittance is, more restrict of the regulation plan to the vibration sources should be. Inside of the light source site, one major vibration source is the utility equipment such as water pump, compressors and so on. There are two controlling approaches for the vibration amplitude of those sources, one is damping, and another way is decay. However reasonable specification is the key of the controlling method. This work will present the detailed establish process of the regulation plan for HEPS in China.

A linear polarization adjustable undulator is proposed in this paper. This undulator can reach 1.5T magnetic peak field with a period length 68mm and magnet length 4m. By adding two repulsive magnet arrays beside center array the magnetic force between girders can be reduced from 70kN to near zero. Such an approach can result in a significant reduction of the undulator volume, simplification of the strong back design and fabrication. By means of rotating through the center of undulator we can achieve magnetic field from vertical orientation to horizontal orientation. The linear polarization of radiation can be adjusted between zero and 90 degree

Modern synchrotron light sources require high mechanical stability throughout its facilities, frequently demanding characterization processes in theμand nanometer scales. In this context, the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) built a new facility with several controlled environment rooms to minimize disturbances during optical and mechanical metrology procedures and to support advanced instrumentation development for the new Sirius' beamlines. The building design imposed very strict requirements regarding temperature, humidity and particles. This work presents the environmental control validation results and the floor vibration assessment enlightening the influence of the building machinery. Temperature variations below ± 0,1 °C were successfully achieved for all rooms, relative humidity is also better than 50 ± 5 % and the floor RMS displacement did not exceed 15 nm. The building is fully operational since early 2017 and currently hosting several tests on monochromators, mirrors, front-ends and many other systems for the Sirius beamlines.
