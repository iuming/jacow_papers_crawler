For more than 30 years, Sigmaphi has been manufacturing magnets and power supplies. Its teams are now able to supply a complete particle beam line, from beam optics calculation to on-site installation and alignment. These combined skills allow design optimization for turnkey systems in order to reduce their purchasing and running costs. An example of successful iterative design is presented: a 70 meters beam line designed, manufactured and installed by Sigmaphi for JINR in Dubna, Russia. This design optimization allowed reducing total power consumption of the 14 quadrupoles by 7.5%.

The irradiation of silicon with ion beams is an established technique to modify its properties. Protons are used for micromachining applications, in conjunction with porous silicon. Porous silicon does not form in areas irradiated with a given fluence of protons (>1014 cm-2). Our work concentrated on the applicability of masked irradiation of silicon wafers with 1.8 MeV proton beams delivered by the TOP-IMPLART LINAC. In our experiments 1-10 Ω*cm n,p-type silicon wafers were masked and irradiated with protons at fluences between 1014 and 1015 protons/cm2. Porous silicon did not form in the irradiated areas up to a distance from the surface corresponding to the stopping range (30um). The suppression of porous silicon formation is due to the to the neutralization of dopant impurities by implanted protons that increases the local resistivity. The interest in using RF LINAC for micromachining applications lies in the possibility of deep implantation, that allows the realization of 3D structures for MEMS applications. The use of metal masks with uniform beams, instead of scanned micro- and nano-metric ion probes, increases throughput achievable in industrial processing of wafers.

In this work we present the latest update on the TOP-IMPLART LINAC. It is a 150 MeV proton linear accelerator for protontherapy application under realization at ENEA-Frascati in the framework of a project developed by ENEA, the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and Regina Elena National Cancer Institute-IFO-Rome. The accelerator consists of a 7 MeV injector operating at 425 MHz followed by a LINAC booster working at 2997.92 MHz at a maximum repetition frequency of 100 Hz. The medium energy section up to 35 MeV is a sequence of four SCDTL modules (Side Coupled Drift Tube LINAC) powered by a single 10 MW klystron: the first module bringing beam energy from 7MeV to 11.6MeV with an input power of 1.3 MW in a 4usec pulse has been successfully commissioned with a 10 uA per pulse beam accelerated at the design energy demonstrating the functionality of low energy proton acceleration at high RF frequency. The effects on beam dynamics, caused by the absence of any harmonic relation between the two operating frequencies of the LINAC has been simulated and experimentally verified during the commissioning activity. The second and third module installation and testing is undergoing.

The purpose of the BIOxTREME project, launched by ENEA and funded by ASI (Italian Space Agency), is to formulate new biological drugs having a stimulant activity on the immune system finalizing the production for a ready to use resource in Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSSs) for space missions with extended durations, in deep space, and with multiple crews. One of the project tasks is to study the effects of physical insults on plants, simulating cosmic environment on production platforms by static magnetic fields, microgravity and ionizing radiation. In order to examine the biological effects, to test plant radio-resistance and to build dose-response curves we carried out proton irradiations of a tomato cultivar Micro-Tom red hairy roots with the TOP-IMPLART accelerator at the ENEA Frascati Research center. The biological samples were placed in a holder specially made in a movable real-time monitoring chamber calibrated in dose. The fluence-homogeneity measurements over the sample and the calibration of the monitoring system were performed using GafChromic EBT3 films. The paper describes the experimental set-up and reports the preliminary results.

Kyma was established in 2007 as a spin-off company of Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste, to design, realize and install all the 18 undulators of FERMI, the seeded FEL, at the time being built at the Elettra lab in Trieste, Italy. For Kyma establishment, Elettra-SincrotroneTrieste formally transferred to the new company know-how and references relevant to Insertion Devices and, by a Knowledge Transfer monetarily evaluated, could participate to Kyma capital owning the 51% of the shares. In few years, Kyma became a well-known organization in the light source community. After more than forty Insertion Devices and sixty phase shifters designed and manufactured, Kyma is now recognized as a qualified partner for design and development of this kind of equipment. Some examples of Kyma industrial achievements in developing skills, knowledge, technologies methods of manufacturing transferred by Universities and Institution, will be presented. An example out of many: the joint effort between Kyma and Cornell University right now leading to the development of a new perspective into the ID world, i.e. the CHESS Compact Undulators (CCU).

In particle beam therapy, it is demanded to improve measurement of beam extracted from accelerator in order to realize more conformal irradiation. We developed a method of reconstructing particle distribution from measured profile in beam transport. In this method, particle distribution is obtained by solving a following equation: I=Dρ, where I is a counted number of particles at a single channel of the profile monitor, D is a matrix representing relation between I and ρ, and ρ is number of particles included in a single n-dimensional voxel of phase space at start point of the beam transport. D is a n×m matrix, where n is number of data which obtained under multiple conditions of beam transport, and m is number of voxels of phase space to be reconstructed. We succeeded formulation of D matrix from transportation matrix of the beam transport R, and discovered that D is formulated as piecewise-polynomials of elements of R. By this method, it is enable to reconstruct the particle distribution in arbitrary dimensional phase space. We show details of the formulation of D and results of simulations of reconstruction of particle distribution in phase space by this method.

Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) would be a powerful tool for the direct visualization of structural dynamic processes in matter. The resolutions of the observation on femtosecond time scales over sub-nanometer (even atomic) spatial dimensions have long been a goal in science. To achieve such resolutions, we have designed and constructed a femtosecond time-resolved relativistic-energy electron microscopy using a photocathode radio-frequency (RF) electron gun (RF based UEM). The RF gun has successfully generated a high-brightness electron beam with bunch length of 100 fs and emittance of 0.2 mm-mrad, which are essential beam parameters for the achievement of nm-fs space-time resolution in the microscopy. Both the static measurements of both relativistic-energy electron diffraction and image have been succeeded. In this presentation, the activities on RF based UEM are introduced. The requirements and limitations of the beam parameters are reviewed. The concept and design of RF based UEM are reported. Finally, some demonstrations of the relativistic-energy UEM images are reported.

Aged large concrete structure, such as highway, bridges and so on, need to be inspected in order to maintain with less cost by un-destructive method. We have been developing un-destructive inspection system by using fast neutron which can penetrate thick concrete. The system will be consisted of (1) Transportable Accelerator based Neutron Source, (2) Fast neutron imaging detector, and (3) Image processing for getting 3D image. RIKEN Accelerator based compact Neutron Source (RANS), which consists of 7MeV proton LINAC and target station, has been operating since 2013. RANS can generate thermal (~25meV) and fast (~2MeV) neutron. Fast neutron detector are developed with plastic scintillator and semiconductor photon sensors. It can see 10mm thick steel rod with 2mm accuracy through 300mm thick concrete.

We have been studying the pulse radiolysis using photo-cathode rf gun at Waseda Univ. Pulse radiolysis is one of the powerful methods to trace early chemical reactions by ionizing radiation. In pulse radiolysis, the probe light absorption, which produced by active species formed by electron beam of rf gun, is measured at each wavelength and made possible to trace reactions. Therefore, we have used the super continuum (SC) light for the probe light. The SC light has a broad spectrum and is generated by nonlinear optical effect caused by injecting picosecond laser to photonic crystal fiber. However, the resulting SC light was unstable because its peak intensity was not enough. We need to use a femtosecond pulsed laser which is expected to be stronger peak intensity than a picosecond laser. We have developed a mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser based on Non-Linear Polarization Rotation as a femtosecond pulsed laser and the chirped pulse amplification system which will be able to amplify the femtosecond pulse. In this conference, we will report the performance of the SC light using this fiber laser system, recent results of pulse radiolysis experiments and the future plans.

The last decade brought much interest in proton therapy within the medical and accelerator communities. Using normal conducting technology, the high-energy beams required can be handled only with large and heavy magnets which causes prohibitive costs. While lattice design work on a superconducting gantry has been carried out for a decade there is yet no practical implementation. The University of Huelva in collaboration with the Andalusian Foundation for Health Research (FABIS) is currently involved in developing and assembling a prototype for a compact superconducting proton gantry. Magnet design and performance is described along with beam dynamics results for the main gantry arcs and for the final spot scanning system using realistic magnetic field maps thoroughly.

CIEMAT is in charge of the design and manufacturing of the quadrupole movers with submicrometric repeatability for the XFEL. EU intersections. Prototyping of these precision devices was successful but manufacturing them in a serial production scheme (101 units) implies some changes at design, fabrication procedures and quality controls. This paper will present some of the main problems and solutions adopted to transform a prototype made at a research facility into a serial production at a conventional industrial company. Also, it describes the inspection and tests, the quality controls and reporting procedures. All the devices have been validated and recepted. This paper describes the adopted procedure and the performance of the serial units.

PSI and its Center for Proton Therapy (CPT) is extending its research capabilities in the field of proton therapy and pencil beam scanning technology. Gantry 3 will be an additional treatment room at the PROSCAN facility at PSI, Villigen, Switzerland. It will feature a 360 degree scanning Gantry delivered by Varian Medical Systems. The Gantry design is based on Varian technology, which will be combined with advanced PSI active scanning technology. The further development of fast energy switching as well as precise spot and continuous line scanning irradiation modes are main research topics at the PROSCAN facility. A major challenge with Gantry 3 is the link of the existing PSI PROSCAN system with the Varian PROBEAM system, while retaining the system integrity and high performance level. Additionally, Gantry 3 will be installed and commissioned while keeping the other treatment rooms (Gantry 1, Gantry 2, Optis 2) in full operation. The current development and project status is presented.

Accelerator based Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) is a technique for obtaining static structures and for studying sub-100 fs dynamic structural changes on the atomic scale. In this paper we present the first electron diffraction results obtained from the VELA accelerator in 2014. The accelerator was operated to provide typically 4MeV/c electron bunches. Diffraction patterns were observed with <<1 pC transported to the detection screen. Single shot and multi-shot accumulated diffraction data are presented from single crystal and polycrystalline samples, including Au, Al, Pt and C. Contamination of the diffraction pattern with dark current contributions is an issue. A variable size aperture directly in front of the sample offers some mitigation, but at the expense of reduced charge contributing to the diffraction pattern. We discuss future developments for electron diffraction on VELA including further beam optimization, measurement of bunch length with a newly installed Transverse Deflecting Cavity, and the planned developments for pump-probe studies.

The IsoDAR sterile-neutrino search calls for a high neutron flux from a 60 MeV proton beam striking a beryllium target, that flood a sleeve of highly-enriched 7Li, the beta-decay of the resulting 8Li giving the desired neutrinos for the very-short-baseline experiment. The target is placed very close to an existing large neutrino detector; all such existing or planned detectors are deep underground, in low-background environments. It is necessary to design a shielding enclosure to prevent neutrons from causing unacceptable activation of the environment. GEANT4 is being used to study neutron attenuation, and optimizing the layers of shielding material to minimize thickness. Materials being studied include iron and two new types of concrete developed by Jefferson Laboratory, one very light with shredded plastic aggregate, the other with high quantities of boron. Initial studies indicate that a total shielding thickness of 1.5 meters produces the required attenuation factor, further studies may allow decrease in thickness. Minimizing it will reduce the amount of cavity excavation needed to house the target system in confined underground spaces.

We present our progress on a new design for a 30 - 350 MeV scaling FFAG for proton therapy and tomography - NORMA (NOrmal-conducting Racetrack Medical Accelerator) which allows the realisation of proton computed tomography (pCT) and utilises normal conducting magnets in both a circular and racetrack configuration which are designed using advanced optimisation algorithms developed in PyZgoubi. The ring and racetrack configurations have average circumferences of around 60 and 70 m respectively, peak magnetic fields of < 1.8 T, average orbit excursions < 50 cm and dynamic aperture calculations of > 50 mm.mrad using a novel technique. The racetrack design has a total magnet-free straight length of 4.9 m at two opposing points, designed to ease injection and extraction systems.

Operation of high-power SRF particle accelerators at two US national laboratories allows us to consider a less-expensive nuclear reactor that operates without the need for a critical core, fuel enrichment, or reprocessing. A multipurpose reactor design that takes advantage of this new accelerator capability includes an internal spallation neutron target and high-temperature molten-salt fuel with continuous purging of volatile radioactive fission products. The reactor contains less than a critical mass and almost a million times fewer volatile radioactive fission products than conventional reactors like those at Fukushima. We describe GEM*STAR *, a reactor that without redesign will burn spent nuclear fuel, natural uranium, thorium, or surplus weapons material. A first application is to burn 34 tonnes of excess weapons grade plutonium as an important step in nuclear disarmament under the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement **. The process heat generated by this W-Pu can be used for the Fischer-Tropsch conversion of natural gas and renewable carbon into 42 billion gallons of low-CO2-footprint, drop-in, synthetic diesel fuel for the DOD.

High-energy gamma rays can be efficiently produced using the direct excitation of the 15.1-MeV level in 12C via the (p, p’) reaction. This reaction has the threshold energy of 16.38 MeV. The threshold for neutron production via 12C (p, n) is 19.66 MeV, so there is an energy window of 3.28 MeV where the 15.1-MeV photons can be produced without any direct neutrons. Thick-target yield estimates indicate that just below the neutron production threshold, the photon output is about twice that of the more well-known 11B (d, n) reaction requiring 4-MeV deuterons, with the expected 15.1-MeV photon flux to be approximately 1011 s-1 sr-1 per 1 mA of 19.6-MeV proton current on a carbon target. A compact pulsed proton accelerator capable of 10-mA or greater peak currents to drive such a gamma source will be presented. The accelerator concept is based on a 4-rod RFQ followed by compact H-mode structures with PMQ focusing.

The Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes (MaRIE) experimental facility will be used to discover and design the advanced materials needed to meet 21st century national security and energy security challenges. This new facility will provide the new tools scientists need to develop next-generation materials that will perform predictably and on-demand for currently unattainable lifetimes in extreme environments. The MaRIE facility is based on upgrades to the existing LANSCE 800-MeV proton linac and a new 12-GeV electron linac and associated X-ray FEL to provide simultaneous multiple probe beams, and new experimental areas. In addition to the high-energy photon probe beam, both electron and proton radiography capabilities will be available at the MaRIE facility. Recently, detailed radiography system studies have been performed to develop conceptual layouts of high-magnification electron and proton radiography systems that can meet the experimental requirements for the expected first experiments to be performed at the facility. A description of the radiography systems, their performance requirements, and a proposed facility layout will be presented.

The Isotope Production Facility (IPF) at LANSCE produces medical radionuclides strontium-82 and germanium-68 by bombarding rubidium chloride and gallium metal targets respectively with a 100 MeV proton beam, 230 uA average current. Rastering the proton beam is necessary to distribute beam power deposited as heat in the target and allow for higher average beam current for isotope production. We currently use a single circle raster pattern with constant amplitude and frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate two different varying amplitude raster patterns (concentric circle and spiral) to achieve uniform target coverage and expose more target volume to beam heating. In this proof-of-principle experiment, we compare beam spot uniformity measured by irradiating films and foils for both raster patterns.

The scheme for preservation and control of the ion polarization in the Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) has been under active development in recent years. The figure-8 configuration of the ion rings provides a unique capability to control the polarization of any ion species including deuterons by means of "weak" solenoids rotating the particle spins by small angles. Insertion of "weak" solenoids into the magnetic lattices of the booster and collider rings solves the problem of polarization preservation during acceleration of the ion beam. Universal 3D spin rotators designed on the basis of "weak" solenoids allow one to obtain any polarization orientation at an interaction point of MEIC. This paper presents the baseline scheme for polarization preservation and control in the MEIC ion complex.

Ion polarization in the Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) is controlled by means of universal 3D spin rotators designed on the basis of “weak” solenoids. We use numerical calculations to demonstrate that the 3D rotators have negligible effect on the orbital properties of the ring. We present calculations of the polarization dynamics along the collider’s orbit for both longitudinal and transverse polarization directions at a beam interaction point. We calculate the degree of depolarization due to the longitudinal and transverse beam emittances in case when the zero-integer spin resonance is compensated.

We present an update on the design of the ion collider ring of the Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) proposed by Jefferson Lab. The design is based on the use of super-ferric magnets. It provides the necessary momentum range of 8 to 100 GeV/c for protons and ions, matches the electron collider ring design using PEP-II components, fits readily on the JLab site, offers a straightforward path for a future full-energy upgrade by replacing the magnets with higher-field ones in the same tunnel, and is more cost effective than using presently available current-dominated super-conducting magnets. We describe complete ion collider optics including an independently-designed modular detector region.

One of the key design features of the Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) proposed by Jefferson Lab is a small beta function at the interaction point (IP) allowing one to achieve a high luminosity of up to 1034 cm-2s-1. The required strong beam focusing unavoidably causes large chromatic effects such as chromatic tune spread and beam smear at the IP, which need to be compensated. This paper reports recent progress in our development of a chromaticity correction scheme for the ion ring including optimization of dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance.

For high luminosity in a muon collider, muon bunches that have been cooled in the six-dimensional helical cooling channel (HCC) must be merged into a single bunch and further cooled in preparation for acceleration and transport to the collider ring. The helical bunch coalescing channel has been previously simulated [*, **] and provides the most natural match from helical upstream and downstream subsystems. This work focuses on the matching from the exit of the multiple bunch HCC into the start of the helical bunch coalescing channel. The simulated helical matching section simultaneously matches the helical spatial period λ in addition to providing the necessary acceleration for efficient bunch coalescing. Previous studies assumed that the acceleration of muon bunches from p=209.15 MeV/c to 286.816 MeV/c and matching of λ from 0.5 m to 1.0 m could be accomplished with zero particle losses and zero emittance growth in the individual bunches. This study demonstrates nonzero values for both particle loss and emittance growth, and provides considerations for reducing these adverse effects to best preserve high luminosity.

The MEIC, proposed by Jefferson Lab, consists of a series of accelerators. The electron collider ring accepts electrons from CEBAF at energies from 3 to 12 GeV. Protons and ions are delivered to a booster and captured in a long bunch before ramping and transfer to the ion collider ring. The ion collider ring accelerates a small number of long ion bunches to colliding energy before they are re-bunched into a high frequency train of very short bunches for colliding. Two sets of low frequency RF systems are needed for the long ion bunch energy ramping in the booster and ion collider ring. Another two sets of high frequency RF cavities are needed for re-bunching in the ion collider ring and compensating synchrotron radiation energy loss in the electron collider ring. The requirements from energy ramping, ion beam bunching, electron beam energy compensation, collective effects, beam loading and feedback capability, RF power capability, etc. are presented. The preliminary designs of these RF systems are presented. Concepts for the baseline cavity and RF station configurations are described, as well as some options that may allow more flexible injection and acceleration schemes.

The MIEC proton and ion beams are generated, accumulated, accelerated and cooled in a new green-field ion injector complex designed specifically to support its high luminosity goal. This injector consists of sources, a linac and a small booster ring. In this paper we explore feasibility of a short ion linac that injects low energy protons and ions into the booster ring.

Electron cooling of the ion beams is one critical R&D to achieve high luminosities in JLab’s MEIC proposal. In the present MEIC design, a multi-staged cooling scheme is adapted, which includes DC electron cooling in the booster ring and bunched beam electron cooling in the collider ring at both the injection energy and the collision energy. We explored the feasibility of using both magnetized and non-magnetized electron beam for cooling, and concluded that a magnetized electron beam is necessary. Electron cooling simulation results for the newly updated MEIC design is also presented.

Construction of CepC and SppC, the proposed future energy frontier circular e+e− and pp colliders in China, provides an opportunity to realize e-p or e-A collisions in a CM energy range up to 4.1 TeV. This paper presents a preliminary conceptual design of this e-p/A collider. The design parameters and anticipated luminosities will be given. We also discuss staging approaches to realize this collider with a low cost and at an earlier time.

A local crabbing scheme requires π/2 (mod π) horizontal betatron phase advances from an interaction point (IP) to the crab cavities on each side of it. However, realistic phase advances generated by sets of quadrupoles, or Final Focusing Blocks (FFB), between the crab cavities located in the expanded beam regions and the IP differ slightly from π/2. To understand the effect of crabbing on the beam dynamics in this case, a simple model of the optics of the Medium Energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) including local crabbing was developed using linear matrices and then studied numerically over multiple turns (1000 passes) of both electron and proton bunches. The same model was applied to both local and global crabbing schemes to determine the linear-order dynamical effects of the synchro-betatron coupling induced by crabbing.

Muon accelerator beams are commonly produced indirectly through pion decay by interaction of a charged particle beam with a target. Efficient muon capture requires the muons to be first phase-rotated by rf cavities into a train of 21 bunches with much reduced energy spread. Since luminosity is proportional to the square of the number of muons per bunch, it is crucial for a Muon Collider to use relatively few bunches with many muons per bunch. In this paper we will describe a bunch merging scheme that should achieve this goal. We present for the first time a complete end-to-end simulation of a 6D bunch merger for a Muon Collider. The 21 bunches arising from the phase-rotator, after some initial cooling, are merged in longitudinal phase space into 7 bunches, which then go through 7 paths with different lengths and reach at the final collecting ”funnel” at the same time. The final single bunch has a transverse and a longitudinal emittance that matches well with the subsequent 6D rectilinear cooling scheme.

RadiaBeam, in collaboration with UCLA, is developing an inexpensive, low-energy, ultra-fast, streaked electron diffraction (S-UED) system which allows one to reconstruct a single ultrafast event with a single pulse of electrons using and RF deflector. The high-frequency (GHz), high voltage, phase-locked RF field in the deflector enables temporal resolution of atomic events as fine as sub-100 fs. In this paper, we present an overview of the system being developed and the initial experimental results. We also discuss the challenges based on our design of a UED system that incorporates a novel, high-resolution dielectric-loaded RF deflector and a solid-state X-band amplifier.

Long periodic transport channels are frequently used in accelerator complexes and suggested for using in high-energy ERLs for electron-hadron colliders. Without proper chromaticity compensation, such transport channels exhibit high sensitivity to the random orbit errors causing significant emittance growth. Such emittance growth can come from both the correlated and the uncorrelated energy spread. In this paper we present results of our theoretical and numerical studies of such effects and develop a criteria for acceptable chromaticity in such channels

We outline a plan for final muon ionization cooling with quadrupole doublets focusing onto short absorbers followed by emittance exchange in vacuum to achieve the small transverse beam sizes needed by a muon collider. A flat muon beam with a series of quadrupole doublet half cells appears to provide the strong focusing required for final cooling. Each quadrupole doublet has a low beta region occupied by a dense, low Z absorber. After final cooling, normalized xyz emittances of (0.071, 0.141, 2.4) mm-rad are exchanged into (0.025, 0.025, 70) mm-rad. Thin electrostatic septa efficiently slice the bunch into 17 parts. The 17 bunches are interleaved into a 3.7 meter long train with RF deflector cavities. Snap bunch coalescence combines the muon bunch train longitudinally in a 21 GeV ring in 55 microseconds, one quarter of a synchrotron oscillation period. A linear long wavelength RF bucket gives each bunch a different energy causing the bunches to drift until they merge into one bunch and can be captured in a short wavelength RF bucket with a 13% muon decay loss and a packing fraction as high as 87%.

Recirculating linear accelerators (RLAs) are a cost-effective method for the acceleration of muons for a muon collider in energy ranges from a couple GeV to a few 10s of GeV. Muon beams generally have longitudinal emittances that are large for the RF frequency that is used, and it is important to limit the growth of that longitudinal emittance. This has particular consequences for the arc design of the RLAs. I estimate the longitudinal emittance growth in an RLA arising from the RF nonlinearity. Given an emittance growth limitation and other design parameters, one can then compute the maximum momentum compaction in the arcs. I describe how to obtain an approximate arc design satisfying these requirements based on the deisgn in Bogacz (2005)*. Longitudinal dynamics also determine the energy spread in the beam, and this has consequences on the transverse phase advance in the linac. This in turn has consequences for the arc design due to the need to match beta functions. I combine these considerations to discuss design parameters for the acceleration of muons for a collider in an RLA from 5 to 63 GeV.

Well-polarized positive surface muons are a tool to measure the magnetic properties of materials since the precession rate of the spin can be determined from the observation of the positron directions when the muons decay. The use of the AGS complex at BNL has been explored for a muSR facility previously. Here we report simulations of a beamline with a target inside a solenoid, and of an orbit feedback system with single muon beam positioning monitors based on technology available today.

In this paper, we report on the experimental implementation of the model-dependent control of the interaction region beam waist position (s* knob) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The s* adjustment provides an alternative way of controlling the luminosity and is the only known method to control the luminosity and to reduce the pinch effect of the future eRHIC. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the s* knob in luminosity controlling and its application in the future electron ion collider, eRHIC, followed by details of the experimental demonstration of such knob in RHIC.

RHIC has provided polarized proton collisions from 31 GeV to 255 GeV in past decade. To preserve polarization through numerous depolarizing resonances through the whole accelerator chain, harmonic orbit correction, partial snakes, horizontal tune jump system and full snakes have been used. In addition, close attentions have been paid to betatron tune control, orbit control and beam line alignment. The polarization of 60% at 255 GeV has been delivered to experiments with 1.8×1011 bunch intensity. For the eRHIC era, the beam brightness has to be maintained to reach the desired luminosity. Since we only have one hadron ring in the eRHIC era, existing spin rotator and snakes can be converted to six snake configuration for one hadron ring. With properly arranged six snakes, the polarization can be maintained at 70% at 250 GeV. This paper summarizes the effort and plan to reach high polarization with small emittance for eRHIC.

Gradient errors in the multi-pass Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) machine, eRHIC, distort the beam orbit and therefore cause emittance increase. The localization and correction of gradient errors are essential for an effective orbit correction and emittance preservation. In this report, the methodology and simulation of optics correction for the multi-pass FFAG ERL machine eRHIC will be presented.

The chromaticities in the eRHIC linear non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) lattice are very large. Therefore, particles will decohere in phase space given the presence of lattice errors. The decoherence causes a deviation of the orbit response which is the basis for orbit corrections. In this report we will present a study of the linearity of the orbit response in a lattice with large chromaticity, a comparison of the results of orbit corrections for several cases together with a conclusion that correcting the average orbit with a measured orbit response works as good as an orbit correction for on-momentum particles.

We develop here on tracking simulations and their analysis, regarding end-to-end polarized e-bunch transport in presence of synchrotron radiation, magnet alignment and field errors. Simulations include the evolution of energy, orbits, emittances, polarization profiles.

RHIC polarized proton Run 15 uses a new acceleration ramp optics, compared to RHIC Run~14 and earlier runs, in relation with electron-lens beam-beam compensation developments. The new optics induces different strengths in the depolarizing snake resonance sequence, from injection to top energy. As a consequence, polarization transport along the new ramp has been investigated, based on spin tracking simulations. Sample results are reported and discussed.

Spin tracking studies in the MEIC figure-8 collider ion ring are presented, based on a preliminary design of the lattice. They provide numerical illustrations of some of the aspects of the figure-8 concept, including spin-rotator based spin control, and lay out the path towards complete spin tracking simulations.

In the FFAG version of the electron energy recovery recirculator of the eRHIC electron-ion collider project, natural chromaticity is important and not corrected. Tracking simulations illustrate various aspects of its effects on 6-D bunch dynamics over the 16 turn recirculation from 1.3 to 21.2GeV collision energy, and back down to injection energy. These effects can be mitigated via orbit control, the methodology for that is described and its effectiveness illustrated via a series of ad hoc numerical simulations. Because polarization is paramount in the eRHIC NP program, its careful monitoring is part of the simulations.

In a hybrid 6D cooling channel, cooling is accomplished by reducing the beam momentum through ionization energy loss in wedge absorbers and replenishing the momentum loss in the longitudinal direction with gas-filled rf cavities. While the gas acts as a buffer to prevent rf breakdown, gas ionization may also occur as the beam passes through a HPRF cavity. The resulting plasma, may gain substantial energy from the rf electric field which it can transfer via collisions to the gas, an effect known as plasma loading. In this paper, we investigate the influence of plasma loading on the cooling performance of a rectilinear hybrid channel. With the aid of numerical simulations we examine the sensitivity in cooling performance and plasma loading to key parameters such as the rf gradient and gas pressure.

The first part of RHIC Run 15 consisted of nine weeks of polarized proton on proton collisions at a beam energy of 100 GeV at two interaction points. In this paper we discuss several of the upgrades to the collider complex that allowed for improved performance this run. The largest effort consisted of commissioning of the electron lenses, one in each ring, which are designed to compensate one of the two beam-beam interactions experienced by the proton bunches. The e-lenses therefore raise the per bunch intensity at which luminosity becomes beam-beam limited. A new lattice was designed to create the phase advances necessary for a functioning e-lens which also has an improved off-momentum dynamic aperture relative to previous runs. In order to take advantage of the new, higher intensity limit without suffering intensity driven emittance deterioration, other features were commissioned including a continuous transverse bunch-by-bunch damper in RHIC and a double harmonic capture scheme in the Booster. Other high intensity protections include improvements to the abort system and the installation of masks to intercept beam lost due to abort kicker pre-fires.
