Space charge is one of the fundamental limitations for next generation high intensity circular accelerators. It can lead to halo growth as well as beam loss, and affect resonance structure in ways not completely understood. We employ the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER), a circular 10 keV storage machine, to experimentally study the structure of betatron resonances for beams of varying degrees of space charge intensity. Experimental techniques such as tune scans and frequency maps are employed. Results are also compared to computer simulations using the WARP code.

Accelerator lattices are designed using computer codes that solve the equations of motion for charged particles in both prescribed and self-consistent fields. These codes are run in a mode in which particles enter a lattice region, travel for a finite distance, and have their coordinates recorded to assess various figures of merit (FoMs). The lattice is then optimized by varying the positions and strengths of the focusing elements. This optimization is done in a high dimensional parameter space, requiring multiple simulations of the particle trajectories to determine the dependence of the confinement on the many parameters. Sophisticated algorithms for this optimization are being introduced. However, the process is still time consuming. We propose to alter the design process using "adjoint" techniques [*]. Incorporation of an "adjoint" calculation of the trajectories and self-fields can, in several runs, determine the gradient in parameter space of a given FoM with respect to all lattice parameters. It includes naturally self-fields and can be embedded in existing codes such as WARP or Vorpal. The theoretical basis for the method and several applications will be presented.

Preservation of the beam quality is important for attaining the desirable properties of the beam. Collective effects can produce an instability severely degrading beam emittance, momentum spread and creating filamentation of the beam. Microbunching instability for beams traveling along a curved trajectory, and space charge driven parametric transverse instabilities are well-known and in-depth studied. However, none of the above include a microbunching longitudinal instability driven by modulations of the transverse beam size. This phenomenon was observed for the first time during the commissioning of the CeC PoP experiment. Based on the dynamics of this instability we named it a Plasma-Cascade Instability (PCI). PCI can strongly intensify longitudinal micro-bunching originating from the beam’s shot noise, and even saturate it. Resulting random density and energy microstructures in the beam can become a serious problem for generating high quality electron beams. On the other hand, such instability can drive novel high-power sources of broadband radiation. In this paper we present our experimental observations of the PCI and the supporting results of the numerical simulations.

The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator is a research electron and proton storage ring recently commissioned at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology facility. Its research program is focused on testing novel techniques for improving beam stability and quality, notably the concept of non-linear integrable optics. In this paper, we report on run 1 results of experimental studies of a quasi-integrable transverse focusing system with one invariant of motion, a Henon-Heiles type system implemented with octupole magnets. Good agreement with simulations is demonstrated on key parameters of achievable tune spread, dynamic aperture, and invariant conservation. We also outline current simulation and hardware improvement efforts for run 2, planned for fall of 2019.

We present a dispersion relation that gives the complex growth rate for coupled-bunch instabilities at arbitrary chromaticity in terms of its value at zero chromaticity. We compare predictions of the theory to elegant tracking simulations, and show that there are two distinct regimes to stability depending upon whether the zero chromaticity growth rate is smaller or larger than the chromatic tune shift over the bunch. We derive an approximate expression that is easily solved numerically, and furthermore indicate how the formalism can be extended to describe arbitrary longitudinal potentials.

Beam-Beam damping of the Ion Instability The electron storage ring of the proposed electron ion collider at BNL has bunch charges as large as 50 nC and bunch spacings as small as 10 ns. For molecules like CO a dangerous buildup of positive ions is possible and a significant fraction of these ions can survive allowable clearing gaps. The instability is thus multi-turn and the weak damping required to stop the ion instabilty with an ideal clearing gap is ineffective here. The beam-beam force is highly nonlinear and a potent source of tune spread. Simulations employing several macro-particles per electron bunch and several ion macroparticles are used to estimate maximum gas densities for some common molecules. A simplified model is introduced and compared with simulations.

In the high intensity limit it can become difficult to simulate intense beams sufficiently within a short time scale due to collective effects. Semi-Analytic methods such as the Square Well Model*/AirBag Square Well** (SWM/ABS) exist to estimate collective effects within a short time scale. SWM/ABS discretizes the longitudinal confining potential into a single square well enforcing linearity for the case of linear transverse optics. A method is proposed here to extend the Square Well Method multiple square wells. This method preserves linearity properties that make it easily solvable within a short time scale as well as including nonlinear effects from the longitudinal potential shape.

An electron beam based cooling system for the ion beam is one of the commonly used approaches. The proposed two’energy storage-ring electron cooler consists of damping and cooling sections at markedly different energies connected by an energy recovering superconducting RF structure. The parameters in the cooling and damping sections are adjusted for optimum cooling of a stored ion beam and for optimum damping of the electron beam respectively. This paper briefly describes a two cavities model along with a third cavity model to accelerate and decelerate the electron beam in two energy storage ring. Based on our assumed value of equilibrium emittance shows that these models give a bunch length of the order of cm and energy spread of the order of 〖10〗-5 in the cooling section which are required parameters for the better cooling. Numerical calculations along with elegant simulation are presented.

Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) group demonstrated arbitrary longitudinal shaping capability of thee emittance exchange (EEX) beamline in 2016. Several different transverse masks were used to shape the beam transversely, and the transmission through the mask was around 40%. The masking is one of the easiest ways to control the profile, but this low transmission would make significant drop of the beam quality due to a higher charge requirement in the gun, and it can make thermal issues for high repetition rate or high intensity beams. At the same time, it only controls the profile not a 2D phase space. We recently proposed a scheme to generate a tunable bunch train using a EEX beamline with a transverse wiggler. This wiggler provides a sinusoidal magnetic field which makes a sinusoidal modulation on the transverse phase space. If the beam passes series of transverse wigglers with different period and strength, one can make arbitrary correlation on the horizontal position and momentum. It opens up totally new way to control all longitudinal properties including arbitrary current profile shaping without charge loss. In this poster, we present the concept of the work and plan.

Nonlinearities on the longitudinal phase space in-duce a double-horn current profile when the bunch is compressed strongly. Since this double-horn can de-grade the performance of FELs due to the CSR it makes, the suppression of the double-horn is one of important beam dynamics issues. Emittance exchange (EEX) can be interesting option for this issue due to its longitudinal controllability. Since EEX exchanges the longitudinal phase space and transverse phase space, higher order magnets such as octupole can control the nonlinearity. In this paper, we present simulation re-sults on the suppression of the double-horn current profile using EEX based bunch compression. We use a double EEX beamline installed at the Argonne Wake-field Accelerator facility for the simulation.

The intrinsic energy spread of electron sources limits the achievable resolution of electron microscopes in both spectroscopic and spatially resolved measurements. We propose that the TM010 mode of a single radio frequency (RF) cavity be used to dramatically reduce this energy spread in a pulsed beam. We show with analytic approximations, confirmed in simulations, that the non-linear time-energy correlations that develop in an electron gun can be undone by the RF cavity running near-crest. We derive an expression that gives the required RF field strength as a function of accelerating voltage. We explore multiple applications, including EELS and SEM. By pulsing a photocathode with commercially available, high repetition-rate lasers, our scheme could yield competitive energy spread reduction at higher currents when compared with monochromated continuous-wave sources for electron microscopes.

The proposed Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC), currently under design, relies on electron cooling in order to achieve the desired luminosity. This includes an electron beam with >55 Mev, 3.2 nC bunches that cools hadron beams with energies up to 100 GeV. To enhance the cooling, the electron beam must be magnetized with a specific eigen-emittance partition. This paper explores the use of the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility to demonstrate the generation of an electron beam with parameters consistent with those required in the JLEIC high-energy cooler. We demonstrate via simulations the generation of the required electron-beam parameters and perform a preliminary experiment to validate FAST capabilities to produce such beams.

Beam cooling enables an increase of peak and average luminosities and significantly expands the discovery potential of colliders. Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) is a high-bandwidth cooling technique that will advance the present state-of-the-art, stochastic-cooling rate by more than three orders of magnitude. A proof-of-principle demonstration with protons or heavy ions involves prohibitive costs, risks and technological challenges; however, exploration of OSC with electrons is a cost-effective alternative for studying the beam-cooling physics, optical systems and diagnostics. The ability to demonstrate OSC was a key requirement in the design of Fermilab’s Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) ring. The IOTA program will explore the physics and technology of OSC in amplified and non-amplified configurations. We also plan to investigate the cooling and manipulation of a single electron stored in the ring. The OSC apparatus is currently being fabricated, and installation will begin in the fall of 2019. In this contribution, we will describe the IOTA OSC program, the upcoming passive-OSC experimental runs and ongoing preparations for an amplified-OSC experiment

The University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) was built to explore space charge effects in the extreme - beyond the space charge limit of most existing storage rings. At the nominal operating kinetic energy of 10 keV, the beam is also non relativistic. We have experimentally verified that the current dependent coherent tune shift obeys the Laslett formula over a wide current range for a cylindrical geometry and non penetrating magnetic fields when the beam is on axis; i.e. the average closed orbit displacement around the ring is essentially zero.* In the current experiment this measurement is extended to the change in current dependent coherent tune shift as the average closed orbit is moved off axis. It can be displaced over approximately ±10 mm of the vacuum pipe diameter of 50 mm without loss of beam. Because the 36 bending magnets in UMER are very short, we treat each of them as a local kick and then increment each by a calculated small amount to achieve the desired, global closed orbit displacement. Experimental results are compared to predictions by Zotter and others.

Hadron beam cooling at high energy is a critical technique for Electron-Ion Colliders (EIC). We consider using an electron storage ring for the EIC at BNL. For such a cooler, the electron beam quality plays an important role since it directly determines the cooling rate. Besides the effects of IBS, space charge and synchrotron damping, which are calculable with well known methods, the heating effect by ions also needs to be carefully considered in electron beam dynamics. In this paper, we present an analytical model to calculate the heating rate by ions and give some example calculations. In addition, this model was benchmarked by applying it on the IBS calculation.

Connecting Gas-Scattering Lifetime and Ion Instabilities

Recently there is a renewed interest in fast ion instability (FII) which is of concern for future low-emittance electron storage rings, such as MBA light sources and colliders, i.e. eRHIC. While analytical theories and numerical codes exist to model the effect, due to various assumptions and limitations, accurate experimental verification is often desirable. Unfortunately, one of the most critical parameters for FII (as well as the classical "trapped-ion" instability), the residual ion concentration, is usually the most uncertain. Vacuum gauges and residual gas analyzers (RGAs) provide some useful data, but they are often not accurate enough, and, more importantly, they cannot directly probe the ion concentration along the beam orbit. In this paper we show how one could use gas-scattering lifetime measurements to infer the residual gas concentration suitable for ion instability experiment modelling.

Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) is a method of beam cooling using optical frequencies which compresses the phase space of the beam by correcting the deviation of each particle’s momentum. A particle bunch passing through an undulator produces radiation which is amplified and provides the corrective energy kick. In this project, we are testing a method of amplifying synchrotron radiation (SR) for the eventual use in OSC. The SR is amplified by passing through a highly-doped Chromium:Zinc Selenide (Cr:ZnSe) crystal which is pumped by a Thulium fiber laser. The SR will be produced by one of the bending magnets of the Advanced Photon Source. The first step is to detect and measure the power of SR using a photo-diode. The gain is then determined by measuring the radiation amplified after the single-pass through the crystal. This serves as a preliminary step to investigate the performance of the amplification of beam-induced radiation fields. The planned experiment is an important step towards achieving active OSC in a proof-of-principle demonstration in IOTA.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is designed to accelerate beam up to 400 kW power with kinetic energy ≥ 200 MeV/u. Fast response of the machine protection system is critical for FRIB beam commissioning and operation to prevent damage to equipment. The beam commissioning of the first linac segment, including fifteen cryomodules, has been completed. Four ion species were accelerated to a beam energy of 20.3 MeV/u with duty factors from 0.05 percent to continuous wave. The peak beam current exceeded 10 percent of the final requirements. This paper summarizes the status of the machine protection system deployed in the production, Machine interlock response time of ~8 μs was achieved. Incentives for future development include being able to achieve smooth and reliable beam operation, faster machine protection response time and real time data analysis of failure mode.

All modern projects of low-emittance synchrotrons follow Multi-Bend Achromat approach*. The low emittance is realized by arranging small horizontal beta-function and dispersion in the bending magnets, the number of which varies from 4 to 9 magnets per cell. We propose an alternative way to reach low emittance by use of a lattice element that we call "Complex Bend"**, instead of regular dipole magnets. The Complex Bend is a new concept of bending magnet consisting of a number of dipole poles interleaved with strong alternate focusing so as to maintain the beta-function and dispersion oscillating at very low values. The details of Complex Bend, considerations regarding the choice of optimal parameters, thoughts for its practical realization and use in low-emittance lattices, are discussed.

The ion source is accompanied by the generation of low frequency (LF) plasma instabilities (PI). Its signature is also visible in high current heavy ion beam required for any accelerator. These LFs affect the profile of the ion beam in transverse phase-space. These issues are investigated in detail by measuring the emittance of beam. Beam oscillations are extracted from the transverse emittance data by taking Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of it. PI frequencies are identified in the measured electromagnetic emission from the plasma, in which these frequencies appeared as sidebands around pump frequency 2.45 GHz. The PI components i.e.,ion acoustic (IA) and ion cyclotron (IC) waves are also visible in the FFT spectra. Low and high frequency oscillations in the beam are 476 kHz and ~1.3 MHz respectively. These two groups of frequencies also exist within the PI induced IA (238 - 873 kHz) and IC (1.29 - 1.3 MHz) frequency ranges. The measured emittance (rms-normalized) in horizontal and vertical phase-space varies from 0.002-0.098 𝜋 mm mrad and 0.004-0.23 𝜋 mm mrad respectively. PI induced beam oscillation is the reason behind such broad transverse emittance growth.

The first experimental run of Fermilab’s Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) ring aimed at testing the concept of nonlinear integrable beam optics. In this report we present the preliminary results of the studies of a nonlinear focusing system with two invariants of motion realized with the special elliptic-potential magnet. The key measurement of this experiment was the horizontal and vertical betatron tune shift as a function of transverse amplitude. A vertical kicker strength was varied to change the betatron amplitude for several values of the nonlinear magnet strength. The turn-by-turn positions of the 100 MeV electron beam at twenty-one beam position monitors around the ring were captured and used for the analysis of phase-space trajectories.

Ultrafast Electron Microscopy (UEM) is a powerful tool to observe ultrafast dynamical processes in sample materials at the atomic level. By collaborating with KRISS and GIST, the future accelerator R&D team at KAERI has been developing a UEM facility based on a photo-emission S-band (=2856 MHz) RF gun. Recently, we have added an alpha magnet in the beamline layout of the UEM to improve beam qualities such as emittance, divergence, energy spread, and bunch length. To achieve high spatial and time resolutions, we have been optimizing those beam parameters and other machine parameters by performing numerous ASTRA and ELEGANT code simulations. In this paper, we describe our ASTRA and ELEGANT code optimizations to obtain high-quality beam parameters for the UEM facility with a photo-emission S-band RF gun and an alpha magnet.

This paper is dedicated to the analysis of our recent experience from ramp-up of operating current at NSLS-II from 25 mA at the end of commissioning in 2014 to 475 mA achieved in studies today. To approach the design level of the ring intensity we had to solve major problems in overheating of the chamber components. Since the beginning of the NSLS-II commissioning, the temperature of the vacuum components has been monitored by the Resistance Temperature Detectors located predominantly outside of the vacuum chamber and attached to the chamber body. A couple of vacuum components were designed with the possibility for internal temperature measurements under the vacuum as diagnostic assemblies. Temperature map helps us to control overheating of the vacuum components around the ring especially during the current ramp-up. The average current of 475mA has been achieved with two main 500MHz RF cavities and w/o any harmonic cavities. In this paper we discuss the heating results for a 15ps bunch length (at low current) of the following vacuum components: Large Aperture BPM, Small Aperture BPM, Bellows, Flanges, Ceramics Chambers and Stripline Kickers.

An 800 MeV 100 µA proton beam is delivered to the Lujan Center, one of five user facilities at the LANSCE linear accelerator center, to generate an intense beam of pulsed neutrons. The Lujan Center beam transport line, known as 1L beamline, is over 68 meters in length, starting from the ROWS01. The beamline is consisted with bending and focusing elements before it reaches the end of the 1L beam optics system, where the beam spot size is nominally 1.5 cm (RMS). The Mark IV target assembly has been designed to optimize the neutron production for the 1L target in the Lujan center to improve the flux and resolution. As part of the safety review of this design, it becomes necessary to know the beam intensity and size on the new target. Using the new measurements of the beamline, calculated beam sizes using the LANL version of the beam envelope code TRANSPORT and CERN code MAD-X are compared. The input beam parameters for the codes were extracted from ORBIT analysis of the proton storage ring beam. Beam envelope measurements were made at various locations throughout the beamline using wire scanners. The predicted beam envelopes and measured data agree within expected errors.
