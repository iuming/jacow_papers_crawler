From http://journals.aps.org/prab/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.18.082802: "A transverse profile imager for ultrabright electron beams is presented, which overcomes resolution issues in present designs by observing the Scheimpflug imaging condition as well as the Snell- Descartes law of refraction in the scintillating crystal. Coherent optical transition radiation emitted by highly compressed electron bunches on the surface of the crystal is directed away from the camera, allowing to use the monitor for profile measurements of electron bunches suitable for X-ray free electron lasers…" The detector design and it's integration for routine use with a transverse mode deflecting cavity will be reviewed with experimental data from the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility.

The performance of a Free-Electron Laser (FEL) depends in part on the quality of the magnetic field in the undulator. Imperfections in the magnetic field of an undulator lead to an imperfect electron trajectory, both offset and angle, as well as a relative phase error between the oscillation phase of the electrons and the generated electromagnetic field. The result of such errors is a reduction of laser gain impacting overall FEL performance. A pulsed-wire method can be used to determine the profile of the magnetic field. This is achieved by sending a square-current pulse through a wire placed along the length of the axis that will induce a Lorentz-force interaction with the magnetic field. Measurement of the resulting displacement in the wire over time using a motion detector yields the first or second integrals of the magnetic field and so provides a measure of the local magnetic field strength. Dispersion in the wire can be corrected using algorithms, with a resulting increase in overall accuracy of the measurement. We have designed, constructed and tested a pulsed-wire magnetic measurement system and used this system to characterize the CSU FEL undulator.

Funding: SNS is managed by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 for the U.S. Department of Energy. The work has been partially supported by NSF grant 1535312
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a method for measuring the full 6D phase space of an low energy, high intensity hadron beam. This is done by combining 4D emittance measurement techniques along with dispersion measurement and a beam shape monitor to provide the energy and phase space components. The measurement will be performed on new Beam Testing Facility (BTF) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), a 2.5 MeV functional duplicate of the SNS accelerator front end.

A novel pressurized gas-filled multi-RF-cavity beam profile monitor has been studied that is simple and robust in high-radiation environments. Charged particles passing through each RF-cavity in the monitor produce intensity-dependent ionized plasma, which changes the gas permittivity. The sensitivity to beam intensity is adjustable using gas pressure and RF gradient. The performance of the gas-filled beam profile monitor has been numerically simulated to evaluate the sensitivity of permittivity measurements. The result indicates that the RF resonator will be useful to measure the beam profile with a charged beam intensity range from 106 to 1013 protons/bunch. The range covers the expected beam intensities in NuMI and LBNF. The demonstration of the monitor with intense proton beams are taken place at Fermilab to validate the simulation result. The result will be given in this presentation.

Ultrashort electron beams are essential for light sources and time-resolved measurements. Electron beams can emit terahertz (THz) pulses using coherent transition radiation (CTR). Michelson interferometer* is one of candidates for analyzing the pulse width of an electron beam based on frequency-domain analysis. Recently, electron beam measurement using a photoconductive antenna (PCA)** based on time-domain analysis has been investigated. In this presentation, measurement of femtosecond electron beam with 35 MeV energy and < 1 nC from a photocathode based linac will be reported. Frequency- and time- domain analysis of THz pulse of CTR by combining the interferometer and PCA will be carried out.
