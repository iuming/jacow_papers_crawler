Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a promising method for cancer therapy. A few accelerator-based BNCT projects are in progress in Japan, and plans for such systems are discussed in Europe, China, Taiwan and Korea. To obtain sufficient epi-thermal neutron flux, 30-50 kW of proton beam power is required. This talk reviews the present situation of the BNCT projects in the world. Key issues for the stable production of epi-thermal neutrons for medical applications are discussed. This includes the type of accelerator (linac or cyclotron), the selection of proton energy (3 MeV, 8 MeV, or 30 MeV), the coice of target (Li or Be) and moderator.
