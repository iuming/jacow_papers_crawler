The reliable and stable operation of the accelerator is the premise and foundation of physics experiments. For example, in the BEPCII, the fault of the magnet power supply front-end electronics devices may cause accelerator energy instability and even lead to beam loss. Therefore, it is very necessary to diagnose and locate the device fault accurately and rapidly, that will induce the high cost of the accelerator operation. Faults diagnosis can not only improve the safety and reliability of the equipment, but also effectively reduce the equipment's cycle costing. The multi-signal flow model proposed by Pattipati K.R is considered as the preferred method of industrial equipment faults detection. However, there are still some problems about fault probability conflict in the processing of correlation matrix diagnosis due to the hierarchical nature of multi-signal flow modeling. Thus we develop the fault diagnosis strategy based on the important prior knowledge of the fault. This method is applied to the front-end electronic devices of BEPCII magnet power supply control system and improves the fault diagnosis and analysis ability of magnet power supply control system.

With many synchrotron facilities retiring or going through upgrades, what is the future of the some of the state-of-the-art equipment and the beamlines built for a specific science at these older facilities? Can the past investments continue supporting the current scientific mission? Beamlines Developed by NSLS2 (BDN) started in 2013 as the NxtGen project prior to NSLS last light on September, 30 2014. Hundreds of pieces of equipment still scientifically useful and valuable have been collected, packed and stored to become part of the new beamlines at the NSLS2 complex. CMS and TES beamlines were built in 2016 in 6 month from bare hutches to the First Light and are already doing user science. QAS, XFM, FIS/MET are taking first light in late 2017/early 2018 and users in 2018. Repurposed components have been fitted with standard NSLS2 EPICS based control systems, Delta Tau motion controllers, digital imaging. Intensity monitors and diagnostics have been equipped with new electronics. Data collection is performed via home grown customizable, beamline specific Bluesky Data Acquisition System. Status of the project and an overview of controls efforts will be presented.

The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project is an international initiative to build a next generation ground-based observatory for very high energy gamma-rays. Three classes of telescopes with different mirror size will be located in the northern and southern hemispheres. The ASTRI mini-array of CTA preproduction is one of the small sized telescopes mini-arrays proposed to be installed at the CTA southern site. The ASTRI mini-array will consist of nine units based on the end-to-end ASTRI SST-2M prototype already installed on Mt. Etna (Italy). The mini-array software system (MASS) supports the end to end ASTRI SST-2M prototype and miniarray operations. The ASTRI software integration team defined the procedures to perform effectively the integration test and release activities. The developer has to properly use the repository tree and branches according to the development status. We require that the software includes also specific sections for automated tests and that the software is well tested (in simulated and real system) before any release. Here we present the method adopted to release the first MASS version to support the ASTRI SST-2M prototype test and operation activities.

The development of process control systems for the cryogenic infrastructure at CERN is based on an automatic software generation approach. The overall complexity of the systems, their frequent evolution as well as the extensive use of databases, repositories, commercial engineering software and CERN frameworks led to further efforts towards improving the existing automation based software production methodology. A large number of control system upgrades were successfully performed for the Cryogenics in the LHC accelerator, applying the Continuous Integration practice integrating all software production tasks, tools and technologies. The production and maintenance of the control software for multiple cryogenic applications became more reliable while significantly reducing the required time and effort. This concept became a guideline for development of process control software for new cryogenic systems at CERN. This publication presents the software production methodology, as well as the summary of several years of experience with the enhanced automated control software production, already implemented for the Cryogenics of the LHC accelerator and the CERN cryogenic test facilities.

Two years ago, SOLEIL (France) and MAXIV(Sweden) synchrotron light sources started a joint project to partially fund two similar in-vacuum diffractometers to be installed at the tender X-ray beamlines SIRIUS and FemtoMAX . SOLEIL diffractometer, manufactured by the French company SYMETRIE* and complementarily funded by a <Ile de France> region project (DIM Oxymore) gathering SIRIUS beamline and other laboratories, features an in-vacuum 4-circles goniometer and two hexapods. The first hexapod is used for the alignment of the vacuum vessel, and the second one for the alignment of the sample stage which is mounted on the 4-circles diffractometer. In order to integrate efficiently this complex mechanical experimental station into SOLEIL control architecture based on TANGO and DeltaTau motion controller, SOLEIL and SYMETRIE work in a close collaboration. Synchronization of the different elements of the diffractometer is a key issue in this work to get a good sphere of confusion thanks to corrections done by the in vacuum hexapod. This paper details this collaboration, status of the project in terms of control system capabilities and the results of the first tests.

The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is currently under construction in Hawaii. The telescope control system comprises a significant number of subsystems to coordinate the operation of the telescope and its instruments. Integrating delivered subsystems into the control framework and managing existing subsystem versions requires careful management, including processes that provide confidence in the current operational state of the whole control system. Continuous software Quality Assurance provides test metrics on these systems using a Testing Automation Framework (TAF), which provides system and assembly test capabilities to ensure that software and control requirements are met. This paper discusses the requirements for a Quality Assurance program and the implementation of the TAF to execute it.

The operation of the CERN tertiary infrastructures is carried out via a series of control systems distributed over the CERN sites. The scope comprises: 260 buildings, 2 large heating plants with 27 km heating network and 200 radiators circuits, 500 air handling units, 52 chillers, 300 split systems, 3000 electric boards and 100k light points. With the infrastructure consolidations, CERN is carrying out a migration and an extension of the old control systems dated back to the 70's, 80's and 90's to a new simplified, yet innovative, distributed control system aimed at minimizing the programming and implementation effort, standardizing equipment and methods and reducing lifecycle costs. This new methodology allows for a rapid development and simplified integration of the new controlled infrastructure processes. The basic principle is based on open standards PLC technology that allows to easily interface to a large range of proprietary systems. The local and remote operation and monitoring is carried out seamlessly with Web HMIs that can be accessed via PC, touchpads or mobile devices. This paper reports on the progress and future challenges of this new control system.

Lanzhou All Permanent magnet ECR ion source No.2 (LAPECR2) is the ion source for 320 kV multidiscipline research platform for highly charged ions. Its old control system has been used for nearly 12 years and some prob-lems have been gradually exposed and affected its daily operation. A set of PLC from Beckhoff company is in charge of the control of magnet power supplies, diagnos-tics and motion control. EPICS and Control System Studio (CSS) as well other packages are used in this facility as the control software toolkit. Based on these state-of-the-art technologies on both hardware and software, this paper designed and implemented a new control system for LAPECR2. After about half a year of running, the new control reflects its validity and stability in this facility.

CERNs Accelerator Fault Tracking (AFT) system aims to facilitate answering questions like: "Why are we not doing Physics when we should be?" and "What can we do to increase machine availability?" People have tracked faults for many years, using numerous, diverse, distributed and un-related systems. As a result, and despite a lot of effort, it has been difficult to get a clear and consistent overview of what is going on, where the problems are, how long they last for, and what is the impact. This is particularly true for the LHC, where faults may induce long recovery times after being fixed. The AFT project was launched in February 2014 as collaboration between the Controls and Operations groups with stakeholders from the LHC Availability Working Group (AWG). The AFT system has been used successfully in operation for LHC since 2015, yielding a lot of attention and generating a growing user community. In 2017 the scope has been extended to cover the entire Injector Complex. This paper will describe the AFT system and the way it is used in terms of architecture, features, user communities, workflows and added value for the organisation.

SLAC's SPEAR3 Booster RF system was recently upgraded where the existing klystron providing RF power to a 5-cell cavity was replaced with a Solid State Amplifier (SSA). The Low Level RF Controls (LLRF) to drive the SSA was provided by a high performance FPGA based system built on SLAC ATCA modules. RF Cavity Tuner Controls were replaced with EtherCAT-based stepper motor controller. New hardware was designed and built for PLC-based Machine Protection System (MPS). Fast digitizers to sample and acquire LLRF signals were implemented in a LinuxRT Server. All of these required new Controls Software implementation. This poster illustrates the Controls associated with each of the above hardware.

The GANIL facility is drastically extending its possibilities with new projects, so increasing its capabilities in nuclear physics. The most significant one is the Spiral2 installation based on a linear accelerator, then to be associated with the S3, NFS and DESIR new experimental rooms. Beside of the legacy home made control system handling the original installation, Epics was chosen as the basic framework for these projects. First, some control system components were used during preliminary beam tests. In parallel, the whole architecture was designed while the organization for future operation started to be considered; also, more structured and sophisticated tools were developed and the first high level applications for the whole machine tuning started to be tested, jointly with the current onsite beam commissioning. Progression of the control system development is presented, from the first beam tests up to the whole Spiral2 commissioning. Then, according to the new projects to cope with, some highlights are given concerning the related organization as well as specific items and developments to be considered, taking benefit from the Spiral2 control system feedback experience.

For the new FAIR accelerator complex at GSI the settings management system LSA is used. It is developed in collaboration with CERN and until now it is executed strictly serial. Nowadays the performance gain of single core processors have nearly stagnated and multicore processors dominate the market. This evolution forces software projects to make use of the parallel hardware to increase their performance. In this thesis LSA is analyzed and parallelized using different parallelization patterns like task and loop parallelization. The most common case of user interaction is to change specific settings so that the accelerator performs at its best. For each changed setting, LSA needs to calculate all child settings of the parameter hierarchy. To maximize the speedup of the calculations, they are also optimized sequentially. The used data structures and algorithms are reviewed to ensure minimal resource usage and maximal compatibility with parallel execution. The overall goal of this thesis is to speed up the calculations so that the results can be shown in a user interface with nearly no noticeable latency.

An automated tool for converting MATLAB based controls algorithms into C codes, executable directly on EPICS process control computers (IOCs), was developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Based on this tool, several high level control applications were embedded into the IOCs, which are directly connected to the control system sensors and actuators. Such embedded applications have significantly reduced the network traffic, and thus the data handling latency, which increased the reliability of the control system. The paper concentrates on the most important components of the automated tool and the performance of MATLAB algorithms converted by this tool.

For many years, we have used a commercial real-time operating system to run EPICS on VME controller boards. However, with the availability of EPICS on Linux it became more and more charming to use Linux not only for PCs, but for VME controller boards as well. With a true multi-process environment, open source software and all standard Linux tools available, development and debugging promised to become much easier. Also the cost factor looked attractive, given that Linux is for free. However, we had to learn that there is no such thing as a free lunch. While developing EPICS support for the VME bus interface was quite straight forward, pitfalls waited at unexpected places. We present challenges and solutions encountered while making Linux based real-time VME controllers the main control system component in SwissFEL.

Modbus-TCP is the Modbus RTU protocol with the TCP interface running on Ethernet. In our applications, an XPort device utilizing Modbus-TCP is used to control remote devices and communicates with the accelerator control system (EPICS). Modbus software provides a layer between the standard EPICS asyn support and EPICS asyn for TCP/IP or serial port driver. The EPICS application for each specific Modbus device is developed and it can be deployed on a soft IOC. The configuration of XPort and Modbus-TCP is easy to setup and suitable for applications that do not require high-speed communications. Additionally, the use of Ethernet makes it quicker to develop instrumentation for remote deployment. An eight-channel 24-bit Data Acquisition (DAQ) system is used to test the hardware and software capabilities.

RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) is a cyclotron-based heavy-ion accelerator facility for producing unstable nuclei and studying their properties. Many components of the RIBF accelerator complex are controlled by using the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS). We will here present the overview of the EPICS-based RIBF control system and its latest update work in progress. We are developing a new beam interlock system from scratch for applying to some of the small experimental facility in the RIBF accelerator complex. The new beam interlock system is based on a programmable logic controller (PLC) as well as the existing beam interlock system of RIBF (BIS), however, we newly employ a Linux-based PLC-CPU on which EPICS programs can be executed in addition to a sequencer in order to speed up the system. After optimize the performance of the system while continuing operation, we plan to expand the new system as a successor to the BIS that has been working more than 10 years since the start of its operation.

As part of the UK's in-kind contribution to the European Spallation Source, ISIS is working alongside the ESS and other partners to develop a new data streaming system for managing and distributing neutron experiment data. The new data streaming system is based on the open-source distributed streaming platform Apache Kafka. A central requirement of the system is to be able to supply live experiment data for processing and visualisation in near real-time via the Mantid data analysis framework. There already exists a basic TCP socket-based data streaming system at ISIS, but it has limitations in terms of scalability, reliability and functionality. The intention is for the new Kafka-based system to replace the existing system at ISIS. This migration will not only provide enhanced functionality for ISIS but also an opportunity for developing and testing the system prior to use at the ESS.

SKA (Square Kilometer Array) is a project aimed to build a very large radio-telescope, composed by thousands of antennae and related support systems. The overall orchestration is performed by the Telescope Manager (TM), a suite of software applications. In order to ensure the proper and uninterrupted operation of TM, a local monitoring and control system is developed, called TM Services. Fault Management (FM) is one of these services, and is composed by processes and infrastructure associated with detecting, diagnosing and fixing faults, and finally returning to normal operations. The aim of the study, introducing artificial intelligence algorithms during the detection phase, is to build a predictive model, based on the history and statistics of the system, in order to perform trend analysis and failure prediction. Based on monitoring data and health status detected by the software system monitor and on log files gathered by the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) server, the predictive model ensures that the system is operating within its normal operating parameters and takes corrective actions in case of failure.

TLS (Taiwan light Source) is a 1.5 GeV synchrotron light source at NSRRC which has been operating for users more than twenty year. There are many toolkits that are delivered to find out downtime responsibility and processing solution. New alarm system with EPICS interface is also applied in these toolkits to keep from machine fail of user time in advance. These toolkits are tested and modified in the TLS and enhance beam availability. The relative operation experiences will be migrated to TPS (Taiwan photon source) in the future after long term operation and big data statistic. These analysis and implement results of system will be reported in this conference.

The Beam Synchrotron Radiation Telescope (BSRT) is routinely used for estimating the transverse beam size, pro'le and emittance in the LHC; quantities playing a crucial role in the optimisation of the luminosity levels required by the experiments. During the 2017 LHC run, the intensi'ed analog cameras used by this system to image the beam have been replaced by GigE digital cameras coupled to image intensi'ers. Preliminary tests revealed that the typically used sub-image rectangles of 128×128 pixels can be acquired at rates of up to 400 frames per second, more than 10 times faster than the previous acquisition rate. To address the increase in CPU workload for the image processing, new VME CPU cards (Intel 4 core/2.5GHz/8GB RAM) are envisaged to be installed (replacing the previous Intel Core 2 Duo/1.5GHz/1GB RAM). This paper focuses on the software changes proposed in order to take advantage of the multi-core capabilities of the new CPU for parallel computations. It will describe how beam profile calculations can be pipe-lined through a thread pool while ensuring that the CPU keeps up with the increased data rate. To conclude, an analysis of the system performance will be presented.

The 1.7GeV light source BESSY II features about 50 beamlines overbooked by a factor of 2 on the average. Thus availability of high quality synchrotron radiation (SR) is a central asset. SR users at BESSY II can base their beam time expectations on numbers generated according to the common operation metrics*. Major failures of the facility are analyzed according to * and displayed in real time, analysis of minor detriments are provided regularly by off line tools. Many operational constituents are required for extraordinary availability figures: meaningful alarming and dissemination of notifications, complete logging of program, device, system and operator activities, post mortem analysis and data mining tools. Preventive and corrective actions are enabled by consequent root cause analysis based on accurate eLog entries, trouble ticketing and consistent failure classifications. This paper describes the tool sets, developments, their implementation status and some showcase results at BESSY II.

The Industrial Controls and Safety systems group at CERN, in collaboration with other groups, has developed and currently maintains around 200 controls applications that include domains such as LHC magnet protection, cryogenics and electrical network supervision systems. Millions of value changes and alarms from many devices are archived to a centralised Oracle database but it is not easy to obtain high-level statistics from such an archive. A system based on the Elastic Stack has been implemented in order to provide easy access to these statistics. This system provides aggregated statistics based on the number of value changes and alarms, classified according to several criteria such as time, application domain, system and device. The system can be used, for example, to detect abnormal situations and alarm misconfiguration. In addition to these statistics each application generates text-based log files which are parsed, collected and displayed using the Elastic Stack to provide centralised access to all the application logs. Further work will explore the possibilities of combining the statistics and logs to better understand the behaviour of CERN's controls applications.

This paper describes the concept of a generic data analytics reporting tool for SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems at CERN. The tool is a response to a growing demand for smart solutions in the supervision and analysis of control systems data. Large scale data analytics is a rapidly advancing field, but simply performing the analysis is not enough; the results must be made available to the appropriate users (for example operators and process engineers). The tool can report data analytics for objects such as valves and PID controllers directly into the SCADA systems used for operations. More complex analyses involving process interconnections (such as correlation analysis based on machine learning) can also be displayed. A pilot project is being developed for the WinCC Open Architecture (WinCC OA) SCADA system using Hadoop for storage. The reporting tool obtains the metadata and analysis results from Hadoop using Impala, but can easily be switched to any database system that supports SQL standards.

Current trends in the architectures of software systems focus our attention on building systems using a set of loosely coupled components, each providing a specific functionality known as service. It is not much different in control and monitoring systems, where a functionally distinct sub-system can be identified and independently designed, implemented, deployed and maintained. One functionality that renders itself perfectly to becoming a service is archiving the history of the system state. The design of such a service and our experience of using it are the topic of this article. The service is built with responsibility segregation in mind, therefore, it provides for reducing data processing on the data viewer side and separation of data access and modification operations. The service architecture and the details concerning its data store design are discussed. An implementation of a service client capable of archiving EPICS process variables and LabVIEW shared variables is presented. The use of a gateway service for saving data from GE iFIX is also outlined. Data access tools, including a browser-based data viewer (HTML 5) and a mobile viewer (Android app), are also presented.

Accessing database resources from Accelerator Controls servers or applications with JDBC/ODBC and other dedicated programming interfaces have been common for many years. However, availability and performance limitations of these technologies were obvious as rich web and mobile communication technologies became more mainstream. HTTP REST services have become a more reliable and common way for easy accessibility for most types of data resources, include databases. Several commercial database REST services have become available in recent years, each with their own pros and cons. This paper presents a way for setting up a generic HTTP REST database service with technology that combines the advantages of application servers (such as Glassfish), JDBC drivers, and Java technology to make major RDBMS systems easy to access and handle data in a secure way. This allows database clients to retrieve data (user data or meta data) in standard formats such as XML or JSON.

Bunch Arrival time Monitor (BAM) is a precise beam diagnostics instrument assessing the accelerator stability on-line. It is one of the most important components of the SwissFEL facility at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The overall monitor complexity demands the development of an extremely reliable control system that handles basic BAM operations. A prototype of such a system was created at PSI. The system is very flexible. It provides a set of tools allowing one to implement a number of advanced control features such as tagging experimental data with a SwissFEL machine pulse number or embedding high level control applications into the process controllers (IOC). The paper presents the structure of the BAM control setup. The operational experience with this setup is also discussed.

In fusion experiment, real-time network is essential to control plasma real-time network used to transfer the diagnostic data from diagnostic device and command data from PCS(Plasma Control System). Among the data, transmitting image data from diagnostic system to other system in real-time is difficult than other type of data. Because, image has larger data size than other type of data. To transmit the images, it need to have high throughput and best-effort property. And To transmit the data in real-time manner, the network need to has low-latency. RTPS(Real Time Publish Subscribe) is reliable and has Quality of Service properties to enable best effort protocol. In this paper, eProsima Fast RTPS was used to implement RTPS based real-time network. Fast RTPS has low latency, high throughput and enable to best-effort and reliable publish and subscribe communication for real-time application via standard Ethernet network. This paper evaluates Fast RTPS about suitability to real-time image data transmission system. To evaluate performance of Fast RTPS base system, Publisher system publish image data and multi subscriber system subscribe image data.

This paper describes the version control of oracle databases across different environments. The basis of this paper is the collaboration between the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research (GSI) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The goal is to provide a sufficient and practical concept to improve database synchronization and version control for a specific database landscape for the two research facilities. First, the relevant requirements for both research facilities were identified and compared, leading to the creation of a shared catalog of requirements. In the process database tools, such as Liquibase and Flyway, were used and integrated as prototypes into the Oracle system landscape. During the implementation of prototypes several issues were identified, which arise out of the established situation of two collaborating departments of the research facilities. Requirements on the prototype were, to be flexible enough to adapt to the given conditions of the database landscape. The creation of a flexible and adjustable system enables the two research facilities to use, synchronize and update the shared database landscape.

ALICE Data Point Service (ADAPOS) is a software architecture being developed for the Run 3 period of LHC, as a part of the effort to transmit conditions data from ALICE Detector Control System (DCS) to GRID, for distributed processing. ADAPOS uses Distributed Information Management (DIM), 0MQ, and ALICE Data Point Processing Framework (ADAPRO). DIM and 0MQ are multi-purpose application-level network protocols. DIM and ADAPRO are being developed and maintained at CERN. ADAPRO is a multi-threaded application framework, supporting remote control, and also real-time features, such as thread affinities, records aligned with cache line boundaries, and memory locking. ADAPOS and ADAPRO are written in C++14 using OSS tools, Pthreads, and Linux API. The key processes of ADAPOS, Engine and Terminal, run on separate machines, facing different networks. Devices connected to DCS publish their state as DIM services. Engine gets updates to the services, and converts them into a binary stream. Terminal receives it over 0MQ, and maintains an image of the DCS state. It sends copies of the image, at regular intervals, over another 0MQ connection, to a readout process of ALICE Data Acquisition.

Since the beginning of computer era the storing and analyzing the data was one of the main focuses of IT systems. Therefore, it is no wonder that the users and operators of the coming FAIR complex have expressed a strong requirement to collect the data coming from different accelerator components and store it for the future analysis of the accelerator performance and its proper function. This task will be performed by the Archiving System, a component, which will be developed by FAIRs Controls team in cooperation with XLAB d.o.o., Slovenia. With more than 2000 devices, over 50000 parameters and around 30 MB of data per second to store, the Archiving System will face serious challenges in terms of performance and scalability. Besides of the actual storage complexity, the system will also need to provide the mechanisms to access the data in an efficient matter. Fortunately, there are open source products available on the market, which may be utilized to perform the given tasks. This paper presents the first conceptual design of the coming system, the challenges and choices met, as well as the integration in the coming FAIR system landscape.

The vacuum group is responsible for the operation and consolidation of vacuum systems across all CERN accelerators. Concerning over 15 000 pieces of control equipment, the maintenance management requires the usage of an Enterprise Asset Management system (EAM), where the life-cycle of every individual equipment is managed from reception through decommissioning. On vacuum SCADA, the operators monitor and interact with equipment that were declared in the vacuum database (vacDB). The creation of work orders and the follow up of the equipment is done through inforEAM, which has its own database. These two databases need to be coupled, so that equipment accessible on the SCADA are available in inforEAM for maintenance management. This paper describes the underlying architecture and technologies behind vacDM, a web application that ensures the consistency between vacDB and inforEAM, thus guaranteeing that the equipment displayed in the vacuum SCADA is available in inforEAM. In addition to this, vacDM performs the management of equipment labelling jobs by assigning equipment codes to new equipment, and by automatically creating their corresponding assets in inforEAM.

The European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS) in Lund, Sweden, is building large-scale infrastructure that is projected to include hundreds of programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Given the future large-scale deployment of PLCs at ESS, we therefore explored ways of automating some of the tasks associated with PLC programming. We designed and implemented PLC Factory, which is an application written in Python that facilitates large-scale PLC development. With PLC Factory, we managed to automate repetitive tasks associated with PLC programming and interfacing PLCs with an EPICS database. A key part of PLC Factory is its embedded domain-specific programming language PLCF#, which makes it possible to define dynamic substitutions. Using a database for configuration management, PLC Factory is able to generate both EPICS database records as well as code blocks in Structured Control Language (SCL) for the Siemens product TIA Portal. Hierarchies of devices of arbitrary depth are taken into account, which means that dependencies of devices are correctly resolved. PLC Factory is in active use at ESS.

This paper presents the Automatic RElease Service (ARES) developed by the Industrial Controls and Safety systems group at CERN. ARES provides tools and techniques to fully automate the software release procedure. The service replaces release mechanisms, which in some cases were cumbersome and error prone, by an automated procedure where the software release and publication is completed with a few mouse clicks. ARES allows optimizing the time and the work to be performed by developers in order to carry out a new release. Consequently, this enables more frequent releases and therefore a quicker reaction to user requests. The service uses standard technologies (Jenkins, Nexus, Maven, Drupal, MongoDB) to checkout, build, package and deploy software components to different repositories (Nexus, EDMS), as well as the final publication to Drupal web sites.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be the world's largest and most sensitive radio observatory ever built. SKA is currently completing the pre-construction phase before initiating mass construction phase 1, in which two arrays of radio antennas - SKA1-Mid and SKA1-Low - will be installed in the South Africa's Karoo region and Western Australia's Murchinson Shire, each covering a different range of radio frequencies. The SKA1-Mid array comprises 130 15-m diameter dish antennas observing in the 350 MHz-14 GHz range and will be remotely orchestrated by the SKA Telescope Manager (TM) system. To enable onsite and remote operations each dish will be equipped with a Local Monitoring and Control (LMC) system responsible to directly manage and coordinate antenna instrumentation and subsystems, providing a rolled-up monitoring view and high-level control to TM. This paper gives a status update of the antenna instrumentation and control software design and provides details on the LMC software prototype being developed.

The high brilliance Gamma Beam System (GBS) at ELI-NP will deliver quasi-monochromatic gamma beams with a high spectral density (10, 000 photons/s/eV) and high degree of linear polarization (>95%). The Gamma Beam Delivery and Diagnostics (GBDD) of ELI-NP is implemented to deliver the gamma beams to the experimental setups and to monitor the characteristics of the beams. An EPICS control system is developed for the GBDD to support two main categories of equipment: i) equipment for the delivery of the gamma beam including vacuum systems, collimators, alignment platforms, and moveable beam dumps; ii) devices to be used during the operation of the GBS for diagnostics and monitoring including digitizers, power supplies, detectors, and profile system. High-level applications for the Gamma Beam diagnostics system are under development to complement the real-time measurements and monitoring including energy spread measurement, flux and polarization measurement, spatial profile monitor and time structure monitor. This paper describes all the aspects of the EPICS Control System for ELI-NP GBDD, including the hardware integration, network architecture, and high-level applications.

One yet unanswered questions in physics today concerns the action of gravity upon antimatter. The GBAR experiment proposes to measure the free fall acceleration of neutral antihydrogen atoms. Installation of the project at CERN (ELENA) began in late 2016. This research project is facing new challenges and needs flexibility with hardware and software. EPICS modularity and distributed architecture has been tested for control system and to provide flexibility for future installation improvement. This paper describes the development of the software and the set of software tools that are being used on the project.

In NSC KIPT, Kharkov, Ukraine the state of art nuclear facility Neutron Source on the base of subcritical assembly driven with 100 MeV/100 kW electron linear accelerator has been build. The electron beam generates neutrons during bombarding the tungsten or uranium target. The subcritical assembly of low enrichment uranium is used to multiply the initial neutrons due to fission of the uranium nuclei. The facility is the first world facility of such kind. It is supposed that maximal value of multiplying neutron factor in the source will be equal to 0.95. So, the neutron flux will be increased as much as 50 times. Because of sub-criticality the facility eliminates the possibility to produce the self-sustained chain reaction. Now the Neutron source is under commissioning. In the report the facility and its control system current status is presented.

The Australian Square Kilometre Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a radio telescope array in Western Australia. A third of the 36 telescopes forming the array have been fully commissioned and are in use under the early science program. The construction phase for the rest of the array has now completed and commissioning is continuing. This report continues on from the last status update and addresses new challenges as the telescope moves into the operational phase. The architecture of the system has proven robust, however some of the third party software choices have been reviewed as new software packages have appeared in the years since the initial adoption. We present the reasoning behind replacing some of our processes and software packages to ensure long-term operation of the instrument.

LIGHT (Linac Image Guided Hadron Technology) is a particle therapy system* developed by Advanced Oncotherapy plc. Accelerator, control and interlock systems are developed by its subsidiary A.D.A.M. SA, a CERN spin-off. The system is being designed to accelerate protons up to 230 MeV using a modular and compact 25-meter-long linear accelerator. It is being designed to operate in pulsed mode where beam properties (energy, pulse charge and spot size) can be changed at 200 Hz. The LIGHT product will be installed in different facilities. As such, the installations will differ in accelerator and beam transfer line layouts, number of treatment rooms (with an optional gantry), facility services, equipment suppliers and equipment versions. Thus the control and interlock systems need to be extensible through configuration and modularization. To achieve this, the control system relies on a multi-tier architecture with a clear separation between front-end devices and controllers. To minimize time-to-market, the systems rely mostly on COTS hardware and software, including a timing and triggering system and a light-weight software framework to standardize front-end controllers.
* The LIGHT Proton Therapy System is still subject to conformity assessment by AVO's Notified Body as well as clearance by the USA-FDA

Funding: The work described was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science via the Isotope Development and Production for Research and Applications subprogram in the Office of Nuclear Physics.
Isotopes produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) are saving lives, advancing cutting-edge research, and helping to address national security questions. For the past two years LANL's Accelerator Operations & Technology Division has executed a $6.4M improvement project for the Isotope Production Facility. The goals are to reduce the programmatic risk and enhance facility reliability while at the same time pursuing opportunities to increase general isotope production capacity. This has led to some exciting innovations. In this paper we will discuss the engineering designs for our new collimator, which is both adjustable and 'active' (i.e. equipped with beam current and temperature measurements), as well as our upgraded beam raster system and new beam diagnostics capabilities. We will also report on results obtained and lessons learned from the commissioning phase and initial production run.

Particle accelerators are complex machines with fast and high power absorption peaks. Power quality is a critical aspect for correct operation. External and internal disturbances can have significant repercussions causing beam losses or severe perturbations. Mastering the load and understanding how network disturbances propagate across the network is a crucial step for developing the grid model and realizing the limits of the existing installations. Despite the fact that several off-the-shelf solutions for real time data acquisition are available, an in-house FPGA based solution was developed to create a distributed measurement system. The system can measure power and power quality on demand as well as acquire raw current and voltage data on a defined trigger, similar to a distributed oscilloscope. In addition, the system allows recording many digital signals from the high voltage switchgear enabling electrical perturbations to be easily correlated with the state of the network. The result is a scalable system with fully customizable software, written specifically for this purpose. The system prototype has been in service for two years and full-scale deployment is currently ongoing.

Linear accelerator technology has been widely applied to radiotherapy machines and there has been an increasing demand of the machines in Thailand over the recent years. An attempt to increase the availability of the low-cost machines has been proposed for the domestic use purposes. Currently, the prototype of the 6 MeV medical linear accelerator is under development at Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI) in Nakorn Ratchasima, Thailand. For beam shaping purposes a so-called secondary collimator is utilized with different size arrangement of the collimator jaws. The collimator motion control is one of the necessary machine subsystems for producing the desired field size of the beam. In this paper, the FPGA-based motion control system of the machine prototype is presented. The programmable logic part of the hardware is designed in VHDL for digital processing. The main motion control algorithm is implemented in the main processor of Zedboard FPGA. Communication between the motion control subsystem and the main control system software of the machine is also described.

The ATLAS experiment has recently commissioned a new hardware component of its first-level trigger: the topological processor (L1Topo). This innovative system, using state-of-the-art FPGA processors, selects events by applying kinematic and topological requirements on candidate objects (energy clusters, jets, and muons) measured by calorimeters and muon sub-detectors. Since the first-level trigger is a synchronous pipelined system, such requirements are applied within a latency of 200ns. We will present the first results from data recorded using the L1Topo trigger; these demonstrate a significantly improved background event rejection, thus allowing for a rate reduction without efficiency loss. This improvement has been shown for several physics processes leading to low-pT leptons, including H->tau tau and J/Psi->mu mu. In addition, we will discuss the use of an accurate L1Topo simulation as a powerful tool to validate and optimize the performance of this new trigger system. To reach the required accuracy, the simulation must take into account the limited precision that can be achieved with kinematic calculations implemented in firmware.

The Muon-to-Central Trigger Processor Interface (MUCTPI) of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be upgraded to an ATCA blade system for Run 3. The new design requires development of new communication models for control, configuration and monitoring. A System-on-Chip (SoC) with a programmable logic part and a processor part will be used for communication to the run control system and to the MUCTPI processing FPGAs. Different approaches have been compared. First, we tried an available UDP-based implementation in firmware for the programmable logic. Although this approach works as expected, it does not provide any flexibility to extend the functionality to more complex operations, e.g. for serial protocols. Second, we used the SoC processor with an embedded Linux operating system and an application-specific software written in C++ using a TCP remote-procedure-call approach. The software is built and maintained using the Yocto/OpenEmbedded framework. This approach was successfully used to test and validate the MUCTPI prototype. A third approach under investigation is the option of porting the ATLAS run control software directly to the embedded Linux.

In many nuclear applications such as nuclear/high-energy physics and nuclear fusion, sensors are widely used in order to detect high energy particles. One of the available technologies is the scintillator, which is generally coupled with a photomultiplier and pulse amplifier. The detector acquisition chain is not stationary; mainly, it changes its gain as a function of the temperature and the nuclear irradiation on the photomultiplier; therefore it needs to be periodically calibrated during its operation. A calibration method reported in the literature is based on the use of a pulsed LED that flashes on the photomultiplier by generating a train of reference pulses. A new technique may be the use of an LED with continuous sinusoidal intensity emission. This provides as an output of the detector chain a small sinusoidal signal which can be digitally processed in real time, by measuring the gain and the delay time of the detector chain. Moreover, this sinusoidal background signal can be removed in real-time, before any processing or storage of data. This paper presents the technique, reporting its simulation and the main characteristics of the developed firmware and the hardware.

FREIA Laboratory is a new facility for developing and testing instrumentation for particle accelerators. There are two pulsed 400 kW 352 MHz RF sources, presently used for testing superconducting RF cavities and there is a need to monitor the electromagnetic field in the experimental hall. The RF leakage detector system consists of number of physically identical nodes with one of them configured as a master and the rest as slaves. Each node supports 3 separate RF measurement channels with a frequency span of 100 kHz to 1 GHz. A desired frequency band is selected using a front-end band-pass filter. The sensitivity of the sensor is -34 dBm and the dynamic range 48 dB. The slaves are battery powered for easy installation. Special care has been taken to minimize the power consumption resulting in battery life to be 4-13 months using 3xAAA batteries. The footprint of the module is 60x100x40 mm. The communication between the master and the slaves uses a Wireless Link operating at the 868 MHz ISM band. The system is controlled by EPICS using the StreamDevice driver. The master RF module is connected via an RS-232 line and a MOXA NPort server to the control system network.

At FAIR the commissioning of the re-assembled CRYRING accelerator, formerly hosted by Manne Siegbahn Laboratory Stockholm, is currently in progress. This compact low energy heavy ion synchrotron and experimental storage ring will be the main instrument for an extensive research programme [1] as well as a testing platform for the future beam instrumentation and control system concepts decided on for FAIR. Besides many other measurement systems CRYRING is equipped with 18 beam position monitors (BPM), for which a new data acquisition system (DAQ) was developed. Based on the upcoming MicroTCA form factor in combination with FPGA mezzanine card (FMC) technology the DAQ system was designed to be state-of-the-art, reliable, modular and of high performance. Testing 'Open Hardware', here the ADC FMCs and FMC carrier boards, was another intention of that concept. The DAQ layout and obstacles that had to be overcome as well as first measurements will be presented.

A prototype of medical linear accelerator is under development at Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI). In order to maintain the proper operation of the machine, the pulse signal is used to synchronize the various subsystems such as electron gun, RF trigger, and magnetron trigger subsystems. In this project, we design the timing system using a XilinxSpartan-3 FPGA development board with VHDL in order to achieve the desired characteristics and sequences of the timing signals for those subsystems. A LabVIEW GUI is designed to interface with the timing system in order to control the time delay and pulse width via RS-232 serial interface. The results of the system design is achieved with the pulse resolution of a 20 nsec per step for four timing channels. The time delay and pulse width for each channel can be set independently based on the SYNC reference signal.

In Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR), various diagnostics systems were operated from the first plasma in 2008. Many diagnostic devices have been installed for measuring the various plasma properties such as plasma current, magnetic current, electron density, electron temperature, impurity, and so on. The DAQ system for measuring the various plasma properties were developed with various form factor digitizer such as VME, CPCI, PXI, VXI. and PCIe. These complicated form factors installed on KSTAR have difficulties with hardware management, software management and performance upgrades. In order to control real-time systems using several diagnostic signals, the real-time control system is required to share the data without delay between the diagnostic measurement system and the real-time control system without branch one signal. Therefore, we developed the Multifunction Control Unit (KMCU) as the standard control system MTCA.4 form-factor and implemented the various diagnostic DAQ system using KMCU V2, that is KMCU-Z30. This paper will present the implementation of KSTAR diagnostic DAQ systems configured with KMCU based on MTCA.4 and their operating results.

After 20 years successful operation of SPring-8, the third generation synchrotron radiation facility, maintaining old analogue modules of LLRF system tend to be difficult. Meanwhile a digital technology like FPGA, fast ADC/DAC become popular. We decided to replace the old analog LLRF system with modern MTCA.4 based one. Prior to replacing the system, we planed to examine the performance of the new system at an RF test stand. An AMC digitizer and a RTM vector modulator were introduced. A feedback control function was reproduced in the FPGA of the digitizer. We also adopted EtherCAT for relatively slow control, such as a motor control for cavity tuner and monitoring of a vacuum pressure. In addition to developing the new hardware of MTCA.4, we were developing a new data acquisition system and a new MQTT based messaging system for an integrated control framework of SPring-8 and SACLA, the X-ray free electron laser facility. To prove feasibility of new control system, it was implemented at the RF test stand. As the result of high power RF operation, we achieved demanding stability of RF in the cavity. We also confirmed that new software framework was enough to control LLRF system.

This article gives a brief description of the timing system for Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou- Cooler Storage Ring (HIRFL-CSR). It introduces in detail mainly of the timing system architecture, hardware and software. We use standard event system architecture. The system is mainly composed of the events generator (EVG), the events receiver (EVR) and the events fan-out module. The system is the standard three-layer structure. OPI layer realizes generated and monitoring for the events. The intermediate layer is the events transmission and fan out. Device control layer performs the interpretation of the events. We adopt our R&D EVG to generate the events of virtual accelerator. At the same time, we have used our own design events fan-out module and realize distributed on the events. In equipment control layer, we use EVR design based on FPGA to interpret the events of different equipment and achieve an orderly work. The Timing System realize the ion beam injection, acceleration and extraction.

Synchrotron facilities provides short, regular and high frequency flashes of light. These pulses are used by the scientific community for time resolved experiments. To improve the time resolution, demands for always shorter X-ray pulses are growing. To achieve this goal, Synchrotron SOLEIL and MAX IV laboratory have developed special operating modes such as low-alpha and femtoslicing, as well as a single pass linear accelerator. For the most demanding experiments, the synchronization between short light pulses and pump-probe devices requires sub-picoseconds delay adjustment. The TimIQ system has been developed for that purpose. It is a joint development between Synchrotron Soleil and MAX IV Laboratory. It is aimed to be used on three beamlines at Soleil and one at MAX IV. Based on IQ modulation technics, it allows shifting a radio frequency clock by steps of #100 fs. This paper is a description of this system and of its performances.

The accelerator complex at CERN is a living system. Accelerators are being dismantled, upgraded or change their purpose. New accelerators are built. The changes do not happen overnight, but when they happen they may require profound changes across the handling systems. Central timings (CT), responsible for sequencing and synchronization of accelerators, are good examples of such systems. This paper shows how over the past twenty years the changes and new requirements influenced the evolution of the CTs. It describes experience gained from using the CBCM CT model, for strongly coupled accelerators, and how it led to a design of a new Dynamic Beam Negotiation (DBN) model for the AD and ELENA accelerators, which reduces the coupling, increasing accelerator independence. The paper ends with an idea how to merge strong points of both models in order to create a single generic system able to efficiently handle all involved CERN accelerators and provide more beam time to experiments and LHC.

The Hefei Light Source II (HLS-II) is a vacuum ultravi-olet (VUV) synchrotron light source. A major upgrade of the light source was finished in 2014, and the timing system was rebuilt with event-system to meet synchroni-zation requirements of the machine. The new timing system provides about 100 output signals with various interfaces. The time resolution of this system is 9.8 ns for most devices and 9 ps for the electron gun and the injec-tion kickers. The measured jitter of the output signal is less than 27 ps (RMS). In order to improve the perfor-mance of light source, the top-off operation mode has been planned. As part of this plan, both the hardware and the software of the timing system are upgraded. By ob-taining real-time data of beam measurement of storage ring, the automatic selection of the bucket is implement-ed. With any designated bunch pattern, top-off injection is achieved, and the storage ring beam can be uniform filled well.

Preparation and verification of the timing diagrams for the modern complex facilities with diversified timing systems is a difficult task. A mathematical method for convenient editing and verification of the timing diagrams is presented. This method is based on systems of linear equations and linear inequalities. Every timing diagram has three interconnected representations: a textual equation representation, a matrix representation and a graph (tree) representation. A prototype of software using this method was conceived in Python. This prototype allows conversion of the timing data between all three representations and its visualization.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) timing system is based on the hardware developed by Micro-Research Finland (MRF). The main purposes of the timing system are: generation and distribution of synchronous clock signals and trigger events to the facility, providing a time base so that data from different systems can be time-correlated and synchronous transmission of beam-related data for for different subsystems of the facility. The timing system has a tree topology: one Event Generator (EVG) sends the events, clocks and data to an array of Event Receivers (EVRs) through an optical distribution layer (fan-out modules). The event clock frequency for ESS will be 88.0525 MHz, divided down from the bunch frequency of 352.21 MHz. An integer number of ticks of this clock will define the beam macro pulse full length, around 2.86 ms, with a repetition rate of 14 Hz. An active delay compensation mechanism will provide stability against long-term drifts. A novelty of ESS compared to other facilities is the use of the features provided by EVRs in uTCA form factor, such as trigger and clock distribution over the backplane. These EVRs are already being deployed in some systems and test stands.

We have developed the TiCkS board based on the White Rabbit (WR) SPEC node, to provide ns-precision time-stamps (TSs) of input signals (e.g., triggers from a connected device) and transmission of these TSs to a central collection point. TiCkS was developed within the specifications of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) as one of the candidate TS nodes, with a small form-factor allowing its use in any CTA camera. The essential part of this development concerns the firmware in its Spartan-6 FPGA, with the addition of: 1) a 1ns-precision TDC for the TSs; 2) a UDP stack to transmit TSs and auxiliary information over the WR fibre, and to receive configuration & slow control commands over the same fibre. It also provides a 1-PPS and other clock signals to the connected device, from which it can receive auxiliary event-type information over an SPI link. A version of TiCkS with an FMC connector will be made available in the WR OpenHardware repository, so allowing the use of a mezzanine card with varied formats of input/output connectors, providing a cheap, flexible, and reliable solution for ns-precision time-stamping of trigger signals up to 200 kHz, for use in other experiments.

A new timing system based on White Rabbit (WR) is being developed for the upcoming FAIR facility at GSI in collaboration with CERN and other partners. The General Timing Machine (GTM) is responsible for the synchronization of nodes and distribution of timing events, which allows the real-time control of the accelerator equipment. WR is a time-deterministic, low latency Ethernet-based network for general data transfer and sub-ns time and frequency distribution. The FAIR WR network is considered operational only if it provides deterministic and resilient data delivery and reliable time distribution. In order to achieve this level of service, methods and techniques to increase the reliability of the GTM and WR network has been studied and evaluated. Besides, GSI has developed a network monitoring and logging system to measure the performance and detect failures of the WR network. Finally, we describe the continuous integration system at GSI and how it has improve the overall reliability of the GTM.

The FAIR General Machine Timing system has been in operation at GSI since 2015 and significant progress has been made in the last two years. The CRYRING accelerator was the first machine on campus operated with the new timing system and serves as a proving ground for new control system technology to this day. A White Rabbit (WR) network was set up, connecting parts of the existing facility. The Data Master was put under control of the LSA physics core. It was enhanced with a powerful schedule language and extensive research for delay bound analysis with network calculus was undertaken. Several form factors of Timing Receivers were improved, their hard and software now being in their second release and subject to a continuous series of automated long- and short-term tests in varying network scenarios. The final goal is time-synchronization of 2000-3000 nodes using the WR Precision-Time-Protocol distribution of TAI time stamps and synchronized command and control of FAIR equipment. Promising test results for scalability and accuracy were obtained when moving from temporary small lab setups to CRYRING's control system with more than 30 nodes connected over 3 layers of WR Switches.

The IMP takes responsibility for the development of Injector II. The target energy index of it is 20-25Mev , which is an intense beam proton accelerator with high operation risk. In order to implement cutting the ion source beam in time when the beam position offset happened, the Injector II Machine Protection System is developed based on FPGA controller and PLC. This system aims to prevent device damage from continuous impact of intense beam, as well as obtains and stores status data of key devices when failures occur to implement failure location and analysis. The whole system is now operating stable in field, and the beam cutting time is less than 10us.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) accelerates many different ion species and charge states defining a wide spectrum of operating modes and parameters. The role of the Run Permit System (RPS) here is to examine if a requested state is suitable for the production of beam. The decision to permit beam is based on input from configuration management databases, machine and personnel protection systems, and beam characteristics and destination. Seeded with this information, an appropriate set of operating parameters are deployed to hardware to support the requested mode. This contribution will describe the interfaces, implementation, and behavior of the RPS at FRIB.

The European Spallation Source ERIC is being built in Lund, Sweden to complement the existing neutron sources in Europe and worldwide. ESS will be the bright-est neutron source ever built upon completion and aims to have an availability of 95% during steady state opera-tions. The purpose of Machine Protection at ESS is to protect the equipment in order to support the high availability. Due to the distributed nature of Machine Protection numerous design teams are involved to implement Protection Functions. The Machine Protection Development at ESS follows the Functional Protection lifecycle for System-of-systems developed at the facility. This paper focuses on the application of the Functional System Inter-action Process part of the Functional Protection method. To obtain the system interaction model, behavioural requirements and to allocate Protection Functions use case workshops are held. The feasibility of different system architectures and protection function implementations are discussed and simulated by going through fore-seen operational sequences, use cases. The different architectures and use cases are documented using Enter-prise Architect.

Injecting beams in CERN facilities is subject to the CERN safety rules. It is for this reason that the Beam Permit approval procedure was improved by moving away from a paper-based workflow to a digital form. For each facility the Beam Permits are signed by the various responsible specialists (Access systems, safety equipment, radiation protection, etc…). To achieve this, CERN's official Engineering Data Management System (EDMS) is used. The functionality of EDMS was extended to accommodate the additional requirements, whilst keeping a user friendly web interface. In addition, a new webpage within the CERN OP-webtools site was created with the purpose of providing a visual overview of the Beam Permit status for each facility. This new system is used in the CERN Control Centre (CCC) and it allows the operations team and all people involved in the signature process to follow the Beam Permit status in a more intuitive, efficient and safer way.

The Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) interlock related systems are configured with various system such as fast interlock, supervisory interlock, plasma control, central control, and heating using various types of hardware, software, and interface platforms. For each system, monitoring and analysis tools are already well-developed. However, for the analysis of system fault behavior, these heterogeneous platforms do not help finding the relation of failure. When the interlock events are latched or pulse is stopped by PCS, events are transmitted to different actuators and it could make another events via various interface. In other words, it could lead another factor of fault causes on different system. Through this application we will figure out sequence of fault factor during the pulse-by-pulse KSTAR operation. The KSTAR Data Integration System (KDIS) is configured with KSTAR event-driven architecture and data processing environment. This application will be developed on the KDIS environment and synchronized with KSTAR event. This paper will present the development of shot fault sequence analysis logic and application with KDIS.

At the European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS), cryogenic cooling is essential for various equipment of the facility. The ESS Superconducting LINAC and the ESS Cryomodule Test Stand, will require major cryogenic services in order to be supplied with liquid nitrogen and helium. Since the use of cryogenic fluids can be associated with Oxygen Depletion Hazard (ODH), the ESS Protection and Safety Systems group will install an ODH Detection System which is a PLC-based alarm system. This system will monitor real time Oxygen concentration levels in designated areas, with the aim to alarm personnel if the oxygen level is detected below certain thresholds. This paper gives an overview about the requirements, system architecture, hardware and software of the ODH Detection System in ESS Accelerator buildings

The reliable protection of the ESS equipment is important for the success of the project. This requires multiple systems and subsystems to perform the required protection functions that prevent undesired hazardous events. The complexity of the machine, the different technical challenges and the intrinsic organisational difficulties for an in-kind project like ESS impose serious challenges to the distributed Machine Protection strategy. In this contribution, the difficulties and adopted solutions are described to exemplify the technical challenges encountered in the process.

With the success and reliability of the transverse feedback system installed at the Advance Photon Source (APS), a major upgrade to expand the system is under way. The existing system is operating at a third of the storage ring bunch capacity, or 324 of the available 1296 bunches. This upgrade will allow the sampling of all 1296 bunches and make corrections for all selected bunches in a single storage ring turn. To facilitate this upgrade a new analog I/O board capable of 352 MHz operation was developed along with a revolution clock cleaning circuit. A 352MHz clock cleaning circuit was also required for the high-speed analog output circuit to maintain data integrity to the receiving DAC unit that is 61m away. This receiving DAC unit will have its transceiver data rate upgraded from 2.3Gbps to about 7Gbps transmitted over a fiber optic link. This paper discusses some of the challenges in reducing the clock jitter from both the system P0 bunch clock and the 352MHz clock along with the necessary FPGA hardware upgrades and algorithm changes, all of which is required for the success of this upgrade.

For the SPES project at Legnaro National Laboratories (LNL), a Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) has been designed to have flexibility, reusability and an high precision. It is an FPGA-based digital feedback control system using RF ADCs for the direct undersampling and it can control at the same time eight different cavities. The LLRF system was tested on the field with an accelerated beam. In the last year some improvements on the firmware, software and hardware of the control system have been done. In this paper the results carried out in the more recent tests, the future works and the upgrades of the system will be detailed.

The I10 beamline at Diamond Light Source is configured to study circular dichroism. To increase signal to noise ratio between the two beam polarisations and increase temporal resolution the beamline is fed by two separate IDs that are typically configured with opposite handed polarisations. A chicane of steering magnets with programmable power supplies is used to provide 10 Hz switching between the two photon beams by producing a dynamic closed bump that alternates the on-axis trajectory of the electron beam between the two IDs. In order to maintain the closed bump and make the switching transparent to the rest of the photon beamlines the phase and amplitude of the sine functions applied to the chicane magnets must be exactly correct. In this paper the linear scheme that was used to correct the residual 10 Hz orbit distortion is presented. Future work that uses the fully programmable nature of the magnet power supply controllers to correct high order distortions is also discussed.

With high intensity beams, a precise measurement and effective correction of the betatron coupling is essential for the performance of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In order to measure this parameter, the LHC transverse damper(ADT), used as an AC dipole, will provide the necessary beam excitation. The beam oscillations will be recorded by the Beam Positions Monitors and transmitted to dedicated analysis software. We set up the project with a 3-layer software architecture: The central node is a java server orchestrating the different actors: The Graphical User Interface, the control and triggering of the ADT AC dipole, the BPMs, the oscillation analysis (partly in python), and finally the transmission of the correction values. The whole system, is currently being developed in a team using Scrum, an iterative and incremental agile software development framework. In this paper we present an overview of this system, experience from machine development and commissioning as well as how scrum helped us to achieve our goals. Improvement and re-use of the architecture with a nice decoupling between data acquisition and data analysis are also briefly discussed.

This paper describes a new software tool recently developed at CERN called (New CPS Beam Optimiser). This application allows the automatic optimization of beam properties using a statistical method, which has been modified to suit the purpose. Tuning beams is laborious and time-consuming, therefore, to gain operational efficiency, this new method to perform an intelligent automatic scan sequence has been implemented. The application, written in JavaFX, uses CERN control group standard libraries and is quite simple. The GUI is user-friendly and allows operators to configure different optimization processes in a dynamic and easy way. Different measurements, complemented by simulations, have therefore been performed to try and understand the response of the algorithm. These results are presented here, along with the modifications still needed in the original mathematical libraries.

The Hadron Experimental Facility is designed to handle an intense slow-extracted proton beam from the 30-GeV Main Ring of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). We have developed a new control system of a magnet power supply to work with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The control PLC handles the status of the interlock signals between a power supply and a magnet, and monitors the output voltage and the current. The PLC also controls a programmable reference voltage to regulate the output current. In addition, we have been developing an automatic orbit-correction program with the control system of the magnet power supply. The previous data of the beam profile monitors located on the upstream side of the beam dump and the temperature distribution on the beam dump show a possibility of the automatic correction of the beam orbit to the beam dump. The optimized current for the horizontal steering magnet was calculated from the horizontal displacement of the proton beam measured with the beam profile monitors. This paper reports the current status of the power supply control system which can automatically correct the horizontal beam position at the beam dump.

In modern free electron laser facilities like FLASH I/II and European XFEL at DESY a high resolution intra bunch train arrival time measurement is mandatory, providing a crucial information for the beam based feedback system. For this purpose a Bunch Arrival Time Monitor (BAM) was developed, based on an electro-optical scheme where an ultra-short pulsed laser is employed. A BAM is composed of several subsystems, including stepper motors, power management, dedicated readout board, management board for voltage settings, temperature sensors and temperature controller and optical amplifier. Part of the electronics is developed using the MicroTCA standard. We will present in this poster the basic requirements for the BAM, software design and implementation developed to manage the subsystems and their interactions.

A state in which accelerator system works at a given moment of time is determined by the state machine. The idea of the project has been based on FSM - finite state machine, in which each of the states is precisely determined by assigned specified operations on subsystem devices of the accelerator system such as e.g. magnets of storage rings, RF transmitters etc. To ensure high reliability, the main part of the project has been based on PLC - Programmable Logic Controller. StateMachine wich is a TangoClass has been written in Python using the facadedevice library, that allows information from the control system to be delivered to the PLC system. By using an universal Tango Class AllenBradleyEIP the state machine shering an informationa about accelerator system to the Tango control system. This information is archived in Cassandra database system by using the Tango HDB++ archiving system.

High intensity hadron colliders and fixed target experiments at CERN require an increasing amount of robotic tele-manipulation interventions to prevent and reduce excessive exposure of maintenance personnel to the radioactive environment. Tele-manipulation tasks are often required on dated radioactive devices which were not conceived to be maintained and handled using standard one arm robotic solutions. Robotic platforms with a level of dexterity that often requires using two robotic arms with a minimum of six degrees of freedom are instead needed for these purposes. In this paper, the control of a novel robust robotic platform able to host and to carry safely a dual-arms robotic system is presented. The arms and the vehicle controls are fully integrated in order to guarantee simplicity to the operators during the realization of the robotic tasks. A novel high-level control architecture for the new robot is shown, as well as a novel low-level safety layer for anti-collision and recovery scenarios. Preliminary results of the system commissioning are presented using CERN accelerator facilities as a use case.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) linear accelerator will deliver high energy proton bunches to tungsten sectors on a rotating Target Wheel, which will produce neutrons through a nuclear process. The motion control system of the Target Wheel presents engineering challenges, such as: velocity and phase stability requirements to precisely align individual tungsten sectors with proton bunches from the accelerator; a high moment of inertia due to the composition and distribution of mass on the wheel; limitations on the physical space to integrate control components, and components for associated safety systems; and, some components being exposed to a high radiation environment. The motion control system being prototyped employs components that satisfy the constraints on the physical space and radiation environment. Precise velocity and phasing of the Target Wheel are achieved by generating a series of pulses as each tungsten sector passes a fiducial point in the rotational cycle, and implementing a motion control algorithm to correctly synchronise the Target Wheel with reference signals from the centralised ESS timing system, which also controls the timing of the accelerator.

A compact AMS facility which is special used for further analyzing atmospheric pollution especially in north China via carbon-14 measurement was developed at CIAE (China Institute of Atomic Energy). This machine is a single acceleration stage AMS, running with the highest accelerate voltage of 200kV. The control system is based on distributed Ethernet control system, using standard TCP/IP protocol as main communication protocol. In order to connect to the main control network freely, device-level data-link layers were developed also. A LabVIEW client, developing virtual machine applied environment, provides friendly graphical user interface for the devices management and measurement data processing.

The installation of a new Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) to the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerating System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory requires a vacuum system capable of providing pressures in the region of 10-10 Torr. Historically, vacuum interlocks have been provided via analog logic chassis which are difficult to upgrade and maintain. In order to provide sufficient interlocks to protect high voltage components of the EBIS, a new programmable logic controller (PLC) based Vacuum control system has been developed and integrated into the rest of the accelerator supervisory control system. The PLC interfaces not only with fast acting relay based interlock signals but also with RS-485 based serial devices to monitor and control lower priority parameters such as pump speeds, vacuum pressure readout and set points, run hours and more. This work presents the structure and interface logic necessary to communicate with a range of vacuum gauges, turbo-molecular pumps and ion pump controllers. In addition, the strategy to interface vacuum control with the rest of the accelerator control system is presented.

NSLS2 is standardized on Geo Brick LV Delta Tau 5A motor controller, suitable to drive majority of stepper and servo motors. Standardization allows less spare inventory and common skill set to maintain. However, some applications especially instruments in the space confined endstations require using small, or even miniature motors. The question that we address, what are the options in customizing the 5A unit for driving low current motors, and what are the limitations? In this paper, we present a quantitative comparison of drive currents and performance data collected with Delta Tau PeWin software and external test equipment for a variety of low current steppers and servomotors with and without encoders ranging from 45mA to 250mA. Delta Tau Geo Brick LV comes in different amplifier configurations: a combination of 5A, 1A, and 0.25A amplifiers. While all configurations are tested, research goal is focused on performance and limitations of 5A driver, avoiding using step and direction option with extra hardware. Performance of widely used Newport MFA-PP and MFA-CC also will be discussed.

The development of HTTP service interfaces* to the BNL Collider-Accelerator Department (C-AD) controls system opens up the ability to more quickly and easily adapt existing codes developed for other systems for use at RHIC. A simple particle accelerator online model built for commissioning the NSLS II** was adapted for use with the Low Energy RHIC electron Cooling project (LEReC)*** and the Coherent Electron Cooling (CeC)**** proof of principle experiment. For this project, a set of python modules and a python application were adapted for use in RHIC by replacing NSLS II control system interfaces with python modules that interface to the C-AD controls HTTP services. This paper will discuss the new interfaces and the status of commissioning them for operations.

A new design of ESRF booster power supply system has been developed and installed. A multiple power supplies control through network including real time control is now operational at ESRF. It manages 4 power supplies to generate 3 waveforms defined with 3x1600 values in a setpoint file. The power supplies states are managed by PLCs. The ramping waveforms are managed by a real time program running on a FPGA board. And a high level control on top of them is assumed by a TANGO multiple classes system. This paper presents how these three levels of controls are interlinked and show the results achieved

The European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS) will consist of 22 different neutron instruments. Each instrument is able to use a large variety of devices to control the environment parameters of the sample during the experiments. Users must be able to control this equipment and the instruments as well as storing and retrieving experiment data. For this purpose, Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) will be used as the backbone control system. This work shows a typical use case where a Sample Environment System (SES) comprised by a Closed Cycle Refrigerator (CCR), spectrometer, temperature and pressure controller has been integrated into the ESS control system, from hardware to user interface.

The operation of extensive control systems cannot be performed by adjusting all parameters one by one manually. Instead, a set of parameters is loaded and applied in bulk. We present a system to store such parameter sets in a type-safe fashion into and retrieve them from a configuration database. The configuration database is backed by an SQL database. Interfaces to store and retrieve data exist for the C++, Java and Python programming languages. GUIs are available both as a standalone program using C++ and Qt, and integrated into Control System Studio (CSS). The version integrated into CSS supports data validators implemented as Eclipse plugins that are run before each commit. The format of the configuration data that can be stored is XML-like, and export and import to/from XML is implemented. The database can hold several completely independent "files" of configuration data. In each file, several branches can be stored, each branch consisting of a chain of commits. Each commit can easily be retrieved at any time. For each entry, the modification history can easily be queried.

EPICS is widely used software infrastructure to control Particle Accelerators, its Channel Access (CA) network protocol for communication with Input/Output Controllers (IOCs) is easy to implement in hardware. Many vendors provide CA support for their devices. The RHIC Control System provides control of more than 400, 000 parameters through Accelerator Data Objects (ADO) software abstraction layer. In this paper we present software bridge, which allows to cross-communicate between ADO and EPICS devices. It consists of two separate programs: an ADO manager, which hosts the ADO parameters and executes caput() request to modify EPICS PV when parameter is changed; and an epics2ado program which monitors the EPICS PVs and notifies the ADO manager. This approach have been implemented in integration of the NSLSII PSC hardware interface into RHIC Controls System.

Toward the SPring-8 upgrade, which we call SPring-8-II, new innovative technologies are introduced at a control framework, a platform, and a fieldbus. We adopted EtherCAT having a master/slave topology as a network based fieldbus. Since a cyclic data transfer time is less than 1msec, EtherCAT can be provided enough performance for a fast control and a feedback system. Synchronization between slaves can be realized easily by the distributed clock technology. Controllers and sensors are set near equipment, and input and output data to/from a master via an Ethernet cable. It reduces the number of wires and the working time for wiring. In 2016, we installed EtherCAT into three types of equipment control systems. One was a prototype digital LLRF system in the high power rf test stand at SPring-8. Another was sub-encoder readout for an undulator at SPring-8. The other was a control system for a kicker magnet power supply at SACLA. An XMC typed EtherCAT Master module was implemented into each of these systems and connected to multi vendor slaves. In this paper, we report the status of new control system using the EtherCAT technology and future plan.

MADOCA-to-EPICS gateway has been developed for easy and rapid integration of EPICS ready devices into MADOCA, the control software framework for SPring-8 and SACLA. MADOCA uses equipment control software called Equipment Manager (EM) in the device control layer. The MADOCA-to-EPICS gateway is implemented as a general-purpose EM to handle EPICS IOCs. The gateway consists of EM functions that interact with IOCs using Channel Access (CA) protocol corresponding to EPICS commands such as caget, caput and camonitor. We can build the gateway for the target EPICS device by editing the EM configuration file, without any programming. We have applied the gateway to the Libera Brilliance+ installed in the SPring-8 storage ring for the evaluation towards the SPring-8 upgrade project. In addition, it has been applied to the Libera Brilliance Single Pass and Spark installed in beam transport line, and the Libera Spark and Cavity installed in SACLA. The gateway brings us the benefits to minimize the installation time and effort even for the different platform (CPU and OS) devices. We will report on the development and advantage as well as the performance improvement of the MADOCA-to-EPICS gateway.

Rapidly changing demands for interoperability among heterogeneous systems leads to a paradigm shift from pre-defined control strategies to dynamic customization within many automation systems, e.g., large-scale scien-tific facilities. However, today's mass systems are of a very static nature. Fully changing the control process requires a high amount of expensive manual efforts and is quite error prone. Hence, flexibility will become a key factor in the future control systems. The adoption of web services and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) can provide the requested capability of flexibility. Since the adaptation of SOAs to automation systems has to face time-constrained requirements, particular attention should be paid to real-time web services for deterministic behaviour. This paper proposes a novel framework for the integration of a Time-Constrained SOA (TcSOA) into mass automation systems. Our design enables service encapsulation in filed level and evaluates how real time technologies can be synthesized with web services to enable deterministic performance.

In keeping with a long tradition in the BNL Collider-Accelerator Department (C-AD) controls environment, we try to provide general and simple to use interfaces to the users of the controls. In the past we have built command line tools, Java tools, and C++ tools that allow users to easily access live and historical controls data. With more demand for access through other interfaces, we recently built a set of python and MATLAB modules to simplify access to control system data. This is possible, and made relatively easy, with the development of HTTP service interfaces to the controls*. While this paper focuses on the python and MATLAB tools built on top of the HTTP services, this work demonstrates clearly how the HTTP service paradigm frees the developer from having to work from any particular operating system or develop using any particular development tool.

At the European Spallation Source (ESS), thousands of (physical and logical) devices will be in production and execute a wide range of functions to enable both the machine and end-station instruments to perform as expected from a controls point of view. Typical examples of such devices are racks, power supplies, motors, pumps, PLCs and IOCs. To properly manage the information of devices in an integrated fashion and at the same time allow external applications (consuming this information) to perform well, an application called Controls Configuration Database (CCDB) was developed at ESS. The present paper introduces this application, describes its features, architecture and technology stack, data concepts, interfaces, and ecosystem; finally, it enumerates development directions that could be pursued to further improve it.

Malcolm is a middlelayer framework that implements high level configure/run behaviour of control system components like those used in continuous scans. It was created as part of the Mapping project at Diamond Light Source to improve the performance of continuous scanning and make it easier to share code between beamlines. It takes the form of a Python framework which wraps up groups of EPICS PVs into modular "Blocks". A hierarchy of these can be created, with the Blocks at the top of the tree providing a higher level scanning interface to GDA, Diamond's Generic Data Acquisition software. The framework can be used as a library in continuous scanning scripts, or can act as a server via pluggable communications modules. It currently has server and client support for both pvData over pvAccess, and JSON over websockets. When running as a webserver this allows a web GUI to be used to visualize the connections between these blocks (like the wiring of EPICS areaDetector plugins). This paper details the architecture and design of framework, and gives some examples of its use at Diamond.

A C/C++ software improvement process (SIP4C/C++) has been increasingly applied by the CERN accelerator Controls group since 2011, addressing technical and cultural aspects of our software development work. A first paper was presented at ICALEPCS 2013*. On the technical side, a number of off-the-shelf software products have been deployed and integrated, including Atlassian Crucible (code review), Google test (unit test), Valgrind (memory profiling) and SonarQube (static code analysis). Likewise, certain in-house developments are now operational such as a Generic Makefile (compile/link/deploy), CMX (for publishing runtime process metrics) and Manifest (capturing library dependencies). SIP4C/C++ has influenced our culture by promoting integration of said products into our binaries and workflows. We describe our current status for technical solutions and how they have been integrated into our environment. Based on testimony from four project teams, we present reasons for and against adoption of individual SIP4C/C++ products and processes. Finally, we show how SIP4C/C++ has improved development and delivery processes as well as the first-line support of delivered products.

A large part of the CERN Accelerator Control System is written in Java by around 180 developers (software engineers, operators, physicists and hardware specialists). The codebase contains more than 10 million lines of code, which are packaged as 1000+ JARs and are deployed as 600+ different client/server applications. All this software are produced using CommonBuild Next Generation (CBNG), an enterprise build tool implemented on top of industry standards, which simplifies and standardizes the way our applications are built. CBNG not only includes general build tool features (such as dependency management, code compilation, test execution and artifact uploading), but also provides traceability throughout the software life cycle and makes releases ready for deployment. The interface is kept as simple as possible: the users declare the dependencies and the deployment units of their projects in one file. This article describes the build process, as well as the design goals, the features, and the technology behind CBNG.

The TANGO Alarm System, based on an efficient event-driven, highly configurable rule-based engine named AlarmHandler, has undergone a deep refactoring. The dedicated MySQL database has been dropped; the TANGO database now stores all the configuration whereas the HDB++ historical database keeps all the alarms history. Correlating alarms with any other engineering data is now much simpler. A dynamic attribute is provided for each alarm rule; this allows to easily build a hierarchy of AlarmHandlers. The AlarmHandler manages Attribute quality in the alarm rules and provides possible exceptions resulting in alarm evaluation. Mathematical functions, such as sin, cos, pow, min, max and ternary conditionals are available in the alarm formulae. The TANGO AlarmHandler device server is now based on the IEC 62682 standard.

TANGO HDB++ is a high performance event-driven archiving system which stores data with micro-second resolution timestamps, using archivers written in C++. HDB++ currently supports MySQL and Apache Cassandra back-ends but could be easily extended to support additional back-ends. Since the initial release many improvements and new features have been added to the HDB++. In addition to bug-fixes and optimizations, the support for context-based archiving allows to define an archiving strategy for each attribute, specifying when it has to be archived or not. Temporary archiving is supported by means of a time-to-live parameter, available on a per-attribute basis. The Cassandra back-end is using Cassandra TTL native feature underneath to implement the time-to-live feature. With dynamic loading of specific libraries switching back-ends can be done on-the-fly and is as simple as changing a property. Partition and maintenance scripts are now available for HDB++ and MySQL. The HDB++ tools, such as extraction libraries and GUIs, followed HDB++ evolution to help the user to take full advantage of the new features.

In developing the control system for the FAIR accelerator complex we encountered strict latency and throughput contraints on the timely supply of data to devices controlling ramped magnets. In addition, the timing hardware that interfaces to the White Rabbit timing network may be shared by multiple processes on a single front-end computer. This paper describes the interprocess communication and resource-sharing system, and the consequences of using the D-Bus message bus. Then our experience of improving latency and throughput performance to meet the realtime requirements of the control system is discussed. Work is also presented on prioritisation techniques to allow time-critical services to share the bus with other components.

The linear induction accelerator LIA-20 for radiography is a pulsed machine designed to provide three consecutive electron bunches. Since every pulse is a distinctive experiment, it is of high importance to provide coherence of the facility state and the experimental data. This paper presents overall software architecture. Challenges and particular approaches to designing of a pulsed machine control system using Tango are discussed.

Nowadays modern accelerators are starting to use virtualization to implement their control systems. Following this idea, one of the possibilities is to use containers. Containers are highly scalable, easy to produce/reproduce, easy to share, resilient, elastic and low cost in terms of computational resources. All of those are characteristics that fit with the necessities of a well defined and versatile control system. In this paper, a control structure based on this paradigm is discussed. Firstly the technologies available for this task are briefly compared. Starting from containerizing tools and following with the container orchestration technologies. As a result Kubernetes and Docker are selected. Then, the basis of Kubernetes/Docker and how it fits into the control of an accelerator is stated. Following the control applications suitable to be containerized are analyzed. It includes electronic log systems, archiving engines, middleware servers,… Finally, a particular structure for an accelerator based on EPICS as middleware is sketched.

NICA (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility) is a new accelerator complex being constructed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia). It will provide heavy ion colliding experiments to study properties of dense baryonic matter. The TANGO based control system of the NICA complex is under development now. The report describes design of the role-based authorization and logging system. It allows limiting access to any Tango device command or attribute according to a user roles and location. The system also restricts access to the Tango database and records details of its modifications. The authorization is performed on the Tango server side thus complementing the native TANGO client-side access control. First tests of the system were performed during the latest Nuclotron run.

Beamlines at Synchrotron Light sources operate 24 hours/day requiring Beamline scientists to have tools to monitor the current state of the Beamline without interfering with the measurements being carried out. The previous web report system developed at ALBA was based on cron tasks querying the Tango Control system and generating html files. The new system integrates all those automatic tasks in a Tornado Tango Device letting the users create their own reports without requiring the intervention of the software support groups. This device runs a Tornado web server providing an html5 web interface to create, customize and visualize its reports in real time (via websockets). Originally designed for the vacuum engineers to monitor the vacuum, is actually used by the scientists and engineers involved in the experiment and the different on-call services to remotely check the beamline overall status.

Cumbia is a new library that offers a carefree approach to multi-threaded application design and implementation. Written from scratch, it can be seen as the evolution of the QTango library, because it offers a more flexible and object oriented multi-threaded programming style. Less concern about locking techniques and synchronization, and well defined design patterns stand for more focus on the work to be performed inside Cumbia Activities and reliable and reusable software as a result. The user writes Activities and decides when their instances are started and to which thread they belong. A token is used to register an Activity, and activities with the same token are run in the same thread. Computed results can be forwarded to the main execution thread, where a GUI can be updated. In conjunction with the Cumbia-Tango module, this framework serves the developer willing to connect an application to the Tango control system. The integration is possible both on the client and the server side. An example of a TANGO device using Cumbia to do work in background has already been developed, as well as simple Qt graphical clients relying on the framework.

The European Spallation Source will produce more data than existing neutron facilities, due to higher accelerator power and to the fact that all data will be collected in event mode with no hardware veto. Detector data will be acquired and aggregated with metadata coming from sources such as sample environment, choppers and motion control. To aggregate data we will use Apache Kafka with FlatBuffers serialisation. A common schema repository defines the formats to be used by the data producers and consumers. The main consumers we are prototyping are a file writer for NeXus files and live reduction and visualisation via Mantid. A Jenkins-based setup using virtual machines is being used for integration tests, and physical servers are available in an integration laboratory alongside real hardware. We present the current status of the data acquisition pipeline and results from the testing and integration work going on at the ESS Data Management and Software Centre in collaboration with in-kind and BrightnESS partners.

Hardware access often brings implementation details into a control application, which are subsequently published to the control system. Experience at DESY has shown that it is beneficial for the software quality to use a high level of abstraction from the beginning of a project. Some hardware registers for instance can immediately be treated as process variables if an appropriate library is taking care of most of the error handling. Other parts of the hardware need an additional layer to match the abstraction level of the application. Like this development cycles can be shortened and the code is easier to read and maintain because the logic focuses on what is done, not how it is done. We present the abstraction concept we are using, which is not only unifying the access to hardware but also how process variables are published via the control system middleware.

This paper describes the design and the development of an innovative management software for the accelerators beamlines at INFN-LNS. The Graphical User Interface, the data exchange protocol, the software functionality and the hardware will be illustrated. Compared to traditional platforms for the accelerators console, at INFN-LNS we have developed a new concept of control system and data acquisition framework, based on a data structures server which so far has never been used for supervisory control. We have chosen Redis as a highly scalable data store, shared by multiple and different processes. With such system it is possible to communicate cross-platform, cross-server or cross-application in a very simple way, using very lightweight libraries. A complex and highly ergonomic Graphic User Interface allows to control all the parameters with a user-friendly interactive approach, ensuring high functionality so that the beam operator can visually work in a realistic environment. All the information related to the beamline elements involved in the beam transport, can be stored in a centralized database, with suitable criteria to have a historical database.

Jefferson Lab's Web Extensible Display Manager (WEDM) allows staff to access EDM control system screens from a web browser in remote offices and from mobile devices. Native browser technologies are leveraged to avoid installing and managing software on remote clients such as browser plugins, tunnel applications, or an EDM environment. Since standard network ports are used firewall exceptions are minimized. To avoid security concerns from remote users modifying a control system, WEDM exposes read-only access and basic web authentication can be used to further restrict access. Updates of monitored EPICS channels are delivered via a Web Socket using a web gateway. The software translates EDM description files (denoted with the edl suffix) to HTML with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) following the EDM's edl file vector drawing rules to create faithful screen renderings. The WEDM server parses edl files and creates the HTML equivalent in real-time allowing existing screens to work without modification. Alternatively, the familiar drag and drop EDM screen creation tool can be used to create optimized screens sized specifically for smart phones and then rendered by WEDM.

At the ESRF the activity of several beamlines is based upon tomography X-ray imaging in various fields such as Paleontology, Medical Imaging and Materials Science. The instrument control and data processing systems are cloned on all the relevant beamlines, however the steps of the processing pipeline from the data acquisition to their full exploitation in premier quality publications are based upon a heterogeneous software scenario comprised of e.g. SPEC, Python, Octave, PyHST2 and MATLAB modules. The need has thus clearly appeared to logically sequence the operations performed by these different actors into user-friendly workflows. At the ESRF we selected a generic workflow tool, Orange, which was originally developed at the University of Ljubljana and designed for data mining in collaboration with the open source community. The graphical interface enables the easy inclusion/exclusion of functionalities represented by individual boxes. Each box can be managed by simple pieces of Python code generating graphical interfaces via the PyQT5 library and is defined by a set of inputs and outputs which can be linked together to produce consistent data processing workflows.

Developing operational User Interfaces (UI) can be challenging, especially during machine upgrade or commissioning where many changes can suddenly be required. An agile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with enhanced refactoring capabilities can ease the development process. Inspector is an intuitive UI oriented IDE allowing for development of control interfaces and data processing. It features a state of the art visual interface composer fitted with an ample set of graphical components offering rich customization. It also integrates a scripting environment for soft real time data processing and UI scripting for complex interfaces. Furthermore, Inspector supports many data sources. Alongside the short application development time, it means Inspector can be used in early stages of device engineering or it can be used on top of a full control system stack to create elaborate high level control UIs. Inspector is now a mission critical tool at CERN providing agile features for creating and maintaining control system interfaces. It is intensively used by experts, machine operators and performs seamlessly from small test benches to complex instruments such as LHC or LINAC4.

JavaFX, the GUI toolkit included in the standard JDK, provides charting components with commonly used chart types, a simple API and wide customization possibilities via CSS. Nevertheless, while the offered functionality is easy to use and of high quality, it lacks a number of features that are crucial for scientific or controls GUIs. Examples are the possibility to zoom and pan the chart content, superposition of different plot types, data annotations, decorations or a logarithmic axis. The standard charts also show performance limitations when exposed to large data sets or high update rates. The article will describe the how we have implemented the missing features and overcome the performance problems.

The acquisition of X-ray diffraction data from macromolecular crystals is a major activity at many synchrotrons and requires user interfaces that provide robust and easy-to-use control of the experimental setup. Building on the modular design of the MxCuBE beamline user interface, we have implemented a finite state machine model that allows to describe and monitor the interaction of the user with the beamline in a typical experiment. Using a finite state machine, the path of user interaction can be rationalized and error conditions and recovery procedures can be systematically dealt with.

Polish National Center for Synchrotron Radiation SOLARIS UJ is being prepared for first users. In order to facilitate process of user management, proposal submission, review and beam time allocation the SOLARIS Digital User Office project has been started. The DUO is developed in collaboration with Academic Computer Center CYFRONET AGH. The DUO consists of several main components. The user management component allows user registration and user affiliation management. The proposal submission component facilitate filling proposal form, indicating co-proposers and experimentalist. The review component supports process of decision making, including the Review Meeting event and grading proposals process. Apart of managing the main processes, the application provides an additional functionalities (e.g. experimental reports, trainings, feedbacks). DUO was designed as an open platform to face the challenges related to continually changing Solaris facility. Therefore, the business logic is described as an easily maintainable rule-based specification. To achieve good user experience modern web technologies were used including: Angular for the front-end part and Java Spring for server.

The quoted machine availability of a particle accelerator over some time range is usually hand-generated by a machine coordinator, who pores over archived operations parameters and logbook entries for the time period in question. When the machine is deemed unavailable for operations, 'blame' is typically assigned to one or more machine sub-systems. With a 'perfect' representation of all possible machine states and all possible fatal alarms it is possible to calculate machine availability and assign blame automatically and thereby remove any bias and uncertainty that might creep in when a human is involved. Any system which attempts to do this must nevertheless recognize the de-facto impossibility of achieving perfection and allow for 'corrections' by a machine coordinator. Such a system for automated availability statistics was recently presented* and we now report on results and improvements following a half year in operation at PETRA-3 and its accelerator chain.

Control System Studio (CS-Studio) is one of the most widely-used display managers for EPICS. It is based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (Eclipse RCP), allowing for coherent integration of interfaces for different systems with common graphical elements and preferences. However, this user interface presents a different way of working to those from the previous generation of EPICS tools such as Extensible Display Manager (EDM) and Striptool. At Diamond Light Source, EDM has been used since commissioning in two different ways: for machine operations and for beamline controls. Both uses of EDM will eventually be replaced with CS-Studio and significant effort has been put into this transition. Two kinds of change proved necessary: adaptations to CS-Studio itself, and changes to the typical user workflows. This paper presents both types of changes that were needed to make CS-Studio a productive tool at Diamond.

SSC-Linac is a linear accelerator injector of SSC in HIRFL. The vacuum control system is based on EPICS which is a real-time distributed control software. The Labview real-time VIs and EPICS VIs were used to design Input/Output Controller(IOC).The different kinds of CRIO modules were adopt in device layer, which can monitor the serial port data from vacuum gauges and contol vacuum valves. The whole control system can acquire vacuum data, control vacuum devices remotely, make the pressure value of the vacuum gauge and vacuum valve interlocked. It also keeps the equipment work stable and the beam has a high quality.

The LIMA project started in 2009. The goal was to provide a software library for the unified control of 2D detectors. LIMA is a collaborative project involving synchrotrons, research facilities and industrial companies. LIMA supports most detectors used for X-ray detection or other scientific applications. Live display is supported via a video interface and most of the native video camera image formats are supported. LIMA provides a plug-in architecture for on-line processing which allows image pre-treatment before saving e.g. noise reduction algorithm or automatic X-ray beam attenuation during continuous scans. The library supports many file format including EDF, CBF, FITS, HDF5 and TIFF. To cope with increasing detector acquisition speed, the latest LIMA release includes multi-threaded, parallelized image saving with data compression (gzip or lz4). For even higher throughput a new design, based on a distributed multi-computer architecture, of the LIMA framework is envisaged. The paper will describe the LIMA roadmap for the coming years.

ESPRESSO, the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations, is undergoing the final testing phases before being shipped to Chile and installed in the Combined Coudé Laboratory (CCL) at the ESO Very Large Telescope site. The integration of the instrument takes place at the Astronomical Observatory of Geneva. It includes the full tests of the Instrument Control Electronics (ICE) and Instrument Control Software (ICS), designed and developed at the INAF-Astronomical Observatory of Trieste. ESPRESSO is the first ESO-VLT permanent instrument which electronics is based on Beckhoff PLCs. Two PLC CPUs shares all the workload of the ESPRESSO functions and through the OPC-UA protocol the PLC communicates with the instrument control software based on VLT control software package. In this phase all the devices and subsystems of ESPRESSO are installed, connected together and verified, mimicking the final working conditions in Chile. This paper will summarize the features of the ESPRESSO control system, the tests performed during the integration in Europe and the main performance obtained before the integration of the whole instrument "on sky" in South America.

The MAX IV synchrotron radiation facility in Lund, Sweden, received its first external commissioning users in November 2016 at the Nanomax hard X-ray beamline. All components of the beamline, including the motorisation, vacuum and diagnostic elements, were integrated into the TANGO-based control system, which through the SARDANA layer also managed the collection of diffraction and fluorescence data from one- and two-dimensional detector channels. Hardware-synchronised continuous scanning (‘‘fly-scanning'') of the sample, mounted on a piezo stage, was achieved using a system built around a standard pulse generator and acquisition board controlled by a dedicated TANGO device. SARDANA macros were used to configure and execute the continuous scanning, and position data from the piezo controller were buffered in synchronization with triggers sent to the detectors, with all data subsequently written to HDF5 files. After successful initial operation, the system is currently being revised and expanded for the users expected in 2018.

The ISOLDE facility at CERN requires a wide variety of software applications to ensure maximum productivity. It will be further enforced by two new and innovative applications; Automatic Save After set uP (ASAP) and Fast Beam Investigation (FBI). ASAP saves crucial time for the engineers in charge (EIC) during the physics campaign. It automatizes and standardizes a repetitive process. In addition, for each new set up, the EIC is required to document the settings of all important elements before delivering beam to the users. FBI will be serving two different needs. First, it will be used as a beam traceability tool. The settings of every element of ISOLDE that could obstruct, stop or affect the beam will be tracked by the application. This will allow to understand better the presence of radioactive contaminants after each experiment at every possible point in the facility. The second functionality will allow real time monitoring of the machine status during a physics run. FBI will be the most efficient way to visualize the status of the machine and find the reason that prevents the beam from arriving to the experimental station.

The HIE-ISOLDE Linac (High Intensity and Energy) is a recent upgrade to the ISOLDE facility of CERN, increasing the maximum beam energy and providing means to explore more scientific opportunities. The main software tools required to set up the new superconducting post-accelerator and to characterise the beam provided to the experimental stations will be presented in this paper. Emphasis will be given to the suite of applications to control all beam instrumentation equipment which are more complex compared to the ones in the low energy part of ISOLDE. A variety of devices are used (Faraday cups, collimators, scanning slits, striping foils and silicon detectors). Each serves its own purpose and provides different information concerning the beam characteristics. Every group of devices required a specific approach to be programmed.

UNICOS (UNified Industrial Control System) is a CERN-made framework to develop industrial control applications. It follows a methodology based on ISA-88 and provides components in two layers of a control system: control and supervision. The control logic is running in the first layer, in a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), and, in the second layer, a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system is used to interface with the operators and numerous other features (e.g. alarms, archiving, etc.). UNICOS supports SIEMENS WinCC OA as the SCADA system. In this paper, we propose to use EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) as the supervision component of the UNICOS framework. The use case is the control system of a CO2 cooling plant developed at CERN following the UNICOS methodology, which had to be integrated in a control system based on EPICS. The paper describes the methods and actions taken to make this integration feasible, including automatic EPICS database generation, PLC communications, visualization widgets, faceplates and synoptics and their integration into CSS and EPICS, as well as the integration with the BEAST alarm system.

A new generation of superconducting magnets is being developped, in the framework of the HL-LHC upgrade project. Several laboratories in Europe, USA, Japan and Russia collaborate on this project. One of the tasks assigned to CERN is to conduct the optimization tests and later the series tests, for the MQXFS and MQXF-A/B magnets. A new dedicated test bench has been built at the CERN superconducting magnet test facility (SM18), where these magnets will be evaluated under their operational conditions in the LHC tunnel. To fulfill the test conditions on these high performance magnets, a new high frequency data acquisition system (DAQ) has been designed, associated to a new software used to control two 15 kA power converters. This article presents all the technical aspects of these two major components of the test platform, from the PXIe hardware selection of the DAQ system to the operational applications deployment. The commissioning phase and results of the first measurement campaign are also reported.

Brazil is building Sirius, the new Brazilian synchrotron light source which will be the largest scientific infrastructure ever built in Brazil and one of the world's first 4th generation light laboratory. Mogno, the future X-ray nano and microtomography beamline is being designed to execute and process experiments in only few seconds. For this reason, prototypes and automated systems have being tested and implemented in the current Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) imaging beamline (IMX). An industrial robot was installed to allow fast sample exchange through an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Also, scripts using Python and Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) were implemented for automatic sample alignment, measurement and reconstruction. In addition, a flow cell for study dynamics and behaviour of fluids at the rock pore scale in time resolved experiments (4D tomography) is being projected.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is equipped with a complex collimation system to protect sensitive equipment from unavoidable beam losses. Collimators are positioned close to the beam using an alignment procedure. Until now they have always been aligned assuming no tilt between the collimator and the beam, however, tank misalignments or beam envelope angles at large-divergence locations could introduce a tilt limiting the collimation performance. This paper describes three different algorithms to automatically align a chosen collimator at various angles. The implementation was tested with and without beam at the SPS and the LHC. No human intervention was required and the three algorithms converged to the same optimal tilt angle.

CEA Irfu Saclay is involved as partner in the ESS accelerator construction through different work-packages: controls for several RF test stands, for cryomodule demonstrators, for the RFQ coupler test and for the conditioning around 120 couplers and the tests of 8 cryomodules. Due to the high number of components it is really crucial to automatize the conditioning. This paper describes how the control of these test stands was done using the ESS EPICS Environment and homemade EPICS modules. These custom modules were designed to be as generic as possible for reuse in future similar platforms and developments. They rely on the IOxOS FMC ADC3111 acquisition card, Beckhoff EtherCAT modules and the MRF timing system.

When the European Muon beamlines at the ISIS pulsed neutron and muon source [1] upgraded their front end magnets, it was desired that these new magnets should be controllable remotely. This work was undertaken by the team responsible for instrument control, who are in the process of a phased upgrade of instrument control software from a locally developed system (SECI) to an EPICS [2] based one (IBEX [3,4]). To increase the complexity of the task, parts of the front end needed to be controlled only by an individual instrument beamline, whilst some values needed to be tuned to the best compromise available for all three beamlines. Furthermore, the muon instruments were not ready for an upgrade to a full IBEX system at that time. By combining SECI, IBEX and the Mantid [5] data reduction package the required control and tuning has been achieved. This paper will give details of the challenges, the topology of the solution, how the current mixed system is performing, and what will be changed when the muon instruments are converted to IBEX.

The SKA project is an international effort (10 member and 10 associated countries with the involvement of 100 companies and research institutions) to build the world's largest radio telescope. The SKA Telescope Manager (TM) is the core package of the SKA Telescope aimed at scheduling observations, controlling their execution, monitoring the telescope and so on. To do that, TM directly interfaces with the Local Monitoring and Control systems (LMCs) of the other SKA Elements (e.g. Dishes), exchanging commands and data with them by using the TANGO controls framework. TM in turn needs to be monitored and controlled, in order its continuous and proper operation is ensured. This higher responsibility together with others like collecting and displaying logging data to operators, performing lifecycle management of TM applications, directly deal - when possible - with management of TM faults (which also includes a direct handling of TM status and performance data) and interfacing with the virtualization platform compose the TM Services (SER) package that is discussed and presented in the present paper.

Developing and deploying software systems for data acquisition and experiment control in a beamline laboratory can be a very challenging task. In certain cases there is the need to replace and modernize an existing system in order to accommodate substantial beamline upgrades. DonkiOrchestra is a TANGO-based framework for data acquisition and experiment control developed at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste. The framework is based on an advanced software trigger-driven paradigm developed in-house. DonkiOrchestra is meant to be general and flexible enough to be adapted to the development needs of different laboratories and their data acquisition requirements. This presentation outlines the upgrade of the LabVIEW-based TwinMic beamline control system which hosts a unique soft X-ray transmission and emission microscope. Other than the technical demanding tasks of interfacing and controlling old and new instrumentation with DonkiOrchestra, this presentation discusses the various challenges of upgrading the software in a working synchrotron beamline.

CERN MEDICIS is a research facility that will make radioisotopes for medical applications using the primary proton beam at ISOLDE. It will start operating later in 2017. The high level application for the new beam line is responsible for the control of various equipment, such as power supplies, Faraday cups and scanners, as well as the monitoring of environmental parameters such as the vacuum level. It is characterized by a single user friendly interface to facilitate the operators tasks. In this paper we provide arguments for the chosen solution and give the latest update on the status of the project.

The linear, super-conducting accelerator at the new European XFEL facility will be able to produce up to 2700 electron bunches for each shot at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The bunch repetition rate might vary initially between 100 kHz and 4.5 MHz to accommodate the various needs of experiments at three different SASE beam lines. A solution, which is able to provide bunch-resolved data of multiple data sources together in one place for each shot, has been implemented at the E-XFEL as an integral part of the accelerator control system. This will serve as a framework for high-level control applications, including online monitoring and slow feedback services. A similar system has been successfully run at the FLASH facility at DESY for more than a decade now. This paper presents design, implementation and first experiences from commissioning the XFEL control system data acquisition.

Asynchronous data acquisition at the Inner-Shell Spectroscopy beamline at NSLS-II is performed using custom FPGA based I/O devices ("pizza-boxes"), which store and time stamp data using GPS based clock {*}. During motor scans, Incremental encoder signals corresponding to motion as well as analog detector signals are stored using EPICS IOCs. As each input creates a file with different timestamps, the data is first interpolated onto a common time grid. The energy scans are performed by a direct-drive monochromator, controlled with a Power PMAC controller. The motion is programmed to follow the trajectory with speed profiles corresponding to desired data density. The "pizza-boxes" that read analog signals are typically set to oversample the data stream, digitally improving the ADC resolution. Then the data is binned onto a energy grid with data spacing driven by desired point spacing. In order to organize everything in an easy-to-use platform, we developed XLive, a Python based GUI application. It can be used from the pre-experiment preparation to the data visualization and exporting, including beamline tuning and data acquisition.

Detectors currently being commissioned at Diamond Light Source (DLS) bring the need for more sophisticated control and data acquisition software. The Excalibur 1M and 3M are modular detectors comprised of rows of identical stripes. The Odin framework emulates this architecture by operating multiple file writers on different server nodes, managed by a central controller. The low-level control and communication is implemented in a vendor supplied C library with a set of C-Python bindings, providing a fast and robust API to control the detector nodes, alongside a simple interface to interact with the file writer instances over ZeroMQ. The file writer is a C++ module that uses plugins to interpret the raw data and provide the format to write to file, allowing it to be used with other detectors such as Percival and Eiger. At DLS we implement an areaDetector driver to integrate Odin with the beamline EPICS control system. However, because Odin provides a simple HTTP Rest API, it can be used by any site control system. This paper presents the architecture and design of the Odin framework and illustrates its usage as a controller of complex, modular detector systems.

Diagnostics of beam parameters is vital for the operation of any particle accelerator and contributes to the precision of the physics experiments. At COoler SYnchrotron of the Forschungszentrum Jülich there are several beam instrumentation subsystems with data acquired and processed in real-time for machine and operator use to ensure safe and efficient performance. Here are presented current development for the Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) with regard to usage of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to achieve fast data processing and integration into the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) used at COSY. Also presented is a way to create and run Graphical User Interfaces based on EPICS variables with Control System Studio (CSS) connected to a data archiving system to display and use previously collected data.

This paper reports the progress of the control system for IPM 10 MeV accelerator. As an electron linac, it consists of beam injection acceleration tube, radio frequency production and transmission, target, diagnostics and control and safety. In support of this source, an EPICS-based integrated control system has been designed and being implemented from scratch to provide access to the critical control points and continues to grow to simplify operation of the system. In addition to a PLC-based machine protection component and IO interface, a CSS-based suite of control GUI monitors systems including Modulator and RF, Vacuum, Magnets, and electron gun. An overview of this system is presented in this article.
