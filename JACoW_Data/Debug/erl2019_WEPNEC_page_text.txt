The currently installed configuration of TRIUMF’s superconducting electron linac (e-linac) can produce an electron beam up to 30MeV and 10mA. Low beam power commissioning of the segment spanning the electron gun to high energy dump took place in summer 2018 with an attained beam energy of 25MeV. As the driver of the ARIEL project, the e-linac will deliver electrons to a photo-converter target station for the production of neutron-rich rare isotope beams (RIB) via photo fission. The e-linac will have sufficient beam power to support the demands of other user community rare isotope beams. This driver accelerator could server as a production machine for high field THz radiation and as irradiation center. A recirculation of the beam would be beneficial for RIB production at higher beam energy and would allow for high bunch compression to generate THz radiation. Such a system would also allow for the investigation of a high beam intensity energy recovery linac. To this end, TRIUMF is investigating the design of such a recirculation and the beam dynamics as a first step.

Since, due to the heat capacity of the cryogenics, additional heat load on a cryogenic system as a result of uncontrolled beam losses is only allowed to be below 50 W which corresponds to 10-5 respected to the full power of BERLinPro, the development of diagnostics which can measure the intensity in the order of 10-5 is crucial. In our previous beam test of the coronagraph-based halo monitor with various operation modes of the BESSY II storage ring, the limitation of the measurement of the halo distribution was to be 10-4 respected to the core intensity due to the noise produced by scattered light from digs and scratches of the first objective lens. In order to mitigate the noise level produced from the surface of the objective lens to reach 10-5 to 10-6, the Mie-scattering effect was investigated, and furthermore, a high-quality surface lens was purchased.

For the operation of an SRF photoinjector a well-functioning and efficient cooling system of the photocathode is necessary. A test experiment was set up of the photocathode cooling system based on the original components, which we call thermal contact experiment (TCX). We present the results of our thermal load studies on the photocathode insert with exchangeable photocathode plug. The goal was to test all components before they are installed in the cold string of the BERLinPro SRF-Photoinjector to ensure the operation of very sensitive semiconductor photocathodes. The tests include the investigation of the cooling performance, the thermal load management and the mechanical stability of the photocathode insert.

High power HOM damper is a challenge for high current SRF accelerator. In the past few years, we developed two types of high power HOM damper: a novel rigid waveguide high power HOM damping scheme and a room temperature SiC beampipe absorbing scheme. This presentation will present the design and test results of these two HOM damping schemes.

The Energy Recovery Linac project BERLinPro is a test facility to study the beam parameter range necessary for an ERL as synchrotron light source [1]. It is currently under construction and is designed to operate with the maximum beam parameters of 50 MeV and 100 mA cw current. Even if the electron losses within the recirculator are limited to 0.6 % due to the available rf power, (at higher losses an immediate beam break-up occurs because of the ERL principle) the beam loss power can be by orders of magnitude higher than in electron storage rings used for synchrotron radiation. The Fluka [2,3] calculations of the resulting activations of machine components and air activations have been discussed in earlier papers [4,5]. In this work we present the components of the ambient dosimetry, the measurement system of air activations and their inclusion in the personal safety system. Additionally we present recent calculations of the activation of cooling water and the method of storing and measuring it in case of a leakage.

BERLinPro is an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) Project, currently being set up at the HZB. The accelerator consists of an injector part (SRF photo injector and booster section) and the ERL part (LINAC and recirculator section). Until realization of the final ERL setup further beam applications are under development using only the injector part of BERLinPro, like ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) or tomography experiments. For those cases a dedicated beam optic for the complete injector is required that differ from the standard ERL optics. Especially for UED experiments, an extreme short electron bunch and a tiny transverse emittance are needed. For the optimization of the injector two multi-parameter Pareto optimization tools were used. On the one hand, ASTRA with an external MATLAB optimizer, on the other hand, OPAL** with its new internal optimization tool. In this paper we will present both generic methods and compare their results.

For intense electron bunches traversing through bends, as for example the recirculation arcs of an Energy-Recovery Linac (ERL), dispersion matching with space charge of an arc into the subsequent radio-frequency (RF) structure is essential to maintain the beam quality. We show that beam envelopes and dispersion along the bends and recirculation arcs of an ERL, including space charge forces, can be matched to adjust the beam to the parameters of the subsequent section. The present study is focused on a small-scale, double-sided recirculating linac Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA). MESA is an under construction two pass ERL at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\"at Mainz, which should deliver a continuous wave (CW) beam at 105 MeV for physics experiments with a pseudo-internal target. In this work, a coupled transverse-longitudinal beam matrix approach for matching with space charge in MESA is employed.

As a new electron source with higher brilliance, the second superconducting RF photoinjector (SRF Gun II) has been built at the ELBE radiation center for high power radiation sources. One of the main goals of SRF gun II is to achieve a higher bunch charge (>200 pC) and lower emittance (3 mm mrad) than the present ELBE thermionic DC gun. SRF Gun II features a 3.5-cell niobium cavity as well as a superconducting solenoid in the same cryomodule. With Mg photocathodes the gun is able to provide medium current beam with bunch charge of more than 200 pC and sub-ps bunch length at 100 kHz repetition rate. With this contribution we present convincing results from long-term user operation of SRF gun II in combination with the bunching concept of the ELBE accelerator in order to produce THz radiation with much higher stability and power than available using the existing thermionic gun.

High-brightness electron beams provided by modern accelerators require several measures to preserve their high quality and to avoid instabilities. The mitigation of the impact of residual ions is one of these measures. It is particularly important if high bunch charges in combination with high repetition rates are aimed for. This is because ions can be trapped in the strong negative electrical potential of the electron beam causing emittance blow-up, increased beam halo and longitudinal and transverse instabilities. One ion-clearing strategy is the installation of clearing electrodes. Of particular interest in this context is the performance of multi-purpose electrodes, which are designed such that they allow for a simultaneous ion-clearing and beam-position monitoring. Such electrodes will be installed in the BERLinPro facility. In this contribution, we present numerical studies of the performance of multi-purpose clearing-electrodes planned for BERLinPro, i.e. we investigate the behavior of ions generated by electron bunches while passing through the field of the electrodes. Hereby, several ion species and configurations of electrodes are considered.

We present the conceptual designs of BriXS and BriXSino (a minimal test-bench demonstrator of proof of principle) for a compact X-ray Source based on innovative push-pull ERLs. BriXS, the first stage of the Marix project, is a Compton X-ray source based on superconducting cavity technology with energy recirculation and on a laser system in Fabry-Pérot cavity at a repetition rate of 100 MHz, producing 20-180 keV radiation for medical applications. The energy recovery scheme based on a modified folded push-pull CW-SC twin Linac ensemble allows to sustain MW-class beam power with almost just one hundred kW active power dissipation/consumption.

High average current electron injectors are desired by high average beam power SRF linacs. With respect to the different linac application, different beam qualities are required. Two kinds of electron gun are planned for future projects at IMP, one is thermionic electron gun dedicated for high average current, and another one is photocathode gun which is for high average current and high beam quality or even with high polarization. Current status and development of the high average current electron source are investigated and summarized. The thermionic gun studies are planned and the feasible types of gun for the future Electron ion collider of China (EicC) project are also proposed. The pre-research scheme of these two kinds of electron guns are schemed, which will be the start of high average current and high-quality electron source development at Institute of modern physics (IMP), Chinese academy of sciences (CAS).

The radiation power of the FEL with optical cavity can be limited by the overheating of reflecting mirrors. In the electron outcoupling scheme electron beam radiates the main power at a slight angle to the optical axis. For this, it is necessary to divide undulator by a dipole magnet at least in two parts - the first for the electron beam bunching in the field of the main optical mode, and the second for the power radiation by deflected beam. Electron outcoupling system is installed on the third FEL based on the multiturn energy recovery linac of the Novosibirsk Free Electron Laser facility (NovoFEL). It consists of three undulators, dipole correctors and two quadrupole lenses assembled between them. There are two different configurations of the system since the electrons can be deflected in either the second or the third undulator. The electron beam dynamics calculations and the results of the first experiments are presented.

Photocathode R&D activity within ASTeC is focussed on further development of the tools required for the preparation and characterisation of high performance photocathodes for X-FELs. Our Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS)* experimental facility can be used with III-V semiconductor, multi-alkali and metal photocathodes to measure transverse and longitudinal energy distributions of the emitted electrons. Recently TESS has been upgraded to increase the instrument sensitivity for operation with low QE materials under UV illumination. Our R&D facilities also include in-vacuum quantum efficiency measurement, XPS, STM, plus ex-vacuum optical and STM microscopy for surface metrology. Intrinsic photocathode emittance is affected by many factors including illumination wavelength and surface roughness. We present energy distribution measurements for electrons emitted from copper, niobium and zirconium photocathode samples with measured levels of surface roughness under illumination by wavelengths between 256 and 291 nm. We also present an update on progress to establish a multi-alkali photocathode preparation facility to support the CLARA** linear accelerator.

The longitudinal solution space of an energy recovery linac is an under-constrained system. For applications where we wish to compress the bunches for delivery to, for example, a free-electron laser or an interaction point, and simultaneously ensure full recovery it is useful to be able to rapidly ascertain and assess the possible solutions. Moreover, when we consider multi-pass ERLS, we quickly conclude that a trial-and-error approach to deriving such solutions (through for example one-dimensional particle tracking) is impractical. Here we extend an analytic recurrence method of deriving phase space solutions in multistage compression schemes, due to Zagorodnov & Dohlus, to multi-pass energy recovery linac systems. We use this method to categorise classes of solutions, and explore the implications of the energy recovery condition.

The injector for PERLE, a proposed electron Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) test facility for the LHeC and FCC-eh projects, is intended to deliver 500 pC bunches at a repetition rate of 40.1 MHz for a total beam current of 20 mA. These bunches must have a bunch length of 3 mm rms and an energy of 7 MeV at the entrance to the first linac pass while simultaneously achieving a transverse emittance of less than 6 mm mrad. The injector is based around a DC photocathode electron gun, followed by a focusing and normal conducting bunching section, a booster with 5 independently controllable SRF cavities and a merger into the main ERL. A design for this injector from the photocathode to the exit of the booster is presented. This design was simulated using ASTRA for the beam dynamics simulations and optimized using the many objective optimization algorithm NSGAIII. The use of NSGAIII allows more than three beam parameters to be optimised simultaneously and the trade-offs between them to be explored.

Compton backscattering at energy recovery linacs (ERLs) promise high flux, high energy x-ray sources in the future, made possible by high quality, high repetition rate electron beams produced by ERLs. CBETA, the Cornell-Brookhaven accelerator currently being commissioned at Cornell, is an SRF multi-turn ERL using Non-Scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (NS-FFA) arcs. CBETA has high quality design parameters with an anticipated top energy of 150 MeV on the fourth pass. The expected parameters of a Compton source at CBETA include a top x-ray energy of over 400 keV with a flux on the order of 1012 ph/s. One particular application requiring a high energy, high flux source is spectroscopy in high energy atomic physics. In this paper, we present anticipated parameters and potential applications in science and engineering for this source.

We present simulation results to decouple the emittance contributions that are intrinsic from the injector lattice versus emittance contributions due to the quality of the cathode out of a 100 MeV electron injector system. Using ASTRA driven by the NSGA-II genetic algorithm, we optimized the LCLS-II injector system with a zero emittance cathode. We then imposed FEL specific energy constraints and show how the Pareto Front solution shifts. Lastly, we reoptimized at various cathode emittances to map out the dependence of cathode emittance versus final emittance out of the injector system. We then determined the cathode quality needed to hit a 0.1 mm mrad 95% rms transverse emittance specification out of the current LCLS-II injector system.

In this report, we present the development of a fast harmonic kicker, a normal conducting deflecting cavity that kicks electron bunches from ERL ring to circulator cooler ring (CCR) in Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC). This cavity utilizes 5 harmonic modes to generate a sharp kick to the electron bunch at high frequency of 86.6MHz, which is injection frequency into the CCR. The beam dynamics study and RF design of the hardware was reported in [1],[2]. In this report we present further progress including impedance by higher order mode (HOM) study and mechanical design for fabrication.

The Low Energy RHIC Electron Cooling (LEReC) ac-celerator was successfully commissioned at BNL. To satisfy the electron beam quality required for cooling, a high voltage DC photocathode gun was chosen as the electron source. The LEReC DC gun system is based on the Cornell University ERL gun. The gun was successfully commissioned with high-current and produced electron beam quality suitable for cooling. Here we describe operational experience with the LEReC gun, as well as experience gained with conditioning of such guns.

A Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) has a potential of substantial reducing cooling time of the high-energy hadrons and hence to boost luminosity in high-intensity hadron-hadron and electron-hadron colliders. In a CeC system, a high quality electron beam is generated, propagated and optimized through a beam line which was carefully designed with consideration of space charge effect, wakefields and nonlinear dynamics such as coherent synchrotron radiation and chromatic aberration. In this paper, we present our study on the beam dynamics of such a beam line and discuss the possibility of using an ERL for high repetition operation.

Low emittance, high QE and long lifetime photocathode is widely studied for X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL)and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL) applications. A deposition system for alkali antimonide photocathode (K2CsSb, Cs3Sb etc.) is being commissioned at Peking University. In this paper, we present our experimental results on alkali antimonide photocathode with this deposition system. We successfully fabricated Cs3Sb photocathode on oxygen free copper, p-type Si (100) and Mo substrates with QE of 1.4%, 2.6% and 2.6% respectively.
