The ID31 beamline is able to provide X-Ray energies ranging from 20 to 150keV. The energy range 50-150keVis covered by a Laue-Laue monochromator located at 100meters from the source. Two asymmetrically cut Si crystals equipped with benders, based on a new concept, provide an energy resolution ranging from few hundreds of eV down to the Darwin width of few eV. The bender principle, design, manufacture and first commissioning will be described. The virtual source, produced with a white beam transfocator, can be before or after the monochromator. Therefore the bending mechanism must allow both concave and convex configuration with bending radius from 20m to infinite. Each bender is equipped with two home made piezo-jacks in close loop with capacitive sensor. The system is liquid Nitrogen cooled. The thermal behaviour will be described in detail and thermo-mechanical finite element analysis presented.

Over time X-Ray mirrors are demanded for better focusing, closer to sample refocusing, spot size as well as better beam uniformity at sample position. Based on the experience of ALBA Phase I beam lines a new alter-native design of a mirror bender* is proposed. The system includes two main functionalities: the mirror bender mechanism and mirror figure error correc-tion. Both mechanisms are based on the introduction of a force constrain on the mirror surface instead of a geometrical one. As being based on a force mechanism they could reach high resolution and especially for the correctors which can achieve nanometre resolution. The correctors are designed to provide high force stability in the mirror side, eliminating the crosstalk between bending and figure correction, and minimizing the sensitivity to drifts. With such controlled deformation of the mirror substrate it is possible to obtain the desired surface figure not only to correct mirror figure errors but also to adapt it to the incident wavefront, thus becoming adaptive system. The mechanical solutions are presented which are able to correct mirror surfaces with a resolution of 1 nm reaching slope errors below 100 nrad.

Design of the Diamond Light Source DMM for the VMXi Beamline

A Double Multilayer Monochromator (DMM) was designed in-house for the VMXi beam-line. This paper describes the novel engineering solutions employed to build a high stability instrument. PiezoMotor® actuators drive sine-arm Bragg axes for both optics providing the coarse and fine motion in a single actuator. The long translation of the second multilayer is driven externally via a linear shift to eliminate in-vacuum pipe & cable motions. A high stability air bearing translates the whole DMM across the two multilayer stripes. The optics are water cooled via an Indium / Gallium eutectic alloy bath to minimise coupled vibrations. The DMM is operational on the VMXi beam-line, experimental and performance data is presented.

Based on the success of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the Department of Energy has funded the LCLS-II - a billion-dollar project. In addition to the existing LCLS copper linac that delivers FEL pulses at 120 Hz, the LCLS-II project will provide a 4 GeV superconducting (SC) linear accelerator to deliver high-repetition-rate FEL pulses, up to 1 MHz. The average power of the FEL beam from the SC linac will range from 20 to 200 W, and potentially to 600 W. The FEL beam has ultra-short pulse length (down to a few fs), narrow energy band width (down to less than 10-4, thanks to self-seeding technology), and is fully coherent beam. The preservation of the wavefront is essential to maintain the outstanding FEL beam properties. In this paper, we will describe the technical challenge of the optics design to preserve the FEL beam wavefront. We will focus on the KB mirror system for LCLS-II instruments. We will especially discuss the aspects of cooling technology to minimize the thermal deformation and the management and minimization of the mechanical coupling between the mirror bending and the cooling.
