The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) at RAL has studied the ionization cooling of muons. Several million individual particle tracks have been recorded passing through a series of focusing magnets in a number of different configurations and a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride absorber. Measurement of the tracks upstream and downstream of the absorber has shown the expected effects of the 4D emittance reduction. This invited talk presents and discusses these results, and projects the future of ionization cooling.
Abstract submitted by the speakers bureau of the MICE Collaboration. If accepted, a member of the collaboration will be selected to present the contribution

A Compact LAser Plasma Accelerator (CLAPA) that can stably produce and transport protons with different energies less than 10 MeV, less than 1% energy spread and several to tens of pC charge is demonstrated. The high current proton beam with continuous energy spectrum and a large divergence angle was generated by using a high contrast laser interacting with micron thickness targets, which later was collected, analyzed and refocused by an electromagnetic lattice using combination of quadrupole and bending electromagnets. This is the first experiment that combines the laser acceleration with a fully functional beam line, realizing the precise manipulation of the proton beams with reliability, availability, maintainability and inspectability . Spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP), the key technology of proton radiotherapy for malignant tumors, is then realized with laser accelerator for the first time.

Plasma Wakefield acceleration is a promising new acceleration techniques that profit by a charged bunch, e.g. an electron bunch, to break the neutrality of a plasma channel to produce a wake where a trailing bunch is eventually accelerated. The quest to achieve extreme gradient conserving high brightness has prompted to a variety of new approaches and techniques. Most of the proposed schemes are however limited to the only plasma channel, assuming in the vast majority of cases, ideal scenarios (e.g. ideal bi-gaussian bunches and uniform density plasma channels). Realistic start-to-end simulations, from the photo-cathode to FEL via a high gradient, emittance and energy spread preserving plasma section, are mandatory for paving the way towards plasma-based user facilities.

The Proton Driven Advanced Wake Field Acceleration Experiment  (AWAKE) at CERN

The Advanced Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment (AWAKE) aims at studying plasma wake field generation and electron acceleration driven by proton bunches. It is a proof-of-principle R&D experiment at CERN and the world’s first proton driven plasma wake field acceleration experiment. The experiment uses the 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS which travels through a 10 m long Rb-vapour plasma cell where it gets self-modulated and generates the plasma wake fields. Eventually an electron beam is injected externally to probe the wake-fields. AWAKE will has completed several experimental campaigns starting in 2016. Results from the initial characterization of the plasma cell and measurements of the seeded self-modulation of the proton beam will be presented. Experiments to accelerate externally injected electrons using the proton driven plasma wake fields will start in 2018 and first results will be reported.

The APS Linac photo-injector can deliver high brightness electron beams to the Linac Extension Area (LEA) for beam experiments such as TESSA (Tapering Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification). Beam jitter in the device-under-test (DUT) area of the LEA can adversely affect the quality of data for such experiments. In this paper, a start-to-end simulation of jitter is studied. Sources of jitter include photo-cathode drive-laser arrival time, laser energy, and RF phases and voltages of the photo-cathode gun and accelerating cavities. It is found that at the DUT the relative mean energy jitter is the most significant concern, and that improvements in the Linac RF voltage stability can help to reduce it. RMS energy spread are more sensitive to the laser timing and charge jitter. The laser timing jitter itself can be compressed by the magnetic chicane by a factor of 5.6.

Laser and THz Driven Deflection and Acceleration of Electron Beams

Dielectric laser accelerators have shown very high accelerating gradients but the phase space that can be captured is very small due to the short wavelength. Moving to THz frequencies could potentially allow larger bunches to be captured and accelerated. Here the THz is generated via Cherenkov radiation in a non-linear dielectric from a laser pulse. Two schemes are proposed either by accelerating in a dielectric waveguide or by creating a travelling focus in the THz allowing direct acceleration.
