The Australian third generation 3 GeV Synchrotron Light Source was originally commissioned with a 100 MeV linear accelerator (LINAC) fed by two 37 MW S band pulsed klystrons. A pulse compressor in form of a SLED cavity was added later to enable single klystron operation for redundancy in case of a modulator failure. The SLED was successfully commissioned in May 2017 including remote selection of single klystron with SLED operation without degradation of beam energy. Two years on there have been some unexpected operational benefits including reduced phase sensitivity and drift allowing repeatable injection based solely on diagnostic phase read backs. Temperature stabilised power amplifiers based on S band GaN radar technology are being trialed in the meantime with a goal to set and inject with minimal operator adjustment. The results from the SLED cavity upgrade are shown and the latest S band radar technology designs are outlined.

At ALBA four Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) measure the beam position along the Linac to Booster Transfer Line. The BPM electronics (Libera Spark type) have been recently upgraded in order to be sensitive to single-pass beam detection. As a result, the position resolution measured in LTB BPMs has been increased by a factor 10 with respect to the former electronics. The increased resolution enables us to resolve the energy jitter of the Linac beam, providing an on-line measurement of the Linac energy during regular operation. In this paper a study of the Linac energy jitter is presented as well as its correlation with the jitter sources.

Funding: Part of this work supported by the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) H2020 Programme under grant agreement n°662186 (MYRTE project).
The goal of the MYRRHA project is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of transmutation in a 100 MW Accelerator Driven System (ADS) by building a new flexible irradiation complex at Mol (Belgium). The MYRRHA facility requires a 600 MeV accelerator delivering a maximum proton current of 4 mA in continuous wave operation, with an additional requirement for exceptional reliability. Supported by SCK•CEN and the Belgium government the project has entered in its phase I: which consists in the development and the construction of the linac first part, up to 100 MeV. We review the design updates of the superconducting linac, with its enhanced fault-tolerance capabilities. The linac capabilities at 100 MeV (Phase I) and 600 MeV (ADS operation) are exposed and discussed.

The MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring lattice contains several strong sextupoles. In order to achieve nominal lattice performance it is important to be able to characterise and correct the higher order magnets and optics of the lattice. This has been done through the analysis of the Off-Energy Response Matrix (OEORM). Its approximate linearity in sextupole strength has been utilised to identify sextupole errors, as well as symmetrise the 2nd order optics. The symmetrisation was able to correct chromaticity, and increase horizontal acceptance by 50 %, compared to magnet settings based solely on rotating coil measurements. An approximate decrease of 10 % in vertical acceptance was detected. This work was inspired by similar investigations at ESRF.

The SPIRAL2 facility at GANIL will use a high-power p, d and heavy-ion superconducting linac for a wide range of applications including RIB production using both ISOL and in-flight techniques. The SPIRAL2 phase 1 deals with the high-power superconducting linac with two experimental areas called ’Neutrons for Science’ (NFS) and ’Super Separator Spectrometer’ (S3). The low energy experimental hall DESIR, under construction, will further increase the possibility for physics experiments. All the linac is installed, the commissioning of the injec-tor part (two sources and the A/Q = 3 RFQ) and two cool down of the entire superconducting linac have been suc-cessfully done. We are now in the linac beam commis-sioning phase. The project scope and parameters, the constraints linked to the safety rules, the accelerator, NFS, S3 and DESIR status and the planning will be pre-sented.

The SPIRAL2 injector, made up of a 5 mA p-d ion source, a 1 mA heavy ion source (up to A/Q = 3) and a CW 0.75 MeV/u RFQ, has been commissioned in parallel with the superconducting linac installation. This com-missioning is successfully completed now and the Diag-nostic plate (D-plate) used to characterize the injector beams is removed. This paper presents the results ob-tained with the reference particles (H+, 4He2+, 18O6+ and 40Ar14+) and a comparison with the simulations. The connexion to the SC linac and the future linac beam commissioning is briefly described.

The spin vector of a particle injected into a perfectly aligned storage ring precesses about the vertically-orientated guide field. In the presence of an Electric Dipole Moment (EDM), the spin precession axis acquires a proportional radial component. However, in an imperfect ring, rotational magnet misalignments induce a radial component to the spin precession axis, related to the Magnetic Dipole Moment (MDM). In the Frequency Domain Method, [*] this additional precession is dealt with by consecutively injecting the beam in opposite directions, and constructing the EDM estimator as the sum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise vertical plane precession frequencies. Since the radial MDM component changes sign when the magnetic field direction is reversed, it cancels in the sum, leaving only the EDM effect. In order to reproduce the guide field magnitude with precision sufficient for the cancellation of the MDM effect, we propose to calibrate the guide field via the horizontal plane precession frequency. In the present work we describe the algorithm of the field flipping procedure, and do a numerical simulation.

The spin precession axis of a particle involved in betatron motion precesses about the invariant spin axis defined on the closed orbit (CO). This precession can be observed in polarization data as a rapid, small-amplitude oscillation on top of the major effect oscillation caused by the precession of spin about the CO axis. The frequency of this latter oscillation is used in the Frequency Domain (FD) methodology as the EDM observable. [*] It is estimated by fitting polarimetry data by a sine function; the rapid oscillations, therefore, constitute a model specification error. This model error might introduce a bias into the frequency estimate. In the present work we investigate the effect of the spin precession axis motion on measurement data and fit quality, and conclude that it is not only insignificant (with regard to data perturbation) compared to spin tune variation, but is also controllable via the application of a Spin Wheel.

Spin coherence refers to a measure of preservation of polarization in an initially polarized beam. The spin vector of a particle injected into a storage ring starts to precess about the vertical magnetic field vector in accordance with the Thomas-BMT equation. The precession frequency is dependent on the equilibrium-level energy, which differs across the beam particles. This does not pose a problem when the initial polarization is vertical; however, the Frozen Spin Storage Ring EDM search method [*] requires beam polarization along the momentum vector, i.e., in the horizontal plane. In the present work we analyze the source of decoherence, and investigate the way it can be suppressed in the horizontal plane in a perfectly aligned ring by means of sextupole fields. We also consider the case of an imperfect ring: transference of decoherence into the vertical plane induced by vertical plane spin precession, and the effect of sextupole fields.

The ARES (Accelerator Research Experiment at SINBAD) linac at the accelerator R&D facility SINBAD (Short innovative bunches and accelerators at DESY) will drive multiple independent experiments including the acceleration of ultrashort electron bunches. In addition the linac will host an experimental area, open for transnational access, to study advanced high gradient, laser driven, acceleration concepts, like the ones studied within the ACHIP (accelerator on a chip) project. The area will be operational mid-2019. This paper will report on the current status of the experimental area, including hardware parameters, beam optics, achievable beam parameters, design of the experimental chamber and commissioning plans. The modification plans for a micro-bunching experiment in the frame of the ACHIP experiment and future upgrade plans will be shown and discussed in detail.

Errors from discretization and large data volume of field maps is a concern for beam dynamics simulations with respect to achievable accuracy and to the required amount of time. High-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) has recently emerged as simple, effective, and adaptive tool to extract the essentials from multidimensional data. This paper is on the feasibility of compression and noise reduction of electromagnetic field map data with HOSVD. The method has been applied to an electric field map of a DTL cavity with 11 m in length comprising 55 rf-gaps. The original field map data of 220 MB was converted into practically noise-free data of just 20 KB. Noise was reduced by 95% as demonstrated using a cubic cavity for which the analytical field map is available.

For future synchrotron light source development novel operation modes are under investigation. At the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA) an optics with negative momentum compaction has been proposed, which is currently under commissioning. In this context, the collective effects expected in this regime are studied with an initial focus on the head-tail instability and the micro-bunching instability resulting from CSR self-interaction. In this contribution, we will present the proposed optics and the status of implementation for operation in the negative momentum compaction regime as well as a preliminary discussion of expected collective effects.

The FAIR proton linac is developed as the high current proton injector for the future FAIR antiproton production chain at GSI. It will provide a 70 mA proton beam at an energy of 68 MeV to the SIS18 synchrotron. The linac consists of an ECR ion source, followed by a ladder RFQ and a normalconducting linac based on CH-type cavities. High beam currents and strict beam quality requirements were the main drivers for the beam dynamics design. To ensure matching between the individual sections and validate the injector design as a whole, end to end simulations were performed using TraceWin with 3D fieldmaps of the CH-linac. In this paper, the final cavity design, as well as the results of end to end simulations and error studies are discussed.

For the production of Antiproton beams with sufficient intensities, a dedicated high-intensity 325 MHz Proton linac is currently under construction. The Proton linac shall deliver a beam current of up to 70 mA with an energy of 68 MeV for injection into SIS18. The source is designed for the generation of 100 mA beams. The Low-Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT) contains two magnetic solenoid lenses enclosing a diagnostics chamber, a beam chopper and a beam conus. A ladder 4-Rod RFQ and six normal conducting crossbar cavities of CCH and CH type arranged in two sections accelerate the beam to the final energy of 68 MeV. The technical design of the DTL CH cavities are presented and the commissioning measurements of the ion source are described. The construction and the procurement progress, the design and testing results of the key hardware are presented.

The MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reac-tor for High-tech Applications) Project is a planned ac-celerator driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of long-living radioactive waste. In order test the reliability of the planned 17 MeV injector, a shortened injector with 5.9 MeV consisting of the ion source, a 4-Rod RFQ, 2 Quarter Wave Rebunchers (QWRs) and a total of 7 normal conducting CH structures is currently being installed in Louvein-la-Neuve (LLN, Belgium). Before the cavities can be tested with beam, they are subjected to so-called low power tests several times during the individual con-struction stages in order to be able to correct any devia-tions. This paper describes the status of the two Quarter Wave Rebunchers, which are currently in the process of copper plating and final acceptance, as well as the first two CH structures, the first of which is already being conditioned while CH 2 is still in preparation.

The MYRRHA Project (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) in Mol, Belgium, is an upcoming accelerator driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of long-living radioactive waste. In the injector section of the accelerator, consisting of a 4-rod RFQ and a normal conducting CH-cavity section, the protons will be accelerated up to 17 MeV before entering the superconducting gap-spoke cavity section with an output energy of 600 MeV. A shortened test-injector with an output energy of 5.9 MeV is currently being installed at the SCK. CEN in Louvein-la- Neuve, Belgium. This test-injector serves the purpose of testing the reliability of the planned injector. When commissioning a cavity, it first has to be fed very little power to avoid damage to the structure by flashovers, discharges and multipacting. The power is then slowly increased up to full operation level. In this process, the surfaces are cleaned by heating/outgasing so that the effects disturbing operation described above do no longer occur. This paper will report on the status of the conditioning of the 176.1 MHz 4-rod RFQ up to 120 kW of the MYRRHA-injector and additional measurements concerning the gap voltage which are currently being performed at the SCK. CEN.

At the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, the HElmholtz LInear ACcelerator (HELIAC) is currently under construction. The HELIAC comprises superconducting multigap Crossbar H-mode (SC CH) cavities. The input beam is delivered by an already existing High Charge Injector (HLI). For the further development of the accelerator a detailed knowledge of the input beam parameters to the SC section is necessary. A method for beam reconstruction is incorporated, which provides for longitudinal beam characteristics using measurements with a beam shape monitor and a particle simulation code. This finalizes the investigations on 6D beam parameters, following previous measurements in transversal phase space. The reconstruction of the longitudinal phase portrait is presented.

Bunch compressors are essential for the generation of short bunches with applications in e.g. colliders, free electron lasers, and advanced accelerator concepts. The up-and-coming ARES accelerator located at SINBAD, DESY will support the formation of ~100~MeV, pC, sub-fs electron bunches for LWFA research and development. We give an overview on the ARES bunch compressor, providing start-to-end simulations of the machine and an update on its technical design.

The accelerator R&D facility SINBAD (Short innovative bunches and accelerators at DESY) will drive multiple independent experiments including the acceleration of ultrashort electron bunches and the test of advanced high gradient acceleration concepts. The SINBAD-ARES (Accelerator Research Experiment at SINBAD) setup hosts a normal conducting RF photoinjector generating a low charge electron beam that is afterwards accelerated to 100 MeV by an S-band linac section. The linac as well as a magnetic chicane allow the production of ultrashort pulses with an excellent arrival-time stability. The high brightness beam has then the potential to serve as a test beam for next generation compact acceleration schemes. The setup of the SINBAD-ARES facility will proceed in stages. We report on the current status of the ARES RF gun and linac commissioning.

Due to the decommissioning of several research reactors there will be a severe drop in available neutrons for research in Europe in the next decade despite the commissioning of the European Spallation Source (ESS). Compact accelerator-based neutron sources (CANS) could close this gap. The High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) currently under development at Forschungszentrum Jülich is scalable in terms of beam energy and power due to its modular design. The driver Linac for HBS at will accelerate a 100 mA proton beam to 70 MeV. The Linac is operated with a beam duty cycle of up to 6% (11% RF duty cycle) and can simultaneously deliver three proton pulse lengths (384 Hz@52 mu-s, 96 Hz@208 mu-s and 24 Hz@832 mu-s) for three neutron production targets. In order to minimize the development effort and the technological risk, state-of-the-art technology of the MYRRHA injector is used. The front end of the HBS Linac consists of an ECR source, LEBT and a 2.5 MeV RFQ followed by a CH-DTL with 35 room temperature CH-cavities. All RF structures are operated at 176.1 MHz and are designed for high duty cycle. Solid-state amplifiers up to 500 kW are used as RF drivers. Due to the beam current and the high average beam power of up to 420 kW, particular attention is paid to beam dynamics. In order to minimize losses, a quasi-periodic lattice with constant negative phase is used. The contribution describes the conceptual design and the challenges of such a modern high power proton accelerator with high reliability and availability.

The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe cannot be explained by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. In order to resolve the matter dominance an additional CP violating phenomenon is needed. A candidate for physics beyond the SM is a non-vanishing Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of subatomic particles. Since permanent EDMs violate parity and time reversal symmetries, they are also CP violating if the CPT -theorem is assumed. The JEDI (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) collaboration in Jülich is preparing a direct EDM measurement of protons and deuterons first at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron) and later at a dedicated storage ring. In order to analyse the data and to disentangle the EDM signal from systematic effects spin tracking simulations are needed. Therefore a model of COSY was implemented using the software library Bmad. It includes the measured magnet misalignments of the latest survey and a simplified description of the RF-Wien Filter device that is used for the EDM measurement. The model was successfully benchmarked using analytical predictions of the spin behavior. A crucial point regarding the data analysis is the knowledge of the orientation of the invariant spin axis with vanishing EDM at the position of the RF-Wien Filter. Especially its radial component is unknown and spin tracking simulations can be used to determine this missing number. Tracking results as well as the algorithm to find the invariant spin axis will be presented.

The linac based CW electron accelerator ELBE operates different secondary beamlines one at a time. For the future different end stations should be served simultaneously, hence specific bunch patterns have to be kicked into different beam-lines. The variability of the bunch pattern and the frequency resp. switching time are one of the main arguments for a stripline-kicker. A design with two tapered active electrodes and two ground fenders was optimized in time and frequency domain with the software package CST. From that a design has been transferred into a construction and was manufactured. The prototype has been tested in the laboratory and installed in the ELBE beam line. The presentation summarises the recent results and the first beam line test.

The construction of a 3.3m Ladder-RFQ at IAP*, Goethe University Frankfurt, has been finished successfully last summer. This RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the p-Linac at FAIR**. Along the acceleration section the parameters modulation, aperture and synchronous phase are varied linearly with cell number, which differs from former designs from IAP Frankfurt. The ratio of transversal vane curvature radius to mid-cell radial aperture and the vane radius itself are constant. The development of an adequate beam dynamics design was done with the aid of the RFQGen-code and in close collaboration with the IAP resonator design team. The RFQ beam dynamics design could be successfully reproduced with the TOUTATIS-routine of CEAs*** TraceWin-code. Several new beam dynamics simulations were performed on the design. Among these were current and Twiss parameter studies as well as simulations concerned with the investigation of longitudinal entrance and exit gap field effects. Others were based on new measurements in the LEBT-line performed by the GSI**** Ion Source Group in April 2019. In the near future, further LEBT measurements and subsequent simulations (among other to design a well-fitting cone for the RFQ), as well as mechanical error studies in TOUTATIS, will follow.

Based on the positive results of the unmodulated 325 MHz Ladder-RFQ prototype from 2013 to 2016, we developed and designed a modulated 3.4 m Ladder-RFQ*. The unmodulated Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. It accepted 3 times the operating power of which is needed in operation**. That level corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 µs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project. This particular high frequency for a 4-ROD-RFQ creates difficulties, which triggered the development of a Ladder-RFQ with its high symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is very well suited for that frequency. The duty cycle is up to 5% for the applied cooling concept. Manufacturing has been completed in September 2018. We will show the finalization of assembly after manufacturing as well as low level RF measurements. The final machining step for both flatness and frequency tuning has been finished in April 2019.

The standalone superconducting (SC) continuous wave (CW) heavy ion linac HELIAC (HElmholtz LInear ACcelerator) is a common project of GSI and HIM under key support of IAP Frankfurt and in collaboration with Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhI) and Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (KI-ITEP). It is intended for future experiments with heavy ions near the Coulomb barrier within super-heavy element (SHE) research and aims at developing a linac with multiple CH cavities as key components downstream the High Charge State Injector (HLI) at GSI. The design is challenging due to the requirement of intense beams in CW mode up to a mass-to-charge ratio of 6, while covering a broad output energy range from 3.5 to 7.3 MeV/u with minimum energy spread. In 2017 the first superconducting section of the linac has been successfully commissioned and extensively tested with beam at GSI. In the light of experience gained in this research so far, the beam dynamics layout for the entire linac has recently been updated and optimized with particular emphasis on realistic assumptions of cavity gap and drift lengths as well as gap voltage distributions for CH3’CH11.

The synchrotron SIS18 of the GSI facility has recently resumed beam operation after a long shutdown, during which major upgrades for the operation of SIS18 in the FAIR facility were realized. This signifies a major milestone for the mission of GSI and FAIR. On one hand, the scientific program of GSI depends strongly on beam from SIS18, including the very important developments of detectors for FAIR experiments. On the other hand, large parts of the existing GSI accelerator facility, including SIS18, are now operated with the FAIR control system, demonstrating its suitability for control of a large scale accelerator facility. Commissioning of the new control system started during the shutdown with a series of dry runs, which proved very useful to establish the basic functionalities. Recommissioning of SIS18 was further facilitated by the fact that the machine model of SIS18, implemented in the modeling framework LSA, had already been tested with beam several years before the shutdown. Thus, all operation modes of SIS18, including multi-turn injection, electron cooling, as well as fast and slow extraction could be successfully commissioned during the first weeks of operation. Other commissioning activities concerned the operation of new devices installed during the shutdown. These devices, mostly installed to prepare SIS18 for the operation with FAIR design parameters, open new possibilities in the standard operation of SIS18. A challenge for the operation of SIS18 is posed by ground motion due to ground water lowering for the nearby FAIR construction site. Surveys revealed that SIS18 subsided by several centimeters during one year. Even though the machine was realigned prior to recommissioning, the dynamics of the ground motion will continue to affect operation of SIS18.

In order to meet the beam intensity and quality requirements imposed by FAIR, the HSI-RFQ beam dynamics originally dating from 2009 has been re-designed recently at CERN. Front-to-end simulations demonstrated that the new design meets the FAIR targets. Implementation of the new electrodes, initially planned for 2019, will require re-adaption of the RFQ cavity rf-parameters by re-shaping the stems that keep the electrodes. However, during the beam time 2018 the existing RFQ did not reach its nominal voltage most likely due to expired lifetime of the electrodes originating from 2009. In order to shorten the RFQ maintenance period and to minimize any risk for upcoming beam time 2019, it was decided to post-pone the implementation of the new design and rather just re-producing the 2009 design electrodes. This contribution is on the re-production process as short-term solution and on the full implementation of the new design as mid-term solution. CST simulations performed at GSI assure that the resonance frequency with the new electrode geometry is recuperated through corrections of the carrier rings. The status of the exchange of the electrodes and simulations for the adaptation of the new electrode design are presented.

A dedicated 68 MeV, 70 mA proton injector is required for the research program at FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research). This 325 MHz linear injector contains a RFQ and six CH structures. The CH (Crossbar H-mode) structures are working in the H210 mode. The main acceleration of this room temperature linac will be provided by the CH structures. For the second acceleration from 11.5 MeV to 24.2 MeV a full scale prototype has been built. This structure consists of two individual CH resonators and a coupling cell. Inside the structure there are 17 tuners, they have an impact on the electric field and the frequency. For operation a flat field is required, therefore this tuners must be correctly positioned. Some series of low level tuning and frequency measurements were done to determine the size of the tuners. Low level measurements and simulations will be compared and presented.

One of the limiting factors of electron beam lifetime in low emittance storage rings is Head-Tail (HT) insta-bility. Low emittance storage rings typically have a large negative natural chromaticity due to the strong quadru-poles. Above transition large negative natural chroma-ticity leads to large Head-Tail instability which limit the beam lifetime. Since the threshold current of HT insta-bility is directly related to linear chromaticity, increasing the linear chromaticity to slightly positive value is a solution to prevent HT instability. In this paper we in-creased the chromaticity of Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) to (+4, +4) and we will investigate the beam dy-namics of ILSF 3GeV storage ring in high chromaticity. For reaching this aim we have used two families of sex-tupoles for chromaticity correction and then optimized them to maximize the dynamic aperture and Touschek lifetime. The beam dynamics of high chromaticity lattice is presented in this paper.

The Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) is a 3 GeV synchrotron radiation facility, which is in the design stage. Inevitable errors like imperfection of magnetic field and misalignment of magnets will introduce various destructive effects on the performance of the machine. The possibility of correcting the errors should be thoroughly examined before settling the design. In this paper, the correction process of beta beating and coupling with LOCO is described. The rms beta beating in horizontal and vertical planes after correction are reduced to 1% and 2% respectively. The average coupling ratio of lattice for 100 random error distribution is corrected to 0.2%.

During 2018, the PIAVE superconducting linac injector at INFN-LNL, based on superconducting RFQs and two cryomodules with quarter wave resonators, underwent a renovation plan. This operation was strictly related to the one carried out on ALPI [1], which will become a post-accelerator for both stable and exotic beams in a near future. PIAVE Quarter Wave Resonator (QWR) cryomod-ules, in operation since 2006, were moved to ALPI to be used for the acceleration of both stable beams and future exotic beams delivered from the cyclotron target-ion-source station, after appropriate purification, charge breeding and pre-acceleration stages. In order to cope with the removal of the two QWR cryomodules in PIAVE, a newly designed 80 MHz room temperature buncher was designed, built and tested: the buncher is required so as to match the longitudinal phase space between PIAVE su-perconducting RFQs (SRFQ1 and SRFQ2) and ALPI. In the same period, substantial refurbishments on the ECR ion source platform were carried out, in particular on its infrastructure and safety equipment. A problem on an electronic component on SRFQ2, though quickly fixed, delayed beam commissioning of the PIAVE injector, which will start at the end of May 2019.

The synchrotron oscillation, which is both longitudinal and horizontal oscillations, occurs under a constant longitudinal velocity of revolving particle. The synchrotron and betatron equations for revolving particles are derived from the improved Hamiltonian. The betatron equation accompanys the shinchro-betatron resonant coupling term. The coherent synchrotron oscillation frequency of the bunch is defined from the integrated phase. Taking advantage of the resonant coupling term, an experiment to suppress magnetically the destabilized coupled-bunch mode of the synchrotron oscillation is proposed.

We are now upgrading a 3-MeV linac at J-PARC. The old 30-mA RFQ is replaced by a spare one of the J-PARC 50-mA RFQ. The ion source is same as the J-PARC linac’s, therefore, the peak beam current is upgraded from 30 mA to 50 mA. This 3-MeV linac will be used for development of various accelerator components, such as beam dyagnostics devices, laser charge exchange equipments, new MEBT buncher, and so on. In this paper, present status of this 3-MeV test linac is presented.

The 1st proton beam acceleration of the Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator (LIPAc) through its novel RFQ was succeeded on 13th June 2018. Addition to plenty of beam diagnostics equipped in the beam line, we prepared some radiation detectors placed around the accelerator in order to acquire supplemental information of the beam, as an indirect measurement. In the first day of the beam injec-tion to the RFQ, the gamma-rays corresponding to certain excited states of Al of the low power beam dump were successfully detected by a LaBr3(Ce) scintillation detec-tor. Some neutrons, which would originate from the inter-action of protons with Cu somewhere, were also ob-served. These results proved that the beam was certainly accelerated up to about 2.5 MeV, and provided us a defin-itive confidence that the RFQ was working appropriately from the very beginning of the commissioning. Also, the comparison of the radiation yields with the RFQ trans-mission provided additional information on the beam energy distribution.

In 2013, the Annular-ring Coupled Structure (ACS) cavities were installed to the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) linac. Since then, the ACS cavities have been stably running. Although any serious problem induced by the ACS RF window has not yet observed, we decided to replace the RF window of one ACS cavity, which is the eighteenth accelerating cavity in the order of beam energy (ACS18), by the newly manufactured one. The major motivations of the replacement are to check the surface condition of the RF window which have been under operation for nearly five years and to confirm the availability of the newly manufactured RF window. By making use of the summer maintenance period of 2018, we carried out the replacement. This was the first experience for us to replace the RF window installed to the ACS cavity in the linac accelerator tunnel. As for the removed RF window, there was no any abnormal warning found with the visual examination. At the starting up of the cavity’s operation after the maintenance period, we investigated how much time would be required for an RF conditioning. It took around fifty hours so that the peak RF power including the beam loading is stably input to the cavity through the new RF window. The ACS cavity with the new RF window is now stably operating.

In the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) linac, negative hydrogen beams are accelerated from 190 MeV to 400 MeV by twenty-one Annular-ring Coupled Structure (ACS) accelerating cavities. The input coupler of the ACS high-beta cavity, which is the 21st accelerating cavity (ACS21) in the order of beam acceleration, had a comparatively larger value of the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) than those of the other ACS cavities. To adjust the VSWR of the ACS21, we designed and fabricated a rectangular waveguide with a capacitive iris which conduces to a better matching between the cavity and the waveguide. In the 2018 summer maintenance period, we installed the newly fabricated waveguide to the ACS21 in the position between the input coupler and the RF window. Consequently, the VSWR of the ACS21 was successfully decreased to the target value which leads to the critical coupling under the nominal accelerating condition with 50-mA peak beam current.

The installation and commissioning of the LIPAc are ongoing under the Broader Approach agreement, which is the prototype accelerator of the IFMIF for proof of princi-ple and design. The deuteron beam will be accelerated by the RFQ linac from 100 keV to 5 MeV during the com-missioning phase-B and by the SRF linac up to 9 MeV during the phase-C. The commissioning phase-B+ will be implemented between phase-B and C to complete the engineering validation of the RFQ linac before installing the SRF linac. The lattice for the deuteron beam of 5 MeV and 125 mA at the commissioning phase-B+ was designed.

A C-band three-cell pi-mode accelerating cavity made of high purity copper is under design for use in ultra-high accelerating gradient experiments at a cavity temperature of 20 K. The basic configuration, consisting of mode converter, short circular waveguide and cells with round periphery, is the same as that which was previously employed in the cold model for a 2.6-cell photocathode electron gun cavity. Though the 0.6-cell part in the previous model is replaced with a full cell having a beam duct, the overall electric property of the cavity will not change significantly. The RF input coupling coefficient is adjusted to around 10 at 20 K, which is expected to be lowered significantly due to the increase in the surface resistance by the rapid temperature rise during a high power RF input. The results of the simulations on the electric field and the temperature rise along the cavity surface during the RF pulse are discussed in the report.

In order to increase CSNS beam power from 100kW to 500kW, the Linac injection energy need to be increased from 80MeV to 300MeV. The combined layout of superconducting spoke cavities and elliptical cavities will be adopted to accelerate H− beam to 300MeV. Two operation frequency of spoke cavities were compared with single and double spoke structure, a compact 648MHz βg=0.4 single spoke cavity was proposed, and the RF performance was presented, as well as the MP behavior.

For ADS application, both research and commercial facilities requires extremely large amount of RF power to drive several mega watts beam power, so proper RF power upgrade plan can reduce the budget per phase and increase the valuable experience in engineering. CiADS (China initiative Accelerator Drive System) proposes to employ SSPA (Solid State Power Amplifier) as RF power source for flexible configuring and upgrading in the future. In this paper, from an engineering point of view, it is acceptable if proper matching beam current was selected for adopting fixed-coupling input coupler while only sacrificed some RF power during the upgrade plan. SSPA upgrade plan start with the stablility requirement to determine bandwidth, then combined with other RF power requirements to select output level, finally, checking how much the surplus of selected level SSPA for detuning control. The calculation and evaluation results for a §I{545}{MeV} physical design lattice illustrate that some resonance cavities had very limited surplus RF power left for detuning control that provided necessary optimization direction and guidelines for both physical design and SSPA arrangement.

CiADS (China initiative Accelerator Driven System) approved by Chinese government at 2016 aims to build the first ADS experimental facility to demonstrate the nuclear waste transmutation. The CiADS driving linac can accelerate 5 mA proton beam to 500 MeV at the beam power up to 2.5 MW with the state-of-the-art accelerator technologies. The challenging programs include beam loss control-oriented physics design, high performance CW operated superconducting cavities, SRF cryomod-ules, and highly efficient RF amplifier system. As the driving linac of the ADS system, the RAMI characters will serve as the design philosophy to guide the physics design and the choice of technical routes. The physics design and key technologies of the high-power machine are descried in the paper.

The SESRI (Space Environment Simulation and Research Infrastructure) is the new national research infrastructure under construction at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in China. This infrastructure is specifically built to simulate the space environment on the ground. The SESRI has kinds of accelerators, and the 300MeV proton and heavy ion accelerator is a major radiation source, which will supply 100-300MeV protons and 7-85MeV/u heavy ions for studying the interaction of high energy space particle radiation with material, device, module and life. To meet above requirements, the facility adopts the combination of room temperature ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) ion source, linac injector and synchrotron. The ion source is required to provide all stable nuclide beams from H2+ to Bi. The linac injector supplies 1MeV/u heavy ion beams and 5MeV proton beam by using RFQ (Radio Frequency Quadrupole) and IH-DTL (Interdigital H-mode type Drift Tube Linac) linac structures. The synchrotron accelerates heavy ions up to 85MeV/u and proton beam 300MeV. And the 3rd integer resonance and RF-KO (RF-Knock-Out) method are adopted for slow extraction. The status of 300MeV proton and heavy ion accelerator design and construction works are briefly described below.

Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) is a 100 km ring e+ e− collider for a Higgs factory. The injector is composed of a Linac and a Booster. The baseline design of CEPC Linac is a normal conducting S-band linear accelerator with frequency in 2860 MHz, which can provide electron and positron beam at an energy up to 10 GeV and bunch charge up to 3 nC. To reduce the design difficulty of booster and booster magnet at low energy part, an alternative design of the Linac with C-band accelerating structure at high energy part is proposed and the energy is up to 20 GeV. The compre-hensive consideration of Linac design and damping ring design will be discussed. In this paper, the physics design of this scheme is presented.

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is an accelerator-based science facility. CSNS is designed to accelerate proton beam pulses to 1.6 GeV kinetic energy, striking a solid metal target to produce spallation neutrons. CSNS has two major accelerator systems, a linear accelerator (80 MeV Linac) and a 1.6 GeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). The Beam commissioning of CSNS/RCS has been commissioned recently. Beam had been accelerated to 1.6 GeV at CSNS/RCS on January 18, 2018 with the injection energy of 80 MeV. The machine parameters are measured and optimized. The beam power is increased step by step. The beam power achieved 50kW in January, 2019. In this paper, the commissioning experiences are introduced.

A deutron CW RFQ was designed and fabricated in Peking University. It will accelerate 50mA CW deutron beam from 50keV to 1MeV at 162.5MHz. The novel structure of four-vane with window was used to seperate the dipole mode from the working mode. The field tuning of this RFQ was different from conventional four vane RFQ because that the four quadrants of RFQ cavity were coupled. The discipline of field tuning was studied by simulation and experiment. The beam dynamics of the RFQ was designed by equipartation and matching method, limit current effect was considered at the same time. The final design result of the RFQ was: voltage between electrodes was 60kV, transport efficiency of RFQ is 98%, field unflatness is less than 2% after tuning, the deformation of RFQcavity is less than 80um. Only 47 hours was spent to increase CW power of cavity from 0 to 55kW in high power test and The RFQ can working stable at the design voltage. The preliminary H2+ beam exeperiment has been done and 1.78mA CW beam was obtained at exit of RFQ. This paper will introduce the detail of design and experiment of the RFQ.

Recently, there has been discussions about the need for the next-generation synchrotron light source facility in Korea. The facility in consideration is composed of a super-conducting linear accelerator for the injector, a storage ring for the EUV and soft X-rays, and a main storage ring for hard X-rays. In this study, design concepts of the soft X-ray storage ring is presented. To effectively utilize the small space allocated for the soft X-ray storage ring, a compact storage ring is taken into account. The compact storage ring is a synchrotron accelerator of which diameter is shorter than the length of injector beamline. In this paper, we report design concepts and optimization of the compact storage ring for the EUV and soft X-ray users. The lattice of the storage ring is modelled by utilizing ELEGANT simulation code to optimize beam parameters and performance of the ring.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) linac transfer-lines to the target and beam dump are designed for the 2 GeV beam energy. The commissioning and operation of the accelerator will start at a reduced energy of 571 MeV with the high beta part of the linac unpowered. The beam power at this energy is still above 1 MW and a proper transport from the last accelerating cavity to the target is essential. Beam dynamics design of the High Energy Beam Transport (HEBT) and Accelerator to Target (A2T) are studied based on this reduced energy in this paper, including phase advance optimization and rematch. Among the factors which are analyzed are the envelope and beam size on the target which are kept close to their values at 2 GeV and losses along the linac and the transfer lines.

The European Spallation Source (ESS), currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, is the world’s most powerful neutron spallation source, with an average power of 5 MW at 2.0 GeV. In the ESS neutrino Super Beam Project (ESSnuSB) it is proposed to utilise this powerful accelerator as a proton driver for a neutrino beam that will be sent to a large underground Cherenkov detector in Garpenberg, mid-Sweden. In this paper we discuss the required modifications of the ESS linac to reach an additional 5 MW beam power for neutrino production in parallel to the spallation neutron production.

Beam dynamics simulation of the ion source (IS) and low energy beam transport (LEBT) of the European Spallation Source (ESS) Linac is conducted with TraceWin and IBSimu code. TraceWin allows multi-particle tracking based on a particle-in-cell space-charge solver and is the standard simulation tool of the whole ESS Linac. IBSimu is based on a Vlasov solver and allows to simulate beam extraction from plasma as well as the beam transport in the LEBT. In preparation for beam commissioning of the IS and LEBT in the ESS Linac tunnel, which started in September 2018 and is ongoing as of the timing of writing this paper, the simulation models of the IS and LEBT in these two codes were updated. This paper reports the effort for these updates, including the beam distribution out of the IS, electromagnetic field map of the LEBT solenoid, more realistic aperture structure in the LEBT, as well as updated LEBT solenoids scan simulation.

Beam commissioning of the ion source (IS) and low energy beam transport (LEBT) of the European Spallation Source is ongoing on its site as of writing this paper and continues until June 2019. The LEBT consists of two solenoids with integrated dipole correctors to steer, focus, and match the high current divergent beam out of the IS to the following radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ). It is also equipped with a suite of diagnostics devices to provide a full characterization of the beam for achieving a good transport within the LEBT, optimizing the matching to the RFQ, and also providing references to numerical simulations. This paper presents results of beam characterization campaign from the ongoing beam commissioning period, including the matching at the RFQ interface based on emittance sampling for varied strengths of the solenoids and verification of the linear model for the trajectory and beam envelope.

At the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster, PSB, an analog transverse damper system has been in operation since 1999, providing satisfactory operational results with the proton beam supplied by Linac2. As a consequence of the LHC Injectors Upgrade, the PSB will face new challenges imposed by higher intensity, injection and extraction energy. In this framework, the transverse feedback system is subject to an upgrade to adapt to the expected Linac4 beam and to the demands for new features including transverse blow-up, beam excitation for optics measurements and new remote control and monitoring capabilities. The replacement of the aging electronic hardware is also recommended to improve the system maintainability for future years. During 2018 a new digital transverse feedback electronics was installed in the PSB, in parallel with the current operational one, offering for the first time the occasion to demonstrate its performance with beam. Encouraging results were obtained such as the suppression of beam instabilities at all PSB energies and intensities. In this paper we describe the steps undertaken in 2018 in order to commission the system with the main goal to accelerate and extract the highest intensity beams produced at the PSB.

The Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) is the first circular accelerator in the injector chain to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and accelerates protons from 50 MeV to 1.4 GeV. The PSB will need to deliver two times the current brightness after the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) in order to meet the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) beam requirements. At the current injection energy a large incoherent space charge tune spread limits the brightness of the beams, which is one of the main motivations to increase the injection energy to 160 MeV with the injection provided by Linac4, a new H− linear accelerator. The higher injection energy will allow doubling the beam intensity while maintaining a space charge tune spread similar to current values. The degradation of the beam brightness due to the tune spread can be minimized with a proper choice of working point and an efficient compensation of resonances. In this paper, we present the measurement of the betatronic resonances in the four rings of the PSB at 160 MeV before the Long Shutdown 2, as well as the results of a proposed compensation scheme.

Transverse emittance discrepancy in the beam transfer between the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) and the Proton Synchrotron (PS) is observed in operational conditions for the LHC beams at CERN. The ongoing LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project requires a tight budget for beam degradation along the injector chain and therefore the reason for this emittance discrepancy needs to be understood. Systematic measurements have been performed for various beam characteristics (beam intensity, transverse and longitudinal emittance). In this paper, a comparison between the emittance measurements using all available beam instrumentation with different emittance computation algorithms is presented. The results are compared to measurements at PS injection. Furthermore, the impact on the LIU project requirements for the emittance preservation along the LHC Injectors Complex is discussed.

In order to reach the target beam parameters of the LHC injectors upgrade (LIU), about twice the presently operational intensity of LHC type beams has to be achieved. Although the planned upgrade of the main RF system will occur during the long shutdown, a series of measurements have been performed to assess the beam dynamics challenges with these very high intensity beams on the long SPS injection plateau. Bunch-by-bunch transverse emittance blow-up measurements suggested the presence of electron-cloud. After a period of running with the high intensity beam for a couple of days, a clear improvement of beam quality was observed which is attributed to scrubbing. In addition, a horizontal headtail instability is encountered for the usual operational settings of chromaticity and transverse damper. The stability limit as a function of chromaticity and Landau octupole settings has been explored and will be discussed, together with possible sources of the instability and mitigation strategies.

Beam-Based Measurement of the Skew-Sextupolar Component of the Radio Frequency Field of a HL-LHC-Type Crab-Cavity

Two High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC) type crab-cavities have been installed in the CERN SPS for testing purposes. An attempt to characterize the skew-sextupolar component of the radio frequency field of the crab-cavity (a3) has been carried out by means of beam-based techniques using turn-by-turn monitoring of the betatron motion. The skew nature of a3 couples the horizontal and vertical betatron motions through a non-linear term. Therefore by exciting the horizontal betatron motion it was possible to observe a spectral line in the vertical beam motion driven by the non-linear coupling at the characteristic frequency 2Qx. A measurement of the magnitude of a3 was thus obtained by characterizing amplitude and phase of such line. The results of the measurements are discussed here.

Two new absorbing materials were developed as collimator inserts to fulfil the requirements of HL-LHC higher brightness beams: molybdenum-carbide graphite (MoGr) and copper-diamond (CuCD). These materials were tested under intense beam impacts at CERN HiRadMat facility in 2015, when full jaw prototypes were irradiated. Additional tests in HiRadMat were performed in 2017 on another series of material samples, including also improved grades of MoGr and CuCD, and different coating solutions. This paper summarizes the main results of the two experiments, with a main focus on the behaviour of the novel composite blocks, the metallic housing, as well as the cooling circuit. The experimental campaign confirmed the final choice for the materials and the design solutions for HL-LHC collimators, and constituted a unique chance of benchmarking numerical models. In particular, the tests validated the selection of MoGr for primary and secondary collimators, and CuCD as a valid solution for robust tertiary collimators.

One of the key devices of the HL-LHC project are SRF Crab Cavities. A cryomodule with two Double Quarter Wave (DQW) crab cavities has been fabricated at CERN in 2017 and successfully tested with beam in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in 2018. The aim of the present study is to present and compare the estimation of the thermal budget for the different components of the cryomodule, performed with numerical and semi-analytical methods, with the experimental measurements carried out on the cryomodule after installation in the SPS.

In view of the High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collimation system, a family of novel molybdenum-carbide graphite (MoGr) composites was developed to meet the challenging requirements of HL-LHC beam-halo collimation, in particular the electrical conductivity and thermo-mechanical performances. The Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) behaviour of this material was extensively characterized to assess its compatibility with the accelerator’s specifications. The results presented in this paper correlate the outgassing behaviour with the microscopic features of MoGr compared to other graphite-based materials. Residual gas analysis (RGA) was exploited to optimize post-production treatments.

Since in 2010 the first sub-millisecond beam losses were observed at varying locations all along the LHC, it is well known that dust can interact with high-intensity proton beams and cause significant beam losses. Initially the sudden localized losses were enigmatic and coined the phrase ’unidentified falling objects’ (UFOs), which is still widely used. These very fast beam losses have resulted in hundreds of premature beam dumps and even magnet quenches since the start of LHC. So far, the only mitigation strategy involved an optimization of dump thresholds and the beneficial conditioning effect which leads to a reduction of the UFO rate over time. To understand the physics involved in these events and to allow an active diminution, it is essential to know the chemical composition and the size of the dust particulates interacting with the protons. The exchange of a dipole magnet offered the unique opportunity to collect dust samples from inside the LHC vacuum system. They were extracted from the various components and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to reveal size distribution and abundant elements. The results of this investigation will optimize the existing UFO models and the improved understanding of the phenomenon may help to prevent future performance limitations. This is also of relevance for future projects, in particular for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) under study.

ALBA is a third generation synchrotron light source that consists on a linac, booster and storage ring. The linac is capable of operating in single (SBM) and multi-bunch injection mode (MBM). Since 2016 the Single Bunch Bucket Selection algorithm which runs in SBM, permits to inject on a selected bucket keeping the charge uniformity along the ring below 4\%. However when running in SBM a significantly lower transmission along the linac is observed, with respect to the one when running in MBM. Simulation efforts have been deployed in order to build up a reliable model of the ALBA linac which can reproduce the experimental measurements. In this paper we present the new simulation model that renders the experimental observations, and the new optimization procedure developed in simulations and tested in the real machine.

Linac4, a 160 MeV, 352.2 MHz linear accelerator, has been fully commissioned and will take its place as new injector to the CERN chain of accelerators during the long shutdown (LS2) in 2019-2020. In the past year, it has been continuously providing beam during a test run to assess its reliability in view of the connection to the LHC injector chain. The target reliability of more than 90% has been demonstrated during the accumulated nine months of run in 2017 and 2018. The beam quality at 160 MeV is suitable for producing all beams for the CERN physics program of today. Nevertheless, the limited peak current of 30mA might be a limitation for future high intensity programs. The bottleneck has been identified at the low energy end of the accelerator. In the meantime, beam extraction and low energy beam transport studies are ongoing at a dedicated test stand with the goal to reach beam currents from the pre-injector up to 45 mA. We will present the status of the modelling of the pre-injector and possible solutions to reach higher beam currents from the RFQ along with results from the reliability run.

The Future Circular e+e− Collider (FCC- e+e−) injector complex needs to produce and to transport a high-intensity e+e− beam at a fast repetition rate for topping up the collider at its collision energy. Two different options are under consideration as pre-accelerator before the bunches are transferred to the high-energy booster: using the existing SPS and designing a completely new ring. The purpose of this paper is to explore the needs and parameters of the existing SPS, to investigate wiggler magnet options for SPS, and provide an updated study of alternative accelerator ring design with injection and extraction energies of 6 and 20 GeV, respectively. In this study, the parameters of both choices are established, including the optics design, layout update and considerations for non-linear dynamics optimization.

This paper describes the concept of a primary electron beam facility at CERN, to be used for dark gauge force and light dark matter searches. The electron beam is produced in three stages: A Linac accelerates electrons from a photo-cathode up to 3.5 GeV. This beam is injected into the Super Proton Synchrotron, SPS, and accelerated up to a maximum energy of 16 GeV. Finally, the accelerated beam is slowly extracted to an experiment, possibly followed by a fast dump of the remaining electrons to another beamline. The beam parameters are optimized using the requirements of the Light Dark Matter eXperiment, LDMX, as benchmark.

The High Luminosity LHC project (HL-LHC) foresees the construction and installation of important new equipment to increase the performance of the LHC machine. The Hollow Electron Lens (HEL) is a promising system to control the beam halo. It improves the beam collimation system of the HL-LHC and mitigates possible equipment damage in case of failure scenarios from halo losses. The halo can store up to 30 MJ energy. The specifications for this new device are quite demanding. The source, an electron gun with an annular shaped cathode, has to deliver a current up to 5 A. This is five times higher than the current in the existing electron lenses in Fermi and Brookhaven national laboratories. This note describes the programme carried out to design and test high-perveance guns equipped with two types of high-performance scandate cathodes. The size of the final gun is now considerably smaller than the one of the first prototype, allowing a reduction of diameter and cost of the superconducting magnet system used to steer the electron beam. The tests carried out at FNAL, BVERI and BJUT demonstrated that the developed cathodes fulfil the specifications and can supply a 5 A fully Space Charge Limited (SCL) current.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade project the improvements required to achieve the parameters of the future beams for the High-Luminosity LHC are being studied and implemented. In order to deliver high brightness beams, control over the beam intensity and emittance is fundamental. Therefore, a highly accurate and reliable transverse emittance measurement is essential. Presently at the CERN Proton Synchrotron, the only operationally available emittance monitors not impacting the facility beam production are the flying wire scanners used to measure the circulating beam profile. The wire scanners will be replaced with a new generation in the next two years and a prototype is already installed. The prototype has been commissioned with beams featuring a wide range of intensities and emittances. This paper evaluates the performance of the prototype with respect to the present system via beam-based measurements. The transverse emittance measurement is discussed, considering the different potential error contributions to the measurement, such as knowledge of the machine optics and the dispersive contribution to the beam size.

Transverse emittance measurements with wire scanners have been extensively studied across the accelerator complex at CERN due to their important role in characterizing the beam and their complicated modeling. In recent years, this topic has been of particular interest for the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project, where a tight transverse emittance blow-up budget between the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) and the Proton Synchrotron (PS) is imposed to assure the required beam brightness for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In order to maintain a high brightness beam, any source of emittance blow-up along the PSB cycle needs to be identified and mitigated. While wire scanners have been mostly used at extraction energy in the PSB, they can also operate along the energy cycle. The scattering of the protons with the wire increases considerably at lower energies, leading to an overestimation of the beam emittance. In this contribution we present the most recent studies, focusing on precisely quantifying the blow-up created by the flying wire with measurements in an optimized set-up and compared to FLUKA simulations.

For the first time, the optics of the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) was measured using turn-by-turn BPM data of forced betatron oscillations excited with an AC dipole. We report results of phase advance and beta beating measurements. Linear coupling was globally minimized along the machine by measuring and correcting coupling resonance driving terms. Finally, non-linear properties of the ring were probed looking at third and fourth order resonance driving terms and amplitude detuning.

The European Spallation Source (ESS), currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will be a spallation neutron source driven by a proton linac of an unprecedented 5 MW beam power. Such a high power requires its ion source (IS) to produce proton beam pulses at 14 Hz with a high peak current more than 62.5 mA and a long plateau up to §I{3}{ms}. The IS and the following low energy beam transport (LEBT) section were manufactured and tested with beam to meet ESS requirements at INFN-LNS and delivered to ESS towards the end of 2017. Beam commissioning of these two sections on the ESS site has started in September 2018 and will continue until the end of June 2019. This paper provides an overview on this first beam commissioning period at ESS and also presents results of IS characterization and testing on LEBT functionalities.

Based on calculated Bz of solenoids installed at the TPS linac low energy section, the electron beam envelope along beam centerline has been explored in this work using the initial and boundary conditions provided in the linac specifications. Concept of magnetic flux compression is adopt to analyze the beam size variation along linac centerline. The calculated result of selected checkpoints has been experimentally verified using screen monitors. In order to benefit tuning capability in routine operation, the display of beam size variation along centerline is integrated into the previously developed toolkit ’linac’. It is hope that it will provide an interactive approach for linac tune-up process and would be helpful to its routine operation.

A high brightness photo-injector has been build for THz coherent undulator radiation and VUV free electron laser test facility at NSRRC. In the first phase, the photo-injector was used to produce ultra-short electron bunches for THz CUR generation. The electron beam is generated form a photocathode rf gun followed by a solenoid for emittance compensation. Then A 5.2 m S-band linac accelerates the electron beam and compresses the beam by velocity bunching. Since the beam emittance will grow during the velocity bunching process, a solenoid system was installed to reduce the emmitance growth. Downstream the linac, a quadruple magnet was use for emittance measurement by quadruple scan method and the bunch length was measured by the coherent transition radiation. Finally, the ultra-short electron bunch with about few hundreds picoseconds passes through a U100 planer undulator can produce THz coherent undulator radiation. The instrument setup and results of measurement are presented in this paper.

Part of the residual beam loss during the Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE) of fixed target beams from the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) can be attributed to kicker magnets switching while the beam is coasting with the main RF systems off before extraction. Generating a barrier bucket to deplete the longitudinal line density of the coasting beam during the kicker rise time can reduce these losses. Beam tests have been performed with an existing Finemet cavity in the PS, which is normally operated as a wideband feedback kicker. To drive the cavity, a beam synchronous waveform synthesizer based on programmable logic has been developed. It produces a pre-distorted signal which ideally results in a single period sinusoidal voltage pulse with programmable parameters at the gap of the cavity, once or multiple times per revolution. The modelling of the behavior of the power amplifier and the cavity is essential to achieve an anti-symmetric voltage pulse with little pre- and post-pulse ripple. The design of the beam-synchronous waveform generator is presented together with results from initial beam studies with the created barrier buckets in the PS.

A barrier bucket scheme is being considered to reduce losses during the Multi-Turn Extraction from the CERN Proton Synchrotron to the Super Proton Synchrotron for the fixed-target physics programme. For effective loss reduction, the extraction kicker has to be triggered during the gap at the time of the longitudinal barrier. Initial beam studies at injection energy and with low intensity beams allowed to fully qualify an existing wide-band cavity to generate one or multiple beam synchronous pulses per turn. Bunch-length stretching and shortening have been exercised with barriers moving in azimuth with respect to the beam. The encouraging results obtained at injection energy guided the implementation of a de-bunching manipulation at higher energy to move all bunches into a single barrier bucket. Beam measurements at a momentum of 14GeV/c, varying intensity and the width of the barrier, demonstrate that a quasi-constant longitudinal line density and an almost fully depleted gap can be achieved at highest intensities. The contribution summarises the results of the beam studies at high energy together with some observations related to the Multi-Turn Extraction.

PIP-II is the Fermilab’s flagship project to provide powerful, high-intensity proton beams to the laboratory’s experiments. The heart of the PIP-II project is an H− 800 MeV superconducting linear accelerator. In order to commission the beam and operate safely the linac, several constraints were evaluated. The design of a movable 5 kW beam absorber was finalized to allow staged beam commissioning in different linac locations. Prompt and residual radiation levels were calculated, and radiation shields were optimized to keep those values within the acceptable levels in the areas surrounding beam absorber. Monte Carlo calculations with FLUKA and MARS15 codes are presented in the paper to support these studies.

A new IH-DTL beam dynamics scheme, IH-EMQ (ElectroMagnetic Quadrupole) is presented to obtain a large longitudinal acceptance. In this scheme, electromagnetic quadrupoles are installed inside the drift tubes of IH-DTL. A large-longitudinal-acceptance heavy-ion IH-DTL design is described in this paper. With the limit current of 25 mA, the 90% normalized longitudinal acceptance reaches 87.8 pi.deg. MeV for the 60 MeV 107Au30+, which is 8 times of the input emittance.

Transverse emittances, especially vertical emittance, are strictly required in the synchrotrons with multi-loop injection. Transverse emittances easily grow up if transverse beam phase spaces are coupled. The growth of the transverse emittance can be restained by decoupling the beam phase spaces. Based on the transfer matrix calculation, it can be theoretically proved that the decoupling can be implemented for general situations. A minimum number of rotated quadrupoles required for decoupling is given. Two quadrupoles can decouple the beam and suppress its emittance growth to 1% in the coupling DTL case.

Future searches of electric dipole moments (EDMs) of fundamental particles can require electrostatic storage rings operating at the particle’s "magic momentum" whereby spin precessions out of the plane of the particle motion would be governed in principle only by the presence of an EDM. An EDM search for the proton, for example, requires a momentum of approximately 700 MeV/c and thus implies a half-kilometer circumference, where relatively modest electric fields are assumed. As no all-electric ring on this scale has been constructed before, the ability to produce precise radial fields for establishing a central orbit and precise electrostatic focusing fields about that orbit requires attention. Results of initial investigations into the feasibility of designing a proper system and the sensitivities of such a system to placement, mis-powering errors and other requirements on realistic electrostatic elements will be presented.

To increase the average current for isotope production by factor of two, we have undertaken several upgrades for our 50-year-old 200 MeV H− linac. Average current will be double by increasing the beam pulse length. We are testing the DTL tanks reliability by increasing RF pulse length and replacing weak RF joints. We are in the process of replace 50-year old ion pumps and a new PLC based vacuum I&C system for the DTL tanks. We are also upgrading/replacing/adding LLRF, diagnostics, machine protection system, and quadrupole power supply. Paper will present status of these activity and future plan.

As the energy, scale and therefore the cost of large-scale accelerator projects, such as X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) increases, new technologies must be developed in order to minimize costs and maximize efficiency wherever possible. One obvious way to reduce costs is to reduce the length of accelerating sections by utilizing higher accelerating gradients. Here we present the results of a study into the various structure options for FEL linacs, contrasting different frequencies, geometries and operating modes. An investigation into the possibility of using cryo-cooled travelling wave (TW) electron structures which allow for higher gradient operation by exploiting the anomalous skin effect is also detailed. Finally, we give simulation results from a number of commercial codes including VSim 9, for a hypothetical TW high gradient C-band structure design employing cryo-cooled technology. Breakdown effects, pulsed heating, tolerances, efficiencies and potential rf sources are also explored, all within the framework of typical FELs and their requirements.

Using the commercial software VSim 9, a highly parallelized particle-in-cell/finite difference time-domain modeling code, the performance of an existing novel RFQ/RFI linac structure designed by Ion Linac Systems is evaluated. This effort is aimed towards having an up to date full 3D start-to-end simulation of the accelerator system, which does not exist currently. The structure used is an efficient 200-MHz, 2.5-MeV, CW-RFQ/RFI proton linac. The methods employed in VSim for modelling and parameter setup are presented, along with the simulation procedures for both the Electromagnetic and PIC solver. The important figures of merit for the structure are given including the Q-factor, field distributions, shunt impedance, and important beam properties. These are then contrasted with the initial design values and analytical calculations.

Three s-band RF guns are installed at the front end of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) linac: two thermionic cathode guns (RG2 and RG1), and one Photo-Cathode Gun (PCG). During normal operations, RG2 provides electron beams for the storage ring to generate x-rays for APS users. The PCG generates high brightness electron beams that can be accelerated through the APS linac and transported into the Linac Extension Area (LEA) for advanced accelerator technology and beam physics experiments. The alternating acceleration of the RG2 and PCG beam in the linac is possible, as most of the time, RG2 beam is only needed for ~20 seconds every two minutes. This mode of interleaving operation of RG2 and PCG beams through the APS linac requires some modifications/additions to several systems of the linac, including RF, magnets, controls and Access Control Interlock System etc. In this paper we report our interleaving design and present the commissioning results of the two beam interleaving operation.
