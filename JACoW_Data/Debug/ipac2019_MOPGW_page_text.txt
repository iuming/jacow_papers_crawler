Large amounts of bellows in an accelerator justify the importance of simplifying the machining and assembling processes of their RF shield. Such quantity also makes this component one of the main contributors for a machine impedance budget. On the other hand, low impedance designs tend to complicate the mechanical aspects. Applied to Sirius round vacuum chamber of 24 mm inner diameter, the omega-strip and comb-type bellows concepts are compared with new proposed designs. In such comparison, the aforementioned aspects, wakefield losses and prototyping experiences are presented in this work.

An overloaded cavity kicker for the Sirius longitudinal bunch-by-bunch feedback system will be presented in this contribution. 4th generation light sources’ lower aperture of vacuum chambers lead to higher cutoff frequencies, jeopardizing the electromagnetic performance of cavities by trapping higher order modes (HOMs) inside the structure. With the objective of damping longitudinal and transverse HOMs without compromising the kicker shunt impedance, solutions as cavity radius reduction, tapered transitions and other geometry changes are discussed herein.

In this work we will present the estimates of single and multi-bunch instability thresholds and current-dependent effects, such as tune-shifts and potential-well distortion for the Sirius storage ring. The results were obtained by tracking simulations and semi-analytic methods using the updated and detailed impedance budget of the machine, which includes contributions from all the in-vacuum components and the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) impedance.

Now the stage of the 30MeV portion of ARIEL (The Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory) e-Linac is under commissioning which includes an injector cryomodule (ICM) and the 1st accelerator cryomodule (ACM1) with two cavities configuration. The two ACM1 cavities are driven by a single klystron with vector-sum control and running in CW mode. During the commissioning, the ACM1 cavities gradient and stability was limited by ponderomotive effect. Acoustic noise from the environment vibration generated by cooling water system, cryogenic system and vacuum system have been identified to certain external source and some damping has been installed. In this paper, the progress of the microphonics suppression of ACM1 is presented.

This work is motivated by the weak-strong beam-beam effect as occurs in colliding charged-particle beams. We consider beams with elliptical cross section and power law binomial forms for the density distribution. We demonstrate explicitly how to construct analytically the space-charge potential inside the ’strong’ beam. This is essential to the program of calculating beam-beam effects for non-gaussian beams.

Electromagnetic Impulse of Beam Density F(x, y)G(z)
75

We calculate the transverse impulse on a test particle as a bunch of charged particles beam passes by. It is often assumed, but seldom proven, that the EM field from a beam density distribution factored into transverse and longitudinal parts, F and G respectively, has also a factored form P(x, y)Q(z). This factorization is not possible for stationary charges. Contrastingly, it becomes increasingly accurate for ultra-relativistic particle beams. We give a general analysis, show how to develop the corrections in terms of integrals of F and derivatives of G. What is significant is that if we integrate over longitudinal coordinate z to find the transverse impulse on a witness charge, the correction terms integrate to zero leading to the impulse P(x, y)Integral[Q(z)] independent of bunch shape. If this result is already known, this paper serves as a reminder.

The commissioning of the ESRF-EBS storage ring will start in December 2019 ultimately providing a horizontal emittance of 130 pm, 30 times lower than the present one. Due to the reduced beam lifetime top-up operation will be required for all operating modes. Transparent injection, i.e. with negligible perturbations on the stored beam, is necessary to allow continuous data acquisition for beam lines experiments. Several options have been considered at ESRF to reduce these perturbations down to a fraction of the rms beam size: i) new kickers power supplies with slow ramping time to facilitate active compensation are under development and will be implemented in the coming years ii) in parallel, long term solutions using non-linear kickers and longitudinal on-axis injection have been investigated.

First attempts of online optimisation of SOLEIL using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is reported with two major applications. This technique proves to be particularly suitable in a control room and could become a standard operation tool for tuning the accelerators in complement of other techniques. The first optimisation of the injection in the storage ring will be presented using the injection septa and the vertical correctors of the booster to storage ring transfer line. The second work will summarise the results obtained from the optimisation of the transverse on- and off-momentum dynamics in presence of insertion devices. Main results, the implementation and improvements will be presented and discussed thoroughly.

The Institute of Nuclear Physics at Orsay (IPN-Orsay) has always been a major player in building accelerators for nuclear physics. The ALTO facility is powered by a 50 MeV/10μA linear electron accelerator dedicated to the production of radioactive beams. The production mode is based on the photo-fission process of a thick UCx target heated up to 2000°C and using the ISOL technique. For the ionization of the released fission fragments, three ion source types can be coupled to the target: Febiad ion source, surface ion source, and laser ion source. The facility can deliver the radioactive ions beams to six different experimental set-ups. The mono-charged RIB exiting from the source must be separated using a magnetic dipole in order to select a nucleus before its transmission through electrostatic devices up to the experimental set-ups. This paper is focus on the separator which was build and exploited with success since 40 years. We propose to revisit this dipole with a precise field-map calculation and particles transport simulations. These results will be use as a first brick of the understanding and reliability of the transmission along the RIB lines at the ALTO facility.

Accelerator physics needs advanced modeling and simulation techniques, in particular for beam stability studies. A deeper understanding of the effects of magnetic fields non-linearities will greatly help in the improvement of future colliders design and performance. In *, a new tracking method was proposed to study the effect of the longitudinal dependency of the harmonics on the beam dynamics. In this paper, the study will focus on the effects on observable quantities in beam based measurements, for the case of HL-LHC Inner Triplet and with possible tests in LHC.

At BESSY II due to the continuously increasing interest in short pulse operation, a major upgrade of the ring will enable simultaneous storage of long and short bunches. This Variable pulse-length Storage Ring (VSR) will be achieved by the installation of additional superconducting high gradient cavities. The cavities will be assembled into one cryomodule in one of the straights of the storage ring. As this module needs more space then initially assumed, one possible solution is to remove two quadrupoles to gain available installation length. The quadrupoles were switched off in simulations and the lattice was optimized with regard to the linear order. The best solution found was transferred to the storage ring, where storage of high current with reasonable injection efficiency and lifetime was possible. The proposed optics has to be further optimized in terms of nonlinear beam dynamics, but has shown that an available installation length can be increased.

The operation of ring-based synchrotron light sources with short electron bunches increases the emission of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the THz frequency range. However, the micro-bunching instability resulting from self-interaction of the bunch with its own radiation field limits stable operation with constant intensity of CSR emission to a particular threshold current. Above this threshold, the longitudinal charge distribution and thus the emitted radiation vary rapidly and continuously. Therefore, a fast and adaptive feedback system is the appropriate approach to stabilize the dynamics and to overcome the limitations given by the instability. In this contribution, we discuss first efforts towards a longitudinal feedback design that acts on the RF system of the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator) and aims for stabilization of the emitted THz radiation. Our approach is based on methods of adaptive control that were developed in the field of reinforcement learning and have seen great success in other fields of research over the past decade. We motivate this particular approach and comment on different aspects of its implementation.

Perturbation of Synchrotron Motion in the Micro-Bunching Instability

Short electron bunches in a storage ring are subject to complex longitudinal dynamics due to self-interaction with their own CSR. Above a particular threshold current, this leads to the formation of dynamically changing micro-structures within the bunch, generally known as the micro-bunching instability. The longitudinal dynamics of this phenomenon can be simulated by solving the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, where the CSR self-interaction can be added as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian. This contribution particularly focuses on the comprehension of synchrotron motion in the micro-bunching instability and how it relates to the formation of the occurring micro-structures. Therefore, we adopt the perspective of a single particle and comment on its implications for collective motion. We explicitly show how the shape of the parallel plates CSR wake potential breaks homogeneity in longitudinal phase space and propose a quadrupole-like mode as potential seeding mechanism of the micro-bunching instability. The gained insights are verified using the passive particle tracking method of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck solver Inovesa.

FCC-ee (Future Circular Collider) is a 100 km electron-positron circular collider with two foreseen experiments, aiming to run at four energies for precision studies of the Z, W, and Higgs boson and the top quark. The FCC-ee is a challenging machine from different points of view. In particular the beam-beam effects are of great importance. For the FCC-ee high-luminosity operation, the beam-beam effects impose profound constraints on the operating point in betatron tune space. In addition, taking into account different sources of machine nonlinearities, a tracking simulation with beam-beam elements revealed a strong beam blowup, especially in the vertical plane. Such a blowup is a potential obstacle to achieving and maintaining a high luminosity; therefore it needs to be carefully studied. In this paper, we present a general overview of simulation results on the FCC-ee beam-beam blowup with realistic machine errors.

BERLinPro is an Energy Recovery Linac Project, currently being set up at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie, Berlin, Germany. BERLinPro is a small demonstrator for ERL technology and applications. Due to the low energy of 50, resp. 32MeV, space charge plays a dominant role in the beam dynamics. Micro-bunching, due to unavoidable shot noise from the cathode in combination with space charge, is seen in the merger as well as in the recirculator. Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) can amplify this bunching, as well as micro-bunching can enhance CSR losses. With the release of OPAL 2.0** in May 2018, for the first time, an open source, highly parallel tracking code is available, that is capable of numerically calculating both effects, space charge and CSR, simultaneously. The calculations are compared to earlier results*, that used analytical formulas on tracked, space charge dominated bunches.

A Robinson wiggler (RW) is considered to be installed in the Metrology Light Source (MLS) to lengthen the bunch and improve the Touschek lifetime by manipulating the damping partitions. Symplectic tracking is crucial to study the impact of the nonlinear field components introduced by the Robinson wiggler. This paper introduces a tracking method based on an implicit symplectic integrator to solve the exact Hamiltonian equations of particle motion in the wiggler. In addition, a numerical generating function method is implemented as an approach to realize fast tracking.

The isochronous optics of the ESR is a unique ion-optical setting in which the ring is operated as a Time-of-Flight Mass-Spectrometer and is used for direct mass measurements of short-lived exotic nuclei. The present isochronous optics had been performed only making a negative dispersion in the straight sections of the ESR of about -7 m. This negative dispersion makes the injection into the ESR very complicated and strict the transmission of the ions in the ring. Moreover, the non-achromatism of the ESR brings a supplementary uncorrectable first-order transverse contribution to the revolution time. In order to make the ESR achromatic, to improve injection and the isochronicity a new achromatic isochronous optics has been calculated and will be presented here in details.

Since the last 20 years, modern heuristic algorithms and machine learning have been increasingly used for several purposes in accelerator technology and physics. Since computing power has become less and less of a limiting factor, these tools have become part of the physicist community’s standard toolkit. This paper describes the construction of an algorithm that can be used to generate an optimised lattice design for transfer lines under the consideration of restrictions that usually limit design options in reality. The developed algorithm has been applied to the existing SIS18 to HADES transfer line in GSI.

GSI High Energy Beam Transfer lines (HEST) link the SIS18 synchrotron with two storage rings (Experimental Storage Ring and Cryring) and six experimental caves. The recent upgrades to HEST beam instrumentation enables precise measurements of beam properties along the lines and allow for faster and more precise beams setup on targets. Preliminary results of some of the measurements performed during runs in 2018 and 2019 are presented here. The focus is on response matrix measurements and quadrupole scans performed on HADES beam line. The errors and future improvements are discussed.

MESA is a two pass energy recovery linac (ERL) currently under construction at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz. MESA uses four 1.3 GHz TESLA type cavities with 12.5 MV/m of accelerating gradient in two modified ELBE type cryomodule with improved thermal connection of the HOM antennas and cw operation. In the first stage of MESA operation 1mA of beam current is foreseen, which will later be upgraded to 10mA. One potential limit to maximum beam current in ERLs is the transverse beam breakup (BBU) instability induced by dipole Higher Order Modes (HOMs). These modes can be excited by bunches passing through the cavities off axis. Following bunches are then deflected by the HOMs, which results in even larger offsets for recirculated bunches. This feedback can even lead to beam loss. Simulation results for HOM spectra of a single TESLA cavity are available for example in *. It was possible to measure the HOM spectra in the cold, not tuned cavities at DESY and in the cold string tuned to the 1.3 GHz fundamental mode at Mainz. Results for the maximum beam current for MESA, limited by BBU, for the various HOM spectra are presented.

Optimization of transfer line optics is essential for delivering high quality beams to the experimental areas. This type of optimization is usually done by hand and relies on the experience of operators. The nature of this task is repetitive though highly complex. Besides optimizing the beam quality at the experiments this task is often accompanied by secondary objectives or requirements such as keeping the beam losses below an acceptable threshold. In the past years Deep Learning algorithms have experienced a rapid development and gave rise to various advanced software implementations which allow for straightforward usage of corresponding techniques, such as automatic differentiation and gradient backpropagation. We investigate the applicability and performance of these techniques in the field of transfer line optics optimization, specifically for the HADES beamline at GSI, in form of gradient-based differentiable simulators. We test our setup on results obtained from MADX simulations and compare our findings to different gradient-free optimization methods. Successfully employing such methods relieves operators from the tedious optimization tasks.

SINBAD (Short and INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility aims to produce ultrashort bunches (sub-fs) at ~100 MeV, suitable for injection into novel accelerators e.g. dielectric Laser acceleration (DLA) and Laser Driven Wakefield acceleration (LWFA). The LWFA experiment demands β functions to be of the order of 1 mm to reduce energy spreads and emittance growth from nonlinearities. Matching such a space charge dominated beam to such constraints with conventional electromagnets is challenging. A Permanent Magnetic Quadrupole (PMQ) triplet is one promising focusing strategy. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a PMQ triplet to fit the requirements of the electron beam properties in a plasma cell and discuss the realizable phase spaces for the LWFA experiment planned at SINBAD.

SINBAD (Short and INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility will host multiple experiments relating to ultra-short high brightness beams and novel experiments with ultra-high gradient. ARES (Accelerator Research Experiment at SINBAD) Linac is an S-band photo injector to produce such electron bunches at around 100 MeV. The Linac will be commissioned in stages with the first stage corresponding to gun commissioning. In this paper, we present studies about the scheme adopted for the alignment of focusing solenoid for the ARES gun. The method is bench marked using ASTRA simulations. Moreover the effect of misalignment of the solenoid on the emittance of space charge dominated scheme and its compensation is also discussed.

Short electron bunch has interesting applications in the synchrotron radiation light sources, such as the production of powerful coherent THz radiation, time resolving spectrum analysis, etc. In this work, we are interested in acquiring the short bunch in the storage ring with a small circumference like Hefei Light Source. In this paper, we tried to approach the short bunch in two separate methods: by increasing the higher harmonic cavity voltage and by reducing the momentum compaction factor. The preliminary result and observations are shown and discussed.

Ultra high-gradient accelerating structures are needed for the next generation of compact light sources. In the framework of the Compact Light XLS project, we are studying a high harmonic traveling-wave accelerating structure operating at a frequency of 35.982 GHz, in order to linearize the longitudinal space phase. In this paper, we propose a new analytical approach for the estimation of the group velocity in the structure and we compare it with numerical electromagnetic simulations that are carried out by using the code HFSS in the frequency domain.

The beam dynamics at the interaction point (IP) in the accelerators which has the nano-beam scheme like as SuperKEKB is extremely sensitive for skewed error of final focusing magnets (QCS). As proceeding the beta squeezing in the interaction region (IR), the effect of optics aberrations at IP is enhanced. In the SuperKEKB Phase-2 commissioning, there was the problem come from skewed quadrupole fields in IR. The dominant skew parameters ‘‘R" for this problem is very hard to see directly by using beam position monitors, thus it was corrected by scanning R parameters. In the next commissioning Phase-3 which is just before the operation with the Belle II experiment, it is planned that the IP beta squeezing is going forward to design parameters which is smaller than it achieved in Phase-2 by the factor of 4 (for horizontal beta) and 10 (for vertical beta). Hence the effect of skew error will be considerable larger and it is estimated that skew sextupoles will emerge as a serious cause for the aberration from the orbit. This report is the study of analysis and correction results for the effect of QCS skewed errors in the SuperKEKB commissioning.

All holes on the chamber walls of synchrotrons should be filled with the radiofrequency (RF)-shields to suppress coupling impedances that excite beam instabilities. In a synchrotron, titanium nitride (TiN)-coated RF-shields are installed with collimators. If the holes, through which the collimator jaw enters and exits the chamber, are filled with such RF-shields, the shields may break down as the dynamic coefficient of TiN increases in vacuum. At the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS), the RF-shields are eliminated from the collimator after demonstrating that the effect due to the RF-shields is negligible on the impedance at low frequencies.

At a high-power proton synchrotron, betatron tune shifts induced by space charge effects cause beam loss which limits the beam intensity. To achieve further high beam intensity at the main ring of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex, precise control of the tune shift is indispensable. When carrying out multi-bunch measurements, we observed that the dependence of the tune shift intensity on the number of bunches follow opposite slope trends for the horizontal and vertical directions. The influence of the bunch spacing was also observed. We report on a simplified tune shift model reconstruction for understanding the origin of these phenomena and present a correction of the tune shifts for reducing beam loss up to 30 %.

We have studied many other dynamic approaches from that reported in the IPAC 2018 for transverse beam instability mitigation in the presence of strong space charge in the 3-GeV RCS of J-PARC. One of such a method is the introduction of an excess of chromaticity from that of natural chromaticity by reversing the sextupole magnetic fields from the middle of the acceleration cycle. The benifits of this method are twofold. It allows to utilize sextupole for chromaticty correction at lower energy and also mitigate the beam instability at higher energy because of introducing higher chromaticity. We first carried out numerical simulations by using ORBIT code, experimentally verified and then applied for the machine operation. The detail of simulation and measurements results are presented in this paper.

In high-intensity particle accelerators, unwanted trans-verse and longitudinal wakefields arise when the high-charge particle beam passes through the narrow chambers or locations with small transverse apertures, such as collimator jaws. Transverse wakefields impose a transverse kicks to the beam, changing its shape, and leading to the growth of the transverse emittance. Longitudinal wakes cause the beam energy losses, heating of the narrow chambers etc. In the present study we investigated the collimator’s impact to the beam. Thus, we evaluated the collimator’s wakefields through the CST simulations. We estimated the corresponding transverse kicks and longitudinal wakes. In the summary simulation results were cross-checked with correspondent analytical expressions.

In diffraction-limited light sources, the study of collective effects is essential. With harmonic cavities (HCs), the ’flat potential condition’ can be achieved, lengthening the bunch by a factor of ~5. However, the effective rf voltage seen by the beam becomes sensitive to both positions and distributions of all bunches, as the beam-induced voltage of both HCs and fundamental cavities (FCs) contribute. In addition, when there are empty buckets, the transient beam loading induces considerable variations of the rf voltage impacting the beam performance*. Here the use of analytical approaches is difficult. Then we introduced the new functions to treat the high-Q resonators driven by either or both of the beams and external generators to the code mbtrack**. Using these features, various operating conditions with arbitrary fill patterns can be studied; coupled bunch instability induced by HOMs of the cavity, Robinson instabilities and general beam dynamics with HCs. The growth rates of the instabilities described above are compared with analytical results. The ring performance with HCs in several fill patterns shall be also reported.

The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is proposing an Accelerator Driven Subcritical System (ADS) for the transmutation of the nuclear waste. ADS will consist of a superconducting CW proton linear accelerator of 30MW and a subcritical nuclear reactor core. The main part of the acceleration will take part in the superconducting region using five types of radio frequency cavities. The ADS operation demands a high intensity and reliability of the beam. Therefore, the beam optics design plays a fundamental role to reduce the beam loss, control emittance growth and beam halo.

The use of multipole magnets enables us to shape the transverse profile of a charged-particle beam into various ones that can never be realized through linear beam optics. To date, the formation of a large-area beam with a uniform transverse intensity distribution has been actually realized using octupole magnets in several accelerator facilities. In this presentation, we demonstrate the formation of different beam profiles using multipole magnets rather than existing rectangular uniform beams. Results of tracking simulations and beam-formation experiments will be shown on the formation of clear-cut beams with different cross-sectional shapes, depending on the order and strength of applied multipole magnets. The dynamic behavior of a beam focused with multipole magnets is also investigated theoretically to better understand the numerical and experimental results.

As a future Diffraction-Limited Storage Ring (DLSR) at NSRL, the Hefei Advanced Light Source (HALS) has been proposed and has a great progress in the lattice optimization. The nonlinear dynamics is well designed and shows good performance, which makes it easier for beam injection and gives us more choices to design a more suitable injection scheme. In this paper, a new off-energy off-axis pulsed multipole injection scheme is proposed. The off-energy beam is off-axis injected into the acceptance of the storage ring with one or several pulsed multipole kickers and meanwhile the stored beam is almost unaffected during the injection. The injection acceptance of the storage ring is analyzed and the injection scheme is preliminary designed. A series of tracking simulations are carried out and the results are presented.

A Fast Method for Multi-Objective Nonlinear Dynamics Optimization of a Storage Ring

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), including multi-objective genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm, have been widely applied in the nonlinear dynamics optimization of storage ring light sources. In the optimization, the direct tracking of objectives, which are, for example, dynamic aperture (DA) and momentum aperture, is very time-consuming. We noticed that there is some positive correlation between on- and off-momentum nonlinear dynamics performances, which can be used to reduce the computation time when applying MOEAs. In this paper, a fast method is proposed, in which a strategy is introduced to speed up the process of optimizing nonlinear dynamics using MOEAs. Taking the SSRF storage ring as an example, on- and off-momentum DAs are optimized using MOEAs with and without the fast strategy, and then a comparison is made to demonstrate the fast method.

Experimental Muon Source (EMuS) is a muon source to be built at China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). The EMuS baseline design adopts a stand-alone target sitting in capture superconducting solenoids, and the muon beam is extracted in the forward direction. In the same time the spent protons are also extracted from the target station and guided to an external. Because there is an angle of 15 degrees between the axis of solenoids and the proton direction, the protons will be deviated by the solenoid field. A pair of correction magnets in front of the solenoids is used to align the incoming proton beam to the target and also guide the spent protons to the beam dump. As the target station is design to work at different field level, this increases the complexity of the proton beam transport.

During the high power experiment of a single-cell standing-wave accelerating structure, it was observed that many RF breakdowns happen when the field inside cavity is decaying after the input rf pulse is off. The distribution of breakdown timing shows a peak at the moment of RF power switches off. A series of simulation was performed to study the after-pulse breakdown effect in such a standing-wave structure. A method of calculating poynting vector over time is proposed in this article to study the modified poynting vector at critical points in the cavity. Field simulation and thermal simulation were also carried out to analyse possible reasons for the after-pulse breakdown effect.

Hiroshima synchrotron radiation center equips a 700 MeV electron storage ring nicknamed HiSOR. It has been operated for more than 20 years. The emittance of HiSOR is 400 nm, which is larger by one or more orders of magnitude than typical modern synchrotron light sources. Therefore, as the future plan of the facility, a new low emittance storage ring is desired. Several designs have been examined. In the newest version, we have selected the lattice structure similar to ASTRID 2 compact light source in Aarhus University, Denmark. The design goal is the energy of around 500 MeV, the circumference shorter than 50 m and the emittance smaller than 10 nm with straight sections for undulators more than 4. In this conference, we report the latest result from the design study.

In a very high energy e+/e− storage ring collider, e.g. Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), the dynamic aperture is limited by the strong synchrotron radiation especially in the vertical direction. Some tracking results also shows that the beam lifetime does not correspond well to the dynamic aperture. Here we develop a method called diffusion map analysis, aiming to describe the beam distribution diffusion in transverse amplitude space by tracking less turns. The diffusion may come from quantum fluctuation of SR, beamstrahlung effect and nonlinearity. Comparing cases with different configuration of sextupoles, the diffusion map analysis presents good consistency with beam lifetime that needs much more turns of tracking. Constraints based on the diffusion map is applied to our dynamic aperture optimization, which could help us achieve enough long beam lifetime.

The booster of High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is proposed to ramp the beam energy from 500 MeV to 6 GeV, and to deliver the required charge to the storage ring. However, the transverse single-bunch instability may limit the reachable bunch charge in the booster. The study of the transverse single-bunch instability has been carried out for the HEPS booster at both 500 MeV and 6 GeV to double check whether the required single-bunch charge can be achieved. Furthermore, the energy ramping process was recently included in the study. We concentrate in the analyses of the simulation results with the consideration of energy ramping process in this paper.

High vacuum has always been mandatory in particle accelerators. This is especially true for circular machines, where the beam makes thousands or millions turns, and beam lifetime is heavily affected by the residual gas scattering. At the beginning of storage ring operation the lifetime was very short mostly dominated by residual gas scattering. The residual gas lifetime is comprised of the elastic and inelastic scattering on electrons and elastic and inelastic scattering on nuclei. One usually calculates only the elastic scattering on nuclei (single Coulomb scattering) and inelastic scattering on nuclei (bremsstrahlung) of the residual gas scattering lifetime component. The analytic calculation the residual gas scattering lifetime and simulations of the beam interaction with the residual gas with code will be shown in this presentation

High electron beam quality is required in Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) to achieve high spatial resolution. However, aberrations mainly induced by solenoid lens will deteriorate the beam quality and limit the resolution. Spherical aberration introduces the largest distortion which is unavoidable in the case of static cylindrically symmetric electromagnetic fields on the basis of Scherzer’s theorem. In order to reduce the spherical aberrations, different models have been designed which are composed of three symmetrical lens and one asymmetrical lens. We obtain the magnetic field distribution and calculate the aberration of each model by OPERA, and the result is that the solenoid without poles has the minimum aberration and meets the design requirement best.

This paper studies if it is possible to build an electron storage ring with no or a small number of sextupole mag-nets. If it is possible, the electron storage ring will be great-ly simplified. For the purpose, two methods are presented in the paper to handle head-tail instability: One is to use dielectric vacuum chamber made of such materials as ceramic or glass to reduce broadband impedance signifi-cantly. Then head-tail instability would be extremely weak. The other method is to install a bunch-by-bunch feedback system to suppress the already weak head-tail instability due to the dielectric vacuum chamber.

In a lepton storage ring of very high energy (e.g. in the e+e- Higgs factory) synchrotron radiation from quadrupoles constrains transverse dynamic aperture even in the absence of any magnetic nonlinearities. This was observed in tracking for LEP and the Future Circular e+e- Collider (FCC-ee). Synchrotron radiation in the quadrupoles modulates the particle energy at the double betatron frequency. Energy modulation varies transverse focusing strength at the same frequency and creates a parametric resonance of the betatron oscillations with unusual properties. It occurs at arbitrary betatron frequency and the magnitude of the parameter modulation of the betatron oscillation depends on the oscillation amplitude. Equilibrium between the radiation damping and the resonant excitation gives the boundary of the stable motion. Here we continue comparison of tracking results with analytical calculations of the parametric resonance.

Development of tunable systems for non-invasive bunch diagnostics is a modern trend in accelerator physics. Certain dielectric targets are considered in this context, for example, dielectric cones or prisms. Moreover, all-dielectric target which increase the radiated Cherenkov field near the predetermined focus up to several orders of magnitude has been described* and field near its focus and sensitivity of this target have been analyzed**. Here we consider a non-symmetrical case where charge trajectory has a shift with respect to structure axis. We develop analytical approach for description of Cherenkov radiation, perform three-dimensional simulations and compare the results.

Open-ended waveguide structures with dielectric loading excited by specially prepared electron bunches are considered as promising candidates for development of contemporary sources of Terahertz (THz) radiation. Despite of the fact that both ordinary vacuum THz devices (e.g., backward wave oscillator) are widely available and other mechanisms for THz generation are discussed, beam driven sources are still extremely attractive due to the extraordinary peak power of THz radiation*. In this report, we study electromagnetic (EM) field produced by a charged particle bunch exiting an open-ended circular waveguide with dielectric filling placed inside collinear vacuum waveguide of a larger radius. Based on the previously developed theory**, we mainly investigate Cherenkov radiation generated penetrated vacuum regions of the structure due to the diffraction mechanism. We pay attention to the case of a train of short bunches resulting in high-order Cherenkov modes excitation. We also develop analytical procedure allowing performing the limiting process to the case of infinite radius of the outer waveguide.

In the X-ray frequency region, interaction of relativistic electrons with crystals results in parametric X-ray radiation (PXR), with its frequency being determined by distance between crystallographic planes and direction of electron motion. If instead of crystal one considers an artificial periodic structure with periods of the order of mm, one can expect emission of radiation of a similar nature at terahertz (THz) frequencies. This frequency range is of significant interest during last decade due to its prospective applications. Moreover, artificial wire-like structures are considered as a promising alternative to conventional dielectric structures for wakefield acceleration*. Here we consider electromagnetic (EM) field produced by a charged particle bunch moving through a lattice of parallel conducting wires. We present several approaches for analysis of EM field in the described wire structure. First, conventional two-wave approximation for describing the "short-wave response" is developed. Second, we use the effective medium approach and describe the "long-wave" part of the spectrum. Third, we develop a method based on vibrator antenna theory which can be useful for finite length wire structure.

The research concerns the design of a drift tube linear accelerator (DTL) with permanent quadrupole magnets (PMQ) placed inside some of the drift tubes for focusing. The study was conducted using Comsol Multiphysics software, where electromagnetic fields and particle dy-namics in the cavity were calculated. The proton beam is accelerated up to 10 MeV. Initial beam is assumed to come from Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator (RFQ). Mathematical methods of control theory are used for particles dynamics optimization. Different focusing lattices are examined and variations of the gradient of the magnetic lenses are analyzed with respect to output beam parameters. Effectiveness of the optimization is estimated by the transmission rate and the emittance growth.

Bunch radiation in periodical waveguides was mainly analyzed for situations when wavelengths are comparable to the structure period (Smith-Purcell emission). However, it is also of interest to study the "long-wave radiation" with wavelengths which are much larger than the structure period*,**. In such situation, the exact boundary conditions on the complicated periodic surface can be replaced with the equivalent boundary conditions (EBC) which must be fulfilled on the smooth surface. Earlier we considered with this approach radiation of the bunch moving along the axis of circular vacuum corrugated waveguide**. Comparison of analytical results with COMSOL simulations showed high accuracy of the EBC method. Here we analyze an analogous problem for the waveguide with corrugated wall and dielectric filling under condition that Cherenkov effect takes place in the dielectric. Due to this fact the radiation differs radically from that in the vacuum waveguide. At the same time, the radiation has essential differences from the one in the usual dielectric waveguide. The radiation properties in the waveguide under consideration and its differences from the radiation in the waveguide with smooth wall are analyzed.

The orbit bump technique has been used at the ALBA Storage Ring to characterize with good precision the impedance of single machine elements, like the in-vacuum undulators or the CLIC stripline kicker. The results are compared with theoretical studies, as well as impedance measurements done at ALBA using other methods like the turn by turn betatron phase or from the analysis of the detuning slopes of the Transverse Mode Coupling Instability.

Any description of the beam dynamics calculation and simulation relies on the proper choice of a coordinate system in order to minimize the computational complexity and to apply different level of approximations in the calculations. This need generates a large number of reference systems, especially to describe the longitudinal dynamics of a particle beam like(z, z′),(t,∆P/P),(z, φ), etc. In this paper we summarize the rules to change coordinates systems, which system is canonical and how the Hamiltonian of the beam transforms according to the chosen coordinate system.

In conventional e+e− storage ring colliders, we only use lengthend bunch length in beam-beam simulation instead of considering impedance directly. It is no problem since the longitudinal dynamics is not sensitive to beam-beam interaction. But it is different since the bunch will also be lengthend during beam-beam interaction by beamstrahlung effect. It is very natural and more self-consistent to consider the longitudinal impedance in the beam-beam simulation. The simulation shows that the working point region of stable collision is slightly shifted by the longitudinal impedance. It is found that the vertical coherent oscillation may decreases the beam-beam limit with impedance at some working point.

In the SPS, which is the last accelerator in the LHC ion injector chain, multiple injections of the Pb-ion beam have to be accumulated. On this injection plateau the beam suffers from considerable degradation such as emittance growth and losses. This paper summarises the achievements on improving the beam parameters and maximising the performance of the Pb-ion beam for the LHC physics run in 2018. The results are discussed in view of the target beam parameters of the LHC injectors upgrade project, which is being deployed during the presently ongoing long shutdown.

Longitudinal Stability of the Hollow Ion Bunches After Momentum Slip-Stacking in the CERN SPS

Momentum slip-stacking is planned to be used for the lead ion beams in the CERN SPS to double the beam intensity for the High-Luminosity LHC project. During this RF manipulation two SPS batches, controlled by two independent RF systems, are going to be interleaved on an intermediate energy plateau, reducing the bunch spacing from 100 to 50 ns. However, there are limitations how close the frequencies of two RF systems can approach each other, resulting in a hole in the longitudinal bunch particle distribution due to the offset in energy of the recaptured bunches. After filamentation, these bunches should be further accelerated to the SPS top energy, before extraction to the LHC. Macro-particle simulations have shown that Landau damping is lost for the bunches with the smallest longitudinal emittances in the batch, causing un-damped oscillations of the bunch core after recapture. The standard application of an additional, fourth harmonic RF system, successfully used in proton operation, was not able to damp the oscillations at top energy, while it was necessary to switch it on from the moment of recapture. In this paper the longitudinal stability of the bunches after slip-stacking is studied in more details both by macro-particle simulations and analytical calculations.

Resistive wall wakefields are an important issue to study for future linear colliders. Wakefields in the Beam Delivery System (BDS) might cause severe multi-bunch effects, leading to beam quality and luminosity losses. The resistive wall effects depend on the beam pipe apertures and materials, which are optimised to limit the impact on the beam. This paper presents a study of this problem for the 380 GeV and 3 TeV beam parameters and optics of the Compact Linear Collider’s BDS. First, the optimisation of the beam pipe apertures to limit the impact of resistive wall effect on the beam quality is shown, then the luminosity and its quality are presented. Finally, the proposed design parameters are discussed.

Reconfiguration of SPS Landau Octupole Circuits to Minimise Second Order Chromaticity

In the SPS Q20 optics presently used for LHC beams, the Landau octupole families of the SPS (LOF and LOD circuits) generate large second order chromaticity due to the relatively high dispersion at their locations. Since the induced second order chromaticity results in enhanced losses due to the large incoherent tune spread, these octupoles cannot be used for mitigating transverse instabilities for LHC beams. A new cabling scheme was proposed, exploiting additional octupoles that were already installed in the machine but not used, which allows minimizing the induced second order chromaticity in both the Q20 optics used for LHC beams, as well as the original SPS optics used for fixed target beams. This paper summarises the optics calculations as well as the experimental verification of the reduced chromatic detuning of the new octupole scheme.

In the past years wakefield sources have been used to manipulate electron beams in accelerators. We recently installed corrugated structures for a total length of 2~m at the SwissFEL injector to test novel schemes for beam manipulations. We present simulations and early experimental results. We compare the model predictions with the measured data for the bunch energy losses and the kick factor, and show early results for the longitudinal phase space linearization and the production of current spikes.

The injection kicker system for the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) must satisfy demanding requirements. To achieve low pulse ripple and fast field rise and fall times, the injection system will use ferrite loaded transmission line type magnets. The beam coupling impedance of the kicker magnets is crucial, as this can be a dominant contribution to beam instabilities. In addition, interaction of the high intensity beam with the real part of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance can result in high power deposition in the ferrite yoke. This gives a significant risk that the ferrite yoke will exceed its Curie temperature: hence, a suitable beam screen will be a critical feature. In this paper, we present a novel concept - a spiral beam screen. The fundamental advantage of the new design is a significant reduction of the maximum voltage induced on the screen conductors, thus decreased probability of electrical breakdown. In addition, the longitudinal beam coupling impedance is optimized to minimize power deposition in the magnet.

Longitudinal higher-order modes (HOMs) at a frequency of around 630 MHz in the 200 MHz travelling wave RF structures currently limit the beam intensities in the CERN SPS to less than that required by the High Luminosity (HL-) LHC. In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project, the performance of the already existing HOM damping scheme for these standing wave modes must be improved. This involves improving the existing HOM-couplers as well as the possible use of a new mitigation technique via the insertion of resonant posts in some cells of the multi-cell structures. The development of the new damping scheme has been performed using theoretical analysis of the cavity-coupler interaction in conjunction with full-wave electromagnetic (EM) field simulations. This contribution will show the verification of the improved HOM damping performance by measurements on a single section with 11 cells and on the future 33-cell structures. The parasitic impact of the damping scheme on the travelling wave fundamental passband (FPB) will also be presented.

The CERN accelerator complex is currently in its long shutdown while the LHC Injector Upgrade is being carried out. The upgrade of the SPS includes but is not limited to: the relocation of the beam dumping system, upgrade of the RF system, replacement of the electrostatic septa and impedance reduction. These major upgrades present an opportunity to perform additional impedance reduction in areas not normally modified due to the large amount of work being performed across the accelerator complex. In this paper, we look at the impedance minimization in the sections near the large aperture quadrupoles of the extraction regions in the CERN SPS. By optimizing the locations of existing equipment and the introduction of a new, more impedance optimised type of bellows, significant reductions in the beam-coupling impedance can be achieved.

The effect of Landau damping is often calculated based on a Gaussian beam distribution in all degrees of freedom. The stability of the beam is however strongly dependent on the details of the distribution. The present study focuses on the change of bunch distributions caused by the decoherence of the excitation driven by an external source of noise, in the presence of both amplitude detuning and a transverse feedback. Both multiparticle tracking simulations and theoretical models show a similar change of the distribution. The possible loss of Landau damping driven by this change is discussed.

As part of the LHC Injector Upgrade Project the injection of the CERN PS Booster will be changed to increase intensity and brightness of the delivered beams. The new injection scheme is likely to give rise to beta beating above the required level of 5\% and new measurements are required. Achieving accurate optics measurements in PSB lattice is a challenging task that has involved several improvements in both hardware and software. This paper summarizes all the improvements that have been performed in the optics measurement acquisition system together with a brief summary of the first results obtained.

Simulations have shown that the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is sensitive to external dynamic magnetic fields (stray fields) to the nT level. Magnetic fields are not typically measured to this precision at CERN. Past measurements of the background magnetic field at CERN are limited. In this paper new measurements are presented.

Simulations have shown the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is sensitive to external dynamic magnetic fields (stray fields) to the nT level. Due to these extremely tight tolerances, mitigation techniques will be required to prevent performance loss. A passive shielding technique is envisaged as a potential solution. A model for passive shielding is presented along with calculations of its transfer function. Measurements of the transfer function of a promising material (mu-metal) that can be used for passive shielding are presented. The validity of passive shielding models in small amplitude magnetic fields is also discussed.

High-order modes (HOM) of the accelerating rf structures and other machine elements, if not sufficiently damped, can drive longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities (CBI). Their thresholds can be accurately obtained from macro-particle simulations using the detailed impedance model containing many different contributions. This method, however, is very difficult to apply for synchrotrons with a large number of bunches, as it is the case for the Future Circular hadron-hadron Collider (FCC-hh) with up to 10400 circulating bunches per beam. In this paper the semi-analytical approach is used for calculations of the instability thresholds during the acceleration cycle of the FCC-hh. As the result, we define requirements for the HOM damping that would be sufficient to prevent development of longitudinal CBI in the presence of weak synchrotron radiation damping.

Beam Loading Compensation for the Future Circular Hadron-Hadron Collider (FCC-hh)

The power consumption of the rf system can be minimised by optimising the cavity detuning and the loaded quality factor. In high-current accelerators, the presence of gaps in the filling results in a modulation of the cavity voltage along the ring (transient beam loading) and as a consequence a spread in the bunch parameters. In addition longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities can appear, caused by the cavity impedance at the fundamental. Both issues can be mitigated by using an rf feedback around the amplifier and cavity, a technique used in many high intensity machines including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Compared to the LHC machine, the energy increase and the radiation loss for the Future Circular hadron-hadron Collider (FCC-hh) will be larger, resulting in a synchronous phase deviating significantly from 180 degrees. The solutions adopted for the LHC must therefore be revisited. This paper evaluates several beam loading compensation schemes for this machine.

The International Linear Collider (ILC) is an electron-positron collider being considered for the post-LHC era. Its Beam Delivery System (BDS) receives the beam from the main linac. This beam is then focused to the nanometer scale after going through collimators, beam diagnostic systems, strong magnets, etc. Effects such as wakefields due to resistive-wall, BPMs and collimators make the system very sensitive to the beam intensity. Understanding these effects is crucial in order to demonstrate that the nominal beam size at the Interaction Point (IP) can be reached in realistic scenarios. In this paper, results of the intensity dependence effects in the ILC BDS, simulated with PLACET, are presented.

The Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) at KEK is a prototype for the Final Focus Systems of the future e+e− linear colliders, the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). In this paper both simulation and experimental results are presented with special emphasis on intensity-dependent effects. The importance of these effects is shown using the PLACET code and realistic ATF2 machine simulations (including beam jitter, misalignment, wakefield, Beam Based Alignment (BBA) correction, …). The latest experimental results are also presented, in particular the impact of the beam intensity on the beam size at the IP.

GALACTIC and GALACLIC, two Vlasov solvers for the study, in the transverse and longitudinal plane respectively, of single-bunch coherent oscillation modes, were recently developed starting from the Vlasov equation and using a decomposition on the low-intensity eigenvectors, as proposed by Laclare and Garnier. The first Vlasov solver was used for instance to shed light on the destabilising effect of resistive transverse dampers and the second helped understanding the details of the mode-coupling behind some longitudinal microwave instabilities. Both theories are reviewed in detail, highlighting in particular the similarities and peculiarities of the two approaches.

A Two-Mode Model to Study the Effect of Space Charge on TMCI in the "Long-Bunch" Regime

Using a two-mode approach for the Transverse Mode-Coupling Instability (TMCI) in the ’short-bunch’ regime (where the mode-coupling takes place between the modes 0 and -1, such as in the CERN LHC), both a reactive damper (ReaD) and Space Charge (SC) are expected to be beneficial: the ReaD would shift the mode 0 up while SC would shift the mode -1 down, but in both cases the coupling (and related instability) would occur at higher intensities. However, the situation is more involved in the ’long-bunch’ regime (where the mode-coupling takes place between higher-order modes, such as in the CERN SPS). As the ReaD modifies only the (main) mode 0 and not the others, it is expected to have no effect for the main mode-coupling. As concerns SC, it modifies all the modes except the mode 0, and the result has been a subject of discussion for two decades. A two-mode approach is discussed in detail in this contribution for the case of a single bunch interacting with a broad-band resonator impedance in the ’long-bunch’ regime. This model reveals in particular that in the presence of space charge, the intensity threshold can only be similar to or lower than that in the absence of space charge.

Following the same approach as for the recently developed GALACTIC Vlasov solver in the transverse plane and taking into account the potential-well distortion, a new Vlasov solver, called GALACLIC, was developed for the longitudinal plane. In parallel, a new mode analysis was implemented for the post-processing of the results obtained through macroparticle tracking simulations. The results of the several benchmarks performed between the two methods are presented.

Alignment of a Magnetic Lattice Based on Particle Tracking

In calculations based on particle tracking in 3D magnetic field maps alignment of the components of a magnetic lattice is essential to obtain desired properties of beam optics. In this contribution we propose a method to control and correct misalignments during the process of the beam optics design. These misalignments would result from overlapping fringe fields of different field maps. The 3D field maps are obtained from the software for electromagnetic calculations OPERA. The full 3D map is saved in the tracking coordinate system and a ROOT (An Object Oriented Data Analysis Framework) ntuple is then created for analysis. The trajectory of the reference particle is calculated by means of OPAL - open source code developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). The transverse magnetic field profiles allow possible misalignments to be precisely determined and the corresponding corrections to be calculated. Moreover, the multipole content in discrete locations along the lattice can be controlled by performing a polynomial fit, which calculates the magnetic field harmonics with respect to the reference track. This method was used at PSI for a design of a model of the magnetic lattice for a superconducting gantry for proton therapy with a large momentum acceptance.

Capture and Flat-Bottom Losses in the CERN SPS
327

Particle losses on the flat bottom of the SPS, the last accelerator in the injector chain of the LHC at CERN, are a strong limitation for reaching the high intensities required by the high luminosity upgrade of the LHC. Two contributions to these losses are investigated in this paper. The first losses occur during the PS-to-SPS bunch-to-bucket transfer, since the bunch rotation in the PS creates halo particles and the bunch does not completely fit into the SPS RF-bucket. The effect of longitudinal shaving in the PS on the beam transmission was recently tested. At high intensities, further capture losses are caused by beam loading in the traveling wave RF system of the SPS, which is partially compensated by the LLRF system, in particular by one-turn delay feedback. While the feedforward system reduces the capture losses, it also increases the losses along the flat bottom due to the RF noise.

In PETRA IV project the on-axis injection scheme is preferred since there is no sufficient dynamic aperture for off-axis injection in ultra low emittance storage rings. The challenge is to prepare the injected bunches with the smaller emittance and larger intensity. The current injector complex including the accumulator and booster does not fulfill the requirements and thus will need refurbishments. The injector upgrade option chosen will be composed of an upgraded electron gun, a higher energy LINAC, and the new booster synchrotron DESY IV which has smaller emittance. DESY IV will be located in the existing tunnel of the current booster DESY II. The design of the lattice and some simulation results are addressed in this article.

To ensure a stable performance of Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), we perform the calibration of accelerator optics using LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbit) technique every month. After the optics and coupling corrections, the rms beta beatings in both planes are reduced to less than 1%. The emittance coupling ratio is also restored to within the design value.

Crab cavities are a critical component within the High Luminosity upgrade project for the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). It is foreseen to use crab cavities in order to compensate the geometric luminosity reduction factor (reduction of the luminous region at the Interaction Point [IP]) due to the beam crossing angle (required for minimizing the impact of the long range beam-beam effects on the single particle beam dynamics) and increase the number of collisions per bunch crossing. In 2018 the first beam tests of crab cavities with protons were performed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. Two vertical superconducting cavities of the Double Quarter Wave (DQW) type were fabricated and installed in the SPS to verify some key components of the cavity design and operation. This paper will present some of the first results relating to the proton beam dynamics in the presence of crab cavities.

The LHC Upgrade, called High Luminosity LHC, aims to increase the integrated luminosity by a factor of 10. To achieve this, the project relies on a number of key innovative technologies, including the use of superconducting Crab Cavities with ultra-precise phase control for beam rotation. A set of prototype Crab Cavities has been recently installed in the second largest machine of CERN, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), that operated as a test-bed from May to November of 2018. The tight LHC constraints call for axially non-symmetric cavity designs that introduce high order multipole components. Furthermore, the Crab Cavities in the presence of SPS non-linearities can affect the long term stability of the beam. This paper presents how the SPS dynamic aperture is affected for different cavity, machine and beam configurations.

Ultra-low emittance lattices are being studied for the future upgrade of the 2.75 GeV SOLEIL storage ring. The candidate baseline lattice was inspired by the ESRF-EBS-type Multi-Bend-Achromat (MBA) lattice, introducing a (-I) transformation to compensate the nonlinear impact of sextupoles thanks to the lattice symmetry and tight control of the betatron phase advance between sextupoles. Whilst the final performance is still being optimized, other types of lattices are being considered for SOLEIL: This includes the so-called High-Order Achromat (HOA) lattice. Though the (-I) scheme provides a large on-momentum transverse dynamic aperture in 4D, its off-momentum performance is rather limited. 6D studies reveal intrinsic off-momentum transverse oscillations which are likely to result from a nonlinear increase in path length. This contribution presents the effects from the inhomogeneous sextupole distribution in the (-I) scheme and compares them with the HOA lattice.

The design for the upgrade of the SOLEIL third generation light source is progressing. At the present stage, different lattices are evaluated as possible candidates for the storage ring upgrade and an important factor for the comparison of their performances is the robustness against lattice imperfections. The strategy for this study consists in defining a set of misalignments of the lattice elements and field errors of the magnets that are expected to be attained after the commissioning, applying them to the lattice models and correcting them using response matrix based techniques. A dedicated algorithm was developed in Accelerator Toolbox in order to accomplish this procedure and compare the different lattices. In this paper the results of this study at the current state are presented, including the considered lattice imperfections, the correction method applied and the final performance of the lattices.

Iterative Trajectory-Correction Scheme for the Early Commissioning of Diffraction-Limited Light Sources

The commissioning of diffraction-limited light sources will be significantly affected by the fact that typical lattice designs rely on very strong focussing elements in order to achieve the small emittance goals. Especially in the early-commissioning phase this can render procedures successfully used in the commissioning of existing third-generation light sources ill-suited for the application to these new machines. In this contribution we discuss an iterative approach to the early trajectory correction, based on the well-known pseudo-inversion of a trajectory-response matrix. Measuring this matrix during early commissioning can be cumbersome, so that an algorithm working with the model response matrix of the lattice is desirable. We discuss the stability of the iteration in the presence of lattice errors, resulting in differences between the actual and the model response matrix. Further, Tikhonov regularization is investigated as a means to trade off the RMS trajectory variation against the strength of the required corrector kicks.

Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) is a promising method for cooling very dense stored particle beams through the interference of radiation created in an upstream ’pickup’ wiggler and a downstream ’kicker’ wiggler. By correlating a particle’s path length via a bypass between the two wigglers with its betatron coordinates in the pickup, the particle will receive a kick in energy which, through coupling introduced by non-zero horizontal dispersion in the kicker, can reduce its betatron amplitude, thus cooling the beam. A proof-of-principle test of this technique is being planned at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). In addition to maintaining standard requirements such as a large dynamic aperture and acceptable lattice functions throughout the ring, the design of the bypass is guided by the mutually competing goals of maximizing the cooling rate while maintaining a sufficiently large cooling acceptance with properly-corrected nonlinearities. We present a design of such a bypass and ring optics so as to best achieve these objectives.

In a dual energy storage ring, the electron beam passes through two loops at markedly different energies EL, and EH, i.e., energies for low energy loop and high energy loop respectively. These loops use a common beamline where a superconducting linac at first accelerates the beam from EL to EH and then decelerates the beam from EH to EL in the next pass. There are two basic solutions to the equilibrium problems possible, i.e., ’Storage Ring’ (SR) equilibrium and ’Energy Recovery Linac’ (ERL) equilibrium. SR equilibrium mode more resembles the usual single loop storage ring with strong synchrotron motion and ERL equilibrium mode is the case where RF in two beam passes nearly cancels. Calculations based on linear transfer matrix formalism show that longitudinal stability exists for both SR mode and ERL mode in two energy storage rings.

A novel approach to transverse resonance suppression in next generation high-intensity accelerators is the use of nonlinear optical elements to induce large tune spreads which result in reduced responses to resonance driving perturbations*. In order to test this theory, we have built and characterized an octupole channel insert for use in the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). This paper presents experimental lattice studies using a low space-charge intensity beam at an energy of 10keV with a beam current of ~150uA, tune depression < 0.005, and unnormalized RMS emittance of 4.3 mm-mr. We apply beam based measurement techniques in order to evaluate the quality of our single-invariant lattice and better understand the nonlinearities created by the octupole channel.

In order to maximize beam lifetime in circular particle accelerators, the nonlinear beam optics are optimized to maximize the dynamic aperture of the beam. The dynamic aperture (DA), which is a 6-D phase space volume of stable trajectories, depends on the strength of the nonlinearities in the machine, and is calculated via particle tracking. Current DA optimization processes include multi-objective genetic algorithm optimizers, and relies on minimizing the magnitudes of resonance driving terms (RDT), which are calculated from the nonlinear contribution to the one-turn-map. The process of searching through the parameter space for an ideal combination that maximizes DA is computationally strenuous. By setting up the sextupole channel such that it is resembles a symplectic integrator of a smooth Hamiltonian, with only a few sextupoles we are able to closely reproduce phase space trajectories of a smooth Hamiltonian up to the hyperbolic point. No chaos and resonances are observed if phase advance per one sextupole magnet in the channel does not exceed ~0.12x2 pi. Therefore, an important property of the suggested approach is the intrinsic elimination of the resonances, and minimization of corresponding RDTs.

These days, the techniques using the turn-by-turn data are well developed in analyzing the accelerator optics. We compared the data for the low and high beam currents and studied the beam current effects on the storage ring lattice optics. Also, by comparing the local transfer matrices, we analyzed the amounts of the impacts on the linear optics around the ring.

A Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) has a potential of substantial reducing cooling time of the high-energy hadrons and hence to boost luminosity in high-intensity hadron-hadron and electron-hadron colliders. In a CeC system, a high quality electron beam is generated, propagated and optimized through a beam line which was carefully designed with consideration of space charge effect, wakefields and nonlinear dynamics such as coherent synchrotron radiation and chromatic aberration. In this paper, we present our study on the beam dynamics of such a beam line and compare the simulation result with what was measured in experiment.

A four dipole magnetic chicane is usually used to compress electron bunch to very short in modern accelerators which requires electron beams to have high peak current. The coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) originated from the strong bending magnets in the chicane could greatly degrade the quality of the electron beam. In this paper, we present our design for a bunch compressing system with 30 to 100 fold in bunch length reduction and at the mean time suppress the effect of CSR on the e-beam’s quality. We discuss and detail the performance of such a compressor for potential FACET-II upgrade.

The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator is a research electron and proton storage ring recently commissioned at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology facility. Its research program is focused on testing novel techniques for improving beam stability and quality, notably the concept of non-linear integrable optics. In this paper, we report the first results of experimental investigation of a quasi-integrable transverse focusing system with one invariant of motion, a Henon-Heiles type system implemented with octupole magnets. Good agreement with simulations is demonstrated on key parameters of achievable tune spread and dynamic aperture preservation. Resilience to perturbations and imperfections in the lattice is explored. We conclude by outlining future research plans and discussing applicability to future high intensity accelerators.

Bayesian Approach for Linear Optics Correction

With a Bayesian approach, the linear optics correction algorithm for storage rings is revisited. In modern ring-based accelerators, optics corrections are determined from repetitive measurements which help identify systematic and random quadrupole errors in presence of various measurement noises. This process is a multivariate nonlinear regression problem driven by either a completed lattice model or a Jacobian matrix. Starting from the Bayes’ theorem, ’likelihood functions’ and ’prior probability’ distributions are extracted from a complete linear optics model. Under some assumptions, the least square algorithm and then the Jacobian matrix approach can be re-derived. The coherence of the correction algorithm is ensured through specifying a self-consistent regularization coefficient to prevent overfitting. Optimal weights for different correction objectives are obtained based on their measurement noise level. A new technique has been developed to resolve degenerated quadrupole errors when observed at a few select BPMs. A necessary condition of being distinguishable is that their optics response vectors seen at these specific BPMs should be near-orthogonal.

An interleaved sextupole scheme using cross-cell betatron phase cancellation technique is adopted as a candidate for the future NSLS-II upgrade lattice. The lattice uses as many NSLS-II installed magnets as possible, including 30 dipoles, to compose a triple bend achromat lattice. A 300 pm.rad horizontal beam emittance is achieved. The emittance can be further reduced to around 200 pm rad with damping wigglers. Various design concepts used in modern 4th-generation light sources, such as adopting longitudinal gradient dipoles and anti-bend scheme, are incorporated into the design as well. The betatron phase-advance between sextupoles is designed to have a cross-cell interleaving cancellation pattern in the transverse planes. The dynamic aperture is big enough for the conventional off-axis top-off injection. At the same time, a large energy acceptance looks promising to ensure a sufficiently long beam lifetime.

The phenomenon of synchrotron radiation (SR) from electrons is at the core of modern accelerator based light sources. While SR in the far field has been well characterized, the near-field SR and its impacts on self-consistent electron beam dynamics remain an ongoing topic. Since it is difficult to experimentally characterize the near fields, it is desirable to develop accurate and efficient numerical methods for the design of these light sources. Here, we investigate a novel method, originally proposed by Shintake and which potentially has both high efficiency and accuracy. We focus on the field calculation of this method and show that the original idea has missed the important terms of fields due to electron acceleration and therefore only applies to a linear motion. To correct this limitation we developed a modified algorithm that gives consistent fields with direct calculations using the Liénard-Wiechert equation. Some basic signatures of the near-field SR fields are also drawn for a cyclotron motion by using this modified approach.

Interaction of a particle beam with the vacuum chamber impedance is one of the main effects limiting the beam intensity in accelerators. Minimization of the impedance is an essential part of the vacuum chamber design for any new accelerator project. The impedance can be estimated experimentally by measuring beam dynamics effects caused by the beam-impedance interaction. Experience obtained at many accelerator facilities shows the beam-based measurements are often different from the pre-computed impedance budgets, the discrepancy of a factor of two or even more is not unusual. The measurements of broadband longitudinal impedance carried out at NSLS-II are discussed in comparison with the numerically simulated impedance budget.

CBETA is an energy recovery linac accelerating from 6 MeV to 150 MeV in four linac passes, using a single return beamline accepting all energies from 42 to 150 MeV. While CBETA gives promise to deliver unprecedentedly high beam current with simultaneously small emittance, Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) can pose detrimental effect on the beam at high bunch charges and short bunch lengths. To investigate the CSR effects on CBETA, we used the established simulation code Bmad to track a bunch with different parameters. We found that CSR causes phase space dilution, and the effect becomes more significant as the bunch charge and recirculation pass increase. Potential ways to mitigate the effect involving vacuum chamber shielding and increasing bunch length are being investigated.

Modern high performance circular accelerators require sophisticated corrections of nonlinear lattices. The beam betatron tune footprint may cross many resonances, reducing dynamic aperture and causing particle loss. However, if particles cross a resonance reasonably fast, the beam deterioration may be minimized. In this paper, we present the experiments with the beam passing through a half-integer resonance stopband via chromatic tune modulation by exciting synchrotron oscillations. This is the first time that beam dynamics have been kept under precise control while the beam crosses a half-integer resonance. Our results convincingly demonstrate that particles can cross the half-integer resonance without being lost if the passage is reasonably fast and the resonance stopband is sufficiently narrow.

The Canadian Light Source (CLS) synchrotron operates with four in-vacuum insertion devices, three in-vacuum undulators, and one in-vacuum wiggler. Presently, each of the devices occupies half of a straight section. The wiggler is unique in our ring as it is both in-vacuum and shares a straight section with an in-vacuum undulator. We have observed gap dependent beam instabilities in the undulator located in the straight section. In order to better understand the problem, the cause of the instabilities was investigated using 3D electromagnetic modelling. First, the ’trapped’ RF modes (natural resonances) for this undulator chamber, their Q value, and their peak frequencies were analysed using Eigenmode simulation. Secondly, beam excitation of the Eigenmodes was simulated with the Wakefield solver. Herein we present the results of this electromagnetic modelling.
