A Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) with a circumference about 100 km, a beam energy up to 120 GeV is proposed to be constructed in China. CEPC will be a double ring collider with two interaction points. Most magnets for CEPC accelerator are conventional magnets, but some superconducting magnets are needed in the interaction region. Final focus superconducting high gradient quadrupoles are inside the solenoid field of Detector magnet, so superconducting anti-solenoid is need to minimize the effect of the solenoid field on the beam. In addition, high strength superconducting sextupole magnets are also required. In this paper, the layout and conceptual design of CEPC Interaction Region superconducting magnets are described, and the R&D plan is presented.

The Interaction Region (IR) magnets for e+e− colliders such as BEPC-II at IHEP Beijing, SuperKEKB at KEK and the ILC in Japan and for Electron-Ion Colliders (EIC), such as HERA-II at DESY and the proposed colliders, eRHIC at BNL, JLEIC at JLab and LHeC/FCC-eH at CERN, must satisfy challenging contradictory requirements. Typically the superconducting IR magnets should be brought as close as possible to the collision point and this in turn requires designing compact coil structures housed in restricted space nearby or sometimes deep inside large experimental detector solenoids. The focusing provided for one beam species should not adversely impact the field seen by the other adjacent beam and accomplishing this can be especially challenging when the beams have quite different magnetic rigidities as occurs for B-factories and even more strongly for EICs. Experiment specific Machine Detector Interface (MDI) requirements also tend to drive IR magnet design choices for different projects. In this presentation we give examples of magnetic designs and technology choices representative of some past and future colliders.

SuperKEKB has been constructed with the target luminosity of 8×1035, which is 40 times higher than KEKB, by the "Nano-Beam" scheme. The beams of 7 GeV electrons and 4 GeV positrons collide at the interaction point (IP) with the crossing angle of 83 mrad, and both beams are squeezed to 50 nano-m in the vertical direction and 10 micro-m in the horizontal direction at IP by the superconducting magnet system. The system consists of 8 superconducting quadrupole magnets (quadrupole doublets), 4 superconducting solenoids and 43 superconducting corrector magnets. After the installation of the magnet system into the beam interaction region, SuperKEKB was operated as the Phase-2 beam commissioning from 2018 March to 2018 July. In the paper, we would like to describe the superconducting magnet system and the experiences on the magnet system during the beam operation.

A Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) with a circumference of about 100 km, a beam energy up to 120 GeV is proposed to be constructed in China. Most mag-nets for CEPC Booster and Collider ring are conventional magnets. The quantities of the magnets are large, so the cost and power consumption are two of the most im-portant issues for the magnet design and manufacturing. The dual aperture dipole and quadrupole magnet with low current high voltage are used in the collider ring. While in the booster the dipole magnet works at very low field, so a low packing factor dipole magnet or a coil type without iron design will be investigated and chosen. In this paper, the conceptual design of the CEPC main mag-nets are in detailed and the R&D plan is presented.
