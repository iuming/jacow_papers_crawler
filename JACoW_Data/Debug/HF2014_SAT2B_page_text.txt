To reach the critical HOM damping requirements of high current Energy Recovery Linac (ERL), the 704 MHz high-current superconducting cavity has been designed with consideration of both performance of the fundamental mode firstly, and the damping of dipole higher order modes (HOMs), which are mainly to reduce the (R/Q)d Qext values, is also immersed into the cavity design process. A Copper prototype cavity was fabricated and verified the HOM damping capability with 6 coaxial HOM couplers (3 couples at each side of the cavity). Vertical test results of Nb cavity demonstrated the fundamental performance. A cryomodule integrated with BNL3 cavity for CEC is designed and undergoing fabrication. This presentation will talk about the cavity design and tests, HOM damping scheme, and also the progress of cryo-module fabrication.
