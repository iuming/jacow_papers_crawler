Recent innovative design concepts have greatly improved ring-based SR source performance beyond the limitations experienced in the past few decades [1,2] and this movement activates upgrades of operational SR facilities and new facility constructions. This talk gives a landscape of ring-based light source development and then, presents expected challenges in each development branch, beyond the current performance limit.

Round Beam Related Challenges in Storage Ring Light Sources

In future low emittance storage ring based light sources round beams are desired for reducing Touschek scattering losses, mitigating emittance growth from IBS, and, last but not least, round beams offer more suitable and better photon beam parameters at the end of beam lines and finally at the user's samples. Various schemes have been proposed to make the naturally flat electron beam in storage rings round. These schemes are more or less challenging and their pros and cons will be presented in this contribution.

Superconducting undulator (SCU) technology offers the possibility of enhancing the magnetic field of undulators compared to other undulator technologies. It also allows for the fabrication of circular polarizing devices in addition to the planar undulators. Work on SCUs therefore continues in the light source community. Recent developments in SCU technology will be presented.
