We present a review of the present status of X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) in operations and under construction in the USA, Asia and Europe. We discuss the present limitations on longitudinal coherence and peak intensity and the technical and physical challenges to overcome them. We present some of the results obtained recently at several laboratories, consider the opportunities for further improvements and how they will extend the research capabilities of X-ray FELs in the physical chemical and biological sciences.
