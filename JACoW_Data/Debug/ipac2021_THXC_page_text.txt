Cancer therapies include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. The prevailing method creates a physical dose differential between tumors and normal tissue, with treatment limited by normal tissue toxicity and patients experiencing acute side effects. Recently, a different paradigm for increasing the therapeutic index of radiation therapy has emerged, supported by preclinical research based on the FLASH radiation effect. FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) refers to novel radiation techniques delivering therapeutic radiation doses with ultra-high dose rates. Experimental studies have shown that normal tissues seem to be universally spared by FLASH-RT, whereas tumors are not. The dose delivery conditions are not fully characterized, but it is estimated that doses (>10 Gy) delivered in >100 ms produce optimal sparing effects. There are many technical challenges for the accelerator communities to create and monitor the required dose rates with novel and compact accelerators and fast large-area monitors for FLASH-RT, to ensure safe and reproducible beam delivery. This presentation reviews current R&D in the FLASH effect and promising innovative beam technologies.

Particle beam therapy treatment with protons and light ions provides significant improvements over conventional X-ray radiotherapy due to the Bragg peak. However, the improved dose conformity of particle therapy requires a corresponding improvement in the accuracy of dose delivery to prevent underdosing of the tumour and overdosing of the surrounding healthy tissue. In vivo measurements of dose delivery have proved challenging: real-time systems for measuring delivered dose have yet to be realised. One possibility for ion therapy systems is through Helium-Carbon mixing. By diluting the Carbon treatment beam with a small quantity of Helium ions and accelerating to the same energy per nucleon, a diagnostic signal can be obtained: with a negligible increase to the delivered dose, the Helium beam exits the patient, providing diagnostic information on the tissue being treated and thereby providing real-time information on the position and range accuracy of the delivered dose. This talk describes the background to ion beam therapy and gives insight into experiments carried out to realise clinical Helium-Carbon mixing. The challenges for future systems are also discussed.

Funding: UT-Battelle, LLC, under Grant DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the US Department of Energy (DOE).
The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) began operation in 2006 and first operated at its full 1.4 MW power in 2013. Targets, which receive the pulsed proton beam, were a limiting factor for reliable full power operation for several years. Reaching reliable target operation at 1.4 MW required not only changes to the target design but also support and coordination across the entire SNS enterprise. The history and some key lessons learned are presented.

Accelerator-driven neutron sources with high brilliance neutron provision present an alternative to classical neutron sources of fission reactors and spallation sources to provide scientists with neutrons to probe the structure and dynamics of matter. The Jülich Centre for Neutron Science has started a project to develop, design and demonstrate compact accelerator-driven high-brilliance neutron sources (HBS) as an efficient and cost-effective alternative to current low- and medium-flux reactor and spallation sources. The HBS will consist of a high current proton accelerator, a compact neutron production and moderator unit, and an optimized neutron transport system to provide thermal and cold neutrons with high brilliance. The project offers the construction of a scalable neutron source ranging from university based neutron laboratory to a full user facility with open access and service. Embedded within international collaboration with partners from Germany, Europe and Japan the Jülich HBS project will offer flexible solutions to the scientific. We will describe the current status of the project, the next steps, milestones, and the vision for the future neutron landscape in Europe.

Muons are elementary particles with strong penetrating power and cosmic-ray muons have been utilized to see through large structures such as the pyramids. Recently, we have succeeded in accelerating muons using a radio-frequency accelerator, opening the door to new imaging techniques using accelerated muon beams. Currently, imaging with cosmic-ray muons is limited in imaging time and resolution by their intensity and energy fluctuations. The muon beams can have high intensity and monochromatic energy, allowing for better resolution imaging in less time. In this poster, imaging of spent nuclear fuel in casks using cosmic rays and muon beams, as well as imaging in other cases, will be evaluated and compared.

X-band low-energy electron linear accelerators are attractive to industrial and medical applications due to the compact size. In this work we present tests of an 8 MeV X-band accelerator for industrial use. It adopts the coaxial coupling standing wave structure working at 9300 MHz. The accelerator length is 50 cm including the cavity, thermal gun, and electron window. Dedicated bunching cells are designed to reduce the energy spread. In the high power tests, the accelerator was able to generate the electron beam with RMS energy spread less than 1% (beam energy: 8.1 MeV, peak current: 45 mA). Combining features of compact size and the low energy spread, this X-band accelerator design is valuable for various applications.

To satisfy maximum beam current operation in the storage ring of TPS, the operation parameters of both RF transmitters are set to be able to generate its maxi-mum RF power in daily usage. Under such condition, the klystrons can deliver any power below 300kW at constant AC power consumption which is about 520-530 kW. Hence, the AC power usage is independent of the required RF output power. To best utilize the avail-able AC power based on the required RF power, an adaptive control methodology is proposed here to change the operation parameters of the klystron, cath-ode voltage and anode voltage, according to the pre-sent RF power. The corresponding operation parame-ters are applied by the prior tested table which maps the operation parameters with the different saturation RF power. The test results show that the saved energy can be 32% to 11% from 30mA to 450mA for both RF plants as comparing to constant operation parameters of 1047 kW AC power.
