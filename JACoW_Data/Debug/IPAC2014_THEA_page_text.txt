It will be shown that the final table of the German (men’s!) football Bundesliga and the distribution of the results may be explained by simple statistical distributions. From this observation, one may conclude that the differences in the performance of the teams are not very large although certain teams from the southern part of Germany perform significantly better than others over the years. With such an analysis large-scale manipulations in the German Bundesliga, the English Premier League, and the Italian Serie A may be ruled out. The same analysis reveals a completely different picture for the German women's football Bundesliga and the Word Cup women's football teams. The respective goal distributions can not be explained with simple statistical models because the difference in the performance of the teams is too large. The reason for this finding is simple and will be discussed at the end of the talk.
