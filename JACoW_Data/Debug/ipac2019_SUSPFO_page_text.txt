A recent upgrade to the high power RF network of the linac at the Australian Synchrotron included a SLED Type 1 Pulse Compressor allowing for the operation of its 100 MeV linac using a single klystron. We explore the effects of the SLED installation on the properties of the beam extracted from the linac with a particular focus on the energy spread and bunch train profile. Additionally, the optical fibre beam loss monitor (oBLM), also recently commissioned, was employed to provide shot-by-shot feedback on loss location and intensity to investigate the change in beam losses.

We will report on a system (ps-BPM) that can measure the electron source vertical position and angular motion along with the vertical source size and angular size at a single location in a synchrotron bend magnet beamline*. This system uses a combination of a monochromator and a filter with a K-edge to which the monochromator was tuned in energy. The vertical distribution of the beam with and without the filter was simultaneously visualized with an imaging detector. The small range of angles from the source onto the monochromator crystals creates an energy range that allows part of the beam to be below the K-edge and the other part above. Measurement of the beam vertical location without the absorber and edge vertical location with the absorber allowes measurement of the source position and angle. The beam width and edge width give information about the vertical electron source size and angular distribution. The ps-BPM measurements have been made where the electron beam size and angular distribution was adjusted using skew quads. The ps-BPM measurements correlate well with modeling of the ps-BPM system as well as conventional beam size measurements using a pinhole.

An SLAC-like Compact Linac installed on the HUST FEL-THz has been used as an injector to produce high power THz radiation. To meet the requirements of monochromaticity and repeatability for FEL, performance of electron beam and stability of RF system are notable. According to the existing facility, based on measurement results of RF jitter, instability of beam has been calculated, and it has been verified in relevant experiments. Furthermore, stability targets in RF system has been pro-posed in this paper.

Iterative learning control (ILC) is an open loop control strategy that improves the performance of a repetitive system through learning from previous iterations. ILC can be used to compensate for a repetitive disturbance like the beam loading effect in resonators. In this work, we aim to use norm-optimal ILC to cancel beam loading effect. Norm-optimal ILC updates the control signal with the goal of minimizing a performance index, which results in monotonic convergence. Simulation results show that this controller improves beam loading compensation compared to a PI controller.

Ultra-High Vacuum is an essential requirement to reach design performances in high-energy particle colliders. For the future HL-LHC or FCC study, the understanding of the beam interactions with the vacuum chamber is fundamental to provide solutions to mitigate the pressure rises induced by electronic, photonic and ionic molecular desorption. Studies were performed on the ions, produced by molecular ionization generated by the proton beam and the electron cloud, and stimulating molecular desorption by the surface bombardment. In-situ measurements were carried out, on the LHC Vacuum Pilot Sector (VPS)*, to monitor the dynamic pressure, and to collect the electrical signals due to the electron cloud and to the ions interacting with the vacuum chamber walls. Experimental measurements of electrical signals recorded by copper electrodes were compared to calculations taking into account both the Secondary Electron Yield of copper and electron energy distribution. Finally, it seems that copper electrodes were not fully conditioned and an ion current could be estimated.

The goal of the project is to develop a Wire-Scanner compatible with low energy - high intensity ion beams and adaptable to various beam chamber diameters. The purpose is to obtain the 2D beam profile by passing measurement wires through the beam. Thanks to a high speed passage of measurement wires, it allows to avoid "disrupting" the beam passage, and can be considered as a non-destructive diagnosis. Wires heating and measuring issues have been solved by using tungsten wires kept in tension by a mechanical system. All driving and signal measurements are performed by a PXI based system. The synchronization of the measurements is guaranteed by an analog input board recovering the wires current and the translator position, the latter being carried out by a laser sensor. Besides this technological aspect, an optimization algorithm for beam profile reconstruction from measured data under Gaussian hypothesis has been developed. The standalone system and first experimental results are presented.

MYRRHA will be a research infrastructure highlighted by the first prototype of a sub-critical nuclear reactor driven by a 600 MeV particle accelerator (ADS). This project aims at exploring the transmutation of long-lived nuclear wastes. A first phase is planned to validate the reliability of a 100 MeV/4 mA Protons LINAC carrying the beam toward an ISOL facility, prefiguring the real MYRRHA demonstrator at 600 MeV. This project is called MINERVA. This paper presents the status of the beam dynamic studies for the high energy beam transport lines at 100 MeV. In agreement with the project require-ments, we describe the specificities of these beam lines for which it is needed to implement a fast kicker-septum. This system will separate the beam between two main lines: toward the beam dump or the ISOL facility. We also describe the studies on the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) selected for MYRRHA. Part of this work was sup-port by the MYRTE project of the European Union.

The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe cannot be explained by the Standard Model. An explanation is a non-vanishing Electric Dipole Moment of subatomic particles. The JEDI (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) collaboration is preparing a direct EDM measurement of protons and deuterons first at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron) and later at a dedicated storage ring. To achieve this, one needs a stable polarization, i.e. around 1000 seconds for spin coherence time. One source of decoherence are the electrostatic deflectors, and this must be quantified. We developed an analytical model for cylindrical deflectors, including fringe fields, and the associated beam and spin transfer functions, integrated over the deflector. All boundaries (including ground) are considered, giving a realistic, accurate field map up to any order. We get universal formulas, the only adjustable parameter being the deflector gap/radius ratio, all other terms being numerical. This has been implemented in BMAD. We present the mathematical, physical and numerical developments, as well as results for a proton storage ring.

The ARRONAX Interest Public Group uses a multi-particle, high energy and high intensity industrial accelerator which has several beamlines used for various purposes. For improvement of operations, ARRONAX has foster and installed robust air-based Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs) outside the beam pipes. BLMs consist of four active detecting plates and are integrated within the experimental physics and industrial control system (EPICS) monitoring and data acquisition system. Each BLM has been tested for the pre-commissioning phase with beams at low intensity (600pA to 6nA on target). Comparative studies and selection of the BLMs has led to their installation at high intensity beam lines. BLMs are now used in beam dynamics studies to investigate transverse characteristics while in regular operation. They support present and future operations extension foreseen at ARRONAX. The results from experimental studies on BLMs at low beam intensity and status of beam dynamics studies at high intensity (A) are presented here. Keywords: BLM, beam dynamics, EPICS, Gas ionization detector, cyclotron, proton.

Spin coherence refers to a measure of preservation of polarization in an initially polarized beam. The spin vector of a particle injected into a storage ring starts to precess about the vertical magnetic field vector in accordance with the Thomas-BMT equation. The precession frequency is dependent on the equilibrium-level energy, which differs across the beam particles. This does not pose a problem when the initial polarization is vertical; however, the Frozen Spin Storage Ring EDM search method [*] requires beam polarization along the momentum vector, i.e., in the horizontal plane. In the present work we analyze the source of decoherence, and investigate the way it can be suppressed in the horizontal plane in a perfectly aligned ring by means of sextupole fields. We also consider the case of an imperfect ring: transference of decoherence into the vertical plane induced by vertical plane spin precession, and the effect of sextupole fields.

Transverse Resonant Island Buckets (TRIBs *) correspond to a second stable orbit, longitudinally winding around the core orbit in the transverse x-x′-phasespace. The exploitation possibilities for stable TRIBs are under investigation at the third generation light source BESSY II in Berlin. The applicability for bunch separation is a main subject of these studies. Stable operation of TRIBs optics with a single or few bunches on the second orbit and a multibunch train on the main orbit has been shown **. Photons emitted on the second orbit are well separated from those of the main orbit at all beamlines. This provides the possibility of bunch separation by beamline adjustment for the timing community without significant impact on the average brightness for other users. Simulations based on linear optics from closed orbits (LOCO) and on nonlinear optics derived from the measured chromaticity and tune shift with action (TSWA) predict this separation well. Friendly user experiments in 2018 confirmed these results. The scheduled upgrade BESSY VSR *** features simultaneously stored long and short bunches. Then TRIBs optics would in principle enable the separation of the different bunches at every beamline offering unique possibilities to our users. Simulations and measurements aiming to investigate further possible optimization of the TRIBs optics are presented.

The Z-pole option of FCC-ee is an Ampere class machine with a beam current of 1.39 A. Due to high HOM power and strong HOM damping requirements, the present baseline of FCC-ee considers a single cell cavity at 400 MHz. In this paper, different HOM damping schemes are compared for the Z-pole operating scenario with the aim of lowering the parasitic longitudinal and transverse impedance. The HOM power for each damping scheme is also calculated.

Echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) is a promising technique for seeded free electron lasers (FELs) not only to go down to wavelengths of 4 nm, but also to simplify the schemes that are currently used to achieve a similar wavelength range (double cascade HGHG). Thus a study optimizing the EEHG performance in the wavelength range from 60 to §I{4}{nm} has been performed. The more critical working point, at 4 nm, is here analyzed in terms of seed laser energy stability for two different seed laser frequencies: visible and UV.

In state of the art photoinjector electron sources, cathode performance determines the lower limit of achievable beam emittance. Measuring the thermal emittance at the photocathodes in electron guns is of vital importance for improving the injectors. Traditional methods, like solenoid scan, pepper-pot, need multi-shots and are time-consuming, therefore suffer from machine stability. Here we propose a new method, named cathode transverse momentum imaging. By tuning the gun solenoid focusing, the electrons’ transverse momentum at the cathode is imaged to a downstream screen, which enables a single shot measurement. Several experiments have been done at the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) with a Cs2Te cathode. Measurements of cathode transverse momentum, the corresponding spectra, cathode transverse momentum map and its correlation with surface electric field are presented.

Synchrotron radiation (SR) reflection is an important issue for future linear colliders. High fluxes of the SR might impact the performance of the detector, through irradiation of the forward luminosity and beam quality calorimeters or of the innermost layers of the vertex detector. The photon reflections depend on the beam pipe apertures’ size, their shape, and materials used with various surface roughness. In this work, we present a study of SR including reflection for the 380 GeV and 3 TeV beam parameters and optics of the Compact Linear Collider’s Final Focus System. The simulations of the SR reflections using the Synrad+ software are presented and the impact on the detector is discussed.

With the VSR upgrade for the BESSY II electron storage ring* bunch resolved diagnostics are required for machine commissioning and to ensure the long-term quality and stability of operation. For transverse beam size measurements we are going to use an interferometric method, which will be combined with a fast gated intensified CCD camera at a subsequent stage. A double-slit interferometer method has already been verified successfully at BESSY II**. In addition first 2D bunch resolved measurement tests have been performed at the dedicated diagnostics beamline for bunch length measurements. Measurements of the interferometer and X-ray pinholes as function of a vertical electron beam excitation are compared in this paper.

The MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reac-tor for High-tech Applications) Project is a planned ac-celerator driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of long-living radioactive waste. In order test the reliability of the planned 17 MeV injector, a shortened injector with 5.9 MeV consisting of the ion source, a 4-Rod RFQ, 2 Quarter Wave Rebunchers (QWRs) and a total of 7 normal conducting CH structures is currently being installed in Louvein-la-Neuve (LLN, Belgium). Before the cavities can be tested with beam, they are subjected to so-called low power tests several times during the individual con-struction stages in order to be able to correct any devia-tions. This paper describes the status of the two Quarter Wave Rebunchers, which are currently in the process of copper plating and final acceptance, as well as the first two CH structures, the first of which is already being conditioned while CH 2 is still in preparation.

The MYRRHA Project (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) in Mol, Belgium, is an upcoming accelerator driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of long-living radioactive waste. In the injector section of the accelerator, consisting of a 4-rod RFQ and a normal conducting CH-cavity section, the protons will be accelerated up to 17 MeV before entering the superconducting gap-spoke cavity section with an output energy of 600 MeV. A shortened test-injector with an output energy of 5.9 MeV is currently being installed at the SCK. CEN in Louvein-la- Neuve, Belgium. This test-injector serves the purpose of testing the reliability of the planned injector. When commissioning a cavity, it first has to be fed very little power to avoid damage to the structure by flashovers, discharges and multipacting. The power is then slowly increased up to full operation level. In this process, the surfaces are cleaned by heating/outgasing so that the effects disturbing operation described above do no longer occur. This paper will report on the status of the conditioning of the 176.1 MHz 4-rod RFQ up to 120 kW of the MYRRHA-injector and additional measurements concerning the gap voltage which are currently being performed at the SCK. CEN.

The Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) will be an electron accelerator allowing operation in energy-recovery linac (ERL) mode. It provides the opportunity to operate scattering experiments at energies of ~100 MeV with thin gas-targets. The MESA Internal Gas Target Experiment (MAGIX) aims to operate windowless jet targets and different gases up to Xenon to search for possible dark photon interactions, to precisely measure the magnetic proton radius and astrophysical S-factors. Investigations on the impact of the target on beam dynamics and beam losses are required for machine safety and to examine limits to ERL operation. The goal of this work is to understand target induced halo in the different experimental setups, track halo particles through downstream sections to examine beam losses and include a suitable collimation system and shielding into the accelerator layout to protect the machine from direct and indirect damage through beam losses and radiation. The present status of the investigations is presented.

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is one possible future successor of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The proton-proton collider center-of-mass collision energy is set to 100 TeV with a beam current of 0.5 A. To achieve this energy a stable acceleration is critical and therefore higher order modes (HOM) need to be damped. HOM dampers, further characterized as couplers, need to fulfill several criteria to be efficient. As a first property the couplers should assure a longitudinal impedance of higher order modes of below 10 kW. Furthermore, the loaded Q-factor should be below 1000 and the corresponding R/Q value should be in the range of 10 Ω. Besides the Hook-type and Probe-type HOM coupler two additional designs were simulated. The recent results of the different couplers attached to a superconducting 400 MHz RF cavity will be presented.

The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe cannot be explained by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. In order to resolve the matter dominance an additional CP violating phenomenon is needed. A candidate for physics beyond the SM is a non-vanishing Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of subatomic particles. Since permanent EDMs violate parity and time reversal symmetries, they are also CP violating if the CPT -theorem is assumed. The JEDI (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) collaboration in Jülich is preparing a direct EDM measurement of protons and deuterons first at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron) and later at a dedicated storage ring. In order to analyse the data and to disentangle the EDM signal from systematic effects spin tracking simulations are needed. Therefore a model of COSY was implemented using the software library Bmad. It includes the measured magnet misalignments of the latest survey and a simplified description of the RF-Wien Filter device that is used for the EDM measurement. The model was successfully benchmarked using analytical predictions of the spin behavior. A crucial point regarding the data analysis is the knowledge of the orientation of the invariant spin axis with vanishing EDM at the position of the RF-Wien Filter. Especially its radial component is unknown and spin tracking simulations can be used to determine this missing number. Tracking results as well as the algorithm to find the invariant spin axis will be presented.

The standalone superconducting (SC) continuous wave (CW) heavy ion linac HELIAC (HElmholtz LInear ACcelerator) is a common project of GSI and HIM under key support of IAP Frankfurt and in collaboration with Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhI) and Moscow Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (KI-ITEP). It is intended for future experiments with heavy ions near the Coulomb barrier within super-heavy element (SHE) research and aims at developing a linac with multiple CH cavities as key components downstream the High Charge State Injector (HLI) at GSI. The design is challenging due to the requirement of intense beams in CW mode up to a mass-to-charge ratio of 6, while covering a broad output energy range from 3.5 to 7.3 MeV/u with minimum energy spread. In 2017 the first superconducting section of the linac has been successfully commissioned and extensively tested with beam at GSI. In the light of experience gained in this research so far, the beam dynamics layout for the entire linac has recently been updated and optimized with particular emphasis on realistic assumptions of cavity gap and drift lengths as well as gap voltage distributions for CH3’CH11.

MESA is a two pass energy recovery linac (ERL) currently under construction at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz. MESA uses four 1.3 GHz TESLA type cavities with 12.5 MV/m of accelerating gradient in two modified ELBE type cryomodule with improved thermal connection of the HOM antennas and cw operation. In the first stage of MESA operation 1mA of beam current is foreseen, which will later be upgraded to 10mA. One potential limit to maximum beam current in ERLs is the transverse beam breakup (BBU) instability induced by dipole Higher Order Modes (HOMs). These modes can be excited by bunches passing through the cavities off axis. Following bunches are then deflected by the HOMs, which results in even larger offsets for recirculated bunches. This feedback can even lead to beam loss. Simulation results for HOM spectra of a single TESLA cavity are available for example in *. It was possible to measure the HOM spectra in the cold, not tuned cavities at DESY and in the cold string tuned to the 1.3 GHz fundamental mode at Mainz. Results for the maximum beam current for MESA, limited by BBU, for the various HOM spectra are presented.

There is a matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe that can not be explained by the Standard Model of particle physics. To resolve that problem additional CP violating phenomena are needed. A candidate for an additional CP violating phenomenon is a non-vanishing Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of subatomic particles. Since permanent EDMs violate parity and time reversal symmetries, they also violate CP if the CPT-theorem holds. The Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigation (JEDI) Collaboration works on a direct measurement of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of protons and deuterons using a storage ring. The JEDI experiment requires a small beam orbit RMS in order to measure the EDM. Therefore an ongoing upgrade of the Cooler Syncrotron (COSY) is done in order to improve the precision of the beam position. One of part of this upgrade is to determine the magnetic center of the quadrupoles with respect to the beam position monitors. This can be done with the so called beam-based alignment method. The first results of the beam-based alignment measurement performed in February 2019 will be presented.

SINBAD (Short and INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility will host multiple experiments relating to ultra-short high brightness beams and novel experiments with ultra-high gradient. ARES (Accelerator Research Experiment at SINBAD) Linac is an S-band photo injector to produce such electron bunches at around 100 MeV. The Linac will be commissioned in stages with the first stage corresponding to gun commissioning. In this paper, we present studies about the scheme adopted for the alignment of focusing solenoid for the ARES gun. The method is bench marked using ASTRA simulations. Moreover the effect of misalignment of the solenoid on the emittance of space charge dominated scheme and its compensation is also discussed.

A novel approach to transverse resonance suppression in next generation high-intensity accelerators is the use of nonlinear optical elements to induce large tune spreads which result in reduced responses to resonance driving perturbations*. In order to test this theory, we have built and characterized an octupole channel insert for use in the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). This paper presents experimental lattice studies using a low space-charge intensity beam at an energy of 10keV with a beam current of ~150uA, tune depression < 0.005, and unnormalized RMS emittance of 4.3 mm-mr. We apply beam based measurement techniques in order to evaluate the quality of our single-invariant lattice and better understand the nonlinearities created by the octupole channel.

This work will describe Fermilab experiments that focus on the optimization of doping parameters to achieve low sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux while maintaining very high Q characteristic of nitrogen doped cavities and same or higher quench fields. Working partially in the context of LCLS-2 higher energy upgrade, new doping recipes are pursued and have been found to vary the mean free path of the resonator which is related to the sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux. Moreover, a correlation has been found between lighter doping and higher quench fields while maintaining sufficiently low surface resistance.

The commissioning of the ESR with a new control system based on the LSA (LHC System Architecture) has started recently. This new control system is under development and considers all aspects of the expected functionality to operate the GSI/FAIR accelerators and incorporates the present GSI controls infrastructure*. Two years ago, the old control system which was based on outdated computers and operating system, was discontinued. So, both the heavy ion synchrotron SIS-18 and the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) operation from now on have to be performed with the new FAIR control system. In order to introduce an improved model to the control system change, new calculations and simulations for SIS and ESR are necessary. In this paper we summarize the results of closed orbit calculations for the ESR which are done with three different codes, namely: ELEGANT*, MAD-X and MIRKO. Also, because the results of ELEGANT and MAD-X in this issue are similar to each other, we present ELEGANT results in the report.

One of the limiting factors of electron beam lifetime in low emittance storage rings is Head-Tail (HT) insta-bility. Low emittance storage rings typically have a large negative natural chromaticity due to the strong quadru-poles. Above transition large negative natural chroma-ticity leads to large Head-Tail instability which limit the beam lifetime. Since the threshold current of HT insta-bility is directly related to linear chromaticity, increasing the linear chromaticity to slightly positive value is a solution to prevent HT instability. In this paper we in-creased the chromaticity of Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) to (+4, +4) and we will investigate the beam dy-namics of ILSF 3GeV storage ring in high chromaticity. For reaching this aim we have used two families of sex-tupoles for chromaticity correction and then optimized them to maximize the dynamic aperture and Touschek lifetime. The beam dynamics of high chromaticity lattice is presented in this paper.

A beam position monitor (BPM) is a common device used in particle accelerators to measure the position of a beam of charged-particles. The goal of this project is to simulate and build prototype of different parts to be used for IPM low energy electron Linac being developed at Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences. The IPM low energy electron Linac will initially be operated at a 7𝜇sec pulse duration and 250 Hz repetition rate with 2.998 GHz bunching frequency. A 4.5-MeV electron beam will be available in the second phase of commissioning. The device is composed of two pickup S-band cavities and a detection circuit to read out the electron beam’s position. The electrode pickup sensors will sense the mode strength generated by the passing beam of electrons. The working modes are TM110 (dipole) for the so called position cavity and TM010 (monopole) for the reference cavity. When the beam crosses the two cavity gaps it induces signals proportional to the product of charge and position offset in the position cavity, and to the charge only in the reference cavity. the position cavity has four rectangular waveguides that couple to the dipole mode while rejecting the monopole mode that would otherwise limit the resolution of the electronics. This signal will be input to a detection circuit that will be used to calculate the signals detected by four antennas arranged. A 180 degree hybrid at the first stage reduce the monopole and a heterodyne receiver principle was used to down-convert the signal frequency in about MHz IF frequency. These signals can then be used to determine the beam’s displacement from the center.

In this study, the idea 99Mo production using hybrid method based on electron accelerator has been pre-sented. Two different main production channels of 100Mo(γ,n)99Mo and 98Mo(n,γ)99Mo can be used for 99Mo production in this system. By considering high power Linac (30 MeV, 1 mA in average beam current) and one-stage approach, the calculation of 100Mo(γ,n)99Mo reactions in the optimized 100Mo target in two different designs (strip and disc) has been simu-lated. It is predicted that about 61 and 53 Ci of 99Mo activity per 24-hour irradiation on the strip target and the disc plates can be achieved, respectively. The threshold energy of photoneutron at 100Mo is about 9 MeV, so a large part of bremsstrahlung photons cannot participate in photoneutron reaction. For feasibility study, new hybrid approach has been tested by 10 MeV Rhodotron. Due to the low threshold of photo-neutron in deuteron (about 2.2 MeV) and significant low energy photons in 100Mo, photoneutron flux is available. So, Molybdenum target in heavy water Tank increases the production yield of 99Mo using neutron absorption reaction in 98Mo. The total activity of 99Mo has been predicted about 0.23 Ci per 24 hours e-beam irradiation.

Ultra high-gradient accelerating structures are needed for the next generation of compact light sources. In the framework of the Compact Light XLS project, we are studying a high harmonic traveling-wave accelerating structure operating at a frequency of 35.982 GHz, in order to linearize the longitudinal space phase. In this paper, we propose a new analytical approach for the estimation of the group velocity in the structure and we compare it with numerical electromagnetic simulations that are carried out by using the code HFSS in the frequency domain.

Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) screens are widely used for beam profile measurements. The radiation is emitted when a charged particle beam crosses the boundary between two media with different optical properties. The main advantages of OTR are the instantaneous emission process allowing fast single shot measurements (i.e. bunch by bunch measurements in a multi bunch machine), and the good linearity with the beam charge (if coherent effects can be neglected). Furthermore, OTR angular distribution strongly depends on beam energy. Since OTR screens are typically placed in several positions along the Linac to monitor beam envelope, one may perform a distributed energy measurement along the machine: this will be useful, for instance, during the commissioning phase of a machine. This paper deals with the studies of an algorithm to optimize the generation and the transport of the transition radiation through an optic system using the simulation tool Zemax. The algorithm, in combination with a particle tracking code (i.e. Elegant), will allow to simulate the radiation generated by a beam and, so, to take into account beam divergence and energy spread or chromatic effects in the optic system.

Operation of modern particle accelerators require high qualitity beams and conseguently sensitive diagnostic system in order to monitories and characterize the beam during the acceleration and transport. A turn-key high level software BOLINA (Beam Orbit for Linear Accelerators) has been developed to fully characterise the 6D beam phase space in order to help operator during commissioning with an easily scalable suite for any high brightness LINAC. In this work will be presented the diagnostic toolkit is presented as designed for the ELI-NP Gamma Beam System (GBS) a radiation source based on the Compton back scattering effect able to provide tunable gamma rays in the 0.2-20 MeV range with narrow bandwidth (0.3% and a high spectral density (104 photons/sec/eV) by the Compton backscattering effect. BOLINA suite is design to be machine independent, thanks to the file exchanges with the EPICS based control system. Simulation of raw data of the ELI-NP-GBS accelerator has been used to test the capabilities of the diagnostic toolkit.

The Local power distribution system (LPDS) of the In-ternational Linear Collider (ILC) is constructed to transmit RF power from the 10 MW klystron to 39 cavi-ties. Each eight or nine 9-cell cavities is assembled in one cryomodule. The variable hybrid is used to adjust the power dividing ratio due to the different required power of each cavity and the variable phase shifter is used to compensate the phase drift caused by the variable hybrid. More compact LPDS is expected to be integrated on the cryomodule decreasing financial cost. We re-design the shorter variable hybrid with a margin of power ratio of ±25% and phase shifter of total phase range being 35° for compensating hybrid and on-crest searching. Fixed phase shifters are designed to adjust the phase difference between adjacent cavities for beam acceleration. Simu-lated results of total compact LPDS can meet the re-quirements of ILC.

The beam dynamics at the interaction point (IP) in the accelerators which has the nano-beam scheme like as SuperKEKB is extremely sensitive for skewed error of final focusing magnets (QCS). As proceeding the beta squeezing in the interaction region (IR), the effect of optics aberrations at IP is enhanced. In the SuperKEKB Phase-2 commissioning, there was the problem come from skewed quadrupole fields in IR. The dominant skew parameters ‘‘R" for this problem is very hard to see directly by using beam position monitors, thus it was corrected by scanning R parameters. In the next commissioning Phase-3 which is just before the operation with the Belle II experiment, it is planned that the IP beta squeezing is going forward to design parameters which is smaller than it achieved in Phase-2 by the factor of 4 (for horizontal beta) and 10 (for vertical beta). Hence the effect of skew error will be considerable larger and it is estimated that skew sextupoles will emerge as a serious cause for the aberration from the orbit. This report is the study of analysis and correction results for the effect of QCS skewed errors in the SuperKEKB commissioning.

Collinear beam-driven structure wakefield acceleration (SWFA) is an advanced acceleration technique that could support the compact generation of high-energy beams for future multi-user x-ray free-electron-laser facilities*. Producing an ideal shaped drive beam through phase space manipulation is crucial for an efficient SWFA. Controlling the final longitudinal-phase space of the drive beam necessitate staged beam manipulations during acceleration. This paper describes the preliminary design of an accelerator beamline capable of producing drive beam with tailored current distribution and longitudinal-phase-space correlation. The proposed design is based on simple analytical models combined in a 1-D longitudinal beam-dynamics simulation tracking program supporting forward and backward (time reversal) tracking.

An inter-digital H-mode drift-tube linac (IH-DTL) is developed in a muon linac at the J-PARC E34 experiment. IH-DTL will accelerate muons from 0.34 MeV to 4.5 MeV at a drive frequency of 324 MHz. Since IH-DTL adopts an APF method, with which the beam is focused in the transverse direction using the RF field only, the proper beam matching of the phase-space distribution is required before the injection into the IH-DTL. Thus, an IH-DTL prototype was fabricated to evaluate the performance of the cavity and beam transmission. As a preparation of the high-power test, a test coupler is designed and fabricated. In this paper, the development of the coupler and the result of the low-power measurement will be presented.

A new experiment at J-PARC (E34) is under construction in order to measure the muon’s g-2 to unprecedented precision of 0.1 ppm and electric dipole moment up to the sensitivity of 10-21 e.cm in order to explore new physics beyond the standard model. A novel three-dimensional spiral injection scheme has been devised to inject and store the beam into a small diameter MRI-type storage magnet for E34. The new injection scheme features smooth injection with high storage efficiency for the compact storage magnet. However, spiral injection scheme is an unproven idea, therefore, a Spiral Injection Test Experiment (SITE) is underway to establish this injection scheme. The SITE is consist of 80 keV thermionic electron gun, two-meter-long beamline, and a solenoidal storage magnet. In order to match the beam with the solenoidal field, several optical elements have been placed on the beamline to control the beam phase space. The DC electron beam spiral track has been confirmed by the de-excitation of the nitrogen gas in the vacuum chamber of the storage magnet. A current monitor system has been developed in order to extract the beam current and geometrical information of three-dimensional trajectory. An electric chopper system to produce the pulsed beam and beam monitors to detect the pulsed beam will also be discussed in this paper.

A variable polarized THz light source using a crossed-undulator configuration has been developed at Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH), Tohoku University. It consists of two planar undulators of which deflecting planes cross at right angles and a phase shifter for phase adjustment. Polarization of the crossed-undulator has observation angle dependence due to that of radiation wavelength and optical path length difference between two radiations. That limits an angular range maintaining the identical polarization state. Assuming undulator parameters for our experiment (a fundamental frequency 1.9 THz and a number of periods seven) degree of circular polarization larger than 0.9 can be obtained only in the range of 2.2 mrad, i. e. 13% of the radiation angular spread.

Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) Main Ring (MR), the world-class high intensity proton synchrotron, provides proton beam to two experimental facilities with two extraction modes: Fast extraction (FX) and Slow extraction (SX). The number of protons per pulse (ppp) in MR recorded the world highest value of 2.6×1014 in the FX mode. Now we are planning to increase the ppp further up to 3.3×1014 in near future. The beam profile is one of the most important parameters to discuss the high intensity beam dynamics in MR. Monitors using multi-wires / ribbons are effective to measure the beam profile with good accuracy and wide dynamic range. However, they cause significant beam losses by interactions with high-intensity circulating beam in synchrotrons. Recently, we installed new multi-ribbon profile monitor (MRPM) in an abort line in MR. The abort line is one of the extracted beam lines of the FX system. It has a quadrupole doublet which is called Abort Q and transports extracted beam to a beam dump. The FX system can extract the circulating beam in MR with an arbitrary energy. Performing the single-pass measurement with MRPM and changing the transfer matrix by sweeping field strength of Abort Q, the emittance of the extracted beam can be measured. In this paper, we present the design, manufacturing, and results of the first beam test of newly installed MRPM system.

J-PARC E34 experiment intends to measure the anomalous magnetic moment and electric dipole moment of muon precisely by a different way from the previous experiment. In this experiment, a low-emittance muon beam is provided using the muons with the thermal energy and the four-stage linac. The demonstration of the first muon RF acceleration with an RFQ linac was conducted and the transverse profile of the accelerated muons was measured last year. As one of the remaining issues for the beam-diagnostic system, the longitudinal beam profile after the RFQ should be measured to match the profile to the designed acceptance of the subsequent accelerator. For this purpose, the new longitudinal beam monitor using the micro-channel plate is under development. The time resolution aims to be around 30 to 40 ps corresponding to 1 % of a period of an operation frequency of the accelerator, which is 324 MHz. On November 2018, the bunch structure of accelerated muons of 89 keV with the RFQ was measured using this monitor at the J-PARC MLF. The latest analysis result of this measurement will be reported in this poster.

We present a novel RF design for a field enhanced electron source driven by field emission cathodes. The proposed electron source relies on the enhanced high electric field gradients at the cathode to simultaneously extract and accelerate electrons. The system will be tested in a conduction-cooled superconducting radio-frequency cavity recently demonstrated at Fermilab. In this paper, we present electromagnetic and thermal simulations of the setup that support the feasibility of the design.

Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) is a promising method for cooling very dense stored particle beams through the interference of radiation created in an upstream ’pickup’ wiggler and a downstream ’kicker’ wiggler. By correlating a particle’s path length via a bypass between the two wigglers with its betatron coordinates in the pickup, the particle will receive a kick in energy which, through coupling introduced by non-zero horizontal dispersion in the kicker, can reduce its betatron amplitude, thus cooling the beam. A proof-of-principle test of this technique is being planned at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). In addition to maintaining standard requirements such as a large dynamic aperture and acceptable lattice functions throughout the ring, the design of the bypass is guided by the mutually competing goals of maximizing the cooling rate while maintaining a sufficiently large cooling acceptance with properly-corrected nonlinearities. We present a design of such a bypass and ring optics so as to best achieve these objectives.

The beam profile monitor is needed for measuring one of the beam parameters of high intensity accelerator to avoid radioactivating the systems. A monitor with sheet-shaped gas that can measure the beam profile nondestructively in two dimensions is developing. One of issues to introduce the monitor in accelerator is that the gas distribution is not uniform. Obtaining correct beam profile data needs to measure the gas distribution data because signal from the monitor is in proportion to beam intensity and gas distribution. A system analyzing distribution of ions produced from the gas using electron beam to measuring gas distribution in three dimensions is developing. An electron gun that produces ideal narrow beam, electrodes that forms parallel electric field toward micro-channel plate(MCP), and phosphor constitute the system. The electron beam that ionizes the gas which needs to be measured, produced ions are induced to MCP, and image on phosphor gives gas distribution data. In preliminary experiment for inspecting the measuring principle, experimental results agreed with simulation. The details of this system and the results of gas measuring experiment are reported.

Muon linac is developed for the muon g-2/EDM experiment at J-PARC. In this experiment, ultra slow muon is accelerated to a momentum of 300 MeV/c with the four linac structures. This scheme offers new opportunity for precise measurements; it enables us to reverse muon polarization at early stage of acceleration. The reversal of polarization is a common method of precision polarization measurements as it can be used to identify or reduce systematic uncertainties dependent on time. It is necessary to accelerate muons and flip its spin without substantial emittance growth for the experimental requirement. As one of the candidates for our spin rotator, we are developing the Wien-filter type. In this poster, the design of the Wien-filter type spin rotator for the low emittance muon beam will be presented.

J-PARC Main Ring (MR) is the intensity-frontier proton accelerator. The beam intensity of 2.6×1014 protons per pulse has been achieved for the current user operation. In this high-intensity operation, the tune spread caused by the space-charge is one of the main reasons for beam loss. The modulation of the betatron function and the tune shift were simulated with a PIC algorithm calculation code*. The simulation results showed that the space-charge effects were dominant in small particle action, and the sextupole fields effects were dominant in large particle action. Because sextupole strength is large in MR, sextupole fields induce substantial tune shifts. At the benchmark of the space-charge simulation, the simulation results matched the analytical space-charge calculations performed without sextupoles. It was found that the betatron function was modulated at most 6% by the space-charge effects and at most 8% by the effects of sextupoles in J-PARC MR. These effects to the injection beam optics matching and to the beam aperture will be investigated.

The J-PARC E34 experiment aims to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the electric dipole moment with a high precision. In this experiment, ultra-slow muons generated from thermal muonium production and laser resonance ionization are accelerated in a multistage muon linac. In order to satisfy the experimental requirements, a suppression of the emittance growth between different accelerating cavities is necessary, and the transverse and longitudinal beam matching is important. Longitudinal beam monitor has to measure the bunch width with a precision of 1% corresponding to several tens of picoseconds. In addition, the beam monitor should be sensitive to a single muon, because the beam intensity during the commissioning is lower than the designed intensity. Therefore, we are developing a longitudinal beam monitor using a microchannel plate (MCP), and a measurement system using photoelectrons to estimate the performance of the beam monitor. On November 2018, the beam monitor has been successfully used in the muon RF acceleration test at the J-PARC. In this presentation, the results of the performance evaluation for this beam monitor are reported.

A complex collimation system is installed in the Large Hadron Collider to protect sensitive equipment from unavoidable beam losses. The collimators are positioned close to the beam in the form of a hierarchy, which is guaranteed by precisely aligning each collimator with a precision of a few tens of micrometers. During past years, collimator alignments were performed semi-automatically*, such that collimation experts had to be present to oversee and control the alignment. In 2018, machine learning was introduced to develop a new fully-automatic alignment tool, which was used for collimator alignments throughout the year. This paper discusses how machine learning was used to automate the alignment, whilst focusing on the operational results obtained when testing the new software in the LHC. Automatically aligning the collimators decreased the alignment time at injection by a factor of three whilst maintaining the accuracy of the results.

The ultrafast electron microscope provides a useful tool for exploring fine structure and observing dynamic process at nanometer and picosecond scale, which has been extensively applied in chemistry and biological field. After emitting from the electron gun, electron beams are focused on the stage sample by the condenser system and then be projected by the imaging system on the screen. In the present study, a two-lens condenser system is simulated by Parmela and a three-lens imaging system is designed using thin-lens approximation. Besides, the shape factor of metallic spheres which have different radius for perturbation method is measured, which is conductive to measuring the Z/Q parameter and the electric field along the axis of the C-band 3MeV photocathode gun for the UEM.

A general harmonic generation and bunch length manipulation scheme using transverse-longitudinal coupling is presented. The method makes use of the freedom in projecting the three beam eigen-emittances into different physical dimensions. A realization of this coupling lattice, a PEHG variant, is given as an example. For the purpose of harmonic generation and bunch compression, this method is advantageous when the transverse emittance is small. The combination with sawtooth waveform modulation is proposed to boost the bunching further. Transverse-longitudinal coupling in storage rings are briefly discussed.

Ti-Zr-V non-evaporable getter (NEG) films have been widely used in vacuum chambers of various accelerators since their discovery. Recently, we have used a new method called ’quantitative deposition’ to deposit Ti-Zr-V NEG films on nichrome substrates. The surface morphology and surface chemical bonding information were collected by scanning electron microscopy. Although the film deposited by DC magnetron sputtering has more uniform grain growth, smoother grain boundaries and higher porosity, the two films all have porous network structure and can be used as getter films.

By seeding with narrow-band Cherenkov radiation from a dielectric loaded waveguide(DLW), stimulated excitation in an optical cavity is presented. The evolution and energy loss of the field oscillating in optical cavity is analysed by the theoretical and numerical calculation. The results show that the high order TM modes of the Cherenkov radiation can be better preserved after a large number of roundtrips in the optical cavity and this scheme offers a potential method of realizing high power Terahertz radiation source in a compact facility.

Proton beam with energies less than 10 MeV, <1% energy spread, several to tens of pC charge can be stably produced and transported in Compact LAser Plasma Accelerator (CLAPA) at Peking University. The CLAPA beam line is an object-image point analysing system, which ensures the transmission efficiency and energy selection accuracy for proton beams with initial large divergence angle and energy spread. A spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) is produced with high precision beam control, which is essential for cancer therapy. Other primary application experiments based on laser-accelerated proton beam have also been carried out, such as proton radiograph, stress testing for tungsten, irradiation of semi-conductor sensor to simulate the space irradiation environment and so on.

Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) is a powerful tool to investigate the dynamic structure with temporal scale of 100 femtoseconds and spatial scale of atomic length. To achieve high quality diffraction patterns, the transverse emittance and the longitudinal length of electron bunches should be reduced. MeV UED, using photocath-ode RF gun instead of traditional DC gun, is being developed to produce high quality electron bunches with lower emittance and shorter length. We are developing a MeV UED facility based on a 1.4 cell photocathode RF gun that can provide higher acceleration gradient at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the MeV UED is pro-posed with typical parameters of the system, as well as the ASTRA simulation results of optimization.

This paper reports the study and demonstration of a new variable temporal shaping method capable of generating linearly polarized picosecond laser pulses with arbitrary predefined shapes, which are highly desired by various applications including low emittance high brightness electron bunch generation in photocathode guns. It is found that both high transmittance and high stability of the shaped pulses can be achieved simultaneously when crystals are set at specific phase delay through the fine control of the crystal temperature. Such variable temporal shaping technique may lead to new opportunities for many potential applications over a wide range of laser wavelengths, pulse repetition rates, time structures and power levels, etc. In addition, a new double-pass variable shaping method is also proposed and could significantly simplify the shaper structure and reduce the cost.

A 32-beam klystron working at 5.712 GHz has been designed with efficiency of 70% and output power of 3.4 MW. Core oscillations method (COM) is chosen to bunch electrons. The code KlyC is used for 1-D and 1.5-D calculation and a series of parameters are given after optimizing, including the position, frequency, R/Q, Q0 and Qe of cavities. CST/PIC is used to make the final design and coaxial cavities are used. This paper describes 1-D, 1.5-D and 3-D beam dynamics of the klystron, compares their differences, and analyses effect of these differences on efficiency.

An alternative klystron-based scenario for the first stage of Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) at 380 GeV centre-of-mass energy was proposed. To preserve the beam stability and luminosity of CLIC, the beam-induced transverse long-range wakefield in main linac must be suppressed to an acceptable value. The design of klystron-based accelerating structure is based on waveguide damping structure (WDS). The high-order modes (HOMs) propagating into four waveguides are absorbed by HOM damping loads. In this paper, the wakefield suppression in CLIC-K based on GdfidL code simulations are presented.

High energy photon source is a fourth-generation synchrotron radiation light source with energy of 6Gev and ultra-low emittance (<0.1nm’rad). The ultra-low beam emittance requires high beam stability. Therefore, we develop a fast correction power supply with high bandwidth and low current ripple to improve the performance of the fast close orbit correction sys-tem to prove the high beam stability. The power supply adopts FPGA for full-digital control and use high speed ADC with temperature control. The power sup-ply has a small signal-bandwidth of 10 kHz and output current ripple lower than 20ppm. In this paper, we will describe the hardware design and software control methods and the test results will be demonstrated

The CiADS (China initiative Accelerator Driven System) proton Linac is designed to accelerate CW beams of up to 500 MeV and 5mA, which is delivered to the spallation target. Since the beam power will eventually reach 2.5 MW, the beam loss should be restricted, which is sensitive to the SC cavity stability. On CW operating mode, the main perturbation to the cavity is microphonics. This paper will describe a set of tools developed to simulate performance of the cavity and its LLRF control system in order to ensure proper cavity operation under microphonics. The simulation tools describe a relationship between microphonics and the RF parameters. The microphonics effect to the cavity is simulated. The tolerated intensity of microphonics is determined by simulation, in order to satisfy the stability of amplitude and phase with 0.1% and 0.1 degree respectively.

A compact room-temperature injector is designed to accelerate 20 mA proton beam from 30 keV to 7.0 MeV for the purpose of Proton Synchrotron Linear Injector for Proton Therapy. The main feature of this linac injector is that the 4-vane Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and the Drift Tube Linac (DTL) section are matched by one triplet and powered by one RF power source. The beam is matched from the first RFQ section to the second DTL section in traverse and longitudinal directions. The overall accelerating gradient of this design has reached up to 1.6 MV/m with transmission efficiency of 96%.This injector combines a 3 m long 4-vane RFQ from 30 keV to 3.0 MeV with a 0.8 m long H-type DTL section to 7.0 MeV. In general, the design meets the requirements of the Pro-ton Synchrotron and the Terminal treatment.

Hefei Advanced Light Source (HALS) is the fourth generation light source in China’s planning and construction. In order to achieve the diffraction limit of the emission and improve the beam quality, the research on magnet power supply (MPS) technology is essential. We have designed a variety of solutions for different power supplies. We designed the first version of the high stability power supply control card. The first version of the high-stability power supply control card was designed and tested with a small power module. Our pre-research system has developed a corrector magnet power supply with a small signal response bandwidth higher than 10 kHz. The developed power prototypes all use self-developed controllers, and most of the test results can meet the requirements. This article describes the progress of the HALS power supply system.

Recent research indicates that ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy (UED/M) have unprecedented potential in probing ultrafast dynamic processes, especially in organic and biological materials. However, reaching the required brightness while maintaining high spatiotemporal resolution requires new design of electron source. In order to produce ultrashort electron beam with extreme high brightness, a 1.4-cell RF gun is being developed to reach higher acceleration gradient near the photocathode and thus suppress the space charge effect in the low energy region. Simulation of the 1.4-cell RF photocathode gun shows considerable improvement in bunch length, emittance and energy spread, which all lead to better temporal and spatial resolution comparing to traditional 1.6-cell RF photocathode gun. The results demonstrate the feasibility of sub-ps temporal resolution with normalized emittance less than 0.1 πmm·mrad while maintaining 1 pC electron pulse.

A 100MHz QWR superconducting cavity is researched in the pre-research project of Hefei Advanced Light Source (HALS). Higher order modes (HOM) damping is a big challenge for synchrotron radiation light source. In this paper, we first apply the novel choke mode structure to the 100MHz QWR (quarter wave resonator) cavity in order to damp the HOM. We identify the main harmful higher order modes. The HOMs in the QWR cavity are suppressed by optimizing the choke dimensions. The broadband HOM impedance spectrum of the cavity was also evaluated by calculating the beam induced wake potential in time domain. The results show that choke mode structure has a good HOM damping effect on the QWR cavity.

Laser treatment has a significant inluent on suppressing the secondary electron emission(SEE). The new synchrotron radiation light source, the Hefei Advanced Light Source(HALS) has a strict requirement on the SEE. In this paper, we used a 355nm laser to process copper sample. After the laser treatment, the secondary electron yield(SEY) reduced from 2.05 to 0.86. We used the scanning electron microscope(SEM) to analysis the surface of sample after the laser treatment.

We propose to generate two narrow band terahertz pulses radiated from two temporally modulated relativistic electron beams, which are generated in a photo-injector. The temporal profile of the drive laser is modulated by means of the paired chirped pulses beating technique, leading to the generation of two pre-bunched electron beams. Coherent transient radiation (CTR) is considered as the mechanism for terahertz radiation generation. The frequencies of the two terahertz pulses can be independently tuned by adjusting the paired beating frequencies, and the interval between the two terahertz pulses can be adjusted by the optical delay line.

We demonstrate a simple way to introduce a femtosecond pre-pulse with adjustable intensity and delay without using an additional compressor to enhance laser-driven proton acceleration. Targets with different thicknesses were shoot at normal incidence by varying the pre-pulses. Experimental results show that significant enhancement on the proton energy can be achieved when the intensity of pre-pulse is optimized. Density profile of preplasma was obtained by bydrodynamic simulations. PIC simulations reveal that the preplasma generated by a femtosecond pre-pulse can increase the intensity of main pulse.

In a very high energy e+/e− storage ring collider, e.g. Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), the dynamic aperture is limited by the strong synchrotron radiation especially in the vertical direction. Some tracking results also shows that the beam lifetime does not correspond well to the dynamic aperture. Here we develop a method called diffusion map analysis, aiming to describe the beam distribution diffusion in transverse amplitude space by tracking less turns. The diffusion may come from quantum fluctuation of SR, beamstrahlung effect and nonlinearity. Comparing cases with different configuration of sextupoles, the diffusion map analysis presents good consistency with beam lifetime that needs much more turns of tracking. Constraints based on the diffusion map is applied to our dynamic aperture optimization, which could help us achieve enough long beam lifetime.

The dual harmonic RF system will be adapted for Chi-na Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) upgrade project. Limited locations in CSNS/RCS are reserved to install additional three 2nd harmonic cavities. The cavity loaded by magnetic alloy (MA) material would be used. Because of the low Q factor of the MA core, the cavity cooling be-comes a very important issue in cavity design. Air-forced, indirect and direct cooling scheme were studied. The fluid thermodynamic of different cooling structure were simu-lated by ANSYS CFX which considered the anisotropy of thermal conductivity of MA core. The limitation of these cooling schemes were discussed in detail based on the simulation results. Indirect cooling experiment was done to assess the cooling efficiency and verify the simulation result. A high power test cavity cooled by water has been designed to estimate the property of the MA core and cooling effectiveness for CSNS/RCS.

Orbit correction is usually an important task in the operation of accelerators. In practice, due to various errors, many devices can not operate in ideal state. By correcting the errors of magnets with corrector magnets, the beam can return to the correct position to ensure the stable operation of the accelerator. In the process of orbit correction, inaccurate BPM output will lead to incorrect correction magnet strength setting, so that the orbit correction will be impacted. BPM may make mistakes in the process of signal acquisition and current conversion. A BPM anomaly detection and predict method based on machine learning and its using in orbit correction optimization is reported in this paper. This method does not need to observe the details of BPM system, electronics technology and so on. It can monitor and predict the BPM status directly by machine learning with the information of the beam inferred from BPM and others, and optimize the orbit correction.

Generally, for a hybrid multi-bend-achromat (MBA) lattice with fixed linear optics, there is little potential to further optimize the nonlinear dynamics due to limited free knobs. To obtain a hybrid MBA lattice with better nonlinear dynamics performance, it is better to consider some indicators of nonlinear dynamics as objective functions in designing the linear optics using an optimization algorithm. In this paper, integral strengths of sextupoles and natural chromaticities are used as the nonlinear dynamics indicators, and different optimization methods with both or either of the two indicators are carried out and compared. As an example, a hybrid 7BA lattice with an energy of 2.4 GeV is designed towards an emittance of less than 70 pm·rad.

The Cyclotron Auto-Resonance Accelerator (CARA) is a novel concept of accelerating continuous-wave (CW) charged-particle beams. This type of accelerator has ap-plications in environment improvement area and genera-tion of high-power microwaves. In CARA, the CW elec-tron beam follows a gyrating trajectory while undergoing the interaction with a rotating TE11-mode RF field and tapered static magnetic field. The cylindrical cavity oper-ating at TE11p-mode is adapted to accelerate electron beam. The cavity size is optimized to obtain a beam with designed energy, then a design method of the TE11p-mode acceleration cavity is described here. Moreover, regard-less of space charge effect, several particle-tracking simu-lations of CARAs are showed.

In modern particle accelerators, the build-up of electron cloud is a main limiting factor for the achievement of high-quality beam. Among the techniques to mitigate it, coating the internal walls of the beam pipes with a thin film which has a low secondary electron yield (SEY) is considered to be one of the most effective means. From several earlier studies, it was found that diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films are potential coatings. This paper is mainly about the research on secondary electron emission characteristics of DLC thin films. The secondary electron emission (SEE) tests were done at temperature of 298 K and vacuum pressure of 2×10-9 Torr. Here, we obtained the characteristics of the SEE from DLC film coatings with different thickness under ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) conditions. The maximum secondary electron yield (SEY), δmax, of the DLC thin films under different primary electron doses were also obtained, respectively.

We propose a THz-pump and UV-probe scheme based on storage ring for ultra-fast dynamics experiment. In which, two sequential laser pulses, one of which has a periodic intensity envelope, simultaneously interact with different parts of the long electron beam in a modulator; after a chicane, the part that interacts with the periodic pulse will bunch at THz domain and radiate through a bend magnet, another based on high-harmonic generation will bunch at UV domain and radiate at a radiator. The electron beam can be utilized circularly in the storage ring, which will increase its average power. The feasibility of this THz-pump and UV-probe scheme is verified in both theory and simulation.

High energy electron imaging, an extension of conventional transmission electron microscopy, is suitable for imaging of thicker objects and expected to be a promising tool for diagnostics of high energy density physics (HEDP). A cascade high energy electron imaging system using two-stage imaging lenses based on strong permanent magnet quadrupoles is designed, optimized and finally installed at Tsinghua university. Encouraging result of 1.6-μm space resolution is obtained in our primary experiments, along with the clear imaging of a spherical capsule as a substitute of the targets used in inertial confinement fusion. Successful implement of cascade high energy electron imaging system is necessary for reaching better resolving power of the imaging system, and well matching of design, simulation with experimental results paves the way to high energy electron microscopy to provide full capacities for diagnostics of HEDP with sub-um and picosecond spatiotemporal resolutions.

A novel Bimodal Electron Gun is designed to apply microwaves at two harmonically-related frequency in a 0.6 cell RF gun to increase the RF breakdown threshold and enhance the beam quality. This stratagem is intended to allow the RF gun structure to support a high accelera-tion gradient as well as to manipulate the emittance evolution in the half cell. By selecting a proper ampli-tude ratio and phase relationship between the first and second harmonic RF field components in the gun cavity, the superposition of the harmonic field components can provide a flat-top like RF profile to omitting the RF emittance component in the gun, while increase the RF breakdown threshold. The recent status of the Bimodal Electron Gun R&D is presented, including the designs of the novel two frequency RF structure and the simulation of the beam dynamic.

We present the design study of the RF input power coupler for 325 MHz superconducting cavities. The power coupler, based on a conventional coaxial transmission line, provides RF powers to the cavity up to 12kW in CW mode. The thermal interceptors are considered as 4.5 K and 40 K or 4.5 K and 77 K corresponding to the usage of liquid Helium only or both liquid Helium and Nitrogen for cryogenic temperature to reduce the thermal load. The transition box (T-box), which is assembled with power coupler, is designed and applied for impedance matching and inner conductor cooling.

The research concerns the design of a drift tube linear accelerator (DTL) with permanent quadrupole magnets (PMQ) placed inside some of the drift tubes for focusing. The study was conducted using Comsol Multiphysics software, where electromagnetic fields and particle dy-namics in the cavity were calculated. The proton beam is accelerated up to 10 MeV. Initial beam is assumed to come from Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator (RFQ). Mathematical methods of control theory are used for particles dynamics optimization. Different focusing lattices are examined and variations of the gradient of the magnetic lenses are analyzed with respect to output beam parameters. Effectiveness of the optimization is estimated by the transmission rate and the emittance growth.

Field emitted electrons have important consequences in the operation of high-gradient RF accelerating structures both by generating so-called dark currents and initiating RF breakdown. The latter is an important limitation of the performance in such devices. Another kind of vacuum discharge that primarily affects the operation of lower-field RF components, for example those used in space applications, is multipactor. Theoretical simulations using CST Particle Studio, show that field emitted electrons generated in the high field regions of high-gradient accelerating cavities migrate to low field regions under ponderomotive forces potentially triggering multipactor there. This phenomenon is an interplay between high field and low field processes which may have as a consequence that multipactor actually affects to the performance of high-gradient cavities because field emitted electrons might reduce the timescales for the onset of multipactor.

OpenXAL is an open source multi-purpose accelerator physics software platform based on a pure Java open source development environment used for creating accelerator physics applications, scripts and services. Currently, the software has been used with an ellipsoidal (bunched) beam to account for space-charge effects. Applications developed so far for ESS, such as the Virtual Machine for the ESS Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) section, would profit from a DC beam description. In this paper, the space-charge component for a continuous beam is derived taking into account beams with different transverse charge distributions (uniform, gaussian, etc). The implementation in OpenXAL and a comparison with other simulation codes is also presented.

As the ECHO enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) scheme draws such intense focus from the FEL community, we conduct simulations to evaluate the challenges of implementing said scheme in different FEL layouts. Nonlinear processes such as this require extensive simulations to harmonize all system specific properties like seed lasers and electron beam properties. Along with optimizing the original EEHG scheme* one can consider, for example, altering the seed laser pulse to optimize the bunching for a machine specific chirp. We study the EEHG as a possible seeding method aimed at increasing coherence of the photon beam for the prospective SXL FEL beamline at MAXIV. The particular chirp of the electron beam through the MAXIV LINAC generates some specific requirements in implementing EEHG but may also offer an opportunity for exotic operation modes of this FEL.

Linacs for free-electron lasers typically require cavity field stabilities of 0.01\% and 0.01 degree, while the requirements for high-intensity proton linacs are on the order of 0.1–1\% and 0.1–1 degrees. From these numbers it is easy to believe that the field control problem for proton linacs is many times easier than for free-electron lasers linacs. In this contribution we explain why this is not necessarily the case, and discuss the factors that make field control challenging. We also discuss the drivers for field stability, and how high-level decisions on the linac design affect the difficulty of the field control problem.

The injection kicker system for the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) must satisfy demanding requirements. To achieve low pulse ripple and fast field rise and fall times, the injection system will use ferrite loaded transmission line type magnets. The beam coupling impedance of the kicker magnets is crucial, as this can be a dominant contribution to beam instabilities. In addition, interaction of the high intensity beam with the real part of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance can result in high power deposition in the ferrite yoke. This gives a significant risk that the ferrite yoke will exceed its Curie temperature: hence, a suitable beam screen will be a critical feature. In this paper, we present a novel concept - a spiral beam screen. The fundamental advantage of the new design is a significant reduction of the maximum voltage induced on the screen conductors, thus decreased probability of electrical breakdown. In addition, the longitudinal beam coupling impedance is optimized to minimize power deposition in the magnet.

Unsupervised learning includes anomaly detection techniques that are suitable for the detection of unusual events such as instrumentation faults in particle accelerators. In this work we present the application of decision trees-based algorithm to faulty BPMs detection at the LHC. This method achieves significant improvements in quality of optics measurements and allows to identify relevant signal properties that contribute to fault detection.

The effect of Landau damping is often calculated based on a Gaussian beam distribution in all degrees of freedom. The stability of the beam is however strongly dependent on the details of the distribution. The present study focuses on the change of bunch distributions caused by the decoherence of the excitation driven by an external source of noise, in the presence of both amplitude detuning and a transverse feedback. Both multiparticle tracking simulations and theoretical models show a similar change of the distribution. The possible loss of Landau damping driven by this change is discussed.

Simulations have shown that the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is sensitive to external dynamic magnetic fields (stray fields) to the nT level. Magnetic fields are not typically measured to this precision at CERN. Past measurements of the background magnetic field at CERN are limited. In this paper new measurements are presented.

Since in 2010 the first sub-millisecond beam losses were observed at varying locations all along the LHC, it is well known that dust can interact with high-intensity proton beams and cause significant beam losses. Initially the sudden localized losses were enigmatic and coined the phrase ’unidentified falling objects’ (UFOs), which is still widely used. These very fast beam losses have resulted in hundreds of premature beam dumps and even magnet quenches since the start of LHC. So far, the only mitigation strategy involved an optimization of dump thresholds and the beneficial conditioning effect which leads to a reduction of the UFO rate over time. To understand the physics involved in these events and to allow an active diminution, it is essential to know the chemical composition and the size of the dust particulates interacting with the protons. The exchange of a dipole magnet offered the unique opportunity to collect dust samples from inside the LHC vacuum system. They were extracted from the various components and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to reveal size distribution and abundant elements. The results of this investigation will optimize the existing UFO models and the improved understanding of the phenomenon may help to prevent future performance limitations. This is also of relevance for future projects, in particular for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) under study.

As part of the Future Circular Collider study, the High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) is a proposed hadron collider situated in the already existing LHC tunnel. It aims at achieving a center of mass energy of 27 TeV, almost doubling the design c.o.m. energy of the LHC. This increase in energy relies on the use of 16 T Nb3Sn dipoles to be developed for the FCC-hh. The field quality of these dipoles is expected to have a big impact on the Dynamic Aperture (DA) at injection energy and subsequently tracking studies are conducted to evaluate the impact of magnetic field errors on the beam dynamics. In the following the results of these studies for the different injection energies considered for the HE-LHC are presented and a possible strategy for increasing the DA are discussed.

Asymmetric ion beam collisions like proton-lead in the LHC or gold-deuteron in RHIC have become major components of heavy-ion physics programmes. The injection and ramp of two different ion species with the same magnetic rigidity and consequently unequal revolution frequencies generate moving long-range beam-beam encounters in the interactions regions of the collider. These encounters led to fast beam losses and can cause emittance blow-up as observed in RHIC in the early 2000s and, more recently, in 2015. Yet such effects are absent at the LHC so the difference between the two colliders requires explanation. Tools and models have been developed to describe the beam dynamics of moving long-range beam-beam encounters and to predict the evolution of emittance and other beam parameters. Besides presenting results for RHIC and the LHC we give an outlook for the HL-LHC and potential operational restrictions.

The High Energy Large Hadron Collider (HE-LHC), a possible successor of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) aims at reaching a centre-of-mass energy of about 27 TeV using basically the same 16 T dipoles as for the hadron-hadron Future Circular Collider FCC-hh. Designing the HE-LHC results in a trade off between energy reach, beam stay clear as well as geometry offset with respect to the LHC. In order to best meet the requirements, various arc cell and dispersion suppressor options have been generated and analysed, before concluding on two baseline options, which are presented in this paper. Merits of each design are highlighted and possible solutions for beam stay clear minima are presented.

The Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) at KEK is a prototype for the Final Focus Systems of the future e+e− linear colliders, the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). In this paper both simulation and experimental results are presented with special emphasis on intensity-dependent effects. The importance of these effects is shown using the PLACET code and realistic ATF2 machine simulations (including beam jitter, misalignment, wakefield, Beam Based Alignment (BBA) correction, …). The latest experimental results are also presented, in particular the impact of the beam intensity on the beam size at the IP.

In 2018, a large fraction of the physics data taking at the Large Hadron Collider has been performed with a beam energy of 6.5 TeV, the nominal bunch spacing of 25 ns and beta functions at the high luminosity interaction points of 30 cm. In order to maximize the integrated luminosity, the crossing angles are gradually reduced as the beam intensity reduces due to luminosity burn-off. In these conditions the beam lifetime is visibly affected by collective effects and in particular by beam-beam interaction and electron cloud effects. By analyzing the beam losses at a bunch-by-bunch level, it is possible to disentangle the contributions from different effects and to assess the impact on the losses of changes applied to the machine configuration.

High-gradient accelerating structures are known to produce field-emitted current from regions of high surface field, which are captured and accelerated by the fields within the structure. This current is routinely measured in structures under test in the CLIC high-gradient test stands using Faraday cups. This paper presents a novel technique to spatially resolve the longitudinal distribution of field emitted current by analysing downstream Faraday cup signals when the structure is fed with RF pulses much shorter than its filling time. Results from this method applied to X-band cavities operating at 100 MV/m are presented, and are compared to breakdown position distributions. A decay in emitted current as conditioning progressed in regions with a low breakdown rate and large jumps in regions with a large breakdown rate are observed.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade project the improvements required to achieve the parameters of the future beams for the High-Luminosity LHC are being studied and implemented. In order to deliver high brightness beams, control over the beam intensity and emittance is fundamental. Therefore, a highly accurate and reliable transverse emittance measurement is essential. Presently at the CERN Proton Synchrotron, the only operationally available emittance monitors not impacting the facility beam production are the flying wire scanners used to measure the circulating beam profile. The wire scanners will be replaced with a new generation in the next two years and a prototype is already installed. The prototype has been commissioned with beams featuring a wide range of intensities and emittances. This paper evaluates the performance of the prototype with respect to the present system via beam-based measurements. The transverse emittance measurement is discussed, considering the different potential error contributions to the measurement, such as knowledge of the machine optics and the dispersive contribution to the beam size.

Low proton beam intensities (0.1-40 nA) are used for medical treatment of tumours at the PROSCAN facility in Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). A cavity resonator using four quadrants operating in a dipole mode resonance has been developed to measure beam positions at these low intensities. The TM110 resonance frequency of 145.7 MHz is matched to the second harmonic of the beam pulse repetition rate (i.e.72.85 MHz). HFSS (High Frequency Structural Simulator) provides the BPM geometry and important parameters such as pickup position; dielectric dimensions etc. Comparison of test bench measurement and simulation provides good agreement. The measured position and signal sensitivity are limited by the noise, so that a position signal can be derived at beam intensities of at least 10 nA . We will discuss potential methods to increase the sensitivity. The dipole cavity resonator can be a promising candidate as a non-invasive position di-agnostic at the low proton beam intensities used in pro-ton therapy

The Beam Gas Vertex detector (BGV) is an innovative beam profile monitor being developed as part of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project at CERN. The goal is to continually measure the transverse beam size by reconstructing beam-gas interaction vertices using high precision tracking detectors. To confirm the feasibility of such a device, a demonstrator based on eight modules of scintillating fiber detectors has been constructed, installed in the LHC and operated for the past 3 years. It will be shown that using the BGV the average transverse beam size can be obtained with a statistical accuracy of better than 5µm (for a gaussian beam with a σ of 200µm). This precision is obtained with an integration time of less than one minute. In addition, the BGV measures the size of individual bunches with a statistical accuracy of better than 5% within 5 minutes. The results obtained from all the data gathered over the past 3 years will be presented and compared to measurements from other beam profile monitors. Some ideas for improvements for the final HL-LHC instrument will also be discussed.

The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre (CCC) in the UK is a particle therapy facility providing treatment for ocular cancers using a 60 MeV passively scattered proton therapy beam. A model of the beamline using the Monte Carlo Simulation toolkit Geant4 has been developed for accurate characterisation of the beam. In order to validate the simulation, a study of the beam profiles along the delivery system is necessary. Beam profile measurements have been performed at multiple positions in the CCC beam line using both EBT3 GAFchromic film and Medipix3, a single quantum counting chip developed specifically for medical applications, typically used for x-ray detection. This is the first time its performance has been tested within a clinical, high proton flux environment. EBT3 is the current standard for conventional radiotherapy film dosimetry and was used to determine the dose and for correlation to fluence measured by Medipix3. The count rate linearity and doses recorded with Medipix3 were evaluated across the full range of available beam intensities, up to 3.12 x 1010 protons/s. The applicability of Medipix3 for proton therapy dosimetry is discussed and compared against the performance of EBT3.

A design study for a future collider to be built in the LHC tunnel, the High-Energy Large Hadron Collider (HE-LHC), has been launched as part of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study at CERN. It would provide proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 27 TeV as well as collisions of heavy ions at the equivalent magnetic rigidity. HE-LHC is being designed under the stringent constraint of using the existing tunnel and therefore the resulting lattice and optics differ in layout and phase advance from the LHC. It is necessary to evaluate the performance of the collimation system for ion beams in HE-LHC in addition to proton beams. In the case of ion beams, the fragmentation and electromagnetic dissociation that relativistic heavy ions can undergo in collimators, as well as the unprecedented energy per nucleon of the HE-LHC, requires dedicated simulations. Results from a study of collimation efficiency for the nominal lead ion (Pb-82-208) beams performed with the SixTrack-FLUKA coupling framework are presented. These include loss maps with comparison against an estimated quench limit as well as detailed considerations of loss spikes in the superconducting aperture for critical sections of the machine such as the dispersion suppressors.

A model has been developed for simulating photon-particle interactions with Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM). BDSIM is a high energy physics program that utilises the Geant4, CLHEP, and ROOT libraries to seamlessly track particles through an accelerator. The photon-particle interactions introduce the capability for modelling a range of applications in accelerator physics. One such application is a laserwire which is a minimally invasive diagnostic technique to measure beam profiles and emittance. In this paper we describe the recent implementation of inverse Compton scattering and electron stripping of Hydrogen ions. This is demonstrated on an example beamline.

Externally injected electrons are captured and accelerated in the plasma wake of a self-modulated proton beam at the Advanced Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE) at CERN. The energy distribution of the accelerated electron beam is measured using a dipole spectrometer in combination with a scintillator screen, with two upstream quadrupoles providing energy-dependent focusing. Measuring the vertical beam size variation with horizontal position along the scintillator screen, and therefore energy, results in an effective quadrupole scan permitting single shot vertical geometric emittance measurements. Limitations of the method due to effects such as imperfect beam focusing and finite resolution are explored via simulations using the beam tracking code BDSIM.

The Cockcroft Beamline is being designed to transport 1 GeV electrons from a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) to an undulator at the Scottish Centre for the Application of Plasma-based Accelerators (SCAPA) in Glasgow, UK. To demonstrate undulator radiation in the X-ray spectral region and potentially free electron laser (FEL) gain, electrons should be transported between the LWFA and the undulators with high fidelity. In this paper we present the design of an adjustable beam line to transport LWFA electrons to the undulator for a range of energies, from 0.5 GeV to 1 GeV, while preserving the electron beam properties and matching the undulator-beam coupling.

Ultra-low emittance lattices are being studied for the future upgrade of the 2.75 GeV SOLEIL storage ring. The candidate baseline lattice was inspired by the ESRF-EBS-type Multi-Bend-Achromat (MBA) lattice, introducing a (-I) transformation to compensate the nonlinear impact of sextupoles thanks to the lattice symmetry and tight control of the betatron phase advance between sextupoles. Whilst the final performance is still being optimized, other types of lattices are being considered for SOLEIL: This includes the so-called High-Order Achromat (HOA) lattice. Though the (-I) scheme provides a large on-momentum transverse dynamic aperture in 4D, its off-momentum performance is rather limited. 6D studies reveal intrinsic off-momentum transverse oscillations which are likely to result from a nonlinear increase in path length. This contribution presents the effects from the inhomogeneous sextupole distribution in the (-I) scheme and compares them with the HOA lattice.

The injector for PERLE, a planned ERL test facility, must be capable of delivering 500 pC bunches at a repetition rate of 40.1 MHz to provide a beam with 20 mA average current with a projected rms emittance of less than 6 mm mrad. This must be achieved at two different operational voltages 350 kV and 220 kV for unpolarised and polarised operation respectively. The PERLE injector will be based on an upgrade of a DC photocathode electron gun operated previously at ALICE ERL at Daresbury. The upgrade will add a load lock system for photocathode interchange. This paper presents the results of a re-optimisation of the electrode system as ALICE operated with a bunch charge of around 80 pC while PERLE needs a bunch charge of 500 pC. This re-optimisation was done using the many-objective genetic algorithm NSGAIII to minimise both the slice emittance and transverse beam size for both required operational voltages.

Here we describe the design of an experimental setup using the IBEX Paul trap to test nonlinear quasi-integrable optics, an accelerator lattice design to create stable high intensity beams. In 2010 Danilov and Nagaitsev found a realisable nonlinear potential which can create integrable optics in an accelerator when embedded in a linear lattice that provides round beams. This concept will be tested in the IOTA ring at Fermilab. It is important to further test this concept over a wide parameter range, preferably in a simplified experimental setup such as IBEX. The IBEX Paul trap is capable of replicating the transverse dynamics of a high intensity accelerator without dispersion or chromaticity.

A high-resolution, low-latency stripline beam position monitor (BPM) signal processor has been developed for use in an intra-train feedback system for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). The processor was designed to have extremely low latency of order nanoseconds and a target position resolution of order 1 micron. The processor consists of a pair of diodes to form the difference and sum of a pair of stripline BPM inputs with microstrip filters to reduce out-of-band noise. The assembled prototype was optimized for use with the electron beam in the extraction line of the Accelerator Test Facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan but the underlying design is readily scaleable to a higher frequency response relevant for CLIC. A latency of 3 ns was measured in a testbench setup. We report the results of performance tests with beam in which the position resolution was measured to be c. 325 nm.

Very High-Energy Electron (VHEE) therapy is a rapidly developing field motivated by developments in high-gradient linacs. Advantages include sufficient penetration (>30 cm) for treatment of deep-seated tumours, measured insensitivity to inhomogeneities and rapid delivery time, making VHEE viable for treatment of heterogeneous regions, e.g. lung or bowel. Researchers at the University of Manchester and CERN have routinely produced accelerating gradients of ~100 MeV/m for the CLIC project. Suitable modification can result in a high gradient medical linac producing 250 MeV electrons within a treatment room. Radiobiological research for VHEE is vital to understand its use in radiotherapy and how it compares with conventional modalities. The goal of radiotherapy is to destroy tumour cells while sparing healthy cells, primarily by damaging DNA within the cancer cell. The study aim is to understand the fundamental interactions between VHEE and biological structures through plasmid irradiation studies - both computational, using the Monte Carlo GEANT4-DNA code, and experimental. Plasmid irradiation experiments have been carried out at using Co-60 gammas at the Dalton Cumbrian Facility and using 6-15 MeV electrons at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust to determine the type and quantity of damage caused to DNA by electron irradiation. These experiments are a world first in VHEE radiobiology, with further studies planned at higher energies using the CLARA and CLEAR facilities at Daresbury and CERN. These studies will also consider the effective dose range of VHEE with energy, as well as implications of damage on DNA. Research into this area of radiotherapy can provide a valuable addition to tools currently available to physicians in the fight against cancer.

A barrier bucket scheme is being considered to reduce losses during the Multi-Turn Extraction from the CERN Proton Synchrotron to the Super Proton Synchrotron for the fixed-target physics programme. For effective loss reduction, the extraction kicker has to be triggered during the gap at the time of the longitudinal barrier. Initial beam studies at injection energy and with low intensity beams allowed to fully qualify an existing wide-band cavity to generate one or multiple beam synchronous pulses per turn. Bunch-length stretching and shortening have been exercised with barriers moving in azimuth with respect to the beam. The encouraging results obtained at injection energy guided the implementation of a de-bunching manipulation at higher energy to move all bunches into a single barrier bucket. Beam measurements at a momentum of 14GeV/c, varying intensity and the width of the barrier, demonstrate that a quasi-constant longitudinal line density and an almost fully depleted gap can be achieved at highest intensities. The contribution summarises the results of the beam studies at high energy together with some observations related to the Multi-Turn Extraction.

A detailed model of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been built using Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM) for studying beam loss patterns and is presented and discussed in this paper. BDSIM is a program which builds a Geant4 accelerator model from generic components bridging accelerator tracking routines and particle physics to seamlessly simulate the traversal of particles and any subsequent energy deposition in particle accelerators. The LHC model described here has been further refined with additional features to improve the accuracy of the model, including specific component geometries, tunnel geometry, and more. BDSIM has been extended so that more meaningful comparisons with other simulations and data can be made. Firstly, BDSIM can now record losses in the same way that SixTrack does: when a primary exceeds the limits of the aperture it is recorded as a loss. Secondly, by placing beam loss monitors (BLMs) within the BDSIM model and recording the simulated dose and energy deposition, it can be directly compared with real BLM data. These results are presented here and compared with SixTrack and BLM data from a typical fill in 2018.

The study of magnetized electron beam has become a high priority for its use in ion beam cooling as part of Electron Ion Colliders and the potential of easily forming flat beams for various applications. The demand for high average current for effective ion beam cooling has caused consideration of using bunched magnetized electron beam produced by a gridded thermionic electron gun. This paper presents the design of a potential electron source for JCIEC first measurements characterizing the beam properties of a magnetized thermionic gun.

Algorithmic control of accelerators is an active area of research that promises significant improvements in machine performance. To facilitate rapid algorithm prototyping, we have developed a generic interface between accelerator controls, beam physics modelling software and modern scripting languages. The work-flow of a project using this interface begins with testing algorithms of choice offline in simulation. After off-line testing, the same code can be deployed on real machines via the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) API. We include noise in our simulations in order to mimic realistic accelerator behaviour and to evaluate robustness of algorithms to experimental uncertainties and long-term drifts. The results of test cases of using this framework are presented, including emittance tuning of the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), correction of diurnal drift in CESR steering and orbit correction on CESR and the Cornell-BNL ERL Test Accelerator (CBETA).

As we move to ultra-high brightness photocathodes and ultra-cold beams, we may become more sensitive to stochastic, point-to point effects such as disorder induced heating and the Boersch effect, given the failure of Debye screening.  In this study, we explore the effects of stochastic scattering. Modern beam dynamics codes often approximate point to point interactions with a potential created by smoothing the charge over space, removing sensitivity to stochastic effects. This approximation is often used in beamline optimization, because it is much faster. We study the limits of validity of this approximation. In particular, we will simulate effects of stochastic space charge on a high brightness photoemission beamline, an ultrafast electron diffraction beamline with a photocathode temperature of 5 meV with a final beam energy of 225 keV. Emittance dilution in the transverse plane and transverse beam size relative to smooth space charge simulations will be presented.

In order to maximize beam lifetime in circular particle accelerators, the nonlinear beam optics are optimized to maximize the dynamic aperture of the beam. The dynamic aperture (DA), which is a 6-D phase space volume of stable trajectories, depends on the strength of the nonlinearities in the machine, and is calculated via particle tracking. Current DA optimization processes include multi-objective genetic algorithm optimizers, and relies on minimizing the magnitudes of resonance driving terms (RDT), which are calculated from the nonlinear contribution to the one-turn-map. The process of searching through the parameter space for an ideal combination that maximizes DA is computationally strenuous. By setting up the sextupole channel such that it is resembles a symplectic integrator of a smooth Hamiltonian, with only a few sextupoles we are able to closely reproduce phase space trajectories of a smooth Hamiltonian up to the hyperbolic point. No chaos and resonances are observed if phase advance per one sextupole magnet in the channel does not exceed ~0.12x2 pi. Therefore, an important property of the suggested approach is the intrinsic elimination of the resonances, and minimization of corresponding RDTs.

The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator is a research electron and proton storage ring recently commissioned at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology facility. Its research program is focused on testing novel techniques for improving beam stability and quality, notably the concept of non-linear integrable optics. In this paper, we report the first results of experimental investigation of a quasi-integrable transverse focusing system with one invariant of motion, a Henon-Heiles type system implemented with octupole magnets. Good agreement with simulations is demonstrated on key parameters of achievable tune spread and dynamic aperture preservation. Resilience to perturbations and imperfections in the lattice is explored. We conclude by outlining future research plans and discussing applicability to future high intensity accelerators.

We present the design of a high-gradient electron gun. The goal of this gun is to generate relativistic electrons using GV/m accelerating fields. The initial design is a standing-wave field-emission gun operating in the pi-mode with a cavity frequency of 110.08 GHz. A pulsed 110 GHz gyrotron oscillator will be used to drive the structure with power coupled in through a TM01 circular waveguide mode. The gun is machined in two halves which are bonded. This prototype will be used to characterize the electron beam and study RF breakdown at 110 GHz.

We study turn-by-turn fluctuations in the number of emitted photons in an undulator, installed in the IOTA electron storage ring at Fermilab with an InGaAs PIN photodiode and an integrating circuit. Our study was motivated by the previous experiment *. We propose a theoretical model for the experimental data from * and in our own experiment we attempted to verify the model in an independent and more systematic way. Moreover, these fluctuations are an interesting subject for a study by itself, since they act as a seed for SASE in FELs. We improve the precision of the measurements from * by subtracting the average signal amplitude using a comb filter with a one-turn IOTA delay, and by using a special algorithm for noise subtraction. We obtain a reasonable agreement between our theoretical model and experiment. Along with repeating the experiment from *, which was performed at a constant beam current, we also collect data for fluctuations in undulator light at different beam current values. Lastly, in our experiment we were able to see the transition from Poisson statistics to Super-Poisson statistics for undulator light, whereas in * only the latter statistics was observed.

Most X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FELs) emit linearly polarized X-ray pulses. Recently, a device called the Delta undulator has been installed at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to provide tuneable polarization. The electron beam is first microbunched by the LCLS normal undulators, then the microbunched beam is kicked prior to the Delta undulator, and an intense circularly polarized X-ray pulse is generated in the Delta undulator towards the kicked direction and is spatially separation from the linearly polarized radiation from upstream undulators. Coherent off-axis radiation is usually strongly suppressed because the microbunches themselves cannot rotate. The talk will show that microbunches can in fact rotate towards the new direction of travel if the kick is applied in a quadrupole focusing channel and also will clarify characteristics of the coherent undulator radiation from a tilted microbunch in the far-field and will compare simulations with experiments. This microbunch rotation can explain the unexpectedly large amount of off-axis radiation that was observed during Delta undulator experiments at LCLS and may have other applications to the advanced X-ray manipulations.

The surface resistance of an SRF cavity is an important measure of its performance and utility: lower resistance leads directly to lower cryogenic losses and power consumption. This surface resistance comprises two components, namely the ‘‘BCS resistance’’, which depends strongly on the quasiparticle temperature, and a temperature-independent ‘‘residual resistance’’, which is often dominated by losses due to trapped magnetic vortices. Both components are generally dependent on the RF field strength. Here we present a summary of recent theoretical advances in understanding the microscopic mechanisms of the surface resistance, in particular addressing niobium hydride formation and quasiparticle overheating (using the tools of density functional theory) and discussing issues with existing models of the positive Q-slope, a field-dependent decrease in the BCS resistance, and possible paths for improvement of these models. We also discuss trapped flux losses using ideas from collective weak pinning theory.

Beams with large transverse emittance ratios (flat beams)have received renewed interest for their possible applications in future linear colliders and advanced accelerators. A flat beam can be produced by generating a magnetized beam and then repartitioning its emittance using three skew quadrupoles. In this paper, we report on the experimental generation of∼1nC flat beams at the Argonne WakefieldAccelerator (AWA). The emittance ratio of the flat beam is demonstrated to be continuously variable by adjusting the magnetic field on the cathode.

The critical temperature (~ 18 K) and superheating field (~ 425 mT) of Nb3Sn are almost twice that of niobium, thereby promising the higher quality factor and accelerating gradient at any given temperature compared to traditional SRF cavities made of niobium. It can enable higher temperature for cavity operation (4 K Vs. 2 K), resulting in significant reduction in both capital and operating cost for the cryoplant. Several single-cell cavities along with witness samples were coated with Nb3Sn to explore, understand and improve the coating process for betterment of cavity performance. RF measurements of coated cavities combined with material characterization of witness samples were employed to update the coating process. Following some modifications to the existing coating process, we were able to produce Nb3Sn cavity with quality factor ≥ 2.1010 for accelerating gradient up to 15 MV/m at 4 K, without any significant Q-slope. In this article, we will discuss recent results from several Nb3Sn coated single-cell cavities combined with material studies of witness samples.

We present initial measurements from a UCLA-Argonne Wakefield Accelerator collaborative plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) experiment aimed at demonstrating the dependence of transformer ratio on longitudinal beam shape. The transformer ratio or the ratio between the maximum acceleration of the witness and the maximum deceleration of the drive beam, is key to a mature, beam-based, plasma wakefield accelerator design. Utilizing the unique capabilities of the emittance exchange (EEX) beamline, we may obtain transformer ratios in excess of six in PWFA. We present the experimental beamline design, relevant beam diagnostics and explore preservation of the longitudinal beam profile.

Non-Evaporable Getter (NEG) coating has been used for years in many particle accelerators due to its advantages like evenly distributed pumping speed, low thermal outgassing, and low photon, electron and ion stimulated desorption yields. Although NEG coating has been tested at room temperatures intensively, there is little data on its behaviour at cryogenic temperatures. Tests in this environment are important for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study and other accelerator facilities where the operational conditions of the beam screen are restricted to cryogenic temperatures. This work will provide some preliminary results on NEG properties at low temperatures, e.g. pumping speed and capacity, as well as its behaviour under electron bombardment, where electron stimulated desorption (ESD) yields will be calculated. The ternary Ti-Zr-V coating, deposited with dense and columnar structure, will be the first material to be tested at cryogenic temperatures in ASTeC Daresbury laboratory. The results were compared with the ones obtained at room temperature, offering an insight into the behaviour of NEG-coated cryogenic chambers when beam-induced effects are present.
