MedAustron is a synchrotron-based ion beam therapy centre, designed to deliver clinical beams of protons (60-250 MeV) and carbon ions (120-400 MeV/u) to three clinical irradiation rooms (IR) and one research room, which can also host 800 MeV protons. The commission-ing activities for the first treatments with proton beams in IR3 have been completed and commissioning of IR1-2 is ongoing. The present paper describes the activities which took place during the last year, which involved all accel-erator components from the ion source to the IR.

A material discrimination based on X-Ray systems is typically achieved by alternating photon pulses of two different energies. A new approach relies on the ability to generate X-ray pulses with an end-point energy that varies in a controlled fashion during the duration of the pulse. An intra-pulse multi-energy X-ray beam device will greatly enhance current cargo screening capabilities. This method originally was described in the AS&E patents*. This paper addresses a linac concept for the proposed scan and describes some proof of concept experiments carried out at SLAC.

An ultrafast detection technique on 100 fs time scales over sub-nanometer (even atomic) spatial dimensions has long been a goal for the scientists to reveal and understand the ultrafast structural-change induced dynamics in materials. In this paper, the generation of femtosecond electron pulses using the RF gun and the first prototype of femtosecond time-resolved relativistic-energy ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) are reported. Finally, both relativistic-energy electron diffraction and image measurements in the UEM prototype are presented.
