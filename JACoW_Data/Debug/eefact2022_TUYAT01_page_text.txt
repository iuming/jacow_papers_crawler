The main challenges for far-future higher-energy particle colliders are discussed along with possible technological paths to overcome them. This workshop paper is mostly an abbreviated version of an article published in the ’’Frontiers in Physics’’ journal (under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence). The topic of electric power generation using accelerators has been added.

Within the framework of the Future Circular Collider Feasibility and Design Study, the design of the electron-positron collider FCC-ee is being optimised, as a possible future double collider ring, currently foreseen to start operation during the 2040s. FCC-ee is designed to operate at four different energy stages, allowing for precision measurements: from the Z-pole up to above the ttbar-threshold. This synchrotron with almost 100 km circumference is designed including advanced accelerator concepts, such as the crab-waist collision scheme or one combined off-momentum and betatron collimation insertion. Furthermore, numerous optics tuning and measurement studies are being performed to drive the collider design at an early stage and guarantee its feasibility and efficient operation.

The CEPC booster provides electron and positron beams to the collider at different energies. The newest booster design is consistent with the TDR higher luminosity goals for four energy modes. The emittance of booster is reduced significantly in order to match the lower emittance of collider in TDR. Both FODO structure and TME structure was studied for booster design. A lot of efforts are made to overcome the difficulty of error sensitivity for the booster and hence the dynamic aperture with errors can fulfill the requirements at all energy modes. Also, the combined magnets scheme (B+S) are proposed to minimize the cost for magnets and power supplies. The design status of CEPC booster in TDR including parameters, optics and dynamic aperture is discussed in this paper.
