The ESS linac will deliver an unprecedented 5 MW of average beam power when completed. Beyond the 90 MeV normal conducting front-end, the acceleration is performed using SC structures up to the design energy of 2 GeV. As the ESS will send the beam to a fixed tungsten target, the emittance is not as important a factor as in injectors. However, the losses have to be studied in detail, including not only the average operational loss required to be of less than 1 W/m, but also the accidental losses, losses due to failure and other potentially damaging losses. The commissioning of the ion source and LEBT starts this year and will continue with the RFQ next year. In this contribution we will discuss the beam dynamics aspects and challenges of the ESS linac.

In the framework of IFMIF/EVEDA project the source and RFQ are ready to be tested with beam. In this article the beam dynamics simulation and the measurement performed in preparation of the first beam injection are presented. The installed line is composed by the proton and deuteron Source with the LEBT composed of two solenoids that inject in the 10 meters long RFQ, the MEBT, diagnostic plate and the beam dump. The line is prepared to be tested with protons of 8 mA in pulsed mode (up to 0.1%).

A newly developed superconducting 15-gap RF-cavity has been successfully tested at GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung. After a short commissioning and ramp up time of some days, a Crossbar H-cavity accelerated first time heavy ion beams with full transmission up to the design beam energy of 1.85 MeV/u. The design acceleration gain of 3.5 MV inside a length of less than 70 cm has been verified with heavy ion beam of up to 1.5 particle mueA. The measured beam parameters showed excellent beam quality, while a dedicated beam dynamics layout provides beam energy variation between 1.2 and 2.2 MeV/u. The beam commissioning is a milestone of the R&D work of Helmholtz Institute Mainz and GSI in collaboration with Goethe University Frankfurt towards a superconducting heavy ion continuous wave linear accelerator cw-Linac with variable beam energy. Further linac beam dynamics layout issues will be presented as well.

DERICA (Dubna Electron-Radioactive Ion Collider fAcility) is the new ambitious project under development at JINR, Dubna *. DERICA is proposed as the next step in RIB facilities development. It is planned that in the DERICA project the RIBs produced by the Fragment Separator, are stopped in a gas cell, are accumulated in the ion trap and then are transferred to the ion trap/charge breeder, creating the highest possible charge state for the further effective acceleration (system {gas cell - ion trap - ion trap/charge breeder}). From the accelerator point of view DERICA will include the driver LINAC-100 of heavy ions with Z=5-92 (energy up to 100 MeV/u) with operating mode close to CW, the fragment separator, the re-accelerator LINAC-30 of secondary beams with energies in the range 5-30 MeV/u), the fast ramping ring (energy <300 AMeV), the collector ring and the electron storage ring. General DERICA concept and possible design of the LINAC-100 and LINAC-30 accelerators playing a key role in the project will presented in this report.
