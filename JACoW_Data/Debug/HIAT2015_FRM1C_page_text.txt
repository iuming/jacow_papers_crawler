A superconducting rotating-gantry for carbon therapy is being developed. This isocentric rotating gantry can transport carbon ions with the maximum energy of 430 MeV/u to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over 0-360 degrees, and is further capable of performing three-dimensional raster-scanning irradiation. The combined-function superconducting magnets were employed for the rotating gantry. The superconducting magnets with optimized beam optics allowed a compact gantry design with a large scan size at the isocenter; the length and the radius of the gantry are approximately 13 and 5.5 m, respectively, which are comparable to those for the existing proton gantries. Furthermore, the maximum scan size at the isocenter is calculated to be as large as approximately 200 mm square for heavy-ion beams at the maximum energy of 430 MeV/u. A construction and installation of the superconducting gantry is in progress, and beam commissioning will begin from this autumn. We will present a status of the superconducting rotating-gantry.

An isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) system for radioactive C-11 ion beam acceleration is expected to be realized for a PET imaging simultaneously with the heavy-ion cancer therapy. In the ISOL scheme, C-11 molecules are firstly produced by irradiating boron compound target with proton beams (20 MeV, ~30 μA) provided by a small cyclotron. The C-11 molecules are separated from impurity molecules mixed into the target chamber during the proton irradiation. Then, 1+ ions are firstly produced from the purified C-11 molecules with the singly charged ion source. Finally, after the isotope separation with an analyzing magnet, the C+ ions are further ionized by employing an EBIS as a charge breeder to obtain required charge state for the HIMAC injector.* We have been developed a C-11 molecular production/separation system to produce the C-11 molecules and separate it from the impurities. We have also been developed a new singly charged ion source to produce the 1+ ions. Moreover, a test irradiation port is being constructed at NIRS cyclotron facility for on-line experiments to produce C-11 ions. Latest results on those developments and prospects of our ISOL scheme are to be presented.

A design of a compact hadron driver for future cancer therapies based on the induction synchrotron concept is given. In order to realize a slow extraction technique in a fast cycling synchrotron, which allows the energy sweep beam scanning, the zero momentum-dispersion D(s) region and high flat D(s) region are necessary. The lattice has the two fold symmetry with a circumference of 52.8 m, 2 m-long dispersion-free straight section, and 3 m-long large flat dispersion straight section. Assuming a 1.5 T bending magnet, the ring can deliver heavy ions of 200 MeV/au at 20 Hz. A beam fraction is dropped from the barrier bucket at the desired timing and the increasing negative momentum deviation of this beam fraction becomes enough large for the fraction to fall in the ES septum extraction gap, which is placed at the large D(s) region. The programmed energy sweeping extraction makes spot scanning beam irradiation on a cancer area in depth possible without an energy degrader avoiding the production of secondary particles or the degradation of emittance. Details of the lattice parameters and computer simulations for slow extraction are discussed.

High Current Injector (HCI) is an upcoming accelerator facility at Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi, India. This comprises of high temperature superconducting Electron Cyclotron Resonance (HTS-ECR) ion source, normal temperature Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), IH-type Drift Tube Linear (DTL) resonators and low beta superconducting Quarter Wave Resonator (QWR) cavities to accelerate heavy ions having A/q ≤ 6. The compact diagnostic system consists of Faraday cup, slit scanner and capacitive pick up to measure the current, profile, position and bunch length of incident ion beam respectively. It is especially designed and fabricated to measure the beam parameters at the entrance of each of six IH-DTL resonators. The compactness is preferred to minimize the transverse and longitudinal emittance growth at the entrance of DTL resonators. The beam current and profile measurements of various heavy ion beams at different energy have been carried out to validate the design and fabrication of the diagnostic system. Here we are presenting the detailed information about its design, fabrication and various test results.
