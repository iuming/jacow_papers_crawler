An upgrade of RHIC EBIS, the extended EBIS, is presently under development at Brookhaven National Laboratory to increase the intensity of the Au32+ ion beams by 40%’50% to 2.1 ’ 109 Au32+ ions/pulse at the booster ring entrance. Generation of intense beams of polarized 3He2+ ions with up to ~ 5 ’ 1011 ions/pulse for the RHIC and the future electron’ion collider is a goal of the EBIS upgrade project as well. Ultra-high vacuum is extremely important for stable and reliable operation of EBIS/T devices. We have developed a linear pumping module based on the ZAO NEG unit commercially available from SAES Getters. This pumping system will be used for the Extended EBIS Upgrade which is presently under development at BNL. A ZAO NEG module has been modified to be heated up to 600 °C by passing up to 120 A of DC current through a stainless-steel cage for required NEG activation and reactivation temperature cycles. A method of pumping speed measurements using pulsed gas injection into the vacuum chamber has been developed and used for characterization of the ZAO NEG-based linear pumping system.

The ReA post-accelerator of the National Supercon-ducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University includes an Electron-Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) operating as a charge breeder. The Facility for Rare Iso-tope Beams (FRIB) is being implemented. After comple-tion, rare-isotopes beam rates are expected to exceed in some case 10<sup>10</sup> particles per second (pps). The charge capacity of the ReA EBIT is insufficient to handle those rates. Therefore, parts of the TEST EBIS from the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) were transferred to the NSCL to build a High-Current Electron-Beam Ion Source (HCEBIS). The HCEBIS features an electron gun that can provide a current up to 4 A for an estimated trap charge capacity of 10<sup>11</sup> elementary charges. This paper presents the HCEBIS specifications, electron-beam cur-rent measurements to test its cathode, and simulation results for its implementation in the ReA post-accelerator. It also presents charge-capacity measurements conducted with the ReA EBIT that demonstrate that the HCEBIS will be able to handle beam rates of more than 10<sup>10</sup> pps.

The parameter space of the TOF was explored using analytic methods as well as computer simulation to improve the design and functionality of a similar device that was constructed as a prototype for the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) in 2019. A simulation of the beam line optics was produced in Opera-2D CAD software to show that other optical elements would not materially affect the operation of the TOF. This will allow for true measurements of the charge state ratios of helium for EBIS and extended EBIS operation in support of the Electron Ion Collider. EBIS operators will use the device to maximize the fraction of 3He ions in the 3He2+ state. Different geometries were explored as well to maximize the effectiveness of the device and to meet the performance criterion and physical constraints of the EBIS beam line.

TRIUMF’s Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility has the only on-line mass measurement Penning trap (MPET) at a radioactive beam facility that uses an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) to enhance mass precision and resolution. EBITs can charge breed exotic isotopes, making them highly charged, thereby improving the precision of atomic mass measurement as the precision scales linearly with the charge state. However, ion bunches charge bred in the EBIT can have larger energy spread, which poses challenges for mass measurements. A cooler Penning trap (CPET) is currently being developed off-line at TITAN to sympathetically cool the highly charged ions (HCI) with a co-trapped electron plasma, prior to their transport to the MPET. To evaluate the integration of the CPET into the TITAN beamline and to optimize the beam transport, ion trajectory simulations were performed. Hardware upgrades motivated by these simulations and previous test measurements were applied to the off-line CPET setup. Ions and electrons were co-trapped for the first time with the CPET. Progress and challenges on the path towards HCI cooling and integration with the on-line beam facility are presented
