The present study is addressed to the theoretical description of the ultimate gradient limitation in SRF cavities. Our intent is to exploit experimental data to confirm models which provide feed-backs on how to improve the current state-of-art. New theoretical insight on the cavities limiting factor can be suitable to improve the quench field of N-doped cavities, and therefore to take advantage of high Q0 at high gradients.

Quality factor of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities is degraded whenever magnetic flux is trapped in the cavity walls during the cooldown. In this contribution we study how the trapped flux sensitivity, defined as the trapped flux surface resistance normalized for the amount of flux trapped, depends on the mean free path. A variety of 1.3 GHz cavities with different surface treatments (EP, 120 C bake and different N-doping) were studied in order to cover the largest range of mean free path nowadays achievable, from few to thousands of nanometers. A bell shaped trend appears for the range of mean free path studied. Over doped cavities falls at the maximum of this curve defining the largest values of sensitivity. In addition, we have also studied the trend of the BCS surface resistance contribution as a function of mean free path, revealing that N-doped cavities follow close to the theoretical minimum of the BCS surface resistance as a function of the mean free path. Adding these results together we unveil that optimal N-doping treatment allows to maximize Q-factor at 2 K and 16 MV/m until the magnetic field fully trapped during the cavity cooldown stays below 10 mG.

In a partnership with SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) and Jefferson Lab, Fermilab will assemble and test 17 of the 35 total 1.3 GHz cryomodules for the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) Project. These devices will be tested at Fermilab's Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) within the Cryomodule Test Stand (CMTS-1) cave. The problem of magnetic pollution became one of major issues during design stage of the LCLS-II cryomodule as the average quality factor of the accelerating cavities is specified to be 2.7 x 1010. One of the possible ways to mitigate the effect of stray magnetic fields and to keep it below the goal of 5 mGauss involves the application of low permeable materials. Initial permeability and magnetic measurement studies regarding the use of 316L stainless steel material indicated that cold work (machining) and heat affected zones from welding would be acceptable.

Two TESLA-style 8-cavity cryomodules have been operated at Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST), formerly the Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) Accelerator Test Facility. Operational instabilities were revealed during Radio Frequency (RF) power studies. These observations were complemented by the characterization of thermal acoustic effects on cavity microphonics manifested by apparent noisy boiling of helium involving vapor bubble and liquid vibration. The thermal acoustic measurements also consider pressure and temperature spikes which drive the phenomenon at low and high frequencies.

In a partnership with SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) and Jefferson Lab, Fermilab will assemble and test 17 of the 35 total 1.3 GHz cryomodules for the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) Project. These include a prototype built and delivered by each Lab. Another two 3.9 GHz cryomodules will be built, tested and transported by Fermilab to SLAC. Each assembly will be transported over-the-road from Fermilab or Jefferson Lab using specific routes to SLAC. The transport system consists of a base frame, isolation fixture and upper protective truss. The strongback cryomodule lifting fixture is described along with other supporting equipment used for both over-the-road transport and local (on-site) transport at Fermilab. Initially, analysis of fragile components and stability studies will be performed in order to assess the risk associated with over-the-road transport of a fully assembled cryomodule.

The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is proposed for operation at Fermilab. The goal of IOTA is to create practical nonlinear accelerator focusing systems with a large frequency spread and stable particle motion. The IOTA is a 40 m circumference, 150 MeV (e-), 2.5 MeV (p+) diagnostic test ring. Construction of an electron lens for IOTA is necessary for both electron and proton operation. Components required for the Electron Lens design include; a 0.8 T conventional water-cooled main solenoid, and magnetic bending and focusing elements. The foundation of the design relies on repurposing the Fermilab Tevatron Electron Lens II (TELII) gun and collector under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions.

The goal of IOTA is to create practical nonlinear accelerator focusing systems with a large frequency spread and stable particle motion. The IOTA is a 40 m circumference, 150 MeV (e-), 2.5 MeV (p+) diagnostic test ring. A heavy low frequency steel floor girder is proposed as the primary tier for IOTA device component support. Two design lengths; (8) 4 m and (2) 2.8 m long girders with identical cross section completely encompass the ring. This study focuses on the 4 m length girder and the development of a working prototype. Hydrostatic Level Sensor (HLS), temperature, metrology and fast motion measurements characterize the anticipated mechanical stability of the IOTA ring.

With the recent discovery of nitrogen doping treatment for SRF cavities, ultra-high quality factors at medium accelerating fields are regularly achieved in vertical RF tests. To preserve these quality factors into the cryomodule, it is important to consider background magnetic fields, which can become trapped in the surface of the cavity during cooldown and cause Q0 degradation. Building on the recent discovery that spatial thermal gradients during cooldown can significantly improve expulsion of magnetic flux, a detailed study was performed of flux expulsion on two cavities with different furnace treatments that are cooled in magnetic fields amplitudes representative of what is expected in a realistic cryomodule. In this contribution, we summarize these cavity results, in order to improve understanding of the impact of flux expulsion on cavity performance.

LCLS-II linac is based on SRF technology developed for the XFEL project. The XFEL 3rd harmonic system built by INFN is based on the original designs of cavity and power coupler developed and built by Fermilab for the FLASH facility at DESY. For LCLS-II application both designs of the 3.9 GHz cavity and the power coupler have been modified for an operation in the continuous wave regime up to 2 kW average RF power. In this paper we discuss coupler modifications and the result multiphysics analysis for various operating regimes. For the initial test of a proposed design, we decided to modify two spare warm sections of power couplers, built for the FLASH facility, by shortening both of two inner bellows and making a thicker copper plating. Modification of the existing coupler test stand and the test program are briefly discussed in this paper.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is an x-ray free electron laser facility. The proposed upgrade of the LCLS facility is based on construction of a 4 GeV superconducting (SC) linear accelerator (linac). An optimal reliable performance of the linac is largely determined by beam sensitivity to various component alignment errors. In this paper we evaluate misalignment tolerances of LCLSII SC linac using a more realistic alignment model that includes correlated misalignment of elements.

LCLS-II coupler based on modified design of TTF3 coupler for higher average power was assembled on high Q cavity and tested at HTS as part of integrated cavity test program. Couplers were thermally connected to thermal shields and equipped with diagnostics to control temperature in different locations and provide information about cryogenic heat loads at 2 K, 5 K and 80 K.Three dressed cavities with power couplers were tested in HTS at full specified RF power. Results are summarized in this paper and cross-checked with simulation.

There is a significant interest in developing high-average power electron sources, particularly in the area of electron sources integrated with Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) systems. For these systems, the electron gun and cathode parts are critical components for stable intensity and high-average powers. In this initial design study, we will present the design of a 9-cell accelerator cavity having a frequency of 1.3 GHz and the corresponding field optimization studies.

Surface imperfections significantly limit the performance of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. The development of surface topography techniques aims to locate the surface flaws in an SRF cavity and profile their geometry details. This effort plays an important role of quality control in cavity productions as well as provides contour information of the defects for understanding quench mechanisms. The surface topography techniques at Cornell University include an optical inspection system and surface replica technique. In this paper, we present the details of the techniques and show features found in the SRF cavities at Cornell.

Cornell's SRF group has developed Vertical Electro-Polishing (VEP) and applied on 1.3GHz Niobium SRF cavities as the primary surface treatment. High-Q and high voltage performances of VEP'ed SRF cavities had been successfully demonstrated at Cornell. In 2014, new VEP R&D collaboration has started between Cornell, KEK, and Marui Galvanizing Co. Ltd. (MGI). MGI and KEK has developed their original VEP cathode named 'i-cathode Ninja'® which has four retractable wing-shape parts per cell for single-/9-cell cavities. We will report the results of VEP process using 'i-cathode Ninja'® on single cell cavity at Cornell.

To demonstrate key parameters of a an energy recovery linac (ERL) at Cornel, an injector based on a photo gun and an SRF cryomodule was designed and built. The goal was to demonstrate high current generation while achieving low emittances. While the emittance goal has been reached, the current achieved so far is 75 mA. Even though this is a world record, it is still below the targeted 100 mA. While ramping up the current we observed excessive heating in the fundamental power coupler which we were able to track down to insufficient cooling of the 80 K intercepts. These intercepts are cooled by a stream of parallel cryogenic flows which we found to be unbalanced. In this paper we will review the finding, describe the analysis we did, modeling of the parallel flow and the modifications made to the module to overcome the heating.

Cornell University is developing the plasma cleaning technology as an alternative cleaning technique for SRF cavity surface preparation. In experiments, we successfully ignited the plasma in a single-cell SRF cavity. However the experiments were limited by the peak electric-fields in the RF coupler. In this paper, we show the analysis of the limitation and propose a new design of the coupler which can eliminate the limitation.

A recent study to optimise the coating of thin-film Nb3Sn cavities has resulted in coating procedures that can fabricate 1.3 GHz cavities capable of reproducibly achieving fields of >16 MV/m with record high Qs >1010 at 4.2 K. However, the performance of these next generation SRF cavities is as yet well below the theoretical maximum performance expected of Nb3Sn, thus giving ample room for further advancements. Current measurements strongly suggest that the current limits are due to local defects and irregularities in the coated surface. In this paper we analyse, using methods including SEM/EDS, TEM, XRD and EBSD, the surface of both sample coupons and cavity cut-outs, with a view to identifying and understanding the origin of surface non-uniformities that would lead to increased surface resistance and cavity quench.

A single-cell 1.3 GHz ILC-shape thin-film Nb3Sn-on-Nb cavity recently achieved accelerating gradients of >16 MV/m with a record Q0 of approx. 2·1010 at 4.2 K, exceeding the power efficiency seen in the current most efficient niobium cavities. A concurrent study of the coating process has resulted in a coating procedure that is capable of replicating this performance in other single-cell cavities. In this paper we demonstrate the RF performance and behaviour of these next generation SRF cavities, with an emphasis on both the impact from both external magnetic fields and the cavity cool down procedure on cavity performance.

Nitrogen-doping has been shown to consistently produce better quality factors in SRF cavities than is achievable with standard preparation techniques. Unfortunately, nitrogen-doping typically brings with it lower quench fields and higher sensitivities of residual resistance to trapped magnetic flux. Here we present work to understand these effects in hopes of mitigating them while maintaining the high Q desired by future projects. Using a nitrogen diffusion simulation, material parameters of nitrogen-doped cavities can be predicted prior to doping. These simulations results are consistent with SIMS data taken from samples treated with cavities. The nature of doping's effect on quench field has also been studied using CW and pulsed measurements. These results have allowed us to better understand the nature of nitrogen-doping and its effect on cavity performance.

Previous measurements at Cornell have shown that the sensitivity of residual resistance to trapped magnetic field in SRF cavities is heavily dependent on the mean free path of the RF penetration layer of the niobium. Here we report on a systematic study of ten cavity preparations with different mean free paths and the effect of these preparations on sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux. In the clean limit, longer mean free path leads to a lower sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux while in the dirty limit the opposite is true, shorter mean free path leads to lower sensitivity. These results are also shown to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions of RF losses due to oscillations of vortex lines.

Nitrogen-doping has become a standard tool for reaching high quality factors in SRF cavities in the medium field region at 2 K. This high Q has been shown to be a result of lowering of the temperature dependent BCS resistance. Here we show that this lowering of the BCS resistance is due to interstitial nitrogen in the niobium lowering the mean free path. The BCS resistance extracted from experimental data is shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions from BCS theory; that there is an optimal doping of which the mean free path is lowered to about half the intrinsic coherence length. These results provide insight into understanding the mechanisms behind nitrogen-doping and allow us to more accurately predict doping parameters to reach optimal cavity performance.

Experiments have shown that the temperature-dependent portion of the RF surface resistance of SRF materials also exhibits a dependence on the magnitude of the surface field, manifested as a "Q-slope" or "anti-Q-slope" in the medium field region. Recent theoretical work proposes an explanation of the anti-Q-slope in dirty-limit superconductors. In this report, we compare theoretical predictions with the results of systematic experimental studies on the RF field dependence of the surface resistance using 1.3 GHz niobium SRF cavities with a wide range of mean free paths. We find very good agreement between theory and experiment in the dirty limit, with some divergence as the cavities approach the clean limit.

Cornell has developed a TE mode sample host microwave cavity in order to study large, flat samples of novel SRF materials. In recent calibration tests, the cavity was shown to reach peak magnetic fields on the sample plate of >100 mT and a quality factor Q0 greater than 1010, making it a powerful system to study the performance of superconductors at high RF fields with nOhms sensitivity. In this report we present results of measurements of two samples of thin-film Nb deposited on Cu using HiPIMS at 500 C and at 800 C.

High-power pulsed (HPP) measurements of SRF cavities offer several different avenues of experimentation from standard continuous wave (CW) measurements by probing higher fields and reducing thermal effects. In this paper we report upon recent measurements of N-doped Nb and Nb3Sn cavities, investigating the limitations of the superheating field, flux entry field, and other maximum fields. We also investigate the potential of these materials for operation in a pulsed accelerator, which would partially or fully mitigate the effects of defects (i.e. thermal quenches).

Low surface resistance, or high unloaded quality factor (Q0), superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities are being pursued actively nowadays as their application in large-scale CW SRF accelerators can save capital and operational cost in cryogenics. There are different options in realization of such cavities. One of them is the large-grain (LG) niobium cavity. In this contribution, we present new experimental results in evaluation of LG niobium cavities cooled down in the presence of an external magnetic field. High Q0 values are achieved even with an ambient magnetic field of up to 100 mG. More over, it is observed that these high Q0 values are super-robust against repeated quench, literally not affected at all after the cavity being deliberately quenched for hundreds of times in the presence of an ambient magnetic field of up to 200 mG.

Center for Accelerator Science at ODU has designed, fabricated and successfully tested a crab cavity for MEIC at Jefferson Lab*. This proof of principle cavity was based on the earlier MEIC design which used 748.5 MHz RF system. The updated MEIC design** utilizes the components from PEP-II. It results in the change on the bunch repetition rate of stored beam to 476.3 MHz. The ion ring collider will eventually require 952.6 MHz crab cavity. This paper will present the analyses of crab cavities of both 476 MHz and 952 MHz options. It compares advantages and disadvantages of the options which provides the MEIC design team important technical information for a system down selection.

The proposed eRHIC electron ion collider at BNL must use a relatively large crossing angle between the ion and electron beams for various reasons, including the reduction of long-range beam-beam effects and minimization of synchrotron radiation noise in the detector. To prevent significant loss of the luminosity due to this large crossing angle, the design of the collider requires the use of groups of crab cavities to provide local crabbing for both proton/ion and electron beams. We will base our design for eRHIC crab cavities based on our experience in the design of the 400 MHz double quarter wave crab cavity (DQWCC) for the Hi-Lumi upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This DQWCC design is scaled to different frequencies of a main crab cavity and its higher harmonics for eRHIC. In this paper, we discuss the preliminary designs of the eRHIC crab cavities and their major parameters.

The 56 MHz SRF cavity is a superconducting quarter-wave resonator installed in the common section of RHIC. Both beams share the cavity in an interwoven pattern over the entire store. The wake field excited in the cavity is the superposition of the two opposing bunches. This paper will discuss the wake field excited by both beams, and the higher order mode power as a result of the excited field.

The nominal operating frequency for the HL-LHC crab cavities is 400.79 MHz within a bandwidth of ±60kHz. Attaining the required cavity tune implies a good understanding of all the processes that influence the cavity frequency from the moment when the cavity parts are being fabricated until the cavity is installed and under operation. Different tuning options will be available for the DQW crab cavity of LHC. This paper details the different steps in the cavity fabrication and preparation that may introduce a shift in the cavity frequency and introduces the different tuning methods foreseen to bring the cavity frequency to meet the specifications.

Photon diffraction model (PDM) is one of the most promising candidates to study High Order Mode (HOM) power absorption on absorbing materials for high current SRF cavities. Because at very high frequency (>10GHz), the wavelengths of HOMs are much smaller compared with accelerators dimension, the phase of those HOM will be negligible. Meanwhile, Finite Element Method (FEM) cannot lend a high resolution on evaluation the HOM field patterns due to limited meshing capability. This PDM model utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to trace the ray diffusive reflection in a cavity. This method can directly estimate the power absorption on the cavity and absorber wall. This method will help design the HOM damper setup for eRHIC HOM damper. In this report, we evaluate HOM absorption on the cavity wall with different absorber setup and give a possible solution for power damping scheme for high frequency HOMs.

A 647 MHz 5-cell cavity has been designed for the envisioned EIC at BNL which is configured as an eRHIC ERL with a FFAG lattice to achieve the necessary e-p luminosity. The cavity was optimized to allow propagation of all HOMs out of the cavity for high BBU threshold current and low HOM power (loss factor). eRHIC will collide the electron beam over a wide energy range with protons from 40 GeV to 250 GeV, which requires the cavity to tune up to 170 kHz at 2 K. This poses a true challenge to the mechanical design of the SRF cavity. This paper will present the RF and mechanical designs of the 647 MHz 5-cell cavity, and status of the cavity fabrication will be addressed as well.

HOM damping is a challenge for high-current SRF linacs possibly generating HOM power at a level of 10 KW per cavity. A rectangular waveguide used as a natural high pass filter is a good option as high power, large spectrum HOM damper. However, its size is too big, causing a big challenge for the cooling and cryogenic system. A reliable, compact HOM damping scheme using a ridged waveguide is being developed to damp high power (> 10 kW), large spectrum HOMs ( up to 40 GHz) that may be generated in the 647 MHz 5-cell eRHIC ERL SRF linac. The size of a ridged waveguide is less than a quarter of the regular waveguide, which alleviates the thermal issue. This paper presents the design of a ridged waveguide and estimated HOM damping results using a ridged waveguide. The thermal or cooling design of the ridged waveguide will also be addressed.

Optimization of energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy sources has become a major focus of political and social policies, leading to increasing energy cost not only in Germany but also in the European energy market. Simultaneously the energy demand of future accelerator projects is estimated to rise compared to existing facilities, leading to overall increased energy costs. Energy efficiency could counteract this trend by reducing energy consumption for a given research goal. This work aims to find recommendations for saving potential in existing research accelerators as well as guidelines for construction of future facilities. In order to identify and develop key figures for comparison between several international particle accelerator facilities, data has been collected by a questionnaire developed in cooperation between GSI and TUD, Darmstadt. We present the first results of it's evaluation.

IFMIF (International Fusion Material Irradiation Facility) will be a Li(d, xn) neutron source providing equivalent neutron spectrum of DT fusion reactions and comparable neutron flux of future commercial reactors. IFMIF, presently in its EVEDA (Engineering Validation and Engineering Design Activities) phase is installing LIPAc (Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator) in Rokkasho (Japan), a 125 mA CW 9 MeV deuteron beam as validating prototype of IFMIF accelerators. The MPS of LIPAc manages the interlocks for a fast beam stop during anomalous beam losses or other hazardous situations. High speed processing is essential to achieve MPS goals driven by investment protection principles. Since Bragg's peak depth is dependent of energy, power densities by uncontrolled beam losses can be very damaging at low energies; the MPS principles for LIPAc are validating those for IFMIF. Beam losses may lead to severe damages by excessive thermal stresses, annealing or even burn/melting of materials. Careful studies to set the maximum allowable time for a beam shutdown to prevent undesired scenarios during the accelerator operational life have been undertaken.

The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) aims to provide an accelerator-based, D-Li neutron source to produce high energy neutrons at sufficient intensity and irradiation volume for DEMO materials qualification. Part of the Broader Approach (BA) agreement between Japan and EURATOM, the goal of the IFMIF/EVEDA project is to work on the engineering design of IFMIF and to validate the main technological challenges which, among a wide diversity of hardware includes the LIPAC (Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator), a 125 mA CW deuteron accelerator up to 9 MeV mainly designed and manufactured in Europe. The aim of this paper is to address the engineering issues of the MEBT and SRF linac related to assembly and Integration at LIPAc facility, focusing in the seismic analysis of the beamlines to ensure the robustness of the equipment and the alignment activities with the cutting edge technology performed in Europe before sending the components to Rokkasho. These activities are essential before starting the installation process of the MEBT in the first half of 2016, and to initiate the assembly and integration of the SRF Linac cryomodule in the next phase.

In the J-PARC accelerator facility, 400 MeV H− ions are injected from linac to rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). A thin graphite foil with the thickness of about 300 ug/cm2 is located at the injection point to strip two electrons from H− ion and convert it to proton. The charge stripping efficiency is usually more than 99.7 %. In other words, less than 0.3 % H− ions are not accurately exchanged to protons. Most of those remaining H− ions or H0 atoms (stripped only one electron from H− ion) are eventually converted to protons by second and third graphite foils and transported to the beam dump. This beam dump consists of an iron block with the size of 0.3×0.3×0.4 m3 for beam stop and the iron block with the size of 3×3×2.5 m3 and concrete with the size of 6×6×6 m3 around the iron block for the radiation shielding. The radiation shielding was designed to endure the 4 kW proton beam to the beam dump. In this presentation, we show the thermal analysis of the beam dump and compare it to the real operation.

HEPS-TF is the test facility of HEPS (High Energy Pho-ton Source) of China. The magnet girders are used for supporting and positioning of the magnets. As the beam emittance is very low, the girder must has high adjusting precision and high stability. Besides, the girder should also be beam-based aligned. For these issues, two girder systems are designed. Both of them use cam mover mech-anisms for precision adjustment. One has six cam mover mechanisms and another has eight. The design aim of the alignment accuracy between girders is within 50 μm, and the adjusting resolution is within 3μm. The design aim of the natural frequency is above 30 Hz. This paper will discuss the scheme selection and structural design of the girder systems.

A three dimensions Hall probe will be manufactured for characterizing the magnetic performance of Cryogenic Permanent Magnet Undulator (CPMU) of Chinese High Energy Photon Source and the test facility (HEPS-TF) at Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP). The positional and angular misalignment errors of the Hall sensors play an important role in the measurement accuracy of CPMU. In order to minimize the misalignment errors, a method of calibrating relative displacements and assembly angles of a 3-D Hall probe is carried out. In this paper, details of the calibration procedures and the data processing are presented.

The goal of web-based user interface is to create a user interface which makes it easy and efficient to operate the KOMAC facility. A web-based user interface for a beam status monitoring of the KOMAC 100 MeV linac and beam lines has been developed with accessing Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) Channel Access (CA) protocol and relational database. Web service is combined with EPICS CA protocol. As a result, a beam operator and user can monitor the beam status in real time by using a web browser of remote PC or wireless device. In this paper, we are describing the implementation of web-based user interface for a beam status monitoring of the KOMAC proton linac.

The Radiation Equipment Research Division of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute has been op-erating a 10 MeV RF electron linear accelerator, which is used for electron beam irradiation. The beam power and energy of the RF electron linear accelerator are 10 kW and 10 MeV. The accelerator is composed of an electron gun, an S-band (= 2856 MHz) accelerating structure, a klystron, electromagnetic solenoids, a scanning electromagnet, an RF driver, a modulator, and a chiller. The linac components have deteriorated due to a long operation time of 9 years. In this paper, we described Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) to control ODA magnet power sup-plies for solenoids and steering magnets of the 10 MeV electron beam irradiation accelerator.

Pohang Accelerator Laboratory(PAL) has been developing a SASE X-ray Free Electron Laser based on 10 GeV linear accelerator. The cavity BPM mover was developed to be used in the intersections of the Undulator Systems. The main specifications include submicron repeatability for a 50 kg cavity BPM adjusting system within compact dimensions and a ±1.5 mm stroke in the vertical and horizontal direction. Compact linear motion guide based on 5-phase stepping motors have been chosen. A closed-loop control system has been developed to achieve this repeatability. For the feedback, one digital probe sensor for each axis was used. Mechanical switches are used to limit movement. In addition, hard-stops are included for emergency. In this report, we describe the design of the stages used for precise movement and results of mechanical measurements including reproducibility will be reported.

Particle accelerator projects share many characteristics with industrial projects. However, experience has shown that best practice of industrial project management is not always well suited to particle accelerator projects. Major differences include the number and complexity of technologies involved, the importance of collaborative work, development phases that can last more than a decade, and the importance of telerobotics and remote handling to address future preventive and corrective maintenance requirements due to induced radioactivity, to cite just a few. The openSE framework was developed as part of the PURESAFE ITN project funded by the European Commission; it is a systems engineering and project management framework specifically designed for scientific facilities' systems and equipment studies and development projects. Best practices in project management, in systems and requirements engineering, in telerobotics and remote handling and in radiation safety management were used as sources of inspiration, together with analysis of current practices surveyed at CERN, GSI and ESS.

A field-free region can be created within a dipole magnet using a superconducting shield, which maintains persistent eddy currents induced during the ramp-up of the magnet. We will study the possibility to realize a high-field superconducting septum magnet using this principle. Properties of different configurations will be presented, and compared to the requirements of the FCC dump system.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a 3 Gev synchrotron light source located in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The commissioning of the beam began on December 2014, and the phase 1 stored current of 100mA was achieved on March 2015. Then the installation and alignment of insertion device were complete during the shutdown from April to July, and also the scheduled maintenance of survey control points was complete in the meantime. This report presents survey alignment results and experience of the TPS .
