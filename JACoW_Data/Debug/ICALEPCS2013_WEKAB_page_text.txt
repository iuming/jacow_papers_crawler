The landing of the car size rover “Curiosity” on Mars was one of the most challenging engineering achievements in robotic exploration. In this talk, I will describe the innovations and challenges in developing and landing Curiosity, the scientific results during the first year of operations, as well as how it fits in the overall program of planetary exploration and Earth observatories.
