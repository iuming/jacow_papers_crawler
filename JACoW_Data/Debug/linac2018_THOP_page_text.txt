The SPIRAL2 injector is composed of two ion sources (p/d and heavy ions up to A/Q=3) followed by a 730 keV/u RFQ. Beam commissioning has started in 2014 in parallel with the superconducting linac and HEBT installations. The RFQ beam commissioning started soon after the first RF conditioning done in October 2015. This paper describes the RFQ beam measurements done on the diagnostic plate for the reference particles (H+, 4He2+ and recently 18O6+) and the difficulties encountered for the RFQ commissioning at the A/Q=3 field level.

A muon linac development for a new muon g-2/EDM experiment is now going on at J-PARC. Muons from the muon beam line (H-line) of the J-PARC muon facility are once stopped in a silica aerojel target and room temperature muoniums are evaporated from the aerogel. They are dissociated with the lasers to be the ultra slow muons, then accelerated up to 212 MeV using a linear accelerator. The low energy part of this muon linac consists of a 324-MHz RFQ and an IH DTL. The frequency is increased to 1296 MHz at the following CCL section. We propose to replace the low energy section to a 1300-MHz RFQ to simplify the configuration of the muon linac. The 1300-MHz RFQ will be extremely small compared to conventional RFQs, therefore we made a cold model to proof the feasibility of this scheme. In this paper, the result of low-power measurement of the 1300-MHz RFQ cold model is described.

A new cavity structure of RFQ accelerator with bent vanes is proposed to meet the miniaturization requirement of low frequency heavy ion accelerators at Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), Chinese Academy of Sciences. The new structure has a downsized cross section by bending vanes while keeping a certain vane lengths. It also possesses the advantages of simple cooling structure and high power efficient when used in low frequency. The new structure has obvious advantages in reducing manufacturing difficulty of cavity, cutting down project cost, enhancing facility reliability and stability.

Protons with an energy of few MeV are commonly used for Ion Beam Analysis of materials, in particular with the Proton Induced X-ray Emission technique (PIXE). Because of its non-damaging character, PIXE is used in a variety of fields, in particular for the diagnosis of cultural heritage artwork. A compact accelerator based on a high frequency RFQ (Radio Frequency Quadrupole) linac has been designed and is being built at CERN. The length of the RFQ is only one meter and it allows the acceleration of a proton beam up to an energy of 2 MeV. The complete system is conceived to be transportable, allowing PIXE analysis almost anywhere. This paper covers the RF design of the compact RFQ operating at 750 MHz. We present general accelerator parameters and the current state of the RF design, which includes RFQ geometry and coupler design, thermal simulation and first particle tracking results.

ESS, the European Spallation Source, will adopt elliptical multi-cell superconducting cavities with a beta value of 0.86 to accelerate the proton beam up to 2 GeV at the last section of the linac. A 5-cell high-beta cavity for ESS project was tested with high power at FREIA Laboratory. A pulse mode test stand based on a self-excited loop was used in this test. The qualification of the cavity package involved a 5-cell elliptical cavity, a fundamental power coupler, a cold tuning system, LLRF system and a RF station. These tests represented an important verification before the series production. This paper presents the test configuration, RF conditioning history, first high power performance and experience of this cavity package.

Solid-state RF amplifiers, which have long lifetimes and small failures, are the recent trend of reliable and stable high-power rf sources for particle accelerators. Hence, we designed a 90kW solid-state amplifier with an extreme low-loss TE011 mode cavity (Q0=100, 000) power-combiner operated at 476 MHz and a 6 us pulse width. Developing this amplifier is for replacement of an IOT rf amplifier, at the X-ray free-electron laser, SACLA. In SACLA, highly RF phase and amplitude stabilities of less than 0.02 deg. and 10-4 in rms are necessary to stable lasing within a 10 % intensity fluctuation. The amplifier comprises a drive amplifier, a reentrant cavity rf power divider, 100 final amplifiers with a 1 kW output each and a TE011 mode cavity combiner. Water-cooling within 10 mK and a DC power supply with a noise of less than -100 dBV at 10 Hz for the amplifier is necessary to realize the previously mentioned stabilities. Based on the test results of the amplifier, the above-mentioned specifications with the extreme low-loss are promising. The amplifier also allows us to operate in pulsed and CW rfs for linacs and ring accelerators. We report the performance of the 90kW amplifier.

The PROBE project aims to develop a high gradient proton accelerator for protons with energy around 250-350 MeV for proton radiography. Detailed studies have shown that the optimum design is a side coupled cavity at S-band. With an aperture of 8 mm a gradient of 54 MV/m can be obtained with 13 MW of RF power in a 30 cm structure. A prototype cavity has been machined by VDL and diffusion bonded by Bodycote. We present initial measurements of the prototype.

CLIC is focusing on the Compact Linear Collider. To obtain a relatively high accelerating gradient, CLIC utilizes Pulse Compressors to increase the input power of accelerators. This work is to make an alternative design for CLIC pulse compression scheme. There are several kinds of pulse compressor: SLED, BOC, SLED-Ⅱ, spherical pulse compressor and so on. Usually, a spherical cavity, including BOC, can offer a higher Q factor compared with a cylindrical cavity. This design utilizes a spherical cavity working with degenerated Whispering Gallery mode.

The cathode emission physics plays a crucial role in the overall beam dynamics in the gun. Interplays between intricate emission mechanisms in the cathode vicinity strongly influence the cathode quantum efficiency (QE) and the intrinsic emittance. The presence of strong space-charge effects in high gradient RF guns further complicates the emission process. A proper modeling of photoemission and a careful treatment of the space-charge contribution is thus of great necessity to understanding the formation of the beam slice emittance. In this article, emission measurements are carried out using the L-band cesium-telluride photocathode RF gun at the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) and the S-band copper photocathode RF gun at Tsinghua University. Following the Dowell model a simple so-called space-charge iteration approach is developed and used to determine the QE through temporal and spatial-dependent electromagnetic fields. An impact of the space-charge cooling on the thermal emittance is presented. Measurement data are shown and discussed in comparisons to preliminary simulation results.

To investigate chiral magnetic effect, 96Zr and 96Ru beams have been accelerated at relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) in Run18 at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). 96Zr and 96Ru beams were provided from electron beam ion source (EBIS) injector and tandem Van de Graaff, repectively. In the presentation, 96zr beam production and acceleration will be reported. The EBIS injector consist of laser ion source, EBIS as a charge breeder, 300 keV/u RFQ and 2 MeV/u IH-DTL. The natural abundance of 96Zr is only 2.8 % and about 50 % is occupied by 90Zr. To obtain sufficient beam current, mass number 96 enriched material was used. Unfortunately, only available form of the enriched material is oxide powder which does not suit for laser ion source target. We have established sintering technique of ZrO2 powder to make a solid piece which can be installed into the laser ion source. The induced singly charged Zr and oxygen were delivered to the EBIS to be ionized further. We have optimized laser irradiation condition, EBIS confinement time, operating condition of the linacs to maximized the performance of the linac based injector. The detailed R&D works will be presented in the conference.
