DESIREE, the double electrostatic storage rings in Stockholm, is now commissioned and used for experiments. The two 9 m circumference storage rings, which are constructed inside a double walled cryostat, are now cooled to 13 K and routinely used for storage of both negative and positive ions with lifetimes of several minutes. The main properties of DESIREE are presented as well as results from the commissioning and the first experiments.

A four-rod radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) contains four modulated rods kept in place by a number of stems and fixed within a resonating cavity. The position and the modulation of the rods determines the focusing and accelerating properties of the RFQ. The resonating field induces currents, and by that Joule losses, in the stems, rods and tuning plates. The temperature increase causes a mechanical deformation which may lead to a deteriorated performance of the RFQ. The temperature increase is kept small by cooling the rods and stems. A new layout of cooling channels has been proposed. The paper reports about coupled electromagnetic, fluid-dynamic, thermal and structural dynamic field simulations carried out for predicting the mechanical deformation of the stems and the rods. The results for the four-rod RFQ planned for the MYRRHA proton accelerator indicate a change of 47 μm of the distance between the rods when cooling water with a velocity of 3 m/s is applied.

The aim of this research is to improve the accuracy and the simulation time of solvers devoted to Radio Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQ). The Method of Moments is a full-wave method used to solve scattering problems. Its main advantage over FE or FDTD solvers is that unknowns are limited to the boundaries of the object. The resulting dense system of equations can be solved very rapidly with the help of domain-decomposition approaches (e.g. Macro Basis Functions*), especially when the level of detail is very fine compared to the wavelength, which is definitely the case for RFQ’s. Such a method however needs a first regularization method to overcome the low-frequency breakdown in order to compute the Macro Basis Functions. The respective field contributions of different parts of the global structure (e.g. rods vs. stems) can also easily be finely investigated. Numerical results will be presented based on the Myrrha RFQ. The low-frequency breakdown issue due to the very fine mesh will be discussed and a solution based on the so-called Loop-Tree** decomposition will be detailed.

Simulation of the Extraction and Transport of a Beam from the SILHI Source with the Warp Code

In a low energy beam transfer (LEBT) line, space charge effects are dominant and make the motion of the particles strongly non-linear. So, the beam dynamics is directly dependent on the 6D distribution of the particles after the ion source extraction system. It is thus essential to simulate accurately the source extraction region and the space charge compensation after it to try to reach an agreement between the simulations and the measurements. Generally, the ion source extraction system is simulated with electrostatic codes (often using simple model for space charge) from which the 6D beam distribution is derived. Then, this distribution can be used as an initial condition to simulate the beam transport in the LEBT with a time dependent PIC code that takes into account space charge compensation. We propose here to simulate accurately the SILHI source extraction system with the Warp and AXCEL-INP codes. The SILHI ion source will be quickly presented and some simulations results will be given and discussed.

One of the most important challenges for the actual and new third generation of synchrotron light sources is to optimize the linear and the non-linear beam dynamics of these strong focusing lattices. The optimization of a storage ring lattice is a multi-objective problem that involves a high number of constraints in a multi-dimensional parameter space. In this paper we used Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and the tracking code ELEGANT to optimize the linear and non-linear beam dynamics of the SOLEIL synchrotron light source. The objectives of our optimization are the dynamical aperture and the momentum aperture which are strongly correlated to the injection efficiency and the Touschek lifetime, respectively. This paper will discuss the deployment of this computational approach using the SOLEIL computer cluster. The first results will also be presented and we will discuss possible improvements.

During the design phase of superconducting radio frequency (RF) accelerating cavities a challenging and difficult task is to determine the electromagnetic field distribution inside the structure with the help of proper computer simulations. Although dissipation due to lossy materials is neglected in the current work, in reality, because energy transfer appears due to the design of the superconducting cavities, the numerical eigenmode analysis based on real-valued variables is no longer suitable to describe the dissipative acceleration structure. Dissipation can appear with the help of dedicated higher order mode (HOM) couplers, the power coupler as well as the beam tube once the resonance frequency is above the cutoff frequency of the corresponding waveguide. At the Computational Electromagnetics Laboratory (TEMF) a robust parallel eigenmode solver based on complex-valued finite element analysis is available. The eigenmode solver has been applied to the TESLA 1.3 GHz and the third harmonic 3.9 GHz nine-cell cavities to determine the resonance frequency, the quality factor and the corresponding field distribution of eigenmodes.

For a medical accelerator facility like the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre (HIT) an online simulation tool with read and write access to the control system and the database is essential for effective beam alignment and beam spot size adjustment at the patient position. Since the commissioning of HIT the simulation programme Mirko from GSI Darmstadt has been in use for the simulation of the beamlines and the synchrotron. While Mirko fully complies with the demands and is still in regular use, the long-term support of the HIT-Mirko derivate cannot be guaranteed. We have therefore started to set up a new simulation environment based on the MAD-X programme from CERN. In a first step we built a MAD-X model of the HIT accelerator using the MAD-X export function of Mirko. The resulting sequences were transformed and extended into executable MAD-X files. The simulation results were validated against Mirko and a good agreement of the calculated beam envelopes could be achieved. Works on the graphical user interface (GUI) for visualisation of and interaction with the beam envelopes and the link to the control system are in progress.

MODE (Matrix integration of Ordinary Differential Equations) is a software package that provides nonlinear matrix maps building for spin-orbit beam dynamics simulation. In this article we briefly describe the developed integrated development environment features and present computational comparison with other simulation tools. MODE mathematical model is based on Newton-Lorentz and T-BMT equations that are expanded to Taylor series up to the necessary order of nonlinearity. The numerical algorithm is based on matrix presentation of Lie propagator. Spin-orbit simulation results of MODE are compared with results of COSY Infinity and OptiM. MODE provides a flexible graphic user interface, code auto complete technology and visual designer for accelerators. There is also a possibility to generate codes in different programming languages and parallelization techniques.

There are a lot of tools to simulate beam dynamics in accelerators of various types. Many of them are intended to use for specific purposes, and there are universal codes that can simulate both orbit and spin motion in magnetic and electrostatic structures. To start using these codes beam physicist first should have learn syntax, know features and methods how to describe lattice and beams in this particular code. Output data structures of different simulation programs are also vary and depend on peculiarities of each program. This paper proposes a new tool for automated generation and execution of input files for simulation programs and for data analysis of output data. The developed tool allows to describe a lattice, calculate different lattice parameters (like tunes) using simulation program, track particles inside the lattice and analyze various parameters of output data (like beam depolarization). Simulations and analysis can be done in parallel using built-in parallelization mechanisms, and all results can be stored in the database and can be easily fetched when needed. The tool is used to simulate beam and spin dynamics in different lattices to increase spin coherence time.

Numerical techniques in the field of particle accelerators are mainly driven by the design of next-generation accelerators: The need for higher simulation complexity and the necessity for more and more specialized algorithms arises from the ever increasing need to include a broader range of physical effects and geometrical details in a computer simulation. This, on the other hand requires fast and reliable simulation tools for a limited user base. Therefore, new approaches in simulation software development are necessary to provide useful tools that are well-suited for the task at hand and that can be easily maintained and adapted by a small user community. We show how Python can be used to solve numerical problems arising from particle accelerator design efficiently. As model problem, the computation of space charge effects of a bunch in RFQs including the vane geometry was chosen and a suited solver was implemented in Python.

Eigenmode simulations of accelerating structures often involve a large number of computed modes that need to be catalogued and compared. In order to effectively process all the information gathered from eigenmode simulations a new algorithm was developed to automatically recognize modes’ field patterns. In this paper we present the principles of the algorithm and investigate its applicability by means of different single and multi cell cavities. The highest achievable order of correctly recognized modes is of particular interest.

BESSY-VSR is a planned scheme to upgrade the existing BESSY II storage ring to support variable electron pulse lengths. In addition to the present 0.5 GHz energy replenishment cavity, two additional SRF bunch compressing cavities operating at 1.5 GHz (3rd harmonic) and 1.75 GHz (sub-harmonic), will be installed. These cavities are essential to produce short 1.5 ps bunches with current of up to 0.8 mA per bunch. In order to achieve such high beam currents, higher order modes must be damped in the superconducting cavities. In this work we present analysis of higher order modes in cavities with different mid-cell shapes.

The electromagnetic properties of SRF cavities are mostly determined by their shape. Due to fabrication tolerances, tuning and limited resolution of measurement systems, the exact shape remains uncertain. In order to make assessments for the real life behaviour it is important to quantify how these geometrical uncertainties propagate through the mathematical system and influence certain electromagnetic properties, like the resonant frequencies of the structure's eigenmodes. This can be done by using non-intrusive straightforward methods like Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations. However, such simulations require a large number of deterministic problem solutions to obtain a sufficient accuracy. In order to avoid this scaling behaviour, the so-called polynomial chaos (PC) expansion is used. This technique allows for the relatively fast computation of uncertainty propagation for few uncertain parameters in the case of computationally expensive deterministic models. In this paper we use the PC expansion to quantify the propagation of uncertain geometry on the example of single cell cavities used for BESSY VSR as well as to compare the obtained results with the MC simulation.

The kernel of beam dynamics simulations using the particle-in-cell (PIC) model is the solution of Poisson's equation for the electric potential. A very common way to solve Poisson's equation is to use the convolution of charge density and Green's function, the so-called Green's function method. Additionally, the integrated Green's function method* is being used in order to achieve a higher accuracy. For both methods, the convolutions are done using fast Fourier transform based on the convolution theorem. However, the construction of the integrated Green's function and the further convolution is still very time-consuming. The computation can be accelerated without loosing precision if the calculation of Green’s function values is limited to that part of the computational domain with non-zero grid charge density. In this paper we present a general numerical study of these Green's function methods for computing the potential of different bunches: The results can also be used in other simulation codes to improve efficiency.

A new ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna was designed with four current straps in Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). It is to provide heating, current drive and some physics experiments in EAST. The breakdown and RF sheath potential for the antenna are investigated by a three dimension electromagnetic code in the paper. The plasma is simulated by a slab with high relative permittivity approximating the plasma loading of the antenna. Calculations show that the maximum of electric field is around the end of the coaxial feeds and the strip line and the electric field is strongly dependent on antenna phasing. Especially the maximum of electric field is decreased to 27.5 KV/cm with the (0,π,π,0) phasing between toroidal straps while the value is 32.8 KV/cm with (0,0,π,π) phasing. A challenge in ICRF is the impurity contamination which is related to sheath potential. The topology of the radio frequency (RF) sheath is optimized to reduce the potential for EAST ICRF antenna. The RF potential is mitigated obviously with the broader side limiter by a factor of 2.

A new particle-moving algorithm for particle-in-cell simulation of plasma is developed based on the Linear Multistep Method. The conventional and the new algorithms are investigated by numerical experiments, which are conducted in three typical fashions of the electron motions in electromagnetic fields, that is, cyclotron in homogeneous magnetic field, drift in field and motions in inhomogeneous magnetic field. The new algorithm not only improves the accuracy but also relaxes the time step condition for the simulation. It can increase the computation efficiency.

Parallel Three-dimensional PIC Code for Beam-beam  Simulation in Linear Colliders

We present our parallel 3D3V particle-in-cell code for the numerical simulations of ultrarelativistic charged beams in supercolliders. In the algorithm we employ the three-dimensional set of Maxwell equations and the Vlasov-Liouville equation for the distribution function of beam particles in 6-dimensional phase space. The code allows performing numerical experiments with an arbitrary density distribution, beam crossing angle and relative offset. From the mathematical point of view the main problem of the three-dimensional modeling is the presence of the high relativistic factor values (the field gradients are high), the convergence conditions for PIC method and the necessary number of particles in 3D cell. Thus the parallel algorithm is based on the mixed Euler-Lagrangian decomposition in order to achieve good load balancing, and demonstrates the high scalability. With the advances of the code it will be possible to apply it for one-passage beam-beam simulations in linear colliders with supercritical parameters. We present the results of numerical simulations of colliding beams using dummy parameters and parameters close to the ones of the newest ILC project.

Low energy particle beams pose specific challenges to simulation codes and experiments alike as a number of effects become important that can often be neglected at higher beam energies, including e.g. space-charge or fringe field effects. The optimization of low energy charged particle beam transport through arbitrary electromagnetic fields is the purpose of a code aimed at tracking low-energy particles from the sub-eV to the MeV energy range with high precision. The code is based on Matlab/Simulink and able to use 3-dimensional field maps from either Finite Elements Method (FEM) solvers, such as Comsol, OPERA 3D or CST particle studio, fields calculated by the code itself, or field maps from measurements. This contribution describes the code structure and presents its performance limitations. It also gives a summary of results obtained from beam dynamics simulations of cyclotrons injection systems, storage ring extraction systems, electrostatic and magnetic beamlines, as well as from photocathode optimization studies.

SolCalc is a software suite that computes and displays magnetic fields generated by a three dimensional (3D) solenoid system. Examples of such systems are the Mu2e magnet system and Helical Solenoids for muon cooling systems. SolCalc was originally coded in Matlab, and later upgraded to a compiled version (called MEX) to improve solving speed. Matlab was chosen because its graphical capabilities represent an attractive feature over other computer languages. Solenoid geometries can be created using any text editor or spread sheets and can be displayed dynamically in 3D. Fields are computed from any given list of coordinates. The field distribution on the surfaces of the coils can be displayed as well. SolCalc was benchmarked against a well-known commercial software for speed and accuracy and the results compared favorably.

The front end of PIP-II linac is composed of a 30 keV ion source, low energy beam transport line (LEBT), 2.1 MeV radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and medium energy beam transport line (MEBT). This configuration is currently being assembled at Fermilab to support a complete systems test. The front end represents the primary technical risk with PIP-II, and so this step will validate the concept and demonstrate that the hardware can meet the specified requirements. SC accelerating cavities right after MEBT require high quality and well defined beam after RFQ to avoid excessive particle losses. In this paper we will present recent progress of beam dynamic study, using CST PIC simulation code, to investigate partial neutralization effect in LEBT, halo and tail formation in RFQ, total emittance growth and beam losses along low energy part of the linac.

Electron lenses are a mature technique for beam manipulation in colliders and storage rings. In an electron lens, a pulsed, magnetically confined electron beam with a given current-density profile interacts with the circulating beam to obtain the desired effect. Electron lenses were used in the Fermilab Tevatron collider for beam-beam compensation, for abort-gap clearing, and for halo scraping. They will be used in RHIC at BNL for head-on beam-beam compensation, and their application to the Large Hadron Collider for halo control is under development. At Fermilab, electron lenses will be implemented as lattice elements for nonlinear integrable optics. The design of electron lenses requires tools to calculate the kicks and wakefields experienced by the circulating beam. We use the Warp particle-in-cell code to study generation, transport, and evolution of the electron beam. For the first time, a fully 3-dimensional code is used for this purpose.

Efficient implementation of general-purpose particle tracking on GPUs can result in significant performance benefits to large-scale tracking simulations. This presentation is an update on the current status of our work on accelerating Argonne National Lab’s particle accelerator simulation code ELEGANT using CUDA-enabled GPU. We summarize the performance of beamline elements ported to GPU, and discuss optimization techniques for some important collective effects kernels, in particular our methods of avoiding costly thread contention. We also present preliminary results of a scaling study of the GPU-accelerated version of the code.

COSY Infinity is an arbitrary-order beam dynamics simulation code. It can determine high-order transfer maps of combinations of particle optical elements. New features are being developed for inclusion in COSY to follow the distribution of particles through matter. To study in detail the properties of muons passing through material, the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map–Monte-Carlo approach in which transfer map methods describe the average behavior of the particles including energy loss, and Monte-Carlo methods are used to provide small corrections to the predictions of the transfer map accounting for the stochastic nature of scattering and straggling of particles. The advantage of the new approach is that the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects. The gains in speed will aid the optimization of muon cooling channels. Progress on the development of the required algorithms is reported.

A method is implemented in COSY Infinity that allows the computation of space charge effects of arbitrary and large distributions of particles in an efficient and accurate way based on a variant of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). It relies on an automatic multigrid-based decomposition of charges in near and far regions and the use of high-order differential algebra methods to obtain decompositions of far fields that lead to an error that scales with a high power of the order. Given an ensemble of N particles, the method allows the computation of the self-fields of all particles on each other with a computational expense that scales as O(N). Furthermore, the method allows the computation of all high-order multipoles of the space charge fields that are necessary for the computation of high-order transfer maps and all resulting aberrations. Space charge effects are crucial in modeling the latter stages of the six-dimensional (6D) cooling channel for the Muon Collider. Results of simulating the 6D cooling channel for the Muon Collider using the FMM method and other tools and improvements implemented for ionization cooling lattices are presented.

Beam tracking programs provide information of orbits along the nominal trajectory to design beam-line optics. Other aspects like machine or radiation protection, which inspect the transverse dimensions and volumes, are simulated with radiation transport Monte Carlo codes, some of which also include magnetic tracking capabilities. Evaluation of certain aspects, like beam loss shower induced propagation along a beam line, or beam mis-steering phase-space, would require to combine features of both types of codes, or use the latter ones with full accelerator 3D implementations, often too cumbersome and time consuming. This paper presents MadFLUKA, a program that produces FLUKA compatible geometries from MAD files. Objects selected from a user user-configurable database are auto-replicated with the rules of ‘twiss’ and ‘survey’ files to create beam lines with hundreds of components. FLUKA magnetic subroutine is generated from MAD optics, including history randomization of fields for ray-trace analysis of mis-steering failures. MadFLUKA is used in the design of the LCLS-II, at SLAC.

Understanding of the interaction of muon beams with plasma in muon cooling devices is important for the optimization of the muon cooling process. We have developed numerical algorithms and parallel software for self-consistent simulation of the plasma production and its interaction with particle beams and external fields. Simulations support the experimental program on the hydrogen gas filled RF cavities in the Mucool Test Area (MTA) at Fermilab. Computational algorithms are based on the electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code SPACE combined with a probabilistic, macroparticle-based implementation of atomic physics processes such as the absorption of the incident particles, ionization of the absorber material, and the generation and evolution of secondary particles in dense, neutral gas. In particular, we have proposed a novel algorithm for dealing with repetitive incident beam, enabling simulations of long time scale processes. Benchmarks and simulations of the experiments on gas-filled RF cavities and prediction for future experiments are discussed.

The ELBE facility with its 40 MeV C.W. LINAC has recently received an upgrade in terms of new secondary radiation sources and beam lines, while advancing the accelerator infrastructure towards 1.6 mA C.W. operation (1.0 mA before). Therefore, the machine interlock system (MIS) was redesigned in parts to meet the new timing requirements resulting from the increased overall beam power. It comprises fast beam loss detection and a PLC based beam line equipment protection system (EPS), both tripping the key components of the electron sources. The former tripping system using PLC interrupts was replaced by an in-house developed staggered CPLD based system with optical transmission and a PROFINET IO interface for control system integration. The EPS is distributed on several PLCs and has been improved in terms of M2M communication. Further, the vacuum inrush protection was completely renewed using brought-in equipment. This contribution depicts the technical features and performance of the MIS subsystems, as well as the actual status within the upgrade project.

Scope of the Machine Protection System (MPS) for the European Spallation Source (ESS) is to protect equipment located in the accelerator, target station, neutron instruments and conventional facilities, from damage induced by beam losses or malfunctioning equipment. The MPS design function is to inhibit beam production within a few microseconds for the fastest failures at a safety integrity level of SIL2 according to the IEC61508 standard. These requirements result from a hazard and risk analysis being performed for the all systems at ESS. In a next step the architecture and topology of the distributed machine interlock system has been developed and will be presented. At the same time as MPS seeks to protect equipment it must protect the beam by avoiding triggering false stops of beam production, leading to unnecessary downtime of the ESS facility.

The Accelerator complex at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is composed of many systems which are required to function in a valid state to ensure safe beam operation. One key component of machine protection, the Beam Interlock System (BIS), was designed to interface critical systems around the accelerator chain, provide fast and reliable transmission of beam dump requests and trigger beam extraction in case of malfunctioning of equipment systems or beam losses. Numerous upgrades of accelerator and controls components during the Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) are followed by subsequent software updates that need to be thoroughly validated before the restart of beam operation in 2015. In parallel, the ongoing deployments of the BIS hardware in the PS booster (PSB) and the future LINAC4 give rise to new requirements for the related controls and monitoring software due to their fast cycle times. This paper describes the current status and ongoing work as well as the long-term vision for the integration of the Beam Interlock System software into the operational environment.

In 2012, a novel experiment has been performed at the CERN HiRadMat facility to study the impact of a 440 GeV proton beam generated by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), on extended solid copper cylindrical targets. Substantial hydrodynamic tunneling of the protons in the target material has been observed. Iterative FLUKA and BIG2 simulations with the parameters of the actual experiment have been performed. In this paper the results of these simulations will be discussed and compared to the experimental measurements. Furthermore, the implication on the machine protection design for high intensity hadron accelerators as the current LHC and the future High Luminosity LHC will be addressed.

The Compact Linear Collider CLIC is based on a four beam scheme, two colliding beams (main beams) and two drive beams, which are used to accelerate the main beams. The intended drive beam parameters exceed the "safe beam" threshold by a factor of 100. Hence, in case of a beam impact serious structural damages of the accelerator equipment are expected. In order to avoid structural damages caused by the drive beam detailed studies of its beam dynamics are on-going. In this paper the major characteristics of the drive-beam beam-dynamics and preliminary machine protection results are summarised.

The optics design of the final turnaround regions for the CLIC drive beam is presented. This includes the extraction region, the turnaround loop and the phase feed forward chicane for correcting errors on the bunch phase. The design specifications of the kicker and septum magnets are provided. Tracking simulations and detailed studies of coherent and incoherent synchrotron radiation have been used to optimise the optics in the turnaround region in order to minimise transverse and longitudinal emittance growth.

The Controls software for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, with more than 150 millions lines of code, resides amongst the largest known code bases in the world. Industry has been applying agile software engineering techniques for decades now, and the advantages of these techniques can no longer be ignored to manage the code base for large projects within the accelerator community. Furthermore, CERN is a particular environment due to the high personnel turnover and manpower limitations, where applying agile processes can improve both, the codebase management as well as its quality. This paper presents the successful application of the agile software development process SCRUM for machine protection systems at CERN, the quality standards and infrastructure introduced together with the agile process as well as the challenges encountered to adapt it to CERN’s environment.

New experiments at the planned 'High Energy Storage Ring' (HESR) require magnetised electron cooling. One of the challenges is the powering of the HV-solenoids, because they are located on HV-sections, which sit on an electrical potential inside a high voltage vessel. We discuss a Multi-MV system where the solenoids are powered by a series of cascade transformers which are in turn supplied by turbogenerators. The usage of SF6 as turbine fluid is desirable from the viewpoint of operational stability and may also lead to energy efficient operation of the turboexpanders since a Organic Rankine-cycle (so-called ORC-process) may be used instead of electrically driven compressors. The paper gives an overview of the turbo generator and ORC project: an introduction, a status report and a road map will be given.

Ageing of devices and components phasing-out, as well as the increasing maintenance costs, affect particle accelerators similarly to any industrial plant. A careful maintenance plan can cope with these problems in the medium-term, but then a complete update of the oldest parts is required. The most recent technologies available on the market together with a modular and open design approach are the basis of an upgrade program aimed at replacing the existing controllers of the Elettra storage ring magnet power supplies. The design considerations, the constraints and the first results are reported.

A magnet power supply (MPS) for PAL-XFEL was developed, which is the bipolar type with the power capacity of 3.6KW. The MPS has been implemented by the digital signal processing technology using the DSP, FPGA, ADCs and so on. An embedded module was adapted for the Ethernet connection for EPCIS. The output current stability of the MPS showed about 10 ppm peak-to-peak in long term experiment. The measured accuracy was less than 10ppm in full range. The other experimental results such as repeatability and zero-cross response were given in this paper.

Continuous beams delivered by the LINCE ECR ion source will be bunched by a multi-harmonic buncher consisting of two copper-made electrodes. Its numerical design is reported here along with electric and magnetic field maps. Multi-frequency operation is proven by tracking a continuous beam and optimizing the its longitudinal phase space bunching for various ion species under the influence of space charge effects. A thermo-mechanical study carried out in order to estimate the needed water flow through the electrodes is presented as well.

This report presents an overview of the magnetic horn and its pulsed power system at the upcoming FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) complex at GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany. In the planned antiproton (pbar) separator scheme a magnetic horn will be used as a device for collection and focusing of highly divergent antiprotons emerging from the target with energies around 3 GeV and within a cone of about 80 mrad .To achieve the desired focusing effect, the horn needs to be powered with a current pulse of 400 kA peak amplitude at the same repetition rate as the primary proton beam, i.e. 0.1 Hz. In future, operation up to 0.2 Hz is planned without major design alterations. Due to civil construction and radiation protection limitations, possible technical realization of this system has some key design issues. The aim is to develop a reliable and efficient magnetic horn system for effective focusing of antiprotons by producing a very strong pulsed magnetic field.

Kicker-devices, also known as choppers, are of great interest for a multi-purpose electron accelerator like the ELBE at HZDR. They serve the following three main tasks: Firstly, they can be used to improve the time resolution for the positron beam line by removing certain parts of the bunch. As a second advantage they enable the machine to run two independent experiments at the same, as a chopper may split the beam into two separate parts. Lastly, a well-positioned kicker can reduce the dark current emitted by the SRF injector of the accelerator. Different designs for structures, deflecting the bunch in the beam line, have been simulated using CST Particle Studio. Here, no big difference to well-known strip line structures do exist. The next step is to design the supply electronics driving the kickers. As the ELBE accelerator runs at a high bunch repetition rate, the kicker has to keep up to this frequencies of up to 13 MHz. Hence, the high power levels needed for the operation may cause additional problems for the driver electronics. The poster is going to present the state of our development for all three tasks and our approaches to solve the corresponding challenges.

A new induction synchrotron system using an induction cell has been developed and constructed at KEK*. In that system, the switching power supply is one of the key devices that realize digital acceleration. The requirements of the switching power supply are high voltage (2 kV) and high repetition frequency (1 MHz). In the present system, we used series connected MOSFETs as the switching device. However, series connection gives large complexity and less reliability. Among various switching devices, a SiC-JFET should be a promising candidate because it has ultrafast switching speed and high voltage blocking capability. We have developed a new and original SiC-JFET switching device and a compact switching power supply employing this switching element**. Now it is integrated into the induction acceleration system for the KEK-DA. Furthermore we have started development of the next generation of SiC package, which has higher voltage capability (2.4 kV) and 2 in 1 module construction. At the conference, the first experimental demonstration of heavy ion acceleration utilizing the SiC-JFET and the design status of the new device package will be presented.

Four lumped inductance injection kicker magnets for the J-PARC main ring (MR) produce a kick of 0.1096 T·m with a 1% to 99% rise-time of about 400 nsec. A residual field of about 6% of the flat-top exists at the tail of the pulse due to an impedance mismatching. The residual field is required to be suppressed less than 1% to reduce injection losses. For a higher intensity beam operation, the kicker rise-time of less than 300nsec is required to inject longer beam bunches which reduces a space charge effect. During the long shutdown in FY2013, 140Ω resistor and 7nF capacitor were connected to the thyratron to improve the post-pulse shape. In addition, an optimization of a capacitance in the matching circuit was carried out to optimize the waveform. As the result, the rise-time of 195nsec and the residual tail field of 2% were achieved. However, another reflection peak of about 9% is appeared. We plan to compensate the effect of the new peak by using a new small kicker magnet. This paper discusses the detail of the circuit and the beam test results.

Solid state is one of the most important development directions for pulsed power technologies. For GW level pulse generators, switches and pulse forming units are difficult to implement with solid state components restricted by high power tolerance and high voltage insulation. Under certain pulse power, operation voltage is decided by impedance of the pulse forming unit, which means that pulse modulation with low impedance method should help improve insulation strength of a pulsed power system. Therefore, a high power, low impedance pulse forming network is developed based on solid components of ceramic capacitors in this research. It is designed that the impedance is 1.6 Ω, the pulse width is about 150 ns, and the output power is above 1 GW. Low impedance is accomplished via several pulse forming units connected in parallel with a circumferential structure, which could reduce the stray inductance due to good symmetrical characteristics. Key factors influencing pulse modulation process are investigated, stray parameters are examined by electromagnetic calculations and preliminary experiments are carried out, with results giving reasonable agreement with the theoretical cases.

Saturable pulse transformers (SPTs) based on multiple batches of windings in parallel combination and coaxial cylindrical conductors are presented. The proposed SPT can be employed as the transformer and magnetic switch simultaneously for pulse capacitor or high-voltage pulse modulator of several hundred kV range. The SPT, with important features such as auto-resetting of core, high step-up ratio and low saturation inductance, achieves a compact integration of common transformer and magnetic switch. In the SPT, The physical suppression effect caused by reversed magnetic coupling mechanism among primary and secondary windings can reduce the saturation inductance of the SPT windings to a level lower than their structure inductances, which helps to achieve a magnetic switch with low saturation inductance. The proposed SPTs were applied in a high power pulse modulator based on a helical Blumlein pulse forming line (HBPFL). When the SPT played as a pulse transformer, the HBPFL can be charged to 200 kV. When the SPT played as a main magnetic switch of the HBPFL, it helped to form a quasi-square voltage pulse with amplitude of 180 kV，pulse duration of 130 ns, rise time of 60 ns.

The LHC injection kicker magnets include beam screens to shield the ferrite yokes against wakefields resulting from the high intensity beam. The screening is provided by conductors lodged in the inner wall of a ceramic support tube. The design of the beam screen has been upgraded to overcome limitations and permit LHC operation with increasingly higher bunch intensity and short bunch lengths: the new design also significantly reduces the electric field associated with the screen conductors, decreasing the probability of electrical breakdown. The high voltage conditioning process for the upgraded kicker magnets is presented and discussed. In addition a test setup has been utilized to study flashover, on the inner wall of the ceramic tube, as a function of both applied voltage and vacuum pressure: results from the test setup are presented.

LHC operation with high intensity beam, stable for many hours, resulted in significant heating of the ferrite yoke of the LHC Injection Kicker Magnets. For one kicker magnet the ferrite yoke approached its Curie temperature. As a result of a long thermal time-constant the yoke can require several hours to cool sufficiently to allow re-injection of beam, thus limiting the running efficiency of the LHC. The beam screen, which screens the ferrite yoke from wakefields, has been upgraded to limit ferrite heating. In addition it is important to improve the cooling of the ferrite yoke: one method is to increase the internal emissivity of the cylindrical vacuum tank, in which the kicker magnet is installed. This paper describes a method developed for measuring the emissivity of the inside of the tanks, which has been benchmarked against measurements of the ferrite yoke temperature during heat treatment in an oven and transient thermal simulations. Conclusions are drawn regarding an ion bombardment technique evaluated for improving emissivity without degrading vacuum properties. In addition initial concepts for improved cooling are presented.

In the context of the LHC High Luminosity Upgrade project a performance upgrade for heavy ions is envisaged. One of the performance limitations is the rise time of the present SPS injection kicker system MKP. A reduction of the rise time for lead ions was studied in line with a modification of the whole injection system. This paper briefly describes the different rise time options studied for an initially proposed dedicated ion kicker system MKP-I, focuses however on a cost effective alternative using the presently installed 12 MKPS magnets connected to a new fast pulse forming line. As only 12 out of the 16 injection kicker magnets would be fast enough to be used in an upgraded system, additional deflection has to be provided by the septa. The beam optics for that variant is highlighted and first requirements for the septum elements are stipulated. The paper concludes with a failure analysis of the proposed scheme.

A terminated power cable is typically applied not only for terminated ends but also to connect two or more cables. The electric field inside the insulation layer becomes disturbed when a coaxial cable structure is broken and the electric stress increases near the ground edge. A structure of cone type is a major method to alter the lines of equi- potential and to relieve the electric stress around the ground. The dimensions of the cone depend on the cable structure. In this paper we introduce a way to calculate the displacement of equi-potential lines when a cone is brought into a coaxial cable, RG220, and then determine a suitable angle and length of the cone, which are important factors to withstand tens of kV and even greater. The corresponding high-voltage tests are also presented here.

TPS requires highly precise and stable pulsed magnets for top-up mode operation. One injection and two extraction in vacuum kicker magnets in the booster ring are designed and noticed to minimize driving voltage. The HV insulation for magnet itself and vacuum feedthrough need to be tested. A DC withstand voltage tester MUSASHI 3802 (Model: IP-701G) is used to test the DC breakdown voltage, which the maximum driving voltage is 37 kV. And the AC withstand voltage tester was also test the AC breakdown voltage. Thicker than 10 mm ceramic plate could effectively avoid the breakdown occurred with 37 kV DC charging. Thus HV withstand voltage will be higher in vacuum chamber and the insulation with HV will not be the problem.

High energy, short-pulse modulators are being re-examined for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) and numerous X-Band accelerator designs. At the very high voltages required for these systems, all of the existing designs are based on pulse transformers, which significantly limit their performance and efficiency. There is not a fully optimized, transformerless modulator design capable of meeting the demanding requirements of very high voltage pulses at short pulse widths. Under a U.S. Department of Energy grant, Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) is developing a short pulse, solid-state Marx modulator. The modulator is designed for high efficiency in the 100 kV to 500 kV range, for currents up to 250 A, pulse lengths of 0.2 to 5.0 μs, and risetimes <300 ns. Key objectives of the development effort are modularity and scalability, combined with low cost and ease of manufacture. For short-pulse modulators, this Marx topology provides a means to achieve fast risetimes and flattop control that are not available with hard switch or transformer-coupled topologies. The system is in the final stages of testing prior to installation at Yale University.

Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) assembled a prototype pulse generator capable of meeting the original specifications for the Next Generation Light Source (NGLS) fast deflector. The ultimate NGLS kicker driver must drive a 50 Ω terminated Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) deflector blade at 10 kV, with flat-topped pulses and a sustained repetition rate of 100 kHz. Additional requirements of the specification include a 2 ns rise time (10 – 90%), a highly repeatable flattop with pulse width from 5 – 40 ns, and a fall time less than 1 μs (down to 10-4 of the peak value). The driver must also effectively absorb high-order mode signals emerging from the deflector itself. It is envisioned that a scintilla of deflection will be imparted by a symmetric pair of shaped parallel deflection blades, pulsed in opposition at 10 kV. Within the guide, each TEM wave produced by the two pulse generators traverses the guide synchronously with the selected (relativistic) charge packet. The DTI team has designed and demonstrated the key elements of a solid state kicker driver capable of meeting the NGLS requirements, with possible extension to a wide range of fast-pulse applications.

In October 2013, Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) successfully installed and began operation of a 120 kV, 120 A, 1.7 ms Marx modulator for the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan. Originally conceived, and built under a DOE SBIR grant to support SLAC (completed in 2010), the Marx bank modulator demonstrates a new technology for compact and economic ILC-class performance; the design meets the performance requirements for ILC, does so in a more compact form factor than other known technologies, and, we believe, will be more economic than other technologies. The basic concept of a Marx modulator is that it charges an array of capacitors in parallel (low voltage), then erects them in series to form a high-voltage discharge. Using DTI’s solid-state switches (instead of traditional spark gaps or SCRs) to construct a Marx modulator enables it to open and close; thus the capacitors serve as storage capacitors rather than fully exhausting during each pulse. The opening capability of the DTI switches also provides for arc protection of the load, exactly as they would in a hard-switch. Such a system requires no crowbar protection to protect the load against arcs.

Fast kicker systems are required for the proposed upgrade of ALS to a diffraction-limited light source (ALS-U). The main approach is to have multiple stripline kicker magnets driven by inductive adders. The design details of the kicker structures and the inductive adder options will be discussed.

The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Berkeley Lab has been updated many times and remains as one of the brightest sources for soft x-rays worldwide. However, recent developments in technology, accelerator physics and simulation techniques open the door to much larger future brightness improvements. Similar to proposals at several other 3rd generation sources, this could be achieved by reducing the horizontal emittance with a new ring based on a multi-bend achromat lattice, reusing the existing tunnel, as well as much of the infrastructure and beamlines. After studying candidate lattice designs, development efforts in the last year have concentrated on technology and physics challenges in four main areas: Injection, Vacuum Systems, Magnets and Insertion Devices, as well as main and harmonic RF systems.
