The MAX IV facility, currently under commissioning in Lund, Sweden, features two electron storage rings operated at 3 GeV and 1.5 GeV and optimized for the hard X-ray and soft X-ray/VUV spectral ranges, respectively. A 3 GeV linear accelerator serves as a full-energy injector into both rings as well as a driver for a short-pulse facility, in which undulators produce X-ray pulses as short as 100 fs. In this paper, we briefly review the overall facility layout and design concepts and focus on recent results obtained in commissioning of the accelerators with an emphasis on the ultralow emittance 3 GeV ring, the first light source using a multibend achromat.

An increasing science demand for high-repetition rate (MHz-class) FEL facilities, from IR to X-rays, has been pushing institutions and groups around the world to develop proposals addressing such a need, and some of them have been already funded and are under construction. Such facilities require the development of high-brightness high-repetition rate electron guns, and a number of groups worldwide started to develop R&D programs to develop electron guns capable of operating at this challenging regime. Here we describe the approaches and technologies used by the different programs and discuss advantages and challenges for each of them. A review of the present achievements is included, as well as a brief analysis to understand if the present technology performance is sufficient to operate present and future high repetition rate FEL facilities.

We discuss the first demonstration of fresh slice self seeding (FSSS) in a hard X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL). The FSSS method utilizes a single electron beam to generate a strong seed pulse and amplify it with a small energy spread electron slice. This extends the capability of self seeded XFELs by producing short pulses, not limited by the duration set by the self-seeding monochromator system, with high peak intensity. The scheme relies on using a parallel plate dechirper to impart a spatial chirp on the beam, and appropriate orbit control to lase with different electron beam slices before and after the self-seeding monochromator. The performance of the FSSS method is analyzed with start-to-end simulations for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The simulations include the effect of the parallel plate dechirper and propagation of the radiation field through the monochromator. We also present results of the first successful demonstration of FSSS at LCLS. The radiation properties of FSSS X-ray pulses are compared with the Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) mode of FEL operation for the same electron beam parameters.

A thermionic RF gun is a compact and efficient source of electrons used in many practical applications. RadiaBeam Systems and the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory collaborate in developing of a reliable and robust thermionic RF gun for synchrotron light sources which would offer substantial improvements over existing thermionic RF guns and allow stable operation with up to 1A of beam peak current at a 100 Hz pulse repetition rate and a 1.5 μs RF pulse length. In this paper, we discuss the electromagnetic and engineering design of the cavity, and report the progress towards high power tests of the cathode assembly of the new gun.
