The ESRF operates a 6 GeV 4th generation light source, the ESRF-EBS. This storage ring is the first to implement the Hybrid Multi-Bend Achromat lattice (HMBA). The HMBA lattice provides a reduction of the horizontal emittance of approximately a factor 30 with respect to the former Double Bend Achromat (DBA) structure, considerably improving the brilliance and transverse coherence of the ESRF accelerator complex while maintaining large horizontal acceptance and excellent lifetime performance. In this report, the characteristics of the HMBA lattice will be reviewed and the beam commissioning results and first operation experience of the new ESRF storage ring will be presented.

The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) project at the Argonne National Laboratory will re-place the existing 7-GeV, 1.1-km circumference dou-ble bend storage ring lattice with a new 6-GeV hybrid 7BA lattice that will reduce horizontal electron emit-tance from 3 nm-rad to 42 pm-rad, including IBS ef-fects for 200-mA operation. With new optimized per-manent magnet and superconducting undulators, an increase in spectral brightness of two to three orders of magnitude in the 10-100 keV X-ray energy range will be realized. The project includes nine new high performance beamlines and fifteen enhanced beam-lines that will exploit the high brightness and coher-ence of the new facility. The project is in full swing, more than 50% complete by cost, and is on schedule for first beam sometime in mid-2024, a slip of 10 months from the original schedule due to the impact of COVID-19. Project status, challenges and outstanding issues will be discussed in this article.

Sirius is a 4th generation 3 GeV synchrotron light source that has just finalized the first commissioning phase at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) campus in Campinas, Brazil. This paper describes the main Accelerator Physics issues faced during the storage ring commissioning, methods that were used to work them out and the current operation status of the machine.
