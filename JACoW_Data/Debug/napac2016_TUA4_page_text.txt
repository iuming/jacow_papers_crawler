Plasma wakefield accelerators can sustain multi-GeV/m fields that may allow much smaller accelerators that could be used for a wide range of fundamental and applied research applications. 3 M€ of funding have been awarded to 16 laboratories and universities from 5 EU member states within the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme. They will be joined by 18 associated partners that make additional in-kind commitments. The goal of this ambitious project is to produce a conceptual design report for the worldwide first high energy plasma-based accelerator that can provide industrial beam quality and user areas. It is the important intermediate step between proof-of-principle experiments and ground-breaking, ultra-compact accelerators for science, industry, medicine or the energy frontier. Major elements of the project and the expected timeframe will be discussed.

Using parameters from the AWAKE project and particle-in-cell simulations we investigate beam loading of a plasma wake driven by a self-modulated proton beam. Addressing the case of injection of an electron witness bunch after the drive beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma, we optimise witness bunch parameters of size, charge and injection phase to maximise energy gain and minimise relative energy spread and emittance of the accelerated bunch.

Intense, short laser pulses propagating through inhomogeneous plasmas generate terahertz (THz) radiation. We consider the excitation of THz radiation by the interaction between an ultra short laser pulse and a miniature plasma waveguide. Such corrugated plasma waveguides support electromagnetic (EM) channel modes with subluminal phase velocities, thus allowing the phasing matching between the generated THz modes and the ponderomotive potential associated with laser pulse, making significant THz generation possible. Full format PIC simulations and theoretical analysis are conducted to investigate this slow wave phase matching mechanism. We find the generated THz is characterized by lateral emission and a coherent, narrow band spectrum. A range of realistic laser pulse and plasma profile parameters are considered with the goal of increasing the conversion efficiency of optical energy to THz radiation. As an example, a fixed driver pulse (1.66 J) with spot size of 15 μ m and pulse duration of 50 fs excites approximately 83.7 μ J of THz radiation in a 500-μ m-long corrugated waveguide with on axis average density of 1018 cm-3.
