The SuperKEKB collider has finally come to the first commissioning, Phase 1 without the final focus system and before Belle II detector roll-in. In order to accomplish a extremely high luminosity of 8x1035 cm-2s-1, the nano-beam scheme is adopted. Since the vertical emittance is one of keys in this scheme, optics corrections for low emittance tuning are applied. The non-interleaved sextupole scheme is utilized in the arc section. Skew quadrupole-like corrector is equipped for each sextupole. These skew quadrupole-like correctors can correct both X-Y coupling and physical vertical dispersions which induce the vertical emittance. Beta function and physical horizontal dispersion are corrected by fudge factors of quadrupoles and/or horizontal orbit bumps at the sextupoles. Overall optics performance as well as the strategy of low emittance tuning is also presented.

KEKB achieved the world's highest luminosity. One of the key issues for the high luminosity at KEKB was a luminosity tuning which was done almost every time even during the physics run to suppress the beam-beam blowup. In this talk, those experiences are summarized. Some experiences of the luminosity tuning at TRISTAN will also mentioned.

The FCC-ee study is investigating the design of a 100 km e+/e− circular collider for precision measurements and rare decay observations in the range of 90 to 350 GeV center of mass energy with luminosities in the order of 1035 cm-2s-1. In order to reach such performances, an extreme focusing of the beam is required in the interaction regions with a low vertical beta function of 2 mm at the IP. Moreover, the FCC-ee physics program requires very low emittances never achieved in a collider with 1.3 nm for εx and 2 pm for εy at 175~GeV, reducing the coupling ratio to around 2/1000. With such requirements, any field errors and sources of coupling will introduce spurious vertical dispersion which degrades emittances, limiting the luminosity of the machine. This study describes the status of the tolerance study and the impact of errors that will affect the vertical emittance. In order to preserve the FCC-ee performances, in particular εy, a challenging correction scheme based on dispersion free steering and linear coupling correction is proposed to keep the coupling and the vertical emittance as low as possible.
