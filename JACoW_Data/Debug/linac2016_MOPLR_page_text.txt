We present results of a proof-of-principle demonstration of the first ever klynac, a compact 1 MeV linear accelerator with integrated klystron source using one electron beam. This device is bi-resonant, utilizing one resonant circuit for the klystron input and gain cavities, and one for the klystron output and linac cavities. The purpose of a klynac-type device is to provide a compact and inexpensive alternative for a conventional 1 to 6 MeV accelerator. A conventional accelerator requires a separate RF source and linac and all the associated hardware needed for that architecture. The klynac configuration eliminates many of the components to reduce the weight of the entire system by 60%. We have built an 8-cavity, 2.84-GHz RF structure for a 1-MeV bi-resonant klynac. A 50-kV, 10-A electron gun provides the single beam needed. Numerical modeling was used to optimize the design. The separation between the klynac ouput cavity and the first accelerator cavity was adjusted to optimize the bunch capture and a pin-hole aperture between the two cavities reduces the beam current in the linac section to about 0.1 A. Standard high-shunt impedance linac cavities designs are used. We have fabricated the first test structure. The structure will be tested with beam in early Summer 2016. Results will be presented at LINAC 2016.

FERMI is the Italian externally seeded free electron laser in the UV and soft x-rays, driven by a high brightness electron beam S-band plus X-band linac. In recent times, the linac has been upgraded, leading the final beam energy from the design value of 1.2 GeV to 1.5 GeV. Together with proper management of the electron beam quality, fundamental wavelengths down to 4 nm become therefore accessible to users. Additional upgrades concerning laser systems, diagnostics and RF structures are on the path. We present the FERMI FEL linac status, and provide an overview of running and future capabilities of the facility.

The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) 12 GeV upgrade reached its design energy in December of 2015. Since then CEBAF has been delivering 12 GeV beam to experimental Hall D and 11 GeV to experimental halls A and B in support of Nuclear physics. To meet this energy goal, ten new 100 MV cryomodules (80 cavities) and RF systems were installed in 2013. The superconducting RF cavities are designed to operate CW at a average accelerating gradient of 19.2 MV/m. To support the higher gradients and higher QL (3.2×107) operations, the RF system uses 13 kW klystrons and digital LLRF to power and control each cavity. This paper reports on the C100 operation and optimization improvements of the RF system and cryomodules.

The FERMI seeded free-electron laser (FEL), located at the Elettra laboratory in Trieste, is driven by a 200 meter long, S-band linac routinely operated at nearly 1.5 GeV and 10 Hz repetition rate [1]. The high energy part of the Linac is equipped with seven, 6 meter long Backward Traveling Wave (BTW) structures: those structures have small iris radius and a nose cone geometry which allows for high gradient operation [2]. Nonetheless a possible development of high-gradient, S-band accelerating struc-tures for the replacement of the actual BTW structures is under consideration. This paper investigates a possible solution for RF couplers that could be suitable for linac driven FEL where reduced wakefields effects, high oper-ating gradient and very high reliability are required.

FERMI is a seeded Free Electron Laser (FEL) driven by a warm S-band Linac. In the injector region, two 3- meter long Forward Traveling Wave (FTW) accelerating structures, coming from the old Elettra injector, were installed. In order to improve the e-beam quality at higher bunch charge, it was decided to replace the existing ones with two dual-feed accelerating structures. Those structures have been designed and manufactured by RI Research Instruments GmbH and delivered to Elettra in July 2015. The following paper will report about the RF design and the manufacturing of the new structures. Details about the RF conditioning and the installation will also be illustrated.

Developing an upgrade of Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS-II) is currently underway. The central part of LCLS-II is a continuous wave superconducting RF (CW SRF) electron linac. High order modes (HOMs) excited in SRF structures by passing beam may deteriorate beam quality and affect beam stability. In this paper we report the simulation results of monopole High Order Modes (HOM) spectrum in the 1.3 GHz accelerating structure. Optimum parameters of the HOM feedthrough are suggested for minimizing RF losses on the HOM antenna tip and for preserving an efficiency of monopole HOMs damping simultaneously.

Development and production of Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) is underway. The central part of LCLS-II is a continuous wave superconducting RF (CW SCRF) electron linac. The 3.9 GHz third harmonic cavity similar to the XFEL design will be used in LCLS-II for linearizing the longitudinal beam profile*. The initial design of the 3.9 GHz cavity developed for XFEL project has a large, 40 mm, beam pipe aperture for better higher-order mode (HOM) damping. It is resulted in dipole HOMs with frequencies nearby the operating mode, which causes difficulties with HOM coupler notch filter tuning. The CW linac operation requires an extra caution in the design of the HOM coupler in order to prevent its possible overheating. In this paper we present the modified 3.9 GHz cavity End Group for meeting the LCLS-II requirements

SRF accelerating cavities are often operated in superfluid helium of temperature near 2 K to enhance the cavity quality factor Q0 and manage cryogenic heat loads, which are particularly important at large SRF accelerator facilities. This temperature paradigm, however, need not put SRF technology out of the reach of small institutions or even limit SRF operation at large facilities to provide 10-100 MeV beam energy. At the Jefferson Lab CEBAF accelerator there are regularly scheduled maintenance periods during which the liquid helium temperature is raised to 4 K, reducing cryogenic plant power consumption by ~50% and saving megawatts of electrical power. During such a recent period, we accelerated a continuous-wave electron beam at the CEBAF photo-injector to 6.3 MeV/c with current ~80μA using two niobium cavities at helium temperature of 4 K. This contribution describes the SRF and cryogenic performance and uses measured beam quality and energy stability as key metrics. These measurements indicate that 4 K operation of niobium SRF cavities in CEBAF and at small institutions may be a sensible and cost effective mode of operation, provided the cryogenic load associated with lower Q0 is manageable for the number of SRF cavities needed. For Jefferson Lab, this enhances our scientific reach allowing additional low-energy ~10 MeV experiments each year.

A dielectric-lined waveguide has been designed for use as an accelerating structure in terahertz-driven electron acceleration experiments at Daresbury. Experimental verification of acceleration will take place on Versatile Electron Linear Accelerator (VELA). The choice of a rectangular waveguide structure with sidewall dielectric layers enables tuning by varying the spacing between dielectric slabs to account for potential manufacturing errors. Schemes for coupling free-space single cycle THz pulses into the waveguide have been evaluated and optimised through CST simulation. Comparison of simulation with experimental measurements will also be presented.

Since more than a decade, the photo injector test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ), has developed and optimized high brightness electron sources for modern Free Electros Lasers like FLASH and the European XFEL. Despite a very high performance of the photo injector was experimentally demonstrated, several discrepancies between measurements and beam dynamics simulations have been revealed. Although the optimized measured values of the projected transverse emittance are close to those obtained from the beam dynamics simulations, the corresponding experimental machine parameters show certain systematic deviations from the simulated optimized setup. As a source for these deviations, electron beam imperfections were experimentally investigated. This includes studies on bunch charge production, electron beam imaging using the RF gun with its solenoid, and investigations on the transverse asymmetry of the electron beam generated in a rotationally symmetric gun cavity. Experimental studies were supplied with corresponding beam dynamics simulations. The paper reports on results of these studies.

Since 1991 the superconducting recirculating electron accelerator S-DALINAC is running at TU Darmstadt. Its designated design energy of 130 MeV wasn't reached yet due to a lower quality factor of the 3 GHz cavities and thus a higher dissipated power to the helium bath. To increase the maximum achievable energy in cw operation from approx. 85 MeV to the design value of 130 MeV the main accelerator will be passed a fourth time. In this configuration the accelerating gradients of the cavities can be lowered, so that the resulting dissipated power will match the available cooling power of the cryo plant. To realize an additional main linac pass a new recirculation beam line is needed. The most crucial points are the design of the separation dipole and its mirrored version as well as a properly calculated lattice. For the implementation of a new recirculation beam line the existing sections must be adapted to fit the new boundary conditions. This contribution will present some aspects of the design and will report on the actual status of this project.

Third harmonic system was originally developed by Fermilab for FLASH facility at DESY and then was adopted and modified by INFN for the XFEL project [1-3]. In contrast to XFEL project, all cryomodules in LCLS-II project will operate in CW regime with higher RF average power for 1.3 GHz and 3.9 GHz cavities and couplers. Design of the cavity and fundamental power coupler has been modified to satisfy LCLS-II requirements. In this paper we discuss the results of COMSOL thermal and mechanical analysis of the 3.9 GHz coupler and cavity to verify proposed modifica-tion of the design. For the dressed cavity we present simulations of Lorentz force detuning, helium pressure sensitivity df/dP and major mechanical resonances.

The 250 MeV CLARA FEL test facility is now under construction at Daresbury Laboratory. Electron beam for this facility is provided by two normal conducting S-band photocathode guns: a 10 Hz 2.5 cell gun earlier used as the injector for the VELA machine, and a 400 Hz 1.5 cell gun now under commissioning. At the initial stage of Phase I CLARA will operate with the 10 Hz gun and a 45 MeV 2 m long linac section working as a buncher and/or booster. The beam will be deflected into the existing VELA beamline with an S-bend and directed to the spectrometer line for analysing beam properties or into one of two VELA user areas. The 400 Hz gun will be installed in the VELA beamline for detailed high power RF and beam commissioning in the VELA beam diagnostics suite. As the 400 Hz gun is equipped with an interchangeable photocathode it is possible to investigate different metal photocathodes and select the one providing minimal beam emittance at highest quantum efficiency. A state of the art photocathode preparation system is under commissioning at Daresbury. After commissioning the 400 Hz gun will be installed to the CLARA beam line to deliver high energy, high repetition rate beams for the FEL facility, and the 10 Hz gun will be returned to the VELA beam line.

The klystron modulator for the L-band linac is upgraded for higher stability. The two-step charging system for the pulse forming network (PFN) is upgraded by adding a high impedance resonant charging line in parallel with the main line. The charging step of the PFN voltage is reduced considerably near the setting value by switching the main resonance line off so that the charging current flows only through the high impedance line. The second model of the solid-state switch is developed using 60 static-induction thyristors, ten of which are connected in series with six such series connected in parallel to meet maximum specifications of 25 kV and 6 kA. The air-cooling capacity is reinforced so that repetition rate is increased from 10 pps for the first model to 60 pps. The fluctuation and accuracy of the klystron voltage are measured to be 7.8×10-6 or 7.8 ppm for the upgraded klystron modulator using a differential amplifier with much higher sensitivity than one used in the previous measurement.

Challenges in Realizing the LCLS-II Cryomodule Production
181

The LCLS-II project requires the assembly and installation of 37 cryomodules in order to deliver a 4 GeV electron beam to the undulators to produce both soft and hard x-rays at a repetition rate up to 1 MHz. All of the cryomodules will operate in continuous wave mode, with 35 operating at 1.3 GHz for acceleration and 2 operating at 3.9 GHz to linearize the longitudinal beam profile. One of the challenges of this project, and the topic of this paper, is coordinating the effort of three DOE labs in order to realize this machine in just a few years time. This coordination is necessary due to the fact that the cryomodules will be assembled at both Jefferson Lab and Fermi Lab, tested, and then shipped to SLAC for installation, commissioning and operation. This paper will report on our experiences to date, issues that have been identified and planned mitigation going forward.

A new test stand dedicated to SRF cryomodule testing, CMTS1, has been commissioned and is now in operation at Fermilab. The first device to be cooled down and powered in this facility is the prototype 1.3 GHz cryomodule assembled at Fermilab for LCLS-II. We describe the demonstrated capabilities of CMTS1, report on steps taken during commissioning, provide an overview of first test results, and survey future plans.

The potential for higher operating temperature and higher gradient have motivated SRF cavity researchers to pursue Nb3Sn as an alternative to Nb for nearly fifty years. Far and away the most common embodiment has been a few micron-thick Nb3Sn layer on the cavity interior surface obtained by vapor diffusion coating, with one or another set of parameters. While many cavities have been made and RF tested, reports of dissecting a cavity in detail to examine the coating and relate it to RF measurements are rare. We coated a BCP-treated single cell cavity in a typical process of tin/tin chloride activation at 500 C followed by tin vapor deposition at 1200 C. After RF-testing, we cut and examined sections from several locations to learn composition, thickness topography of the interior surface. The effect of process variables, such as surface preparation, process temperature and duration, and vapor chemistry needs to be explored.

Operations at 4 K instead of 2 K have the potential to reduce the operational cost of an SRF linac by a factor of 3, if the cavity quality factor can be maintained. Cavities coated with Nb3Sn have been shown to achieve the accelerating gradients above 10 MV/m with a quality factor around 1010 at 4 K. Because such performance is already pertinent for CEBAF injector cryomodule, we are working to extend these results to CEBAF accelerator cavities envisioning coating of two CEBAF 5-cell cavities with Nb3Sn. They will be installed in an injector cryomodule and tested with beam. The progress on this path is reported in this contribution.

Understanding the improvement of the SRF cavity quality factor by low-level nitrogen addition ("N-doping") is attracting much attention from researchers. Precise, repeatable measurement of the nitrogen profile in the parts-per-thousand to parts-per-million range is vital. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) is the approach of choice because of excellent sensitivity and depth resolution. Accurate quantitation must consider sample properties, such as surface topography and crystal structure, calibration of the instrument with reference materials, and data analysis. We report the results of a SIMS study in which polycrystal and single crystal coupons were N-doped, each accompanied by new SRF-grade niobium sheet equivalent to a single cell cavity.

It has been shown that cooldown details through transition temperature can significantly affect the amount of trapped magnetic flux in SRF cavities, which can lead to performance degradation proportional to the magnitude of the ambient magnetic field.[*] It has also more recently been shown that depending on the exact material properties - even when the material used originated from the same batch from the same vendor - and subsequent heat treatment, the percent of flux trapped during a cool-down could vary widely for identical cool-down parameters.[**] For LCLS-II, two material vendors have produced half of the niobium used for the cavity cells (Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (NX)). Both vendors delivered material well within specifications set out by the project (according to ASTM B 393-05), which allows yet some variation of material characteristics such as grain size and defect density. In this contribution, we present RF and magnetic flux expulsion measurements of four single cell cavities made out of two different niobium batches from each of the two LCLS-II material suppliers and draw conclusions on potential correlations of flux expulsion capability with material parameters. We present observations of limited flux expulsion in cavities made from the production material and treated with the baseline LCLS-II recipe.

The twin-axis cavity is a new kind of rf superconducting cavity that consists of two parallel beam pipes, which can accelerate or decelerate two spatially separated beams in the same cavity. This configuration is particularly effective for high-current beams with low-energy electrons that will be used for bunched beam cooling of high-energy protons or ions. The new cavity geometry was designed to create a uniform accelerating or decelerating fields for both beams by utilizing a TM110 dipole mode. This paper presents the design rf optimization of a 1497 MHz twin-axis single-cell cavity, which is currently under fabrication.

RF-dipole crabbing cavities are being considered for a variety of crabbing applications. Some of the applications are the crabbing cavity systems for LHC High Luminosity Upgrade and the proposed Electron-Ion Collider for Jefferson Lab. The design requirements in the current applications require the cavities to incorporate complex damping schemes to suppress the higher order modes that may be excited by the high intensity proton or electron beams traversing through the cavities. The number of cavities required to achieve the desired high transverse voltage, and the complexity in the cavity geometries also contributes to the wakefields generated by beams. This paper characterizes the wakefield analysis for single cell and multi-cell rf-dipole cavities.

Since 2005 the Institute for Nuclear Physics at the Technische Universität Darmstadt operates a high temperature vacuum furnace. It is designed to reach temperatures of up to 1800°C. It has been used for baking out several niobium superconducting RF cavities at 850°C with proven success*. Current research for improving the performance of SRF cavities is focused on nitrogen treatment of such cavities. Nitrogen doping of SRF cavtities results in an up to four times higher quality-factor as compared to untreated cavities**. At higher temperatures between 1300°C and 1700°C the so-called delta-phase of NbN forms, which is highly interesting for applications to superconducting accelerator technology***. The UHV-furnace at the S-DALINAC offers the possibility to treat niobium samples at considerably higher temperatures than what has been done up to now in order to study the effect of delta-phase NbN and N-doping on superconducting properties. The furnace has been refurbished and recommissioned to realize research on nitrogen treatment of niobium samples. We will report on our first experiences with operating the upgraded furnace.

Since our designed shape of the spoke is complicated due to increase the RF properties, one-step press forming with one set of molds will cause so large strain to break the sheet. We designed the mold components including the process of press work. The press forming tests of the spoke cavity have been done with the various materials of sheets to check molding performance. In this paper we present status of the spoke cavity fabrication.

Multilayer thin film coating is a promising technology to enhance performance of superconducting cavities. Until recently, principal parameters to achieve the sufficient performance had not been known, such as the thickness of each layer. We proposed a method to deduce a set of the parameters to exhibit a good performances. In order to verify the scheme, we are trying to make some experiments on the subject at Kyoto. The sample preparation and the test setup for the measurement apparatus will be discussed.

A 1.3 GHz single-cell niobium (Nb) coupon cavity was vertically electropolished (VEPed) with three different Ninja cathodes which were specially designed for VEP of 1.3 GHz superconducting RF elliptical (ILC/Tesla type) cavities. The cathodes were fabricated to have different surface areas and different distances between cathode surface and the equator. The Ninja cathode prepared with an enhanced cathode surface area was covered with a meshed shield to avoid bubble attack on the surface of the cavity cell. It has been turned out that the anode-cathode distance and the cathode area affect surface morphology of the equator. A smooth equator surface was obtained in the cases in which the cathode surface was geometrically close to the equator or instead the cathode surface area was sufficiently larger. Two 1.3 GHz ILC/Tesla type single-cell cavities VEPed with the Ninja cathodes and using optimized conditions showed good performance in vertical tests.

We have been using single cell coupon cavities to establish vertical electropolishing (VEP) process for a couple of years. A series of in-situ measurements of an EP current at an individual coupon in a coupon cavity can help determination of appropriate EP conditions. VEPed coupons which are surface analysed with XPS, SEM and the other tools can also bring lot information and expertise to development of VEP cathode and optimization of VEP conditions. This time we fabricated the world first 9-cell coupon cavity where 3 sample coupons at the equators and 6 sample coupons at positions close to the irises can be installed. VEP of this coupon cavity with a newly developed Ninja cathode brought useful information for improvement of the VEP facility and optimization of the VEP conditions.

A 325MHz β=0.30 balloon variant of single spoke resonator, which was proposed to suppress multipacting around operational gradient, was chosen as the prototype cavity of SSR1 for Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP). It was also demonstrated to achieve good RF and mechanical properties by geometry optimization for both cavity and helium jacket. The details of RISP SSR1 design will be reported in this paper, accompanying with some particular considerations of fabrication for this new member to the spoke family.

The PIP-II project at Fermilab requires fifteen 650 MHz SRF cryomodules as part of the 800 MeV LINAC that will provide a high intensity proton beam to the Fermilab neutrino program. A total of fifty-seven high-performance SRF cavities will populate the cryomodules and will operate in both pulsed and continuous wave modes. These cavities will be processed and prepared for performance testing utilizing adapted cavity processing infrastructure already in place at Fermilab and Argonne. The processing recipes implemented for these structures will incorporate state-of-the art processing and cleaning techniques developed for 1.3 GHz SRF cavities for the ILC, XFEL, and LCLS-II projects. This paper describes the details of the processing recipes and associated chemistry, heat treatment, and cleanroom processes at the Fermilab and Argonne cavity processing facilities. This paper also presents single and multi-cell cavity test results with quality factors above 5·1010 and accelerating gradients above 30 MV/m.

Cornell's SRF group and Faraday Technology Inc. have started collaborations on two phase-II SBIR projects. Both projects are aiming for the development of advanced Vertical Electro-Polishing (VEP) for Nb SRF cavities, such as HF free or acid free VEP protocols. These could be eco-friendlier alternatives for the standard, HF-based EP electrolyte used, and could bring new breakthrough performance for Nb SRF cavities. Here we give a status update and report first results from these two projects.

Compact and more affordable, facilities for proton therapy are now entering the market of commercial medical accelerators. At CERN, a joint collaboration between CLIC and TERA Foundation led to the design, fabrication and testing of a high gradient accelerating structure prototype, capable of halving the length of state-of-art light ion therapy linacs. This paper focuses on the mechanical design, fabrication and testing of a first prototype. CLIC standardized bead-pull measurement setup was used, leading to a quick and successful tuning of the prototype. The high power tests will soon start in order to prove that the structure can withstand a very high accelerating gradient while suffering no more than 10-6 breakdown per pulse per meter (bpp/m), resulting in less than one breakdown per treatment session.

Low velocity particles are critical in every hadron accelerator chain. While RFQs nicely cover the first MeV/u range, providing both acceleration and bunching, energies higher than few MeV/u require different structures, depending on the specific application. In the framework of the TULIP project [1], a 750 MHz IH structure was designed, in order to cover the 5-10 MeV/u range. The relatively high operating frequency and small bore aperture radius led the choice towards TE mode structures over more classic DTLs. Hereafter, the RF regular cell and end cell optimization is presented. An innovative solution to compensate dipole kicks is discussed, together with the beam dynamics and the matching with the 5 MeV 750 MHz CERN RFQ [2]. This structure was specifically designed for medical applications with a duty cycle of about 1 ', but can easily adapted to duty cycles up to 5 %, typical of PET isotopes production in hospitals.

The SARAF 176 MHz accelerator is designed to provide CW proton/deuteron beams up to 5 mA current and 40 MeV accelerated ion energy. Phase I of SARAF (up to 4-5 MeV) has been installed, commissioned, and is available for experimental work. Phase II of SARAF is currently in the planning stage and will contain larger MEBT with three rebunchers and four cryomodules, each consisting of SC HWRs and solenoids. Phase II MEBT line is designed to follow a 1.3 MeV/u RFQ, is 4.5 m long, and contains three 176 MHz rebunchers providing a field integral of 105 kV. Different rebuncher configurations have been studied in order to minimize the RF losses and maximize the shunt impedance. Different apertures have also been tested with a required of 40 mm diameter by beam dynamics. The simulations were done using CST Microwave Studio. CEA leads the design for SARAF phase II linac including the MEBT rebunchers and has studied a mixed solid copper and Cu plated stainless steel, 3-gap cavity. SNRC is developing a 4-gap OFHC copper rebuncher as a risk reduction. Both designs are presented and discussed in the paper.

Charge stripping of intense heavy ion beams is a major challenge in current and future linear heavy ion accelerators. Conventional stripping techniques are limited in their applicability, e.g. solid carbon foils suffer from short lifetimes at high intensities. One possible alternative is the use of a plasma as a stripping medium, which the presented work focuses on. The main goal of the studies is the prediction of the final charge state distribution of the ion beam. Rate equations were implemented numerically, taking into account different models for ionization, recombination and energy loss processes. First quantitative results are presented in form of an overview of the charge state distributions of different charge stripping media. For fixed projectile properties and target phase, it is observed that the mean charge state q0 decreases for increasing nuclear charge Z\text{T} of the target. Plasmas show significantly increased q0 for the same ZT. The width d of the charge state distributions is larger for higher Z\text{T}. The latter is caused by multiple loss of the projectile and decreases the maximum stripping efficiency by typically less than a factor of 2.

After upgrade of J-PARC Linac in 2014, Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) beam commissioning of the J-PARC LINAC has been made for improving H-beam intensity extracted from Linac. Currents of two solenoid coils and steering magnets in LEBT are optimized with extraction and acceleration voltages for static acceleration in ion source (IS) which decides on an initial emittance diagram of H− beam. As a result of LEBT and IS parameter optimization, beam transmission rate of RFQ has been reached up to 96 % in 50 mA H− current operation. Moreover, PIC-MC (Particle-In-Cell Monte-Carlo) simulation model is developed for H− transport in LEBT. Comparison between experimental and numerical results are presented to clarify beam physics from IS exit to RFQ entrance.

The Radio Frequency Quadrupole system has been designed and constructed for C-ADS (Chinese Accelerator Driven System) Injector II in Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has been running for more than one year until now. It is a quadrilateral four-vane resonator with two equal couplers operating in CW mode. In the paper, RF system upgrade will be presented in detail，especially the two-port configuration was introduced and the conditioning based on two new sets of solid-state amplifier instead of the original tetrodes power source due to system hardware upgrade are described in the paper.

The J-PARC linac started beam commissioning in 2006 and has delivered beam to users since 2008. The linac had been operated with a beam energy of 181 MeV and a peak beam current of 15-20 mA, which corresponds to the 3 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) beam power of 300 kW. An energy of 400 MeV and higher peak beam current of 50 mA linac was required to reach the goal of the J-PARC project. For the beam energy upgrade, we installed a new accelerating structure, Annular-ring Coupled Structure linac (ACS) in 2013. The ion source and the Radio Frequency Quadrupole linac were replaced to increase the peak beam current in 2014. Since then, the linac provides beams to demonstrate a 1 MW equivalent beam at the RCS and also for routine operation for user programs. The progress and operation experiences of the J-PARC linac are presented.

The Drift Tube Linac (DTL) of the European Spallation Source (ESS) is designed to operate at 352.2 MHz with a duty cycle of 4% (a beam pulse of 2.86 ms, 14 Hz repetition period) and will accelerate a proton beam of 62.5 mA pulse peak current from 3.62 to 90 MeV. This article describes the commissioning strategy plans for the DTL part of the linac, techniques for finding the RF set-point of the 5 tanks and steering approach. Typical beam parameters, as proposed for commissioning purposes, are discussed as well and how the commissioning sequence of the tanks fits together with ongoing installation works in the tunnel.

The design and construction with several tens of megawatts superconducting accelerator is the developing direction in the further. The superconducting section follows the RFQ and MEBT, which needs good enough beam quality. The normal temperature front ends are redesigned for China Initiative ADS. The LEBT transports a 35KeV, 10mA DC proton beam to the RFQ, after the RFQ acceleration the MEBT transports a 2.1MeV 10mA CW proton beam to the superconducting DTL. The "Point Source" is proposed in the beam scrape application during the LEBT section to get the ideal transverse beam parameters. To get the ideal longitudinal beam parameters, the new RFQ is designed with little emittance. Collimators are installed in the new MEBT to scrape the outer sphere beams which may turn to halo. Details of the beam dynamics simulations will be given.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) will deliver first protons on target by mid 2019. Civil construction of the accelerator tunnel has made good progress and will allow starting installation of the normal conducting frond end (NCFE) by end of 2017. To achieve these milestones the design of all major beam line components have been completed and the construction of the subsystems begun. We report on the advancement of the subsystems and the commissioning progress of the microwave discharge Proton Source (PS-ESS).

In the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) linac, H0 particles arising from collisions of accelerated H− beams with residual gas are considered as one of the key factors of the residual radiation in the high energy accelerating section. To analyze the H0 and the accelerated H− particles, the bump magnet system was designed and produced. The H0 beam diagnostic line consists of four horizontal bending magnets, non-destructive beam position monitor and wire scan beam profile monitor. In the 2015 summer maintenance period of the J-PARC, the new diagnostic line was constructed in the beam transport (MEBT2), which is the matching section from separated-type drift tube linac (SDTL) to annular-ring coupled structure linac (ACS). In the beam commissioning, we experimentally confirmed that the accelerated 190 MeV H− beams are horizontally shifted as expected with the magnetostatic field simulation and the particle tracking simulation.

Increasing energy of proton beam at LANSCE from 800 MeV to 3 GeV improves radiography resolution ~10 times. Using superconducting RF cavities with gradients ~15 MV/m after the existing linac would result in a long and expensive booster. We propose accomplishing the same with a much shorter cost-effective booster based on normal conducting high-gradient (~100 MV/m) RF accelerating structures. Such X-band high-gradient structures have been developed for electron acceleration and operate with typical RF pulse lengths below 1 us. They have never been used for protons because typical wavelengths and apertures are smaller than the proton bunch sizes. However, these limitations do not restrict proton radiography (pRad) applications. A train of very short proton bunches with the same total length and charge as the original long proton bunch will create the same single radiography frame, plus pRad limits contiguous trains of beam micro-pulses to below 60 ns to prevent blur in images. For a compact pRad booster at LANSCE, we explore feasibility of two-stage design: a short S-band section to capture and compress the 800-MeV proton beam followed by the main high-gradient X-band linac.

Proton beam therapy has been shown to be a promising alternative to traditional radiotherapy, especially for paedi- atric malignancies and radio-resistant tumours. Allowing a highly precise tumour irradiation, it is currently limited by range verification. Several imaging modalities can be utilised for treatment planning, but typically X-ray CT is used. CT scans require conversion from Hounsfield units to estimate the proton stopping power (PSP) of the tissue be- ing treated, and this produces inaccuracy. Proton CT (pCT) measures PSP and is thought to allow an improvement of the treatment accuracy. The Christie Hospital will use a 250 MeV cyclotron for proton therapy, in this paper a pulsed linac upgrade is proposed, to provide 350 MeV protons for pCT within the facility. Space contraints require a compact, high gradient (HG) solution that is reliable and affordable.

A dedicated RF test stand for testing RF components and accelerating structures at 325 MHz has been put into operation at GSI. It allows testing the klystrons and circulators as well as the RFQ and the CH-acceleration cavities for the planned FAIR proton linac (p-Linac) and further cavity projects. The system integration has been completed and first high power tests with the CH prototype cavity were successfully performed. The operation parameters are 2 Hz repetition rate and 200 microseconds pulse length. Investigations on the critical path from wave guide to coaxial high power cavity coupler have been made. Performance measurements of the klystron, circulator and directional couplers with up to 2.8 MW on dummy load and the following conditioning process of the CH-prototype cavity with its coupled RF structures will be presented. Additionally the results of the conditioning of a ladder RFQ prototype are shown.

The field flatness and the layout of the stabilization system in a drift tube linac are strongly dependent on the manufacturing errors that affect the local resonant frequency. In this paper a methodology is presented to study, firstly, the sensitivity of the resonant frequency and of the field flatness to each geometrical parameter of the drift tubes; then a set of tolerances for each parameter is found and a stabilization system layout is defined in order to keep the field flatness within an acceptable limit.

Making an accurate RF design of any accelerating structure is fundamental to ensure that electromagnetic and beam dynamics requirements will be achieved. This is essential for the most complicated accelerating structures like the drift tube linac: in this case a meticulous design facilitates the RF commissioning too. In this paper the influence of the interfaces and of the field stabilization system on the RF design is analyzed and an advanced design methodology to mitigate field degradation is presented.

We are constructing a linac for development of accelerator components at J-PARC. This linac consists of a H− ion source, a low energy beam transport (LEBT), an radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) linac, and a diagnostics bean line. The beam energy is 3 MeV, the beam current is 30 mA, and the duty factor is 0.6%, which corresponds to 0.5 kW. The accelerator itself has a capacity of at least 1 kW. However, the beam power is limited by radiation dose, because there are no radiation shields between the accessible area during the operation. The source and LEBT are same as the J-PARC linac's. The RFQ is a used one in the J-PARC linac, called RFQ I. At first, we are planning to conduct experiments of the laser charge exchange development for the transmutation facility. Then, this linac will be used for the development accelerator components such as beam scrapers, bunch shape monitors, laser profile monitors, and so on. We will be able to install new devices into the actual J-PARC linac after the full testing. The development of H− ion source can be carried out at this system, and also RFQ in the future. In this paper, present status of this 3-MeV linac at J-PARC is presented.

The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) accelerator comprises two (H+ and H−) 750-keV Cockcroft-Walton style injectors, a 201.25-MHz, 100-MeV drift-tube linac (DTL) and an 805-MHz, 800-MeV coupled-cavity linac (CCL). As part of the LANSCE Risk Mitigation project a new digital low-level radio frequency (LLRF) control system is being deployed across the linac, starting with the DTL. Related to this upgrade, a study was performed where specific cavity field errors were simultaneously introduced in all DTL tanks about the nominal stable, low-spill, production set points to mimic LLRF control errors. The impact of these errors on the resultant beam spill was quantified for the nominal 100 μA, 800-MeV Lujan beam. We present the details of the measurement approach and results that show a rapid increase in total linac beam spill as DTL cavity field phase and amplitude errors are increased.

Carbon therapy is the most promising among techniques for cancer treatment, as it has demonstrated significant improvements in clinical efficiency and reduced toxicity profiles in multiple types of cancer through much better localization of dose to the tumor volume. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, are developing an ultra-high gradient linear accelerator, Advanced Compact Carbon Ion Linac (ACCIL), for the delivery of ion-beams with end-energies up to 450 MeV/u for 12C6+ ions and 250 MeV for protons. In this paper, we present a thorough comparison of standing and travelling wave designs for high gradient S-Band accelerating structures operating with ions at varying velocities, relative to the speed of light, in the range 0.3-0.7. In this paper we will compare these types of accelerating structures in terms of RF, beam dynamics and thermo-mechanical performance.

The RISP (Rare Isotope Science Project) has been proposed as a multi-purpose accelerator facility for providing beams of exotic rare isotopes of various energies. It can deliver ions from proton to uranium. Proton and uranium ions are accelerated upto 600 MeV and 200 MeV/u respectively. The facility consists of three superconducting linacs of which superconducting cavities are independently phased. Requirement of the linac design is especially high for acceleration of multiple charge beams. We present the RISP linac design, the prototyping of superconducting cavity and cryomodule.
