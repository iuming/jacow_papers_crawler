The co-location of ESS and MAX IV in Lund will provide European and Swedish researchers with access to leading infrastructures for both x-ray and neutron science, as well as unique opportunities for synergies. An overview and exam- ples are given of the scientific research which will be enabled - the raison d¿etre of the investment in infrastructure which is currently happening in Lund, rang- ing from biology and health to soft matter, chemistry, physics and engineering. These are all key research areas with scientific and societal impact for driving Scandinavian and European competitiveness within the global landscape.

Beam Instrumentation and Diagnostics for High Luminosity LHC

The High Luminosity LHC projects aims to increase the integrated luminosity of the LHC experiments by an order of magnitude. New and upgraded beam instrumentation is being developed to cope with much brighter beams and to provide the additional novel diagnostics required to assure safe and efficient operation under the new LHC configuration. This contribution discusses the various ongoing developments and reports on the results obtained with prototypes for transverse position, intra-bunch position, transverse size and profile, and beam halo monitoring.

On December 2018 the ESRF was shut down and the 28 years old storage ring was entirely dismantled in the following months. A new storage ring, the Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS), that had been pre-assembled in 2017 and 2018, is presently being installed and the commissioning will start in December 2019. EBS will achieve a much reduced horizontal emittance, from 4 nm to 150 pm, and will also provide the X-ray users with a more coherent synchrotron radiation beam. In this paper, we present an overview of the diagnostics systems for this new storage ring.
