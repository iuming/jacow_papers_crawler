The final Beam Instrumentation Workshop, hosted by Jefferson Lab, was held in Newport News Virginia, April 15 - 19, 2012. The series of 15 meetings, spanning 23 years began at Brookhaven National Lab, adopted the Faraday Cup Award to recognize excellence in particle beam diagnostics instruments, and culminated in a transition to a 3 year cycle with DIPAC & a new Asian meeting; the IBIC. This presentation gives highlights of the spring meeting and a bit of nostalgia of the past events.
