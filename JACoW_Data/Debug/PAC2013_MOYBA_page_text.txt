Following the feasibility demonstration of the novel CLIC technology and the publication in 2012 of a CLIC Conceptual Design Report for a Multi-TeV Linear Collider to be built in stages, a new phase towards a technical design is being launched by a global collaboration of volunteer institutes. This paper reviews the status and plans of the CLIC study outlining the developments planned for the next project phase.
