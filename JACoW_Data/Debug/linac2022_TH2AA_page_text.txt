The highest extraction efficiency (9.4%) of a Free Electron Laser (FEL) oscillator has been achieved at the mid-infrared FEL facility of Kyoto University*. The FEL is driven by a normal conducting linac consisting of a thermionic/photocathode RF gun and a traveling wave accelerator tube. The dynamic cavity desynchronization method**,*** was used to achieve the high extraction efficiency with a short macro-pulse duration (7 micro-s). Because of the interaction between the electron beam and FEL electromagnetic field, a maximum electron energy decrease of 16% was observed. An FEL micro-pulse energy of ~100 micro-J with the micro-pulse duration of 150 fs at the wavelength of 11 micro-m was observed. The detailed structure of the FEL micro-pulse was measured using a fringe resolved autocorrelation with a phase retrieval algorithm. As a result, superradiance ringing (or Burnham Chiao ringing), i.e. generation of multiple sub-pulses and 180-degree phase jumps between those sub-pulses, was experimentally observed for the first time in an FEL oscillator.

The Hard X-ray FEL machine SwissFEL at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland is commissioned and transiting to user operation smoothly. FEL operation requires stringent requirements for the beam stability at the linac output, such as the electron bunch arrival time, peak current and beam energy. Among other things, a highly stable RF system is required to guarantee the beam stability. RF performance often dominates the overall performance and availability of FELs, and for this reason the SwissFEL RF system has been designed based on the state-of-the-art technologies that have enabled excellent RF stability, resulting in an arrival time jitter of ~10 fs rms and relative beam energy stability of 10-4 rms. This paper aims to provide an understanding of the peak performance of the RF systems and to highlight possible limitation currently faced, focusing on the S-, C- and X-Band systems.
