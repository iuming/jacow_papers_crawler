In AWAKE a self-modulated proton bunch drives wakefields in a plasma. Recent experiments successfully demonstrated many aspects of the self-modulation of the drive bunch as well as acceleration of test electrons [*,**,***]. Next experiments will focus on producing a multi-GeV accelerated electron bunch with low emittance and low energy spread. The experiment requires a variety of advanced beam diagnostics to characterize the self-modulated proton bunch at the picosecond time scale. These include optical transition radiation and a streak camera for short and long time scale detailed imaging of self-modulation and hosing, coherent transition radiation for modulation frequency measurements in the 100-300 GHz frequency range and multiple fluorescent screens for core and halo measurements. An overview of these diagnostics will be given.

China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) accelerator complex consists of a front end, an 80 MeV DTL LINAC, and a 1.6 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS). It is designed with a beam power of 100 kW in the first phase and reserves upgrade capability to 500 kW in the second phase. CSNS has started user operation at 20 kW after the initial beam commissioning in 2018, the beam power is quickly up to 50 kW and 80 kW by two times beam commissioning in between the user beam time 2019, and finally reached 100kW, the design goal, in February 2020. This talk gives the experiences and most recent status of beam instrumentation system of CSNS during the beam power ramping, as well as future upgrade plan for CSNS-II.

The upgrade of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) storage ring has lead to the construction of a new machine called the Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS). EBS has been successfully commissioned in less than three month and reached the targeted parameters for user mode. The success of the EBS commissioning also depended on the performances and the reliability of the beam instrumentation used to monitor the beam. In this paper a summary of the EBS commissioning is presented with a special focus on the beam instrumentation performances.

Shanghai Soft X-ray FEL (SXFEL) test facility was designed and built to demonstrate EEHG and HGHG schemes and verify key technologies for the future hard X-ray FEL facility (SHINE). After three years commissioning 8.8 nm FEL radiation with peak power of 1 MW had been achieved at the end of 2019. The design, fabrication, commissioning and operation of BI system including Stripline-BPM, Cavity-BPM, screen monitor, bunch length monitor, beam arrival monitor, bunch energy monitor, will be introduced in this paper. Several lessons learned during design stage and beam commissioning stage will be addressed as well.
