In September 2012, Chinese scientists proposed a 240 GeV Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), serving two large detectors for Higgs studies. The circulating CEPC beams radiate large amount of SR power, 30 MW per beam. Reducing power consumption is an important criterion in the design. high efficiency RF sources are required in order to reduce power losses and cost. The most popular RF source for an accelerator is a klystron, which has the advantage that it can be operated at high power with a reasonably high efficiency. The specifications and developments of 650 MHz CW klystron, including the design of prototype and a future high efficiency consideration are summarized in this paper.
