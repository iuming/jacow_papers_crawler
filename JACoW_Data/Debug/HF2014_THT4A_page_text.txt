In this paper I will commend on the early CEPC design as of October 2014. In particular I will comment on the choice of circumference, minimum and maximum energy, number of collision points and target luminosity. I will finish with suggestions to increase performance with minimum incremental cost.

The natural next future circular collider is a circular e+e− Higgs Factory and, after that, a post-LHC p,p collider in the same tunnel. The main Higgs factory cost-driving parameter choices include: tunnel circumference \mathcal{C}, whether there is to be one ring or two, what is the installed power, and what is the ‘‘Physics'' for which the luminosity deserves to be maximized. This paper discusses some of the trade-offs among these choices, and attempts to show that the optimization goals for the Higgs factory and the later p,p collider are consistent.
