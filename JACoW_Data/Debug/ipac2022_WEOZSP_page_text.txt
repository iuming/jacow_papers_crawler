Longitudinal bunch shaping using transverse deflecting cavities (TDC) was recently proposed*. This configuration is well suited for shaping the current profile of high-charge bunches since it does not use dipole magnets, and therefore, is not prone to deleterious effects arising from coherent synchrotron radiation. An intercepting mask located downstream of the first TDC, which introduce a spatiotemporal correlation, transversely shape the beam. Downstream of the second TDC, upon removal of the cross-plane correlation, the bunch is temporally shaped. In this paper, we investigate longitudinal bunch shaping with an X-band TDC powered by an X-band, short-pulse wakefield Power Extraction and Transfer Structure (PETS), where the wakefield from the drive beam propagating through the PETS is the power source. We describe the RF designs of the X-band TDC and the configuration of the overall shaping system. Finally, we explore via beam-dynamics simulations the performances of the proposed shaper and its possible application to various bunch shapes relevant to beam-driven acceleration and coherent radiation generation.

Crab Cavities are a key component of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade, as they aim to minimize the luminosity reduction caused by the crossing angle. Two superconducting crab cavities were installed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN in 2018 to test their operation in a proton machine for the first time. An important point to consider is the increase in transverse emittance induced by noise in the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system. During the first experimental campaign in 2018, the measured emittance growth was found to be a factor of 4 lower than predicted by the available analytical models. In this report, the effects of transverse beam impedance in the presence of CC LLRF noise on transverse emittance growth are presented and the results of the second experimental campaign, which took place in the SPS in 2021, are discussed.

Ceramic breaks are used in synchrotrons for many purposes. For example, they are inserted between the Multi-Wire Profile Monitor (MWPM) on the injection line at the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) in J-PARC to completely prevent the wall currents accompanying beams from affecting the MWPM. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of suppressing beam impedances and the radiation fields from the ceramic breaks, it would be preferable that the inner surface of the ceramic break is coated with Titanium Nitride (TiN), or covered over capacitors. In this report, we measure the radiation fields from the ceramic break with and without capacitors as well as the beam profile and investigate the effect of the ceramic breaks on the measurements.

As other low emittance machine upgrades ALBA-II proposal considers operating in full coupling. In such configuration the horizontal emittance is further reduced while the lifetime is increased at the price of working close to equal fractional tunes. This mode of operation has not been adopted by any existing light source to date, and it presents a few disadvantages, like the optics degradation, injection efficiency reduction and beam size stability. In this paper the above mentioned difficulties are studied for the present ALBA storage ring in full coupling conditions.
