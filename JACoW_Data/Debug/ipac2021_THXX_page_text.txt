Funding: The work is supported by the US Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-76SF00515
The presentation will give an overview of the achievements of major FEL facilities around the world. Followed by a discussion of plans to improve and/or increase brightness, spectral cleanliness, peak power, energy per pulse, and photon energy reach. The presentation will attempt to define the term "High Power" in the context of where future developments should go and what other high power systems are necessary to support maximum science output.

Neutrinos can hold keys to fundamental physics questions such as the origin of matter, the relationship between nature’s forces, formation of the most extreme objects in galaxies, and how we come to exist at all. Accelerator-based neutrino facilities provide platforms that enable comprehensive studies of neutrinos and their properties. In this paper, we discuss high-power proton accelerators for neutrino science and describe their parameters, features, and critical technologies.
