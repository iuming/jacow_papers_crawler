Since the Accelerators for America's Future (AfAF) Symposium in 2009, the U. S. Dept. of Energy's Office of High Energy Physics (DOE-HEP) has worked to broaden its accelerator R&D activities beyond supporting only discovery science to include medicine, energy and environment, defense and security, and industry. Accelerators play a key role in many aspects of everyday life, and improving their capabilities will enhance U.S. economic competitiveness and the scientific research that drives it. Funded for the first time in 2014, the DOE Office of Science Accelerator Stewardship Program has launched initiatives to facilitate access to DOE accelerator infrastructure, develop innovative accelerator technologies that solve critical problems, and catalyze new partnerships across the accelerator user community. We will discuss the formulation and evolution of the Accelerator Stewardship program, the current status of initiatives, and plans for engagement with the accelerator and user communities for future stewardship activities.

The development of heavy ion accelerator in China is presented. For the existing facilities, the status of HIRFL(Heavy Ion accelerator Research Facility of Lanzhou) and Beijing HI-13 tandem accelerator is given. For the proposed next generation high intensity heavy ion facility, the HIAF (High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility) project is introduced. HIAF is a proposed new accelerator facility in China. The facility is being designed to provide intense primary and radioactive beams for a wide range of research fields. The HIAF facility plan was approved by central government of China in December of 2012. The machine studies are now mainly focused on design optimization and key technical R&D. Projected funding for HIAF is estimated to be up to $400 million and the approximately 8-year period is expected to design and construct the facility. The unique features of the first phase of HIAF are high current pulsed beams from iLinac and high intensity heavy ion beams with ultra-short bunch length from CRing. The cooled rare isotope beams also will be prepared through projectile-fragmentation (PF) method and advanced beam cooling technology. To reach the main goals of the HIAF facility, there are still several technical challenges such as operation with high intensity beams, control of the dynamic vacuum pressure, beam compression for very short pulse beam and the design of Nuclotron-type superconducting magnets. For most of those challenges solutions have been found and prototypes are being built through close international collaborations. The general description, accelerator challenges and present status are given in the presentation.

Substantial research and development related to CW proton and ion accelerators are being performed at ANL. A normal conducting CW RFQ and a 4K cryomodule with seven quarter-wave resonators (QWR) and SC solenoids have been developed, built, commissioned and operated as an upgrade of the CW ion linac, ATLAS, to achieve higher efficiency and beam intensities. The new CW RFQ and cryomodule were fully integrated into ATLAS and have been in routine operation for more than a year. Currently we are engaged in development of the first cryomodule for a CW H linac being built at FNAL. This work is well aligned with the development of a 1 GeV 25 MW linac as the driver of a sub-critical assembly for near-term spent nuclear fuel disposal. A 2K cryomodule with eight 162.5-MHz SC half wave resonators (HWR) and eight SC solenoids is being developed for FNAL and scheduled for commissioning in 2017. The testing of the first 2 HWRs demonstrated remarkable performance. Experience with the development and reliable operation of new copper and superconducting accelerating structures is an essential precursor for advanced, reliable future large scale high power CW accelerators.
