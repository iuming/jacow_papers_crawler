Hollow electron lenses are considered as a possible mean to improve the LHC beam collimation system, providing an active control of halo diffusion rates and suppressing the population of transverse halos. After a very successful experience at the Tevatron, a conceptual design of a hollow e-lens optimized for the LHC was produced. Recent further studies have led to a mature preliminary technical design. In this paper, possible scenarios for the deployment of this technology at the LHC are elaborated in the context of the scheduled LHC long shutdowns until the full implementation of the HL-LHC upgrade in 2023. Possible setups of electron beam test stands at CERN and synergies with other relevant electron beam programmes outside CERN are also discussed.

The main emphasis of the Future Circular Collider study is the design of a 100~TeV proton-proton collider in a new tunnel of about 100 km circumference. This paper presents the first optics design of the future hadron collider (FCC-hh). The basic layout follows a quasi-circular geometry ‘‘quasi racetrack'' with 8 arcs and 8 straight sections, four of which designed as interaction points. Assuming 16~T dipole magnets, a first version of the ring geometry and magnet lattice is presented, including the optics of the foreseen high luminosity regions and of the other straight sections dedicated to the installation of injection/extraction lines, beam dump etc., and an arc structure with optimized dipole fill factor to reach the target center-of-mass energy of 100~TeV.

The institute of High Energy Physics has proposed an electron positron collider ring with a circumference of 50-100km to study the Higgs boson. Since the proposal was made, the lattice design for CEPC has been carried out and a preliminary conceptual design report has been written at the end of 2014. In this paper, we will describe the philosophy and results of our lattice design. The procedure of dynamic aperture optimization will be shown. A specific issue for CEPC, the pretzel orbit, which has been found distorting the linear lattice for a considerable amount, will be examined. The ways that we are trying to correct the pretzel orbit effect and the result will be shown. We will also discuss the saw tooth effect on the linear lattice and dynamic aperture of the ring.
