The ERC Advanced Grant COXINEL aims at demonstrating free electron laser amplification, at a resonant wavelength of 200 nm, based on a laser plasma acceleration source. To achieve the amplification, a 10 m long dedicated transport line was designed to manipulate the beam qualities. It starts with a triplet of permanent magnet with tunable gradient quadrupoles (QUAPEVA) that handles the highly divergent electron beam, a demixing chicane with a slit to reduce the energy spread per slice, and a set of electromagnetic quadrupoles to provide a chromatic focusing in a 2 m long cryogenic undulator. Electrons of energy 176 MeV were successfully transported throughout the line, where the beam positioning and dispersion were controlled efficiently thanks to a specific beam based alignment method, as well as the energy range by varying the slit width. Observations of undulator radiation for different undulator gaps are reported.

Free-electron lasers (FEL) are unique light source for different applications on the femto-second scale, including for instance the most basic reaction mechanisms in chemistry, structural biology and condense physics. Laser wake field acceleration (LWFA) mechanism allow to produce extremely short electron bunches of a few fs length with the energy up to a few GeV providing peak current of many kA in extremely compact geometries. This novel acceleration method therefore opens a new way to develop compact "laser-based" FELs. ELI beamlines is an international user facility for fundamental and applied research using ultra-intense lasers and ultra-short high-energy electron beams. In frame of this report we present conceptual solutions for an compact "LFWA" based soft X-ray FEL, which can deliver a photon peak brightness of 1031 ph/sec/mm2/mrad2/0.1%bw. A combination of this achievement with novel laser technologies will open a new perspective for the development of extremely compact FELs with few or even sub-femtosecond photon bunches for a very wide user community.

I will present the latest BELLA Center efforts towards realizing a free-electron laser (FEL) driven by a laser plasma accelerator (LPA). In addition to simulation and modeling results performed to optimize FEL performance, the experimental status of the laser system, accelerator, electron beam transport line, and characterization of the undulator, will be addressed. Several of our recent publications play a critical role in the LPA FEL project: Parametric studies of the LPA emittance for two injection techniques based on a single-shot dispersive diagnostic* will be presented, and recent insight into the advantages and limitations of active plasma lenses** will be covered.
