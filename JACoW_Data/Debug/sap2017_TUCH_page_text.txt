High power femtosecond laser pulse can be achieved as the technological innovation with chirped pulse amplification (CPA) and high power pulse amplification. The concept of laser plasma based accelerator has turn to realization in recent years. The laser intensity can be retained with a long distance in plasma through technical control of Rayleigh length, self-focusing, and laser guiding. Electrons can be accelerated upto GeV energy in centimeter scale, as there is no voltage breakdown in plasma, which results in a 100GV/m acceleration field as well. There are two main mechanisms of electron acceleration in laser-plasma acceleration, Direct laser acceleration (DLA) and Laser wakefiled acceleration (LWFA), which prevail in different plasma density regime. A 200-TW laser facility was recently built in Peking University, specified for laser plasma acceleration research. Different laser conditions were investigated to generate electrons which allow us to achieve electrons with energy up to 290 MeV with relatively small divergence angle of 4 mrad, and also can achieve lower energy electrons with several pC charge for direct imaging or generating X-ray for imaging as well.

In cases of low beam energy and high particle densities, space-charge effects become necessary discussions on transverse beam dynamics. It may cause a big enough tune shift in a circular accelerator moving the beam onto a resonance. In this paper, the transverse tune shift in High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) storage ring and booster ring caused by space-charge effects is firstly estimated based on the existing theory. Since the tune shift is at the level of 0.2, it may move the beam onto a resonance in the operation mode with high bunch charges. Then some simulations are made by tracking particles with elegant in the HEPS storage ring and booster including the space-charge effects. During the tracking, some particles are lost in HEPS booster ring with bunch charge of 14.4nC for the so called 'swap-out' mode. Further simulation shows that no particles would be lost if the charge of single bunch was less than 8.6nC in HEPS booster.
