In 2014 LANSCE accelerator facility return to 120 Hz pulse rate operation after long period of operation at 60 Hz pulse rate. Increased capabilities require careful tuning of all components of linear accelerator. Transformation to double pulse rate resulted in re-evaluation of tuning procedures in order to meet new challenges in beam operation. The paper summarizes experimental activity on sustaining of high productivity of accelerator facility while keeping beam losses along accelerator at the low level.

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator sys-tems have been performing continuously and progressively since commissioning in 2006 to deliver the neutrons to beamlines. The 1.4 MW design beam power has been demonstrated during 24/7 operation while developments and investigations for system improvements are still ongoing to achieve the full design beam power and availability. Numerous difficulties that impeded reaching the full performance of the SNS accelerator systems have been identified and are being eliminated through repairs, upgrades, and developments. In this report, operational performance and developments of the accelerator systems are presented along with the efforts for future upgrades of the SNS.

The flagship of Fermilab's long term research program is the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), located Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, which will study neutrino oscillations with a baseline of 1300 km. The neutrinos will be produced in the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF), a proposed new beam line from Fermilab's Main Injector. The physics goals of the DUNE require a proton beam with a power of roughly 2.5 MW at 120 GeV, which is roughly five times the current maximum power. This poster outlines the staged plan to achieve the required power over the next 15 years.
