The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is based on a continuous-wave superconducting heavy ion linac to accelerate all the stable isotopes to above 200 MeV/u with a beam power of up to 400 kW. At an average beam power approximately two-to-three orders-of-magnitude higher than those of operating heavy-ion facilities, FRIB stands at the power frontier of the accelerator family - the first time for heavy-ion accelerators. To realize this innovative performance, superconducting RF cavities are used starting at the very low energy of 500 keV/u, and beams with multiple charge states are accelerated simultaneously. Many technological challenges specific for this linac have been tackled by the FRIB team and collaborators. Furthermore, the distinct differences from the other types of linacs at the power front must be clearly understood to make the FRIB successful. This report summarizes the technical progress made in the past years to meet these challenges.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is currently in the preliminary design phase at Michigan State University (MSU). FRIB consists of a driver linac for the acceleration of heavy ion beams, followed by a fragmentation target station and a ReAccelerating facility (RεA). While FRIB is expected to start commissioning in 2017, the first stage of RεA called ReA3 is already under commissioning and was coupled to the Coupled Cyclotron Facility in 2012. Once FRIB is completed RεA will continue operation as post-accelerator facility for FRIB. RεA consists of a gas stopper, an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) charge state booster, a room temperature radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), a LINAC using superconducting quarter wave resonators, and an achromatic beam transport and distribution line to a new experimental area. An overview of the facility will be discussed. In particular, this talk will focus on the technical progress and commissioning results using pilot beams from the off-line ion source and charge bred beams from the online EBIT injector.
