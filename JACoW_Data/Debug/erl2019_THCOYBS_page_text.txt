Quality of photocathode in a photoinjector is one of the critical issues for the stability and reliability of the whole accelerator facility. In April 2013, the IR FEL lasing was demonstrated for the first time with the electron beam from the SRF gun with Cs2Te at HZDR. Cs2Te photocathode worked in SRF gun-I for more than one year without degradation. Currently, Mg photocathodes with QE up to 0.5% are applied in SRF Gun-II, generating e- beam with bunch charge up to 300 pC in CW mode with sub-ps bunch length for the high power THz radiation. It is an excellent demonstration that SRF guns can work reliably in a high power user facility.

The 113 MHz superconducting gun is used an electron source for the coherent electron cooling experiment. The unique feature of the gun is that a photocathode is held at room temperature. It allowed to preserve the quantum efficiency of Cs2KSb cathode which is adversely affected by cryogenic temperatures. Relatively low frequency permitted fully realize the accelerating field gradient what in turn helps to achieve 10 nC charge and 0.3 microns normalized emittance. We present the achieved performance and operational experience as well.

Stable operation of 3.5 cell DC-SRF photoinjector has been realized with average beam current of ~1mA at Peking university. A new 1.5 cell DC-SRF photoinjector has been designd and now is being constructed. In this talk we will give a brief introduction on the low emittance simulation of the new photoinjector, which indicates that emittance less than 0.5 um could be achieved at 100 pC bunch charge. Laser shaping, bi-alkali photocathode are all in progress.
