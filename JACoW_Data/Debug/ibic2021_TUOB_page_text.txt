Beam loss detection is essential for the machine protection and the fine tuning of the accelerator to reduce the induced radioactivity. The beam loss monitors (BLM) at the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) are mainly divided into the following types: the coaxial cylindrical ionization chamber (IC) filled with Ar/N2 gas mixture, Xe, BF3 gas, and the scintillator with photomul-tipliers, among which the Ar/N2 IC is the main type. In the low-energy section of the linac (beam energy <20 MeV), the BF3 BLMs enclosed by a high-density poly-ethylene (HDPE) moderator are utilized to detect the beam losses. The Monte Carlo program FLUKA is employed to perform the relevant simulations. This paper presents the summary of the beamloss detection for the CSNS BLM system.

For several years, the SLS storage ring was not equipped with any loss monitors; hence, any understanding of the operational losses, accidental losses, or manual beam dumps was missing. Initially, a long quartz fiber (350 m) was installed around the ring to locate losses, and read out with a photomultiplier tube. With the long fiber, we garnered some understanding yet, it was not easy to locate the position of the losses. Hence, we opted for scintillator based fiber loss monitors, installed in certain location. All the fibers are read out together with a single CMOS based 2.3MP camera. A device was built for 28 channels. 10 fibers were connected and are located in the injection kicker in the booster to ring transfer line and three Arcs storage ring. With these loss monitors, we were able to detect and locate the position of losses due to injection and sudden beam dumps or losses. In this poster, we will introduce the concept and the components of this monitor, and present the data processing algorithm that allow us to locate and track the losses in the SLS storage ring.
