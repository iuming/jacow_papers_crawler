The first shutter assembly outside of the Front End (FE) for Brockhouse X-Ray Diffraction and Scattering Sector (BXDS) beamline required a unique design solution to accommodate all components into required safety shutter position. Located between the IVW high energy wiggler monochromator and POE1 wall, the total envelope size approximated 1m x 0.660m (LxW). Accommodating a smaller space required an alternative shutter design than traditionally used implemented at the CLS. The alternative proposed design combined the collimator (CLM), safety shutter (SSH), photon shutter (PSH) and Fixed Mask (FM) into one chamber. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted on the FM and PSH assembly to verify that geometric designs were adequate for reasonable operation in the beamline. FEA was used to determine the steady-state thermal and static-structural response in both operating positions. Missteer was analyzed for both operating positions to a maximum of 2.5mm (commonly accepted missteer used at the CLS) from center. Finally, two extreme position (5mm) analyses were completed for determination of potential, but unlikely operating conditions.

The fast closing shutter (FCS) system plays an important role in protecting the ultra-high vacuum in the SPring-8 storage ring from a sudden vacuum accident in the beam-lines. In order to predict the transit time of the shock wave and the following pressure increase, a shock tube system with an inner diameter of 35 mm and a total length of 10 m was prepared to measure the shock Mach number. Experiments have been conducted that simulated an inrush of the atmosphere into the high-vacuum (~10-3 Pa) pipe by using a trigger system that combines of a thin cellophane diaphragm with a plunger. Special ionization gauges with a high-speed amplifier are distributed about every 1 m to detect the transit time of the shock wave and to measure the pressure in a low-pressure chamber after the actuation of the FCS system. By inserting vacuum components with various cross-sectional shapes including actual front-end components into the shock tube, the attenuation in the shock wave was systematically investigated.

Since the first commissioning in 1982, the 2.5-GeV Photon Factory storage ring has been upgraded three times in 1986, 1997 and 2005, in order to reduce the beam emittance and to create new four short straight sections for in-vacuum short period undulators. To satisfy the new boundary conditions of the upgrades, the beamline front ends were re-designed. We look back on the history of the beamline front-end components at the Photon Factory.

Accurate and stable x-ray beam position monitors (XBPMs) are key elements in obtaining the desired user beam stability in the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Currently, the APS is upgrading its facility to increase productivity and to provide far more highly coherent and brilliant hard x-rays to beamline experiments with a new storage ring magnet lattice based on a multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice. To improve the beam stability, one of the proposed beam diagnostics is the grazing-incidence insertion device x-ray beam position monitor (GRID-XBPM) for high heat load (HHL) front ends (FEs) at the APS. In this paper, final design of the GRID-XBPM and the high-power beam test results at beamline 27-ID-FE will be addressed.

Over the course of decades, the shape of the bulk shielding walls for synchrotron light sources has developed into a standard configuration, including a ratchet shape of the outer storage ring wall, to accommodate the clearance needs for front end and first optical enclosure assemblies. New state of the art light sources will have low emittance, high energy beams, which will give potential for higher beam losses. These losses will yield higher radiation dose rates at the downstream wall and stricter safety requirements in the first optical enclosure. Throughout the installation of local shields at NSLS-II, verification dose rate studies of various shielding configurations were performed. Analysis of these studies revealed that a circular outer bulk shield wall could greatly reduce the dose rate to the users who work near the front end optical components. This presentation discusses the benefits of this circular bulk shield wall verses the challenges of component installation near the wall and ways to mitigate them.

Currently under construction on Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory Campus, Campinas/SP, Sirius is a 3GeV, 4th Generation Synchrotron Light Source. In this paper we describe the Front End that has been designed to transmit the intense synchrotron radiation generated by the insertion devices that will generate the most critical thermal stress, with a peak power density of 55.7 kW/mrad² and a total power of 9.3kW at 500mA in the storage ring. The functions of the main components and their location in the layout are described. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and structural simulations, that have been carried out to verify the performance under the high heat loads generated by Sirius, are also detailed along with the limits of temperature and stress that have been employed in the design.

A superconducting wiggler (SCW) will be first employed to generate high energy X-rays for ultra-hard X-ray applications beamline at Shanghai synchrotron radiation facility (SSRF). The front-end will handle a heat load of 44.7 kW with a peak power density of 45 kW/mrad², which is much higher than the commissioned ones at SSRF. Overall design of the high heat load front-end has been completed, including one short absorber with a length of 300 mm and three long absorbers longer than 500 mm. Long absorbers have been designed to be made by medium speed wire-cut electrical discharge machining (WEDM-MS) or electron beam welding (EBW). Thermal analyses of all absorbers have also been done to comply with the failure criteria of SSRF.

The new insertion device beamlines in the PETRAIII extension project are arranged in three new sector types. Following will present the designs of the photon beamlines frontends for these sectors. The designs are based on the original design concept developed for the photon beamline frontends at PETRAIII. The aim of this generic approach was to minimize the number of specialized components for all beamlines. The existing girder concept allows a fast and reliable installation phase. The newly designed frontends aimed at using the same proven components and minimizing of the number of girder variations. There will be 4 new sectors with two undulator IDs in each sector. The canting angle between the undulators has been increased from 5mrad to 20mrad in difference to the generic beamlines. Additionally, two of the straight sections are modified. One straight section will be transformed in a side station sector with a 1mrad canting angle. The other straight section with the 40m long damping wiggler will be used as a single beamline with a hard X-ray source. The modifications of the original frontend design, the components and the deviations between the sector types are being presented.

The pulse-by-pulse X-ray beam monitor equipped with microstripline structure had been developed at SPring-8. This monitor has a potential to function as (1) a pulse intensity monitor, (2) a pulse-by-pulse X-ray beam position monitor (XBPM), and (3) a pulse timing monitor. In insertion device beamlines, however, it cannot be used without further improvement because of heat-resistance problem. Therefore, we examined a pulse-by-pulse XBPM for insertion device beamlines by introducing heat resistance structure, which employed a diamond heat sink. Thermal finite element analysis was carried out to design an effective structure of a detector head and the holder. Evaluation tests of the prototype will be also presented in this contribution.

The MAX IV laboratory is a Swedish national laboratory for synchrotron radiation hosted by the Lund University. It will operate two storage rings to produce synchrotron light of very high intensity and quality over a broad wavelength range. A linear accelerator will feed these storage rings in topping up mode as well as serve as an electron source for a short pulse facility built on its extension. The storage rings have different sizes and operate at different energies: the MAX IV 1.5 GeV ring has 12 straight sections optimized for soft x-rays; while the MAX IV 3.0 GeV ring, has 20 straight sections, optimized for harder x-rays. In the initial stage of the project, five beamlines are foreseen to operate on the 3.0 GeV storage ring and an additional five on the 1.5 GeV ring. Each beamline requires a front end to interface the different characteristics in terms of vacuum level, heat loads, radiation safety, beam size and position, with respect to the storage ring. This document describes the most recent developments of the different Front Ends project at MAXIV.

The European XFEL will generate up to 27000 ultra short X-ray pulses per second with a brilliance that is a billion times higher than that of the best conventional X-ray radiation sources. The outstanding characteristics of the facility are unique worldwide. Starting 2017, it will open up completely new research opportunities for scientists and industrial users *. To built up the more than 3km long Photon beam transport system it was necessary to create a complete CAD integration model with placeholders of optical and diagnostic elements and beam-line sections. The detailed 3D model has to be placed into this so called "overview assemblies". Later workshop and installation drawings were created from this overview assembly. This drawings helped the technicians/engineers to built up the whole system in the underground tunnel.

KEK has been operating two SR sources, the PF-ring and the PF-AR, for about thirty years. We have made a proposal of constructing a new SR facility, tentatively called KEK light source (KEK-LS). An extremely low-emittance storage ring based on the hybrid multi-bend achromatic (HMBA) lattice has been designed as a successor of the aged two rings. The undulator brightness almost approaches 1022 or exceeds 1022 in the soft X-ray to hard X-ray region. It is higher by two orders of magnitude than those of present 3rd generation light sources and by four orders from the PF-ring. The coherent fractions reach 10 % and 1 % at 1 keV and 10 keV, respectively. The KEK-LS will serve as the platform to advance the frontier of science using nanobeam, high-energy resolution beam and high coherent beam. We are conducting necessary studies to fully utilize the high brilliance beams emitted from KEK-LS. We designed beamline optics systems at 1 keV and 10 keV, respectively, and evaluated the beam performance. Also, we are making careful considerations as for the state-of-the-art technology of optics elements. Here, we present the typical beamline designs and the performance by lay-tracing simulations.

Minimizing Grating Slope Errors in the IEX Monochromator at the Advanced Photon Source

The IEX beamline at the APS is currently in the commissioning phase. The energy resolution of the beamline was not meeting original specifications by several orders of magnitude. The monochromator, an in-focus VLS-PGM, is currently configured with a high and a medium-line-density grating. Experimental results indicated that both gratings were contributing to the poor energy resolution and this led to venting the monochromator to investigate. The initial suspicion was that a systematic error had occurred in the ruling process on the VLS gratings, but that proved to not be the case. Instead the problem was isolated to mechanical constraints used to mount the gratings into their respective side-cooled holders. Modifications were made to the holders to eliminate problematic constraints without compromising the rest of the design. Metrology performed on the gratings in the original and modified holders demonstrated a 20-fold improvement in the surface profile error which was consistent with finite element analysis performed in support of the modifications. Two gratings were successfully reinstalled and subsequent measurements with beam show a dramatic improvement in energy resolution.

High Frequency UHV Mechanical X-Ray Beam Chopper
339

A mechanical chopper* has been designed and built to perform X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) experiments with operating liquid electrochemical cells at NAPP end station of ALBA Synchrotron (BL24, CIRCE). When operating the cell, to separate the weak currents induced by the X-ray absorption process at the electrode in contact with the electrolyte (TEY signal) from the faradaic current set between the electrodes, the incoming beam must be chopped at a certain frequency (w). Then, using a lock in amplifier, the signal at this frequency w can be extracted and measured. When the chopper is located in the beam path, it produces pulses with a frequency w, modulating the TEY signal. The chopper developed at ALBA, with variable frequency, improves previous designs which used piezo-actuated choppers constrained to work at fixed oscillating frequencies**. The design consists of a slotted disk that spins around an axis by means of an UHV stepper motor. A LED and photodiode based UHV sensor ensures that frequency drifts do not affect the measurements. The motor is hold by an internally water cooled OFHC support, which allows long duration experiments at high speeds without stopping.

A high power load monochromator has been constructed for computed tomography (CT) studies at the BioMedical Imaging and Therapy (BMIT) facility located at the Canadian Light Source. A non-dispersive pair of bent Laue-type crystals is used, with the first crystal water-cooled. The monochromator operates at energies from 25 to 150 keV, and the maximum width of the beam is 190 mm at crystal location. The beam intensity is between 1013 and 1014 photons/s/mm2 under typical operating conditions. In normal mode of operation, if the first crystal is bend with 3 N*m and the second crystal with 2 N*m torque, the measured FWHM of the spectral bandwidth at 50 keV is 1%. With the improved design of the holding springs, the monochromator is quite insensitive to vibrations, it can operate with small turbo pump attached for medium resolution imaging at 20-50 keV. Due to high power loads, the system experiences high out-gassing and a proper filter set to protect the crystal and to reduce the thermal drift is required. High level of radiation inside the monochromator vessel is the reason the operation of the system must be based only on mechanical end-switch calibration.

ANATOMIX is a new long beam-line (200 m) devoted to full-field tomography at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. It will operate in the energy range from 5 to 30 KeV, and feature 4 operation modes via versatile optics configurations, including direct white beam propagation. Aimed for tomography in the 17-25 KeV range, one of the operating modes implies the use of a wide beam achieved by a pair of mirrors focusing in the horizontal direction at a distance of 160 m from the experimental station. To define a secondary source, a specially-designed slit is located in the focal plane. The aperture is adjustable from 0 to 500 µm and a transverse movement allows scan of the whole slit at constant gap. A pair of tungsten cylinders act as slit blades, they are mounted on a support rotating around a vertical axis. The distance between the cylinders is fixed (500 µm), the actual beam aperture is the projection of the gap between the cylinders, defined by the rotation angle. The rotating block is mounted on a translation stage used both for slit scan and to remove the slit from the beam for direct beam operation. The cylinders are cooled through copper braids linked to water-cooled heat sinks.

To provide independent operation of the two 2-ID beamline experimental stations, a new canted beamline design is being developed. The constraint of keeping the existing front end limits the canting angle. The optimal canting angle was determined to be 400 urad and is achieved by using a permanent magnet. A coil is added to the canting magnet to provide a steering adjustment of maxi-mum 40 to 50 urad. In order to increase the beam separation as well as to provide power filtering and higher harmonics rejection for the downstream optics, a dual mirror system with focusing capability is used as the first optic at approximately 28 m from the center of the straight section. The inboard mirror (2.6 mrad) reflects the inboard beam outboard while the outboard mirror (4.1 mrad) reflects the outboard beam inboard. The beam presented to the dual mirror system is defined by two 1 mm x 1 mm apertures. The maximum power absorbed by each mirror is 200 W. Two vertically deflecting monochromators with minimum offset of 17 mm are located in the First Optical Enclosure on the outboard branch. The monochromator for the inboard branch is located in the corresponding experimental station.

An APPLE-II-type variable polarization undulator was installed at BL-13A/B in Photon Factory (PF) in the end of FY2014, and the user experiments were started in FY2015. Photon flux at BL-13 increased by nearly one order of magnitude compared to the previous one. BL-13A is mainly used for scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) measurements, while BL-13B is mainly dedicated to surface science using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) [*]. Present status of PF BL-13A/B will be presented in the poster.

One of the key components of the beam transport, in the SXR beam-line is the bendable focusing mirror system, operated in a Kirkpatrick-Baez Configuration. For the first time in the Synchrotron or FEL world, the large bending needed to focus the beam will be coupled with a cooling system, since the full FEL power is delivered through all of the optics to the sample. In this paper we will discuss the key design elements of the KB mirror system. We will cover the flexure hinge based bender mechanism which provides a well-defined axis of rotation. The flexure based twist and height correction mechanisms which allow correction for manufacturing and assembly tolerances. The parallel leaf spring lever arms which allow the use of relatively low bending forces with high resolution and do so while maintaining a constant direction of force application. The epoxy joint which was designed to minimize the tensile loading of the epoxy to increase its performance. We will then go on to discuss the cooling scheme which allows us to mechanically decouple the cooling system from the mirror.

The Energy Materials In-Situ Laboratory Berlin (EMIL) at BESSY-II is currently under completion *. The setup for EMIL consists of two canted undulators, providing a wide energy spectrum of 70 - 10.000 eV, three monochromators (two plane grating monochromators and one LN2-cooled double crystal monochromator) and ten mirror chambers for radiation dispersion and focusing into two separate pathways of 65 m length. Split-mirror chambers distribute the desired photon energy to one (or simultaneously to two) of five experimental endstations. The maximum lateral distance between all beamline elements is not more than one meter. This narrow design, selectable monochromators and several beam crossings require advanced modification of all vacuum chambers to enable variable beam routes. Long pathways demand a very high mechanical and thermal stability as well as a reproducible motion of all optical elements. The chosen constant strut-length hexapod design for the mirror chambers provides a wide range of movement in six degrees of freedom. We report on the optics of the beamline, monochromator characteristics and mechanics, proposed timelines and present first commissioning results.

The F-Switch is a new concept of device for the manipu-lation of large arrays of 2D CRLs or similar disc-shaped optical elements (12mm dia, 2mm thick) under high vac-uum. Unlike the well-known transfocator devices the optical elements are randomly selectable. This enables a number of potential modes of operation, including the fine adjustment of focal length by adjusting the effective lens centre position when using CRLs or the use of some positions within the array to implement filters or reference foils. Actuation and guidance is achieved within the thickness of the element, so that the overall length of the device is minimised. The device has been in user operation on the I04 MX beamline at Diamond Light Source (DLS) since 2015. Another device is being assembled for use on the I11 beamline at DLS. It is also hoped to install another device on the I03 beamline. We present details of the mechanical design of the F-Switch and some examples of its operation.

Synchrotron SOLEIL’s SixS beam-line is equipped with a 2D hybrid pixel detector coupled with an automatic attenuators system that allows data recording for (strong) intensity variations, preserving the 2D detector in its safe and linear range. The acquisition system is based on a "fly-scan" mode, providing very fast acquisition speeds. The fast automatic attenuators system (<10ms) inserts the attenuators using a binary sequence and the fast data acquisition allows to perform quantitative measurements of systems that can evolve in short time.

The live animal imaging program at the Bio-Medical Imaging and Therapy (BMIT) facility at the Canadian Light Source has been developing for the last 5 years and continues to grow. It is expected to become a large portion of the user activity as numerous groups work towards the goal of live animal studies. Synchrotron-based imaging of live animals is an opportunity for great science that also brings challenges and specific requirements for the experimental end-station. The beamline currently provides basic support and has been improving the facilities available. For example, there have been changes to the lab to allow for longer rodent housing and improved housing during measurements. Remote control of heat lamps and of flow rate for gas anaesthesia allow a veterinarian or animal care worker to make adjustments without interrupting the imaging. Integration of user equipment such as heart/breathing monitoring and ultrasound equipment with the beamline systems can be used for gating control of imaging. Future improvements will be done with consultation with university veterinarians and the user groups.

PETRA III as a third generation synchrotron source allows realizing new experimental methods. The MiNaXS beamline P03 is dedicated to aμand a nanofocus end-station. To the 2 existing CRL, the plan is to install two additional ones. The CRL3-system consists of a vacuum tank, a lens-exchanger with two train units and piezo driven motors and a Hexapod for alignment in the beam. At the train units are stacks of 1D BeCRL (1,2,4,8,16,32) to decouple horizontal and vertical focusing. The control of the piezo motors is done by an SPS and the separately moving train units by a normal stepper motor controller. CRL3 will allow for a focal distance of 600 mm with a small beam size below 3 µm, being especially adapted to complex in-situ setups [*,**,***].The CRL4 system will consist of two SpaceFab vacuum stages where on each one a "step shaped" arrangement of lenses is located, one for horizontal and one for vertical focusing. This is done to parallelize the beam shape and thus obtain a higher flux for the three downstream CRL systems and the nanofocus end station. We will present the technical challenges as well as the current status of both new CRL-station.

Upgrade the Beamline PF-AR NW14A for the High-Repetition-Rate X-Ray Pump-Probe Experiments

We report the upgrade of the x-ray pump probe system to high repetition rate at the beamline PF-AR NW14A. A 400 fs high-repetition rate fiber laser system (Amplitude, Tangerine) was newly installed. The fiber laser system, which is operated at 1030 nm fundamental wavelength, is capable of reaching up to 0.1 mJ pulse with a repetition rate of 400 kHz. A higher harmonic generation system enlarges the spectral range from UV to mid-infrared. To increase the laser power density at a sample position, the x-ray was additionally focused by a polycapillary lens (Polycapillary Optics, XOS). The synchronization of X-ray and laser pulses is based on the RF master clock of the storage ring. The delay between the laser and the X-ray is controlled by changing the emission timing of the laser with a Trigger & Clock Delay Module (84DgR5CO1, CANDOX). The high repetition rate system increases experimental efficiency 400 times.

The European XFEL will start user operation early 2017. The unique bunch structure of 600µs long bunch trains @ 10Hz delivering up to 2.700 bunches set strong demands on sample delivery. Each bunch will be intense enough to completely disintegrate the sample. Therefore, the Sample Environment group * develops fast replacement techniques of samples to operate experiments at the high rep rate of the Eur. XFEL. Serial femtosecond crystallography and single particle imaging on biological samples will be performed at the SPB/SFX instruments of the Eur. XFEL. The Sample Environment group will organize the biological user support. Main sample delivery methods will be microscopic liquid jets for SFX and aerosol sources for SPI. Some experiments will require quickly changing samples that are delivered on surfaces or on x-ray transparent windows. For this type of samples, the Sample Environment group develops a fast solid sample scanner with load-lock exchange system. For experiments on the reaction of materials to fast changing external fields the Sample environment group develops in collaboration with the ESRF and DESY a compact pulsed magnets in the 30 Tesla range (pulse length ~1ms).

Sector 1-ID at the APS accommodates a number of different experimental techniques in the same spatial envelope of the E-hutch end station. These include high energy small and wide angle x-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), high energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM, both near and far field modes) and X-ray tomography. These techniques are frequently combined to allow the users to obtain multimodal data with 1 um spatial resolution and 0.05° angular resolution. Furthermore, these techniques are utilized while the sample is thermo-mechanically loaded to mimic real operating conditions. The instrumentation required for each of these techniques has been designed and configured in a modular way with a focus on stability and repeatability between changeovers. This not only allows the end station to be used for a greater number of techniques but it also results in a reduction of time and effort typically required for set up and alignment. Key instrumentation design features and layout of the end station are presented.

The BioXAS beam-lines are a recently completed group of beam-lines at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The BioXAS EXAFS beam-lines host three 32-element germanium detectors. There was a need to introduce an exchangeable filter between the soller slits and the 32-element germanium detectors. It was further required to have an automated filter exchange system so that users could quickly vary filter thicknesses and types to determine the effect on the signal. An auto-mounting filter system was created to meet these requirements and allows users to quickly exchange filters without breaking experimental hutch lockup. The auto-mounter cartridge can hold up to ten slides that measure 100mm X 55mm in cross-section. The device inserts slides in an extremely small envelope between the soller slits and the liquid helium cryostat. The auto-mounter assembly also houses the stages required to actuate the soller slits laterally and vertically. During device commissioning we performed 800 consecutive successful filter exchanges as part of a stress test. The spatial constraints, mechanics, and fabrication of the device will be presented. Software development will also be discussed.

The Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) Lift is a large, high precision, eight stage positioning and scanning system installed at BMIT Facility. In order to guarantee a uniform exposure rate of the sample, the vertical speed of the main stage (Zscan) is constant with <1% error over the 700 mm vertical excursion. It may reach 200 mm/s. The main CT stage (PHI1) can rotate 120 kg load with speed up to 30 rpm. The verified accuracy of the motion is less than 5 Um. Other stages include: Ytrans - horizontal positioning of the vertical rotational axis to the beam, PHI2 - kappa axis used for specimen positioning, PHI3 - rotary axis used for specimen positioning and Xpos, Ypos , Zpos: fine positioning stages. Alignment of the sample using the MRT Lift is a time consuming and challenging task. The BMIT Group has developed a Python-based MRT Lift positioning and control program that uses a combination of computational and iterative methods to independently adjust the sample’s X, Y, Z, pitch and roll positions. Integration with the SolidWorks modelling platform allows high quality renderings of the MRT Lift in its current or proposed position to be displayed in real time.

Recent macromolecular crystallography beamlines are targeting smaller crystals. Minimum crystal size is now less than 10 microns. Microfocus beamline is one of essential tools for the structure determination using such smaller crystals. At microfocus beamline, more stable beam operation is required. BL-17A is a macromolecular crystallography beamline at the Photon Factory in Japan and was renewed for structural studies using smaller crystals in summer shutdown of 2014 and 2015. In order to reduce the vibration defect originated from the experimental hall floor, we have reinforced a particular section of the floor, where the main optical components of BL-17A are placed. The thickness of the concrete of the floor was increased from 200 mm to 500 mm with more dense reinforcement grid and the new concrete was tightly connected to the floor frame. To evaluate the effects of the floor improvement, we measured the distortion of the floor by weighting with an autocollimator and observed the fluctuation of the beam position and intensity by dropping a weight around the beamline. The results showed that the beam stabilization was sufficiently improved after the reinforcing works.

A scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) is a powerful tool to analyze 2-dimensional chemical states with high spatial resolution. In UVSOR Synchrotron (Okazaki, Japan), the STXM beam-line has been opened for general users since 2013 and has been improved for two significant features; in-situ/operando measurement and use of low energy photons. We have been developing in-situ/operando measurements, such as humidity control, electrochemistry and polarization dependence of oriented molecules*. Furthermore, feasibility of quantitative 3-dimensional (3D) morphological analysis by computed tomography has been tested to perform 3D chemical state analysis. UVSOR Synchrotron has an advantage of photon fluxes in the low energy region from VUV to soft X-rays. In this region, not only the K-edges of light elements but also a lot of L-edges and M-edges of metals can be targets of the chemical analysis. Therefore, we have been exploring for the lower energy analysis; that is, one of our targets is the Li K-edge. Currently, the energy from 100 to 770 eV is available. In this presentation, recent progress of BL4U and development of in-situ/operando measurement methods will be reported.

DSSC (DEPMOS Sensor with Signal Compression) is a non-linear gain DEPFET sensor for the energy range 0.5-6 keV. This is a development project for Eu-XFEL led by the MPG’s Semiconductor Laboratory. This is a silicon detector with ~40000 um2 hexagonal pixels. The Photon Science Detector Group at DESY has the responsibility for the Mechanics/Thermal Workpackage of DSSC. This presents a challenge particularly because ~400 W are put out by the electronics in the in-vacuum detector head (by sensors and electronics boards). The heat load distributes in four cooling blocks (which are movable) where the cooling-tubes welded in. The aim is to achieve -20°C sensor temperature on each Sensor (four per block). The detector components (very sensitive and expensive electronics) will be operated in vacuum. Therefore it is important that coolant-liquid is safe enclosed. From that idea starts the design of double-walled bellow cooling pipes, this has few benefits. More reliability with the silicone fluid inside the pipes to prevent the inner detector parts from condensation or leakage inside the vessel, Insulating vacuum between the coolant bellows for more performance.

We present the final engineering design and first commissioning results of two highly integrated experimental stations for the micro-focusing (FMX) and the highly automated (AMX) MX beamlines at the NSLS-II. These beamlines will support a broad range of biomedical structure determination methods. The experimental stations are designed and fabricated in-house to meet the challenging requirements resulting from the small beam size of 1 µm and the extremely short working distance of only 190 mm from the beam exit window to the FMX focal spot. The compact beam conditioning unit contains, within 140 mm, a beam position monitor, an attenuator, primary slits, an intensity monitor, a sub-millisecond shutter, and secondary slits. The diffractometers consist of an interchangeable dual axis air bearing-based goniometers with a target sphere of confusion of 100 nm, an on-axis microscope, an x-ray fluorescence detector and dynamic beam shaping slits. The end stations are integrated in a compact space on a granite machine bed with high modularity for future upgrades and extensions. Real-time autonomous robotic systems are being implemented for high through-put cryogenic sample handling.

The RIXS endstation of ADRESS beamline at Swiss Light Source (SLS) is equipped with an ultrahigh resolution X-ray spectrometer. The spectrometer with a length of 5 m is installed on a rotating girder platform and allows varying scattering angles from 30° to 130°. The position of the CCD detector is longitudinally adjustable on the girder and vertically adjustable on a moving frame to allow an angle between 2° to 15° in the vertical plane. In the scope of a CCD camera upgrade, the modification of the vertical alignment of the guiding structure and ultra-high vacuum tanks became necessary. The new camera with a higher resolution and larger detector size weights around 25 kg. It is required to have a vibration amplitude well below 2 micrometer. We will present the critical design parameters of the upgrade, and the effort to increase bending stiffness of vacuum guide structure while keeping major geometry parameters. In addition, kinematic overdeterminacy was removed. After the upgrade we performed vibration measurements verifying that dynamic stability of the camera is improved, and design goal is reached. The site acceptance test confirmed the proper operation of the new mechanism.

For the experiments at synchrotron radiation source BESSY II synchrotron of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin a new end station and a new beam-line were developed and are now in user operation. The end station contains a 9-2-1 Tesla vectorial magnet and a cryostat with manipulator for the sample cooling and positioning, an UHV deposition chamber, and an UHV detector chamber. We report here on the technical design of the detector chamber which is placed below the magnet chamber and is also connected to the deposition chamber. Because of various constrains a sophisticated mechanics had to be developed to provide integrated functionality for both the detector holder and the sample transfer units. The detector unit consists of a tubular holder of 5 cm diameter which travels more than 60 cm vertically and exhibits an unlimited rotation degree of freedom of 360 degrees within the magnet bore. The sample transfer unit consists of a telescopic movement mechanism allowing for the sample holder vertical travel within the detector tubular holder. The functionality challenges and their resolve were addressed in an innovative mechanical design.

Exit slit edge geometry and paired edge parallelism can directly impact performance of a synchrotron beamline. At the same time, maximizing the performance of an existing design is often a financial and logistical necessity. The construction project for beamline 7.0.1 (BL7.0.1, COherent Scattering and MICroscopy (COSMIC)) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) consists of two branch lines, each of which has vertical and horizontal slit assemblies. These assemblies were fabricated from a preexisting design, positively impacting project schedule and budget. Apart from orientation, the slit assemblies are identical. The goal for parallelism is ± 2 microns over the full 25 mm length. The each slit blade edge can travel ± 5 mm about the beam center with the resolution of a micron; slits can scan over that range with a nominal size of about 10 microns. A variety of fabrication and metrology techniques were implemented to maximize the performance of the current design and future areas of improvement in fabrication, metrology, and design were identified.

At Small-angle X-ray Scattering beamlines (SAXS), beamstops are needed to block the intense primary beam that has not been scattered by the sample in order to protect the detector from any damage. Beamstops are usually confined inside a vacuum tube minimizing air space between the sample and the detector. For certain experiments, a motorized beamstop is required to achieve a precise positioning in different regions of the detector active area. ALBA has developed a new motorized beamstop* consisting of a two-rotation mechanism inside vacuum that composes a movement able to cover all range of the active area of the detector. The presented solution involves a main rotation reached by a gear and a worm drive actuated by a stepper motor and a second rotation relative to the main one produced by a piezo rotation stage. For each position appears two different solutions. This characteristic permits take two equivalent images in the detector with the same beamstop position but different orientation in the beamstop support; thus permitting the compensation of the support shadow on the active area of the detector.

A patient positioning system (PPS) is required to position human patients for high sensitivity, high resolution imaging in IMBL radiation enclosure 3B. The core requirement is the access of any section of a human body for imaging within a large range of orientations (rotation and tilt) using X-ray beams between 1.4 and 2.1m from the enclosure floor whilst allowing a direct path for the X-rays to pass through the area to be imaged and onto the detector. The system will normally use the horizontal monochromatic X-ray beam at 1420mm from the floor but will have a working envelope allowing the use of a beam inclined at 7° from the horizontal and produced several meters upstream from enclosure. The area of interest is from the top of the shoulders to the ankles. A collaboration with BEC Engineering has lead to the robotic solution. A Kuka robot will be suspended from 8m linear rail suspended from a gantry mounted to the hutch wall. A custom modular chair has been designed for the robot knuckle, it will accommodate the range of positions required for imaging and with adjustable and removable sections to allow a clear path for the beam.

The Materials Imaging and Dynamics (MID) instrument of the European XFEL facility will provide unique capabilities in materials imaging and dynamics experiments, with particular focus on the application of coherent X-ray scattering and diffraction techniques. Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) experiments are at the heart of the activities planned at the MID station, but also time-resolved scattering and imaging studies can be foreseen, taking advantage of the time structure and high flux of the X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) beam. Here we present the technical realizations of the devices inside the Optics and Experimental Hutches. SAXS, WAXS and large field of view configurations are shown.

The High Energy Density (HED) instrument is one out of six end-stations currently being constructed at the European XFEL GmbH. One of the scientific fields is the investigation of extreme high energy density states driven by high-energy and high-intensity lasers at a repetition rate of up to 10 Hz. To operate the laser systems and align the laser pulses with the X-ray pulses strong requirements to the environment like temperature stability and low vibrations are requested. The laser induced radiation requires heavy concrete shielding and also has influences to the layout of the interaction chamber. A second interaction area is prepared for further scientific set-ups that cannot be hosted in the main interaction chamber provided by external scientific groups e.g. the HIBEF user consortium.

The combined contributions of the European XFEL and the Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX) user consortium will setup a state-of-the-art experimental instrument to study the structure and dynamical behavior of biological samples with x-ray diffractive imaging methods at atomic resolution and to initiate and follow conformational dynamics of these samples with down to femtosecond time resolution. Ultrashort x-ray pulses in the range of only a few up to several 100s of femtoseconds are so short that the exposure of a sample is over before x-ray-induced radiation damage effects can alter the atomic structure Therefore, a radiation dose far above the conventional radiation damage limits can be applied to a sample in a Â“diffraction before destructionÂ” approach. Therefore, with such femtosecond snapshots high-resolution diffraction data can be obtained from samples unperturbed by radiation damage effects. At the same time, data collection can be performed at room temperature, avoiding cryogenic conditions, which helps to keep biological samples close to their native conformation and allows for time-resolved studies of dynamical conformational behaviour.
