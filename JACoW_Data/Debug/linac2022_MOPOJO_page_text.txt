This paper discusses recently proposed Higgs-Energy LEptoN (HELEN) e+e’ linear collider based on advances superconducting radio frequency technology. The collider offers cost and AC power savings, smaller footprint (relative to the ILC), and could be built at Fermilab with an Interaction Region within the site boundaries. After the initial physics run at 250 GeV, the collider could be upgraded either to higher luminosity or to higher (up to 500 GeV) energies.

The medical isoptope Mo-99 is used for diagnosing several 10 million patients every year. Up to now it is produced from enriched Uranium using high-flux neutron reactors. The Institute for Radio Elements (IRE), Belgium has ordered the design of a high-power superconducting linac for producing Mo-99 without use of nuclear fission as part of their SMART project. The LightHouse accelerator consists of a photo gun and 7 superconducting RF modules"*", a beam splitter and target illumination optics. It will deliver two electron beam of 75MeV and 1.5MW each. Photocathodes are prepared and transfered in-situ. We report on the design principles and the Beam Test Facility operating since April 2022.
*Based on Cornell CBeta design

Here, we report our first step towards tackling this issue at the roots by irradiating the pharmaceutical effluents from a stages of their existing treatment plant with an Electron Beam (EB) with doses varying from 25 kGy to 200 kGy. We have used a normal conducting pulsed wave linear accelerator developed by SAMEER. It produced a pencil beam of electrons of energy 6 MeV with an average current of 16 micro-Ampere. To ensure optimum dose delivery, Fluka-Flair Simulations have been used. We have successfully demonstrated that electron beam irradiation along with the use of conventional techniques like coagulation after the irradiation can further increase the efficacy of the process with a final reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) to be as large as 65% in some of the cases.

High-energy electron accelerators have been used in water purification for several years. They are very effective for the removal of complex impurities. This study aims to design a superconducting electron beam accelerator with an output energy of 1 MeV and beam power of 40 kW for wastewater treatment. A 1.3 GHz single cell elliptic cavity with β = 1 was designed and optimized for TM010 mode and an accelerating gradient of 15 MV/m. For the optimized cavity, the RF parameters, namely, R/Q, transit time factor and geometry factor (G) were found to be 174.93 ohm, 0.67 and 276 ohm, respectively. Multiphysics studies showed that the value of R/Q for fundamental accelerating mode was 174.93 ohm. It was much higher than that of other modes, thus, HOM coupler is not required for the system. The Lorentz force detuning coefficient after stiffening the cavity iris, and the temperature rise due to the RF surface losses were found to be 0.20 Hz/(MV/m)2 and 0.085 K, respectively. It is also observed that there is no occurrence of multipacting for the designed accelerating gradient.

A high-pulse-current injector followed by a short high-gradient X-band linac is considered as a driver for a compact Inverse Compton Scattering source. We show that using a high-power ultrashort pulse laser operating in burst mode and a Fabry-Pérot enhancement cavity, X-rays with flux values over 1013 ph/s and photon energies up to MeV are achievable. The resulting high-intensity and high-energy X-rays allow for various applications, including cancer therapy, tomography, and nuclear waste management. A preliminary conceptual design of such a compact ICS source is presented, together with simulations of the expected performance.

The LINAC Test Facility (LTF) based at Daresbury Laboratory supports research and development of applications in medical, security, and environmental technologies through the operation of a Compact LINAC. This facility has been operated and upgraded over several years and this work has been performed in a collaboration between STFC and Teledyne e2v, enabling the facility to deliver an increased accelerating gradient of 6 MeV, which has broadened the capability to provide testing of radiotherapy and security scanning technologies. This paper de-scribes the developments undertaken, the benefits gained by both parties, and future planned improvements.

X-ray based Cargo and Vehicle Inspection (CVI) systems are used for security and customs inspections at a variety of locations. To provide the maximum flexibility many users require mobile CVI systems to allow vehicles to be screened efficiently for threats and contraband. The need for mobile systems means that the linear accelerator, and ancillary systems, used to generate the x-rays must be compact, rugged, and reliable. These systems must meet image performance tests specified by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The IEC also defines a standard for material discrimination. The requirements of these standards mean that the x-ray output produced by the linac needs to be consistent during and between scans, with the stability and repeatability of the output being critical. The tolerances on the linac output to meet the performance standards combined with the need for a compact system gives an unusual challenge for the linac design. A review of how different stability measures impact the performance tests is presented. This is compared to current technologies and possible future linacs used for mobile CVI systems.

We present the design of a compact, 10 MeV, 300 mA pulsed X-band linac developed for medical application. The layout, <1 m including gun, buncher, capture section and current monitor, is of a recent configuration in which the 36 main linac cavities are individually fed in parallel through side waveguide manifolds, allowing for split fabrication. Initially destined for experimental study of FLASH irradiation of mouse tumors, the design was developed as a prototype for realization of a PHASER cancer treatment machine, in which multiple linacs, powered sequentially from a common RF source, are to provide rapid treatment to patients from multiple directions without mechanical movement, delivering dosage on a time scale that essentially freezes the patient. In this paper, we focus on the RF design, beam capture optimization, mechanical design and fabrication of the linac itself, deferring discussion of other important aspects such as window and target design, experimental specification setting, radiation shielding and operations.

The use of electronic brachytherapy (EB) has grown rapidly over the past decade. It is gaining significant interest from the global medical community as an improved user-friendly technology to reduce the usage of Ir-192. However, the present EB machines all use electron beams at energies of 100 kV or less to generate the X-ray photons, which limits their use to low dose-rate brachytherapy. We focus on the development of a compact and light weight 1-MeV linac to generate and deliver >250 kV X-ray photons to the patient. The device is intended to retrofit to existing brachytherapy applicators. In this paper we will report progress on this project.

We report on the development of a cryogenic X-band (11.424 GHz) accelerator to provide electron beams for Very High Energy Electron therapy. The distributed coupling linac is designed with a 135° phase advance, capable of producing a 100 MeV/m accelerating gradient in a one-meter structure using only 19 MW when operating at 77 K. This peak power will be achieved through pulse compression of a 5-8 MW few-µs pulse, ensuring compatibility with a commercial power source. We present designs of the cryogenic linac and power distribution system, as well as a room temperature pulse compressor using the HE11 mode in a corrugated cavity. We discuss scaling this compact and economical design into a 16 linac array that can achieve FLASH dose rates (> 40 Gy/s) while eliminating the downtime associated with gantry motion.

Here we present, the design and optimization of a 100 kV DC thermionic electron gun, and a transport channel that provides transverse focusing through a normal conducting solenoid and longitudinal bunching with the help of a single gap buncher for a 1.3 GHz, 40 kW, 1 MeV superconducting electron accelerator. The accelerator is proposed to treat various contaminants present in potable water resources. A 100 kV thermionic electron gun with LaB6 as its cathode material was intended to extract a maximum beam current of 500 mA. To minimize beam emittance, gun geometry i.e. cathode radius, and height and radius of the focusing electrode are optimized. The minimal obtained emittance at the gun exit is 0.3 mm.mrad. A normal conducting focusing solenoid with an iron encasing is designed and optimized to match and transport the beam from gun exit to the superconducting cavity. Finally, a 1.3 GHz ELBE type buncher is designed and optimized to bunch the electron beam for further acceleration.

We are developing an accelerator-based terahertz source that can produce arbitrary polarization states from linearly polarized coherent undulator radiation (CUR). The polarization manipulation of the CUR can be realized using the Martin’Puplett interferometer employed as an optical phase shifter. This study also demonstrates a variable polarization manipulator by using the terahertz CUR (THz-CUR) source based on an extremely short electron bunch at Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH), Tohoku University. The horizontally polarized CUR with a frequency of 1.9 THz was manipulated into variable polarization state, and Stokes parameters were measured to derive the degree of polarization. Beam experimental results will be presented in this conference.

The Diamond Light Source pre-injector linac generates single bunch and multibunch 100 MeV electron beams for top-up and fill of the storage ring. The linac is powered by two high-power 3 GHz klystrons, and both klystrons are required for reliable injection into the booster and storage ring. In order to introduce redundancy, a SLED pulse compression cavity has been installed so that the linac can operate from just one klystron, with the second klystron held as a standby. A simple phase flip can be used to generate a high-power transient RF spike, suitable for single bunch linac operation, and a programmable amplitude and phase drive profile can be specified to generate a constant-power klystron output suitable for multibunch operation. Details are presented of design, installation and high-power operation of the SLED system, and the ability to generate a long pulse, including corrections for klystron nonlinearity and deviations from modulator flat-top, is demonstrated.
