The multipurpose CW accelerator ELBE at HZDR, which is delivering a large set of secondary beams, is driven by a thermionic DC injector. In order to enhance the machine's beam quality, the development of a superconducting RF injector has been pursued since the early 2000ies. The corresponding ELBE SRF Gun I of 2007 and Gun II of 2014 already delivered beam for the operation of several user beamlines, such as the FEL, positron generation, and THz facility. Currently, the next version ' Gun III ' and its cryomodule are being assembled, characterized, and prepared for the final commissioning throughout late 2017/early 2018. The new module benefits from the experiences in terms of emittance compensation and surveillance of operation variables made with the two predecessors. Results of the latest Gun II operations as well as first commissioning data of the Gun III module will be presented.

The superconducting linear accelerator ELBE is operated in continuous wave operation (CW). The analogue LLRF system, used since 2001, is going to be replaced by a digital solution based on MTCA.4. The new system enables a higher flexibility, better performance and more advanced diagnostics. The contribution will show the performance of the system at ELBE, the hardware and the software structure. Further it will summarize the last steps to bring it into full user operation and give an outlook to the envisioned beam-based feedback system that will take advantage of the capabilities of the digital LLRF system.

SwissFEL is a free electron laser user facility at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland designed to provide FEL radiation at photon energies ranging from 0.2 to 12 keV. Beam commissioning of the hard x-ray line ARAMIS has started in October 2016 and lasing at 300 eV was achieved in May 2017. First pilot user experiments at photon energies ≥ 2 keV are foreseen for the end of 2017. This contribution comprehends commissioning results and first operational experience of various diagnostics systems, such as beam position monitors, charge and loss monitors as well as transverse profile measurements with screens, wire scanners and synchrotron radiation monitors. It also provides information about sliced beam parameters using a transverse deflector and shows first results from the BC-1 compression monitor and measurements with the electron bunch arrival time monitors.

Funding: The ATF is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Brookhaven National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-98CH10886
The Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at Brookhaven National Lab is an Office of Science user facility focusing on advanced acceleration techniques. It houses several electron beamlines synchronized to high power lasers, including a TW-class carbon dioxide (10 micron) laser. Here we outline ongoing upgrades to both the accelerator and laser systems, give a brief overview of the experimental landscape, and report on the recent commissioning of a newly installed X-band deflector cavity [1]. The deflector cavity is implemented as a longitudinal electron beam diagnostic, which will allow us to measure the structure of ultra-short bunches.

The beam transport line (BT) for the Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR), which is a 6.5-GeV light source of KEK, has been recently renewed. The new BT dedicated to PF-AR allows not only simultaneous operation with the SuperKEKB storage ring, which has a much shorter Touschek lifetime, but also the top-up operation via 6.5-GeV full-energy injection. The construction, including tunnel excavation, was completed by the end of 2016, and the commissioning was performed for one month from February 2017. Standard beam monitors, such as stripline beam position monitors, screen monitors, beam loss monitors, and fast current transformers are installed in the new BT and contribute greatly to accomplishing the commissioning in a short period of time. This paper discusses details of these monitors and some commissioning results obtained by using them.

In the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project, the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) will be extensively modified during the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2, 2019-2020) at CERN [1]. This includes a new injector, Linac4, which will provide a 160 MeV H− beam and a complete new injection section for the PSB composed essentially of a chicane and a stripping foil system. The equivalent of half of this new injection chicane, so-called Half-Sector Test (HST), was tempo-rarily installed in the Linac4 transfer line to evaluate the performance of the novel beam instrumentation, such as, stripping foils, monitoring screens, beam cur-rent transformers, H0/H− monitor and dump, beam loss monitors, and beam position monitors. The results of the instrumentation commissioning of the HST are presented in this paper.
