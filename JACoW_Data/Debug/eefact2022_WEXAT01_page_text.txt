The beam-beam interaction is one of the most critical factors determining the luminosity performance of SuperKEKB. Simulations and experimental results from SuperKEKB have shown that a complete understanding of the beam-beam effects demands reliable models of 1) the nonlinear beam-beam interaction at the interaction point, 2) the one-turn lattice transfer map with machine imperfections, and 3) other intensity-dependent collective effects. The interplay of these factors makes it difficult to predict the luminosity performance of SuperKEKB via simulations. This paper continues the authors’ previous work* to discuss the beam-beam effects on luminosity in SuperKEKB.

Emittance increase has been seen in SuperKEKB LER. It is pure single bunch effect: dependent of bunch current but independent of total current. -1 mode signal has been seen in the bunch oscillation recorder at the emittance increase. The emittance increase depends on collimator aperture/impedance and bunch-by-bunch feedback system. We discuss the instability measurement and simulations to explain the phenomenon.

In the future colliders, with extreme parameters, such as very intense beam population, low emittances, small beta functions, large Piwinski angle, the stability of beam-beam interaction is very sensitive to longitudinal dynamics. Therefore, both the beam-beam simulation and theroretical analysis should consider the longitudinal impedance in a self-consistent way. In this paper, we develop an analysis method to study the beam-beam instability with longitudinal impedance.

The design performance of future e+e− ring colliders has been pushed to new extreme based on the crab-waist scheme. The new found coherent head-tail instability (X-Z instability) may induce the horizontal beam size blowup and reduce the machine performance. The longitudinal coupling impedance would distort the phase space: lengthen the bunch and bring incoherent synchrotron tune spread. The simulation study has found the clear influence of longitudinal impedance on the X-Z instability in both CEPC and FCCee. With the evolvement of future machine design process, the transverse impedance has also been included. The results show that a vertical beam-beam TMCI-like instability may be induced when the impedance is considered. It is first found in e+e− colliders. Some similar study at SuperKEKB will also be presented. It could be expected or concluded that different effect would couple and determine the final performance together in present and future high performance crab-waist colliders. Separate effect study seems not enough to evaluate and predict the machine performance/stability.
