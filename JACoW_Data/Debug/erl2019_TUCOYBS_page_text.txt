Superconducting cavities with two beam pipes have been proposed in the past for energy recovery linac applications. The relatively complex geometry of those cavities presented a serious challenge for fabrication and surface processing. Main concerns have now been overcome with the production and successful RF testing of a new elliptical twin-axis cavity proposed by Jefferson Lab and optimized by the Center for Accelerator Science at Old Dominion University in the frame of a DoE accelerator stewardship program. The cavity design provides uniform accelerating or decelerating fields for both beams. This paper describes the cavity design, fabrication experience, and the first cold RF test results and explores potential applications especially for the proposed Jefferson Lab electron-ion Collider (JLEIC).

MESA and BERLinPro are two Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) projects, both currently under construction at Germany. Both projects are running on the TESLA operation frequency of 1.3 GHz. Despite the different goals for future operation and achievable beam current the main linac cryomodule of MESA is planned to be integrated into the BERLinPro ring in order to perform high current beam tests. This unique opportunity is beneficial for both projects. Nevertheless, there are some challenges coming with the integration of the modules at Berlin. We will give an overview of the planned experiments and will report in particular on the adaption of SRF and cryosystems. Despite the diverse goals, the main linac, providing the larger part of the particles energy, is fairly compatible. It is planned to test and run the MESA linac module in BERLinPro, prior to its usage in MESA. The goals and benefits of this unique cooperation for both projects are outlined in this paper. The necessary adaptions in BERLinPro, including hardware aspects, the new optics, and the scope of performance are outlined in the paper.
