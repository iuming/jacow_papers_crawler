Advanced Computational Methods for Vacuum Technology With Application to Synchrotron Radiation Light Sources

Following the progress in the design and improvement of their performances, the new generations of light sources have come to a point where diffraction-limited x-ray beams are a reality. This evolutionary trend has required a parallel evolution of the design of their vacuum systems, and the application of cross-disciplinary discoveries in the field of materials, surface treatments, thin-films, pumping technology, and more. This 2 ½ hour tutorial will follow the following program: ▪ Basics of gas dynamics: outgassing, conductance, pumping speed. ▪ Basics of synchrotron radiation (SR), with examples relevant to vacuum design. ▪ SR-induced desorption. ▪ Computational methods for vacuum: a review. ▪ Practical examples of analysis, simulation, and design of key components of light sources. ▪ Summary and conclusions.

Finite Element Analysis in Design of Synchrotron Instrumentation - Issues, Good Practices and New Horizons

Finite Element Analysis(FEA) is a design tool widely implemented in the design of synchrotron instrumentation to predict behavior of a particular design under the assumed real life conditions. Although FEA is a very popular and trusted design tool in use for several decades, it is of paramount importance to emphasize that it is only as accurate as the user’s input into the analysis and the interpretation of the results. In its introduction the tutorial will cover the importance of accurate inputs into the analysis and correct interpretation of the results as well as the best practices in how to improve said accuracies. Second part will cover the nature of the phenomena analyzed with thermal and structural simulations with the emphasis on the seemingly paradoxical fact that thermally loaded structures frequently fail only upon load removal. The third part will cover thermal and structural simulations with several examples. The tutorial will be concluded with alternate applications of FEA in the design of synchrotron instrumentation. Examples of multi-physic and vibration analysis, component weight optimization, and the analysis of the acoustic levitation supports will be presented.
