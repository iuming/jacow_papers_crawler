Funding: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 721559.
Beams of low energy antiprotons in the keV energy range are very difficult to characterize due to their low intensity of only 107 particles per shot, annihiliation, and low repetition rate. The project AVA (Accelerators Validating Antimatter physics) is an Innovative Training Network within the H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. It enables an interdisciplinary and cross-sector program on antimatter research across 3 scientific work packages. These cover facility design and optimization, advanced beam diagnostics and novel low energy antimatter experiments. This contribution presents the AVA R&D into beam profile, position and intensity measurements, as well as detector tests which will provide an order of magnitude improvement in the resolution and sensitivity in closely related areas. It also summarizes the interdisciplinary training program that AVA will provide to its 15 Fellows, as well as to the wider antimatter and accelerator communities.

Proton therapy is now recognized as one of the most effective radiation therapy methods for cancers. A proton therapy facility with multiple gantry treatment rooms is under development in HUST (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), which is based on isochronous superconducting cyclotron scheme. The 250MeV/500nA proton beam will be extracted from a superconducting cyclotron and injected into the beam-line. Many beam diagnostic instruments are distributed throughout the beam line to measure the beam profile, position, current, loss, energy and energy spread. Some of them will send the beam information to the treatment control system (TCS) and serve as the safety interlock. This paper presents the considerations for the distribution of beam diagnostic instruments and shows the layout of beam diagnostics monitors in the beamline.

China Spallation Neutron Source(CSNS), the biggest platform for neutron scattering research in China, will be finished built and run in the end of 2017. It mainly consists of a 80MeV H− linac and a 80MeV to 1.6GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron, two beam transport lines, one target station and relative ancillary facilities. The Linac beam commissioning with beam loss monitors, current transformers, BPMs, beam profile monitors and beam emission measurement has been the main task since last year. Beam instrumentations, commissioning of the temperary 60 MeV linac will be discussed in this paper.

This paper gives an overview of Sirius diagnostics systems under commissioning or in planning phase. It includes beam position monitors for electron and photon beams, visible and X-ray synchrotron light monitors, transverse profile monitors, streak camera, beam loss monitors, current monitors, charge monitors, tune and filling pattern measurements. The paper focuses on the specification of the beam diagnostics systems and their motivation, parts selection, accompanying data acquisition systems, control software capabilities and development status.

During flight mission onboard electronic equipment of spacecraft exposed to outer space radiation. Impact of charged particles leads to errors and failures in electronic components. The most critical problem for spacecraft engineers is heavy ions influence which cause single event effects (SEE) in electronic components. To be assure that spacecraft electronics will work properly during the mission ground SEE testing is needed. For these purposes heavy ions accelerators are used. In this report, we will discuss requirements to heavy ions beams, techniques and equipment used for control heavy ion beam parameters during SEE testing. Special attention will be given to description of flux and fluence control procedure.
