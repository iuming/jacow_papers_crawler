Solid-state RF power amplifier (SSPA) technology has developed significantly over recent years. Powers of hundreds of kilowatts are being achieved, driven by the developments of LDMOS and other transistor technologies. The price and size of SSPA still correlate with the output power, which is not the case for vacuum tube based devices. In order to be competitive with vacuum tubes at higher levels of power and frequency, SSPA's should be designed to be more compact and cheaper than current offerings, using the high efficiency and reliability of modern transistors to produce highly available amplifier systems. The scalability of SSPA output power is achieved by a modular architecture based on several ~1kW transistors; this gives an important advantage over vacuum tubes. In order to meet challenging demands for high power, efficient, reliable, compact and cost effective RF amplifiers, the next generation architecture of SSPA is employed and single design for various frequencies and power is proposed.
