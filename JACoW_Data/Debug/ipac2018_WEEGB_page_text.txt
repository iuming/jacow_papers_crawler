It is anticipated that the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) will, at its 26th meeting 13-16 November 2018, revise the SI that links the definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole to exact numerical values of the Planck constant h, elementary charge e, Boltzmann constant k, and Avogadro constant NA, respectively, and which revises the way the SI is defined including the wording of the definitions of the SI units for time, length, mass, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity so that the reference constants on which the SI is based are clearly apparent. Feature article Scientific American 2017 Feb. After a brief historical introduction to the SI, speaker will chart the motivation and conceptual framework for this momentous change, and the technologies being developed for its introduction. This talk would be a few days in advance of World Metrology Day 2018.
Speaker: Dr. Alan Steele / Measurement Science and Standards laboratory in Ottawa, part of Canada's National Research Council (NRC)
