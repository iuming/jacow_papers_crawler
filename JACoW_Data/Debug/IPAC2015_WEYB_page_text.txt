This presentation should present an overview of efforts for benchmarking and application of space charge codes for rings. After briefly recalling the historical background of the simulation efforts of space charge effects in rings, we will overview the present benchmarking efforts against experimental results.

CERN is constructing a 750 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) which can accelerate a proton beam to 5 MeV in a length of 2 m. The beam dynamics strategic parameters have been chosen to make this RFQ a good candidate for the injector of a medical facility operating at frequency of 3 GHz. Minimising beam losses above 1 MeV, containing the RF power losses and opening the road to industrialisation have been the guidelines for an unconventional RFQ design. In this paper, the optimisation efforts, the structure design and the expected beam qualities will be detailed. The status of the construction as well as the potential for further developments will be presented.

The SuperKEKB B-factory adopts nanobeam scheme for the collision, which consists of large crossing angle and very small vertical beta function at the interaction point. Simulations have revealed that the luminosity of SuperKEKB will be very sensitive to perturbations from various sources. This paper discusses various beam dynamics issues involved in the SuperKEKB collider, including beam-beam, lattice nonlinearity, and space charge effects, as well as their interplay and planned mitigations.
