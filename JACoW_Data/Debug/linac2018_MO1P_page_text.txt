SNS plans to double the power capability of the SNS proton beam by increasing the beam energy and the beam current. Accelerator scope includes additional superconducting RF cryo-modules and supporting RF systems, and upgrades to existing RF systems. Also the accumulator storage ring and the neutron source target will be upgraded to accommodate the additional power. The technical approach, project status and plans will be discussed.

Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) accelerators have been having over 10 years of operation experience. In 2006, the J-PARC linac started beam operation with an energy of 181 MeV. To realize the nominal performance of 1 MW at 3 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and 0.75 MW at a 30 GeV Main Ring synchrotron (MR), the linac energy was upgrade to 400 MeV by adding an annular-ring coupled structure linac, and the beam current was also upgraded from 30 to 50 mA by replacing a new ion source and an RFQ. After the upgrade, the RCS demonstrated 1MW equivalent beam operation and currently operates 400 kW for the Material and Life Science Facility. The MR beam power is increasing and becomes about 480 kW beam to the Neutrino Facility and about 50 kW at the Hadron Experimental Facility. Further upgrade plan of 1.5 MW beam power from the RCS is now in consideration. To achieve the plan, it is necessary to increase by about 20 % both beam current and pulse length at the linac. The detail process in the past upgrade and the possibility for further upgrade at the linac will be presented in this talk.

The European Spallation Source under construction in Lund (Sweden) uses a 2 GeV-5MW pulsed superconducting linac as proton driver. Normal conducting accelerating structures are used up to 92 MeV and superconducting structures up to 2 GeV. Most linac components are designed and procured as in-kind contributions by institutes/laboratories in the European partner countries. Installation of the Ion source delivered by INFN-Catania started end 2017. Installation of more components and infrastructure progresses at a high pace. Commissioning of the normal conducting linac section will take place in parallel with installation of the superconducting section. Beam commissioning of the superconducting section will be done starting in 2021, interlaced with the installation of additional high beta cryomodules. Beam will be sent to the target in 2022, initially at an energy of 1.3 GeV. Start of the User Programme is scheduled in 2023, when some neutron instruments will be ready and end of construction is in 2025, with the full set of instruments operational. This paper reports the status of linac components construction, the progress with installation on site, and the overall project schedule.
