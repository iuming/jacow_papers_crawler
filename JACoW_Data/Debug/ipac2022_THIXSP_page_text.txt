A new 3 GeV light source with a circumference of 350 m and an MBA lattice has been officially funded and is being constructed in north-eastern Japan. Aiming at stable and high-performance operations with an emittance of about 1 nm rad, various design and R&D activities are being performed: the four bend achromatic lattice using BQ combined function magnets; the compact RF system using a TM020 mode and in-cavity compact HOM absorbers; the in-vacuum off-axis injection scheme enabling stored beam oscillation-free injections with a small injection beam amplitude; the injector linac composed of a thermionic E-gun and C-band accelerators with a capability of extension to feed a future SX-FEL driver, and so on. The installation of accelerator components is ongoing. The talk will include the overall design of the light source, R&D results, and the latest construction status.
