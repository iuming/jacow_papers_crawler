The talk gives a theoretical overview of recent progress in our understanding of the field dependence of the SRF surface resistance Rs(H). A theory of microwave suppression of Rs(H) in the Meissner state of alloyed superconductors under a low-frequency, strong RF field at low temperatures is presented*. Solving equations for Rs(H) derived from a non-equilibrium BCS theory in the dirty limit shows that Rs(H) has a minimum as a function of H, mostly due to field-induced temporal oscillations of the quasiparticle density of states. The calculated field dependence Rs(H) is in good agreement with recent experiments on Ti and N alloyed Nb resonator cavities. The theory suggests that the extended Q(B) rise can be further enhanced by reducing subgap density of states by materials modifications. Applying superimposed dc and ac fields can be used to reduce the rf dissipation by tuning Rs(H0) with the dc field and also to probe the mechanism of microwave suppression of Rs(H) under equilibrium conditions. Ways of increasing the SRF performance by an optimized dirty layer at the Nb surface, which can withstand magnetic field exceeding the superheating field of Nb is discussed **.

Additional RF tests and temperature treatments (120°C baking, 100K soaking, …) have been carried out on Spiral2 quarter-wave cavities and ESS double spoke cavities. For each test, residual resistance and BCS resistance have been evaluated by testing the cavities between 4.2K and 1.5K. This talk will summarize the main results and try to highlight the main differences with high frequency cavities.

A significant issue in low beta resonators is medium field Q-slope (MFQS) at 4K that in some cases has resulted in projects choosing to operate low frequency cavities at 2K. Recent measurements have been done on QWR (80MHz) and HWR (160MHz) cavities at TRIUMF to study the MFQS of Low Beta Resonators. Quality factor data taken in cooling from 4K to 2K is used to separate the rf surface resistance into BCS and residual components for different surface treatments. These measurements shed light on the mechanisms behind the field dependence in the rf surface resistance.

Recent cavity results with niobium have demonstrated the necessity of a good understanding of both the BCS and residual resistance. For a complete picture, and comparison with theory, it is essential that one can measure the RF properties as a function of applied magnetic field, temperature, frequency and ambient magnetic field. Standard cavity measurements are limited in their ability to change all parameters freely and in a controlled manner. On the other hand, most sample measurement setups operate at fairly high frequency, where the surface resistance is always BCS dominated. The quadrupole resonator, originally developed at CERN, is ideally suited for RF characterization of samples at frequencies of 400 and 1300 MHz, between which many of today’s SRF cavities operate. We report on a modified version of the QPR with improved RF figures of merit for high-field operation. Experimental challenges in the commissioning run and alternate designs towards a simpler sample change are shown alongside measurement results of a large grain niobium sample.

Nanoscale defect structure within the magnetic penetration depth of ~100 nm is key to the performance limitations of niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Using a unique combination of advanced thermometry during cavity RF measurements, and TEM structural and compositional characterization of the samples extracted from cavity walls at both room and cryogenic temperatures, we directly discover the existence of nanoscale hydrides in SRF cavities limited by the high field Q slope, and show the decreased hydride formation after 120C baking. Crucially, in extended studies we demonstrate that adding 800C hydrogen degassing - both with AND without light BCP afterwards - restores the hydride formation to the pre-120C bake level correlating perfectly with the observed high field Q slope behavior. We also show absence of niobium oxides along the grain boundaries and the modifications of the surface oxide upon 120C bake, which contradicts some of the widely used models of niobium surface.
