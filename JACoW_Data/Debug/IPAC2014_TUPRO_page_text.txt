In the framework of the HL-LHC Upgrade project possible variants for the layout of the LHC matching section located in the high luminosity insertions are investigated. This layout is optimized to reduce the demand on the voltage of the crab cavities, it also improves the optics squeeze-ability, both in ATS[1] and non-ATS mode. Moreover the injection and transitions to collision optics are also discussed. [1] S.

Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Commission under the FP7 project HiLumi LHC, GA no. 284404, co-funded by the DoE, USA and KEK, Japan.
The HL-LHC Upgrade project relies on large aperture magnets (mainly the inner Triplet and the separation dipole D1). The beam is much more sensitive to non-linear perturbations in this region, such as those induced by the fringe fields of the low-beta quadrupoles. Analytical evaluations of detuning with amplitude and chromatic effects show that the effect is small, but not negligible. Therefore, the effect on long-term beam dynamics is evaluated via tracking simulations. Different tracking models are compared in order to provide a numerical estimate of this effect due to the proposed inner triplet quadrupoles. The implementation of the fringe fields in SixTrack, to be used for dynamic apertures studies, is also discussed.

Crab cavities (CCs) are a key ingredient of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC)  to ensure head on collisions at the main experiments (ATLAS and CMS) and fully profit from the smaller β* provided by the ATS optics. At KEKB, CCs have exhibited abrupt changes of phase and voltage during a time period of few LHC turns and considering the large energy stored in the HL-LHC beam, CC failures represent a serious risk to the LHC machine protection. In this paper, we discuss the effect of CC voltage or phase changes on a time interval similar to, or longer than, necessary to dump the beam.  The simulations assume a realistic steady-state distribution to assess the beam losses for the HL-LHC.  Additionally, some strategies are studied to mitigate the damage caused by the failures.

Different aspects of the NICA facility operation in polarized proton and deuteron modes aimed at reaching the highest possible luminosity and polarization degree as well are analysed. The main aim is to provide average luminosity L ≥ 1•1032 cm-2 s−1 at √sNN ≥ 26-27 GeV for single-spin proton collisions. Optimal schemes of the Siberian Snake insertions to the Nuclotron and NICA collider rings were proposed. The results of simulations are presented and discussed.

The LHC and its injectors were stopped in February 2013, in order to maintain, consolidate and upgrade the different equipment of the accelerator chain, with the goal of achieving LHC operation at the design energy of 14 TeV in the centre-of-mass. Prior to the start of this Long Shutdown (LS1), a major effort of preparation was performed in order to optimize the schedule and the use of resources across the different machines, with the aim of resuming LHC physics in early 2015. The rest of the CERN complex will restart beam operation in the second half of 2014. This paper presents the schedule of LS1, describes the organizational set-up for the coordination of the works, the main activities, the different main milestones, which have been achieved so far, and the decisions taken in order to mitigate the issues encountered.

The high luminosity LHC upgrade (HL-LHC) requires new magnets in the low-beta interaction regions with a larger aperture than in the existing LHC. These include the Nb3Sn superconducting (SC) inner triplet quadrupoles, Nb-Ti SC separation dipoles D1 and D2, and SC matching quadrupoles Q4 and Q5. The large aperture is necessary for accommodating the increased beam size caused by significantly higher beta functions in these magnets in the collision optics. The high beta functions also enhance the effects of field errors in these magnets leading to a smaller dynamic aperture (DA). It is, therefore, critical to determine the field quality specifications for these magnets which 1) satisfy an acceptable DA, and 2) are realistically achievable. The estimates of expected field quality obtained from magnetic field calculations and measurements were used as a starting point. Then, based on the DA study, the field errors were optimized in order to reach an acceptable DA. The DA calculations were performed using SixTrack. Details of the optimization process and summary of the field quality specifications for collision and injection energies are presented.

Simple Models Describing the Time-evolution of Luminosity in Hadron Colliders
1017

In recent years, several studies have been performed to describe the evolution of the losses in circular proton machines. Considerations based on single-particle, non-linear beam dynamics allowed building models that, albeit simple, proved to be in good agreement with measurements. These initial results have been generalised, thus opening the possibility to describe the luminosity evolution in a circular hadron collider. In this paper, the focus is on the derivation of scaling laws for the integrated luminosity, taking into account both burn off and additional pseudo-diffusive effects. The proposed models are applied to the analysis of the data collected during the LHC Run I and the outcome is discussed in detail.

During LHC Run 1 about 30 % of the potential peak performance was lost due to transverse emittance blow-up through the LHC cycle. Measurements indicated that the majority of the blow-up occurred during the energy ramp. Until the end of LHC Run 1 this emittance blow-up could not be eliminated. In this paper the measurements and observations of emittance growth through the ramp are summarized. Simulation results for growth due to Intra Beam Scattering will be shown and compared to measurements. A summary of investigations of other possible sources will be given and backed up with simulations where possible. Requirements for commissioning the LHC with beam in 2015 after Long Shutdown 1 to understand and control emittance blow-up will be listed.

For many applications, the precise knowledge of the beta function at a given location is essential. Several measurement techniques for optics functions are used in the LHC to provide the most suitable method for a given scenario. A new tool to run k-modulation measurements and analysis is being developed with the aim to be fully automatic and online. It will take constraints of various systems such as tune measurement precision, powering limits of the LHC superconducting circuits and limits of their quench protection systems into account. It will also provide the possibility to sinusoidally modulate the currents of the investigated quadrupoles with a predefined frequency and amplitude to increase the measurement precision further. This paper will review the advantages and limitations of k-modulation measurements in the LHC with and without sinusoidal current modulation. The used algorithms and tools will be presented and estimates on the obtainable beta function measurement precision will be given.

In the framework of the Radiation to Electronics (R2E) project, important mitigation actions are being implemented in the LHC during the first Long Shutdown (LS1) to reduce the Single Event Error (SEE) occurrence in standard electronics present in much of the equipment installed in LHC underground areas. Recent simulations have motivated additional actions to be performed in Point 4, in addition to those already scheduled in Points 1, 5, 7 and 8. This paper presents the organisation process carried out during LS1 to optimise the implementation of the R2E mitigation activities. It reports the challenges linked to civil engineering and to safe room relocation in Points 5 and 7. It highlights the reactivity needed to face the new mitigation requirements to be implemented in Point 4 before the end of LS1. It presents the advancement status of the R2E mitigation activities in the different LHC points with the main concerns and impact with the overall LHC LS1 planning.

Future high luminosity heavy-ion operation of the LHC will be dominated by very rapid luminosity decay due to the large collision cross-section and, to a lesser extent, emittance growth from intra-beam scattering (IBS) due to the high bunch intensities. A stochastic cooling system could reduce the emittance far below its initial value and reduce the losses from debunching during collisions, allowing more of the initial beam intensity to be converted into integrated luminosity before the beams are dumped. We review the status of this proposal, system and hardware properties and potential locations for the equipment in the tunnel.

The wide spectrum of intensities and emittances imprinted on the LHC Pb bunches during the accumulation of bunch trains in the injector chain result in a significant spread in the single bunch luminosities and lifetimes in collision. Based on the data collected in the 2011 Pb-Pb run, an empirical model is derived to predict the single-bunch peak luminosity depending on the bunch's position within the beam. In combination with this model, simulations of representative bunches are used to estimate the luminosity evolution for the complete ensemble of bunches. Several options are being considered to improve the injector performance and to increase the number of bunches in the LHC, leading to several potential injection scenarios, resulting in different peak and integrated luminosities. The most important options for after the long shutdown 1 and 2 are evaluated and compared.

Machine availability is one of the key performance indicators to reach the ambitious goals for integrated luminosity in the post Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) era. Machine availability is even more important for the future High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [1]. In this paper a Monte Carlo approach has been used to predict integrated luminosity as a function of LHC machine availability. The baseline model assumptions such as fault-time distributions and machine failure rate (number of fills with stable beams dumped after a failure / total number of fills with stable beams) were deduced from the observations during LHC operation in 2012. The predictions focus on operation after LS1 and its evolution towards HL-LHC. The extrapolation of relevant parameters impacting on machine availability is outlined and their corresponding impact on fault time distributions is discussed. Results for possible future operational scenarios are presented. Finally, a sensitivity analysis with relevant model parameters like fault time and machine failure rate is discussed.

LHC operation requires the flawless functioning of the machine protection systems. The energy stored in the beam was progressively increased beyond the 140 MJ range at the end of 2012 at 4 TeV/c. The further increase to 364 MJ expected for 2015 at 6.5 TeV/c should be possible with the existing protection systems. For HL-LHC, additional failure modes are considered. The stored beam energy will increase by another factor of two with respect to nominal and a factor of five more than experienced so far. The maximum beta function will increase. It is planned to install crab cavities in the LHC. With crab cavities, sudden voltage decays within 100 us after e.g. cavity quenches lead to large beam oscillations. Tracking simulations predict trajectory distortions of up to 1.5 σ in the first turn after a sudden drop of the deflecting voltage in a single cavity within 3 turns. The energy of several MJ stored in halo protons that could hit the collimator in case of such events is far above damage level, even if the collimator jaws are made of robust material. In this paper we discuss the challenges for machine protection in the HL-LHC era and possible mitigation strategies.

The HL-LHC performance could considerably benefit from having a 200 MHz RF system. This would allow to inject longer bunches with larger bunch intensity from the SPS and to perform bunch length leveling if required. We also consider the possibility of decreasing the crab cavity frequency to increase both virtual peak luminosity and luminous region. Performance estimates of various configurations are presented in this paper.

LHC will resume operation in 2015 at 6.5 TeV. The higher energy allows for smaller IP beta functions, further enhancing the optics errors in the triplet quadrupoles. Moreover the uncertainty in the calibration of some quadrupoles will slightly increase due to saturation effects. The complete magnetic cycle of the LHC will take longer due to the higher energy and extended squeeze sequence. All these issues require more precise and more efficient optics measurements and corrections to guarantee the same optics quality level as in 2012 when a 7% peak beta-beating was achieved. This paper summarizes the on-going efforts for achieving faster and more accurate optics measurements and corrections.

For the commissioning and operation of modern particle accelerators, automated error detection and diagnostics methods are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present two such methods, which are capable of localising sources of beam offset jitter with a combination of correlation studies and so called degree of freedom plots. The methods were applied to the ATF2 beam line at KEK, where one of the major goals is the reduction of the beam offset jitter. Results of this localisation are shown in this paper. A big advantage of the presented method is its high robustness especially to varying optics parameters. Therefore, we believe that the developed beam offset jitter localisation methods can be easily applied to other accelerators.

The LHCb detector will be upgraded during the second long shutdown (LS2) of the LHC machine, in order to increase its statistical precision significantly. The upgraded LHCb foresees a peak luminosity of L = 1-2 . 1033 cm-2 s−1, with a pileup of 5. This represents ten times more luminosity and five times more pile up than in the present LHC. With these conditions, the pp-collisions and beam losses will produce a non-negligeable beam-induced energy deposition in the interaction region. More precisely, studies have shown that the energy deposition will especially increase on the D2 recombination dipole, which could bring them close to their safety thresholds. To avoid this, the placement of a minimal neutral absorber has been proposed. This absorber will have the same role as the TAN in the high luminosity Interaction Regions (IR) 1 and 5. This study shows the possible dimensions and location of this absorber, and how it would reduce both the peak power density and total heat load.

For the HL-LHC it is planned to basically double the diameter of the triplet quadruple magnets around the high luminosity insertions of the LHC. The high luminosity experiments ATLAS and CMS would like to keep a small central chamber radius close the interaction point. In the context of collider-experiment studies for the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC, we present a first study of the possible consequences of these changes for the experimental running conditions based on detailed simulations with tracking. We have started to implement crab cavity failures and discuss first results from these simulations.

Growing expectations for integrated luminosity during upcoming LHC runs introduce new challenges for LHC beam operation in the scope of online luminosity control. Because some LHC experiments are limited in the maximum event rates, their luminosity is leveled to a constant value. Various techniques may be used for luminosity leveling, changing the betatron function at the interaction point is one of them. This paper explains the main operational requirements of a betatron function leveling scheme for the upcoming LHC run. Issues concerning the beam optics, orbits and collimator settings are discussed. The proposed architecture for control system integration will be discussed. A few operational scenarios with different beam configurations foreseen for the next LHC run will be presented.

Adjusting luminosity and optimizing the luminous region in each interaction point of the LHC according to the experiments needs has become a requirement to maximize the efficiency of the different detectors. Several techniques are envisaged, most importantly by varying β* or a transverse offset at the interaction point. Coherent and incoherent stability in the presence of beam-beam effects will be discussed in realistic luminosity levelling scenarios for the LHC.

The effects of Intra Beam Scattering (IBS) in the High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) will be stronger compared to effects in the present LHC because of the high intensity of the proton bunches and the new proposed optics. We present benchmarking studies carried out for the present LHC at injection and collision energies as well as HL-LHC at collision energy with the Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing optics. The results of IBS growth-rate calculations using the full Bjorken-Mtingwa formulae* are compared with simplified formulae**, Bane’s high energy approximation***, and the completely integrated modified Piwinski approximation****. The results of calculations based on these methods carried out in Mathematica are compared with results from the codes MAD-X and ZAP.

The planned High Luminosity upgrade to the LHC will require stronger focusing of the beam in the interaction regions. To achieve this, the inner triplet quadrupoles will be replaced with new magnets having larger gradient and aperture. In this new focusing regime the quadrupole fringe fields are expected to have a greater effect on the beam dynamics, due to their large aperture, as compared to the nominal LHC. In this preliminary study, simplified models are used in a tracking code to assess the impact of the fringe fields on the dynamics using frequency map analysis.

The upgrade of the LHC from the current set-up to high luminosity performances will provide new challenges from the point of view of beam-beam as well as other collective effects and luminosity levelling. We present the current possibilities for doing luminosity levelling for HL-LHC. We explore the merits and drawbacks of each option and briefly discuss the operational implications. The simplest option being levelling with an offset between the two beams. In particular, we look at the possibility of using flat beams in the IPs for all the available options and investigate their benefits and drawbacks, using the code COMBI. Flat beams would allow an additional degree of freedom, with the levelling only required in one of the planes at any given IP. To this end, various scenarios are looked at, both with and without crab cavities.

In the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) Project, the LHC will be significantly upgraded to attain a peak luminosity of up to 8.5 × 1034 cm-2s-1, thus almost an order of magnitude higher compared to the nominal machine configuration in ATLAS at IP1 and CMS at IP5. In the view of a successful machine setup as well as a successful physics programme, beam induced background studies at IP1 were performed to investigate sources of particle fluxes to the experimental area. In particular as a start of the study, two sources forming the major contributions were simulated in detail: the first one considers inelastic interactions from beam particles hitting tertiary collimators, the second one from beam interactions with residual gas-molecules in the vacuum pipe close by the experiment, referred to as beam-halo and local beam-gas, respectively. We will present these first HL-LHC background studies based on SixTrack and FLUKA simulations, highlighting the simulation setup for the design case in the HL-LHC scenario. Results of particle spectra entering the ATLAS detector region are presented for the latest study version of HL-LHC machine layout (2013).

After operation at the nominal luminosity, the LHC is planned to be upgraded to a 5-fold increased luminosity of 5×1034 cm-2s−1. The upgrade includes replacement of the IP1/IP5 inner triplet 70-mm NbTi quadrupoles with the 150-mm coil aperture Nb3Sn quadrupoles along with the new 150-mm coil aperture NbTi dipole magnet. A detailed model of the region with these new magnets, field maps, corrector packages, segmented tungsten inner absorbers was built and implemented into the FLUKA and MARS codes. Various aspects of the new design were studied: (i) thicknesses of tungsten absorbers; (ii) beam screen interruption in interconnects; (iii) crossing angle value and orientation, etc. In the optimized configuration, the peak power density averaged over the magnet inner cable width doesn’t exceed 2 mW/cm3, safely below the quench limit. For the integrated luminosity of 3000 fb-1, the highest peak dose of 35 MGy occurs in the corrector package CP, while for other magnets, the peak dose in the innermost insulators ranges from 20 to 30 MGy. Dynamic heat loads to the triplet magnet cold mass are calculated to be on a target 10 W/m level. FLUKA and MARS results agree within 10%.

A preliminary design of the 125-GeV Higgs Factory (HF) Muon Collider (MC) has identified an enormous background loads on the HF detector. This is related to the twelve times higher muon decay probability at HF compared to that previously studied for the 1.5-TeV MC. As a result of MARS15 optimization studies, it is shown that with a carefully designed protection system in the interaction region, in the machine-detector interface and inside the detector one can reduce the background rates to a manageable level similar to that achieved for the optimized 1.5-TeV case. The main characteristics of the HF detector background are presented for the configuration found.

Recent discovery of a Higgs boson boosted interest in a low-energy medium-luminosity Muon Collider as a Higgs Factory (HF). A preliminary design of the HF storage ring (SR) is based on cos-theta Nb3Sn superconducting (SC) magnets with the coil inner diameter ranging from 50 cm in the interaction region to 16 cm in the arc. The coil cross-sections were chosen based on the operation margin, field quality and quench protection considerations to provide an adequate space for the beam pipe, helium channel and inner absorber (liner). With the 62.5-GeV muon energy and 2×1012 muons per bunch, the electrons from muon decays deposit about 300 kW in the SC magnets, or unprecedented 1 kW/m dynamic heat load, which corresponds to a multi-MW room temperature equivalent. Based on the detailed MARS15 model built and intense simulations, a sophisticated protection system was designed for the entire SR to bring the peak power density in the SC coils safely below the quench limit and reduce the dynamic heat load to the cold mass by a factor of 100. The system consists of tight tungsten masks in the magnet interconnect regions and elliptical tungsten liners optimized for each magnet.

As the last missing step in phase 1 of the beam energy scan (BES-I), aimed at the search for the critical point in the QCD phase diagram, RHIC collided gold ions at a beam energy of 7.3 GeV/nucleon during the FY 2014 run. While this particular energy is close to the nominal RHIC injection energy of 9.8 GeV/nucleon, it is nevertheless challenging because it happens to be close to the AGS transition energy, which makes longitudinal beam dynamics during transfer from the AGS to RHIC difficult. We report on machine performance, obstacles and solutions during the FY 2014 low energy run.

After running uranium-uranium and copper-gold collisions in 2012, the high energy heavy ion run of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for Fiscal Year 14 (Run14) is back to gold-gold (Au-Au) collisions at 100 GeV/nucleon. Following the level of performance achieved in Run12, RHIC is still looking to push both instantaneous and integrated luminosity goals. To that end, a new 56 MHz superconducting RF cavity was installed and commissioned, designed to keep ions in one RF bucket and improve luminosity by allowing a smaller beta function at the interaction point (IP) due to a reduced hourglass effect. The following presents an overview of these changes and reviews the performance of the collider.

In this article, we study the beam-beam interaction in the possible future gold-gold collision with different particle energies in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). With different particle energies, the center-of-mass of collision is moving in the longitudinal direction during collision. Since the RF harmonic numbers are different for the two RHIC rings, bunches collide in 110 turns followed by 10 turns without collision. In this study, the stability of particles and the beam emittance growth are calculated through numeric simulations based on a 6-D weak-strong beam-beam interaction model.

Further reduction of betatron coupling and vertical dispersion in the storage ring of the Australian Synchrotron Light Source has resulted in the achievement of a beam vertical emittance that is now dominated by the intrinsic quantum effects. This paper will detail the key elements in achieving a vertical emittance at the quantum limit and results achieved.

Advanced magnetic optic designs are required to meet the heavy demands of future light sources: diffraction limited emittance, femto-second pulses and low energy spread. This paper highlights the magnetic optic that is presently being investigated in the ERL-simulation group at HZB. The injector optic is based on subtle emittance compensation techniques of space charge dominated beams. The high energy arcs are designed to suppress emittance growth due to CSR through horizontal phase advance manipulation, ISR effects by keeping the radiation integrals small and reduce the degradation due to chromatic aberrations. Optimised Start-to-End beam dynamic simulations are presented.

The Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) conception is a promising way of creating diffraction limited synchrotron light source. The high ERL beam quality (low emittance, short bunch and low energy spread) gives an opportunity to generate high brightness photon beams. One of the main requirements for the optic in such machines is the suppression of emittance growth. An important reason for beam degradation is the impact of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) in bending magnets. CSR induced emittance dilution and methods of preservation both with and without compression are discussed in this article.

BERLinPro is an ERL project at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, with the goal to illuminate the challenges and promises of a high brightness 100 mA superconducting RF gun in combination with a 50 MeV return loop and energy recovery [1, 2]. The precision of the beam position in a single turn machine might be relaxed compared to the demands in storage rings. Still, a trajectory correction concept has to be developed and the influence of trajectory offsets on the goal parameters, its dependence on fluctuating injection parameters or effects related to the low energy of 6.5-50 MeV have to be investigated. This paper covers the initial trajectory correction studies and first tolerance scenarios of BERLinPro using the projected hardware concept.

The Electron Stretcher Facility ELSA of Bonn University provides a polarized electron beam of up to 3.2 GeV. In the stretcher ring various depolarizing resonances are crossed during the fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s. The high polarization degree of up to 70% can only be conserved by taking several appropriate countermeasures. Concerning integer resonances, additional harmonic horizontal fields are applied by orbit correction magnets around the ring to compensate the resonance driving fields. The correction field has to be adjusted by empirical optimization of polarization. Recent developments enhance this optimization process, especially at high energies: A new magnet system allows for higher correction amplitudes and shorter rising times. Furthermore, a modified correction scheme was implemented. It takes into account the additional fields of the quadrupole magnets, arising from the orbit response of the correction magnets.

High Bandwidth Closed Orbit Control for a Fast Ramping Electron Accelerator

ELSA is a fast ramping stretcher ring capable of acceleration and storage of polarized electrons with energies up to 3.2 GeV. To preserve the initial degree of polarization, the acceleration is performed by a fast energy ramp with a maximum ramping speed of 6 GeV/s. During acceleration especially the vertical orbit needs to be continuously corrected so that the vertical rms deviation does not exceed 50 μm at any time. In order to compensate the so called integer resonances, which occur at certain energies, the orbit correction system further needs to provide additional, empirically determined, harmonic field distributions. A successful application of these combined correction measures requires a considerably high bandwidth of up to some 100 Hz. In our contribution we will have a closer look at the performance and the acquired bandwidth of the correction system.

The High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) of the FAIR project is primarily designed for internal target experiments with stored and cooled antiprotons, which is the main objective of the PANDA collaboration. However, the HESR storage ring also appears to have remarkable properties to carry out physics experiments with heavy ions. In this paper a new ion optical design allowing the heavy ion operation mode of the HESR is presented. The main goal was to provide an optics which meets the requirements of the future experiments with heavy ion beams. Closed orbit correction, dynamic aperture as well as other characteristics of beam dynamics of the ion optical setup are under analysis in this study.

FAIR - the international facility for antiproton and ion research – located at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany is one of the largest research projects worldwide. It will provide an antiproton production rate of 7·1010 cooled pbars per hour, which is equivalent to a primary proton beam current of 2·1016 protons per hour. A high intensity proton linac (p-linac) will be built, with an operating rf-frequency of 325 MHz to accelerate a 70 mA proton beam up to 70 MeV, using conducting crossed-bar H-cavities. The repetition rate is 4 Hz with an ion beam pulse length of 36 μs[1]. Developed within a joint French-German collaboration - GSI/CEA-SACLAY/IAP – the compact proton linac will be injected by a microwave ion source and a low energy beam transport (LEBT). The 2.45 GHz ion source allows high brightness ion beams at an energy of 95 keV and will deliver a proton beam current of 100 mA at the entrance of the RFQ (Radio Frequency Quadrupole) within an emittance of 0.3π mm mrad (rms). To check on these parameters computer simulations with TraceWin, IGUN and IBSIMU of the ion extraction and LEBT (Low Energy Beam Transport) are performed.

At present the facility is driven from the ELBE linac with a CW electron beam of 100kHz repetition rate and up to 100pC of bunch charge. With the upgraded SRF electron gun bunch charges up to 1nC will become available. For the beam energies in the 20-30 MeV range buch compression into the sub-200 fs range becomes a major challenge. We present beam dynamics calculation of the attempted bunch compression scheme as well as first measurements obtained during the commissioning.

The proposed figure-8 storage ring at Frankfurt University [1, 2] is based on longitudinal guiding magnetic fields and will have special features with respect to the beam dynamics. A crucial part of the ring is the injection section, where the low energy beams have to cross an area of steeply rising field – up to B = 6 T into the main ring field. An optimized magnetic channel is designed to bring the injected beam close enough to the magnetic ring flux. An ExB kicker is needed to move the injected beam from the injection channel to the main magnetic field flux allowing multi turn injection. Simulation studies concentrate on this part and will be presented, results will be discussed. A comparison with simulations for prepared scaled down experiments with existing room temperature toroids will be done.

Optical systems for transverse-to-longitudinal emittance exchange involving single dipole-mode cavity were in great details studied during the last decade theoretically and experimentally. In this paper we discuss the question, if there are any advantages in usage of beamlines utilizing two deflecting cavities instead of one. The general analysis is presented and specific beamline designs are given as examples.

We show that with an appropriate parametrization the linear transport of the Twiss parameters can be viewed as a bilinear (or Moebius) map of the upper complex half-plane (which is the hyperbolic plane) into itself. Using then elementary techniques of hyperbolic geometry we classify transformations of the Twiss parameters into elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic types and, for each type, present its typical phase space portraits.

The purpose of the optical system, which we call the dump line, is not simply the transport of the beam to the beam dump. It is an essential part of the beam switchyard which provides the possibility to distribute electron bunches of one beam pulse to different FEL beam lines, allowing a flexible selection of the bunch pattern at each FEL experiment. In this paper we describe the final layout of this optical system as it is now under construction.

In 2013 the superconducting soft x-ray Free Electron Laser FLASH at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) the extraction section needed to connect the 2nd beam line FLASH2 was installed. In order to allow simultaneous operation of the two beam lines (FLASH1/2), the optical functions in the extraction area needed to be modified. During the recommissioning of FLASH we have optimized, measured and corrected the optical functions in the machine. We report on the the results and the methods.

The Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ), focuses on testing, characterizing and optimizing high brightness electron sources for free electron lasers. PITZ is equipped with a number of transverse emittance measurement stations, among which is the Phase Space Tomography (PST) module. A PST measurement requires a specific transport along the tomography lattice, which ideally rotates the beam in the normalized transverse phase space by 180 degrees in equidistant steps. A preceding matching section is used to provide an injection scheme that delivers the necessary beam parameters for the design transport along the tomography lattice. The high charge density and moderate energy of the electron bunch at PITZ contribute to significant space-charge forces which lead to emittance growth and consequent mismatches of the design parameters. This article presents and evaluates measurements of the emittance increase along the matching section of a 1 nC beam at 22 MeV/c under different focusing schemes.

J-PARC Main Ring should deliver a high-power proton beam to neutrino experiments with limited particle losses. To meet this requirement low-order machine resonances have to be compensated. The linear coupling resonance Qx+Qy=43 has been identified as the potential source for significant particle losses at the collimator. The resonance compensation scheme has been studied experimentally by using a low intensity beam. To understand this process the simulations have been performed by using the PTC-ORBIT code. The Main Ring model has been developed to reproduce the machine operation including the initial stage of the acceleration. The 6D beam model has been defined to represent the ‘pencil’ beam used for this study. In frame of this report the single and multi particle dynamics will be discussed to understand the results of measurements, performed during RUN44 (November 2012). The results of the long-term tracking for this case will be presented. The obtained results can be used to benchmark the computer modeling the ‘sum’ linear coupling resonance with the experimental results.

Racetrack microtron (RTM) is a compact accelerator to obtain electron beams with an energy above 100 MeV. Conventional RTM's have been designed to accelerate a train of electron bunch from a thermionic electron gun, where the bunch charge is typically 10 pC. In the industrial application of laser Compton scattered gamma-ray sources, RTM with 200-300 MeV electron energy will be a suitable device to produce 2-3 MeV gamma-ray beams. Single electron bunch from a photocathode RF gun is accelerated and a high-charge small-emittance beam is preferable in such RTM. In this paper, we adopt a simulation code, GPT, for design and optimization of RTM in view of high-charge and small-emittance beam generation.

Heavy-Ion Advanced Research Facility (HIAF) is a new project proposed at Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) in China. HIAF project accelerator is composed of intense ion beam sources, injector superconducting LINAC, acceleration and accumulation storage ring, a collection ring and a collider ring. To achieve the ultimate project goal, HIAF accelerator requires the ion source to provide very high intensity of heavy ion beams, such as 1.7 emA 238U34+ with a repetition rate of 5 Hz and pulse length of 0.5 ms. No state-of-the-art ion source can meet the needs. As a baseline of the project, a high performance superconducting ECR ion source, which is designed to be operational at the microwave frequency of 40-60 GHz will be adopted to produce the pulsed beam of interest for the HIAF accelerator. To transport and match the beams from ECR to the downstream RFQ, a low energy beam transport (LEBT) is needed. This paper presents a preliminary design of the LEBT and the beam dynamics in the LEBT.

Raon, the rare isotope accelerator of the the Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) in Daejeon, South Korea, is being designed to accelerate multiple-charge-state beams simultaneously. Using an Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) Ion Source to produce the ions, Raon will transport the beam through two 90-degree bending magnets and a Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) system to a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). In order to test the components of the injector and LEBT system, a test facility is under development. A new LEBT, based upon the LEBT of the main driver linac, is being designed to fit within the test facility’s restrictive space requirements. This work will briefly review the main driver linac LEBT design, and then discuss the current status of the test facility LEBT design.

Optics matching and transverse emittance preservation are key goals for a successful operation of modern high brightness electron linacs. The capability of controlling them in a real machine critically relies on a properly designed magnetic lattice. Conscious of this fact, we introduce an ensemble of optical functions* that permit to solve the often neglected conflict between strong focusing, typically implemented to counteract coherent synchrotron radiation and transverse wakefield instability, and distortion of the transverse phase space induced by chromatic aberrations and focusing errors. A numerical evaluation of the merit functions is applied to existing and planned linac-based free electron lasers.

The influence of solenoids on spin is very efficient, but beam focusing is determined mainly by structural quadru-poles. The condition of stable orbital motion of particles does not require compensation of the betatron oscillation coupling. To reduce the influence of the Snake on orbital motion it is desirable to exclude compensating quads completely. The design of solenoid Siberian snake for the Nuclotron lattice is presented. The orbital functions of the lattice were calculated and the results are discussed.

The construction of the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is underway at Fermilab. Among the main goals of the facility are the proof-of-principle experiments on nonlinear integrable optics and optical stochastic cooling. Both require outstanding quality of the linear lattice and closed orbit. Software was developed to thoroughly test the proposed lattice configurations for error correction performance. The presented analysis is based on a statistical approach on a number of error seeds, such as various alignment, calibration and field errors.

Energy measurements with precision down to 10-5 are inferred from the lifetime evolution when the beam is depolarized using AC kicks with the Transverse Fast Feedback system. Lifetime measurements are carried out using the DCCT, the BPM sum signals, pin-diode BLMs, and a scintillator based Beam Loss Detector. Results obtained with this instrumentation are reported.

This paper summarizes the tasks carried out to develop a turn-by-turn (TBT) measurement system at ALBA. These tasks mainly include testing the MAF firmware for the libera BPMs and implementing the necessary analytical tools to infer the beam dynamics parameters. TBT measurements using an injection kicker are presented. Linear and non-linear beam dynamics results are compared with LOCO. Results are still preliminary since a good agreement with the linear model has not been achieved yet.

TraceWin is used at the European Spallation Source (ESS) as the design tool, while fast and accurate on-line models will be needed during the operations. Three models are compared: the ESS Linac Simulator (ELS), TraceWin and the OpenXAL. In all of the benchmarked models, dynamics of each beam-line element is, to the first order, represented by a transfer matrix. Differences in the matrices occur, since different reference frames are used and as well different assumptions about the energy of the particles are made. General transformations of the reference frames will be presented. Using those, the comparison of transfer maps among TraceWin and OpenXAL are given. When the differences between TraceWin and OpenXAL were unclear, the benchmark versus other code, like MAD-X and Dynac was done. The best implementations were combined into a new on-line model implementation Java ELS (or JELS) and at last the comparison of the latter with TraceWin is given.

Optics measurement algorithms which are based on the measurement of beam position monitor (BPM) turn-by-turn data are currently being improved in preparation for the commissioning of the LHC at higher energy. The turn-by-turn data of one BPM may be used more than once, but the implied correlations were not considered in the final error bar. In this paper the error propagation including correlations is studied for the statistical part of the uncertainty. The confidence level of the measurement is investigated analytically and with simulations.

We describe the extension of the functionality of the slicing module and its applications in MAD-X. We can now select thick or thin slicing for individual quadrupoles or groups of quadrupoles and implemented tracking of thick quadrupoles and dipoles in MAD-X. Complex dipole magnets with fringe fields can now automatically be translated to simple bends with extra dipedges.

Scaling Laws of Wake Field Effects for Gradient Changes in the CLIC Main Linac

The main linac of CLIC is designed to maximize the transportable bunch charge, since this parameter determines the energy efficiency of the CLIC accelerating structures. The bunch charge is limited by short-range wake field effects, which increase the projected beam emittance. For the main linac cost optimisation, it is important to understand how the charge limit scales with the change of the gradient of the accelerating structures. In this paper, we determine such a scaling law via simulations studies. It is shown that from different possible scenarios, the charge limit for a lower gradient CLIC structure scales advantageous and a relatively high charge can be used.

Tests of Beam-Based Alignment have been performed at FACET, with successful results. A flight simulator based on PLACET has been put in place to test the correction algorithms before applying the correction to the real machine. The flight simulator not only helped studying the parameters space in a safe environment, but it also helped developing a graphical interface that the experimenter can use to set each parameter of the correction also during the on-line.

The proton channel of the PSI high intensity proton accelerator (HIPA) transports the beam from the extraction point of the ring cyclotron through two meson production graphite targets up to the SINQ spallation source. After many years of continuous improvement, the HIPA accelerator complex has now reached the remarkable beam power of 1.4 MW. The next power upgrade is foreseen for the near future. In order to achieve this further step, an optimization of the beam optics in the proton channel is required with the goal of keeping the beam losses at a reasonable extent and, at the same time improve the beam distribution on the SINQ target.

A 2.4 T hybrid multipole wiggler (MPW) and a 6.5 T superconducting wavelength shifter (SWLS) have been successfully installed and commissioned at Siam Photon Source (SPS). The influence of the two insertion devices on the electron beam dynamic at different operating points have been studied in order to determine the optimal lattice configuration for operation. In this paper, the compensation of the linear optics will be presented, and the commissioning scheme will also be described. In addition, the investigation of the difference between the model and the actual observed machine parameters will be reported in details.

Beam tuning in the beam delivery system (BDS) is one of the major challenges for the future linear colliders. Up to now single beam tuning has been performed, both in simulations and experiments at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF). However, in future linear colliders, due to fast detuning of the final focus optics both beamlines will need to be tuned simultaneously. In this paper a first two-beam tuning study for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) BDS is presented applying the usual toolbox of beam-based alignment (BBA) and sextupole knobs.

The LHeC is a proposed upgrade to the LHC to provide electron-proton collisions and explore the new regime of energy and intensity for lepton-nucleon scattering. The work presented here investigates optics and layout solutions allowing simultaneous nucleon-nucleon and lepton-nucleon collisions at separate interaction points compatible with the proposed HL-LHC lattice. A first lattice design has been proposed that collides proton beam 2 with the electron beam. The nominal design calls for a β* (beta function in the interaction point ) of 10 cm using an extended version of the Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing (ATS) scheme, and a L* (distance to the inner triplet) of 10 m. Modifying these two parameters, β* and L*, can provide benefits to the current design since the values of these parameters have direct effects on the luminosity, the natural chromaticity and the synchrotron radiation of the electron beam. This work aims to explore the range over which these parameters can be varied in order to achieve the desired goal.

Electrostatic elements are frequently used for transporting low energy charged particles, as they are easy to build and operate. However, beam motion is strongly affected by effects from fringe fields, positioning and manufacturing errors of individual ion optical elements. It is important to carry out detailed studies into these effects in order to optimize beam transport. In this paper results from numerical studies with a purpose-written code are presented and compared against analytical estimates. It is shown how the results can be used to optimize the mechanical layout of the electrostatic ion optics elements, including quadrupoles and spherical deflectors. Finally, the results from beam tracking through a multi-element beam line are presented on the basis of both, matrix multiplication and numerical particle tracking.

The Front End Test Stand (FETS) linear accelerator at Rutherford Appleton laboratory (RAL) will accelerate a 60 mA, 2 ms, 50 pps H− beam to 3MeV. The aim of FETS is to demonstrate perfect chopping using a novel 2 stage (fast / slow) chopper scheme. The beam chopper and associated beam dumps are located in the MEBT. Achieving a low emittance-growth under the influence of strong, non-linear space-charge forces in a lattice which has to accommodate the long chopping elements is challenging. The baseline FETS MEBT design is 4.3 m long and contains 7 quadrupoles, 3 rebunching cavities, a fast and slow chopper deflector and two beam dumps. In particle dynamics simulations using a distribution from an RFQ simulation as input, beam loss for the un-chopped beam is below 1% while the chopping efficiency is >99 % in both choppers. The final MEBT lattice chosen for FETS will be presented together with particle tracking results and design details of the beam line components.

Alternative acceleration technologies are currently under development for cost-effective, robust, compact and efficient solutions. One such technology is plasma wakefield accel- eration, driven by either a charged particle or laser beam. However, the potential issues must be studied in detail. In this paper, the emittance growth of the witness beam through elastic scattering from gaseous media is derived. The model is compared with the numerical studies.

The EMMA non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient accelerator (ns FFAG) is a ring consisting of 42 quadrupole pairs. The dipole fields which guide particles around the ring are arrived at through offsetting the quadrupoles from a reference axis. In the ideal case, first order 4D transfer maps will describe the turn by turn progression of a particle bunch in transverse phase space. This contribution sees the use of experimental data to calculate the 4D transfer map for EMMA at several different momenta, and a comparison made with maps produced through simulation.

Stangenes Industries is working closely with Brookhaven National Lab in the United States to develop the eRHIC future ion collider. The collider requires a polarized electron source with high average current, short bunch length and small emittance. An array of photocathodes with their beams funneled into a common trajectory is utilized to achieve the required beam current and cathode lifetime. Stangenes Industries is charged with delivering the prototype injector for preliminary beam studies that will lead to full implementation by 2020. This study focuses on the development of the of beam transport system extending from cathode to beam dump. A majority of the complexity involves the so called "combiner magnet" that acts as a high frequency-rotating dipole to bend each beam into the final common trajectory. Preliminary experiments into the feasibility of such a system are analyzed.

This contribution re-visits fields, particle motion, and spin precession in the AGS helical polarization snakes. The work was undertaken in preparation of orbit and spin modeling for future polarized proton and helion runs at RHIC. The investigations include re-computation of 3-D OPERA field maps of the helical snakes and particle and spin tracking. There is a series of sub-products of this study, amongst others, the appropriate settings of the AGS cold snake when changing its strength, cold snake settings for polarized helion programs, non-linear coupling in the AGS, the transport of the stable polarization axis from the AGS to RHIC injection kickers, and in addition, a series of high accuracy 3-D field maps have been produced, in view of long-term tracking in the AGS for beam and polarization transmission studies.

The AREAL solenoid, dipole and corrector magnets design, simulations and performance are presented. A solenoid magnet will be used for the focusing of the low energy (E~5MeV) electron beam after RF gun as well as in the beam diagnostic section. The magnetic iron cover of solenoid provides return path for magnetic field screening effectively the field in the outer space and concentrating it inside solenoid gap. The dipole magnet is part of the spectrometer for beam energy spread measurements. An Iron-free corrector magnet design allows independent horizontal and vertical beam steering. The design optimization and magnetic field calculations are performed using CST-EM Studio. A good agreement between measurements and simulations is obtained.

A 30° Green Magnet based on permanent NdFeB magnets has been developed and installed in the injection line at the ASTRID2 synchrotron light source. The cost efficient design is optimized for a 1 T field at a length of 1 m using shaped iron poles to surpass the required field homogeneity. The inherent temperature dependence of NdFeB has been passively compensated to below 30 ppm/°C. A study of potential demagnetization effects has been performed by irradiation of NdFeB samples placed directly in a 100 MeV e-beam. A high permanent magnet work point was found to result in enhanced robustness, and the risk of demagnetization was found to be negligible for typical synchrotron applications. The magnet has successfully been in operation at ASTRID2 since autumn 2013.

Compact magnet systems for ultra-low emittance synchrotron light sources have been developed at MAXLab*. Results of the production and test at Danfysik of 60 magnet systems for the MAXIV 3 GeV storage ring will be presented. These systems, contain a combined function dipole and up to 12 discrete multipoles integrated into up to 3.3 m long yokes. The production concept and test system has been reported** so here we focus on long term stability and trends of the magnetic performance of individual magnets. A complete series of 12 magnet girders for both the MAXIV 1.5 GeV and the SOLARIS storage rings are also to be produced at Danfysik. With two combined function dipoles and 11 multipole magnets integrated into 4.5 m long iron yokes these magnet systems are significantly larger. The ±0.02 mm mechanical tolerance requirement is a significant challenge but is possible with special attention to the minimization of tolerance build-up effects on the inserted multipole magnets by functional machining. New aspects of the magnetic test concept resulting from multipoles placed deep inside the girder structure will be described together with results from test of the first prototype unit.

Magnets are a keystone of the ESRF upgrade programme. The specifications of the magnets of the ESRF II lattice are stringent: high gradients, extended Good Field Region (GFR) and vertical gaps large enough for the X-ray beam ports. The magnet design approach is presented here. Shape optimization of the magnet poles is systematically used. The magnet design is treated as an ill-posed, non linear, constrained problem. Iterative algorithms have been developed; the algorithms converge in less than 10 iterations, leading to very short computation time. This design method has been applied to high gradient quadrupole magnets. The shape optimization leads to original pole profiles.

The present fixed-gap undulator system for FLASH1 and the new FLASH2 undulators will share the same electron beam accelerator, thus 12 variable gap undulators are needed in order to provide radiation of different wavelengths to both experimental halls independently. Each of the 12 devices has a length of 2.5m. The magnet structure with a period length of 31.4mm provides a maximum field of 0.96T with an effective K-parameter of 2.81 at minimum gap. Phase, vertical and horizontal trajectories have been tuned based on Hall probe and stretched wire measurements. Remaining multipoles were optimized with moderate gap dependence by using magic fingers. At some magnet structures, shims were placed to correct gap dependent field integrals. All undulators have an rms vertical and horizontal trajectory flatness <6Tmm2 for all gaps corresponding to an rms trajectory roughness (at 1GeV) along the structure of ~2um. The rms phase error is below 2° over the entire gap range.

Properties, Options and Limitations of PrFeB-magnets for Cryogenic Undulators
1238

The gap induction and thus the K-factor of permanent magnet undulators may be increased by cooling them to cryogenic temperatures. The use of NdFeB-magnets in cryogenic undulators, however, is limited to temperatures above 140 K due to the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) which leads to a reduction of the magnetization level. A further increase of the gap induction in undulators may be achieved by use of PrFeB-magnets at even lower temperatures, as this alloy does not show the SRT phenomenon. Although the effects are well known, up to now only a few undulator prototypes were built using this class of material since the coercivity of ternary PrFeB-magnets is not sufficient to minimize the risk of partial demagnetization when the undulator structure is kept at room temperature. This problem can be solved by applying actual technologies like grain-boundary diffusion in order to achieve coercivities exceeding 20 kOe at RT without sacrificing the high remanence Br of about 1.6 T at 77 K. We will provide actual data of the magnet performance achieved and show up the technological limitations in building PrFeB-based CPMU’s.

Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) is a 3 GeV Synchrotron light source with the circumference of 489.6 m. Using locally available material and the emittance of less than 1 nm-rad are two main points of the ILSF storage ring lattice, consisting of 56 low field pure bending magnets, 252 quadrupoles and 196 sextupoles with additional coils for the correctors and skew quadrupoles. The physical designs of these magnets have been performed relying on two dimensional codes POISSON [1] and FEMM [2]. Three dimensional RADIA [3] was practiced too, to audit chamfering values.

To fully control the beam position source point for the dipole beam lines additional correctors are needed. The space available however is minimal and no alternative solution (e.g. additional coils on quadrupoles or sextupoles) is possible making the design of such a magnet very challenging. The design, installation and performance of those special magnets is presented and discussed.

The application of quadrupoles with high or ultra-high gradient and small apertures requires a precise control over harmonic components of the field. A simple, fast, low cost measurement method on small size PMQs (Permanent Magnet Quadrupoles) is described. It is based on the same principle of the familiar "rotating coil technique", but in this case, profiting of the small dimensions of the PMQ, it consists in rotating the PMQ itself instead of the coil. In such way a gain on accuracy and measure time is obtained. It has been applied to characterize a set of commercial PMQs with a gradient around 200 T/m and an internal radius of 3.5 mm to be mounted in a SCDTL (Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac) structure for the acceleration of a proton beam from 7 to 12 MeV. This structure has been developed in the framework of the Italian TOP-IMPLART (Intensity Modulated Proton Linear Accelerator for Radiotherapy) Project

Magnetic-field Variable Permanent Dipole Magnet for Future Light Sources

Permanent dipole magnets with variable magnetic field have been designed, fabricated, and tested at SPring-8. Permanent magnets can be advantageous over electromagnets in terms of reliability, stability and compactness in addition to the small power consumption. No unexpected down of an accelerator due to power supply failure is supposed to happen. There is no cooling water flow that can induce a fluctuation of the magnetic field. These features may become important for future light sources, where a very reliable, stable, and compact ring is required. In addition, the power consumption is now one of the most important issues after the 3.11 disaster in Japan. One of critical issues to realize such a magnet is that a magnetic field has to be tuned. In the future, combined-functioned and longitudinally gradient magnets will play a key role in achieving extremely small emittance. In such a case, changing a gap will not work any more. We have designed and fabricated a permanent dipole magnet of which magnetic field can be tuned without changing the gap. The results of the performance test will be presented and a possibility to apply it for future light sources will be discussed.

Beam ripples are one of the critical problems in high power proton synchrotrons. Magnet field ripples are considered as a main origin of the beam ripples among various possible sources. Although magnet power supply ripples are generally treated as the dominating ripple source, the load circuit parameters of the magnets and their interconnections are also playing critical roles in defining the ripple amplitudes and frequencies. In this viewpoint, the magnet power supplies are treated as simplified current sources, and the ripples generated in the circuit systems are investigated both in analytical and numerical ways. One of the findings in this direction of investigation is the existence of intrinsic ripples. The intrinsic ripples occur inevitably in the synchrotron magnets, no matter how the power supplies are producing idealistic current ramp patterns. Their amplitudes are defined by the circuit parameters such as inductance and capacitance, and the ramp parameters such as ramp rates. Some of the analytical mechanisms in generating the magnet field ripples are presented as well as the studied examples.

Quadrupole magnets for ILC final focus should be strong enough with the restriction on the external radius to let the disrupted out-going beam pass by, while vibration of the magnetic center has to be highly avoided to keep the nm sized beam focusing stable at the interaction point a few meter downstream from the lens. Gluckstern's 5-ring PMQ singlet seems a good candidate for this point of view. In order to fabricate a good 5-ring singlet, property of each ring has to be good enough. A harmonic coil system, which has 24-bit ADC’s for high resolution, was developed. Current noise level of the system is less than 10-5, which is supposed to be improved by reducing mechanical vibration of the ball bearings. We demonstrated the evaluation method of coil wire position with magnetic field from pin point magnet, so that the accuracy of the method was comparable to um scale. We measured the prototype 5-ring PMQ singlet and evaluated harmonic components. This result was compared with the data measured at KEK.

The quadrupole magnets are being manufactured and measured for China Spoliation Neutron Source Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (CSNS/RCS) since 2012. In order to evaluate the magnet qualities, a dedicated magnetic measurement system has been developed. The main quadrupole magnets have been excited with DC current biased 25Hz repetition rate. The measurement of magnetic field was mainly based on integral field and harmonics measurements at both static and dynamic conditions. This paper describes the magnet design, the field measurement system and presents the results of the quadrupole magnet.

The paper introduces magnets and magnetic field measurements of Hefei Light Source II. In the year 2012-2014, NSRL of USTC upgraded the HLS to HLS II. The HLS II, which was built to improve the performance of the light source, in particular to get higher brilliance of synchrotron radiation and increase the number of straight section insertion devices, is now at commissioning stage. Main purpose of this stage is to achieve full energy with high current, fine emittance and enough life time based on adjustment of magnet current, RF voltage and so on. Most of the magnets were replaced during this project. A new magnetic field measurement platform was built and used for the sampling test on new magnets. Test results showed that the discreteness and uniformity of integrated magnetic field of magnets all meet the requirements.

PAL-XFEL, currently under construction in Pohang, Korea, will consist of a 10 GeV linac, three hard X-ray branches and two soft X-ray branches. As the first phase of this project, one hard X-ray (HX1) and one soft X-ray (SX1) branches will be constructed. This facility requires 6 different families of dipole magnets, and 11 families of quadrupole magnets included steering functions. We are designing these magnets with the water cooling or the heat sink system now. In this presentation, we describe the modified design of the magnets for efficient manufacturing, and the magnetic and thermal analysis with the test results.

In AVF cyclotrons the median plane of the magnetic field rather often does not coincide with the mid-plane of their magnetic system. To measure the radial component of the magnetic field, equipment based on search coils is developed and used to correct the median plane of the magnetic field. The equipment for Br mapping is described. The Br mapping and shimming results are presented for two proton therapy IBA C230 cyclotrons.

We report on the tuning of end magnets of a compact 12 MeV racetrack microtron (RTM) which is under construction at the Technical University of Catalonia. They are magnetic systems composed of four dipoles with the Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) material used as a source of the magnetic field. The poles of the magnets are equipped with tuning plungers which allow to adjust the magnetic field level. In the article we describe the tuning procedure and different techniques that were used in order to fulfill strict requirements of the field characteristics of the end magnets. It is shown that the obtained magnetic systems provide correct beam trajectories in the 12 MeV RTM.

Pulsed deflecting magnet project was worked out in BINP. The kicker design task is: impulsive force value is 1 mT*m, pulse edge is 5 ns, and impulse duration is about 200 ns. The unconventional approach to kicker design was offered. The possibility for set of wires using instead of plates using is considered. This approach allows us to reduce the effective plate surface. In this case we can decrease effects related to induced charges and currents. In the result of modelling optimal construction was developed. It includes 6 wires. The magnet aperture is about 5 cm. Calculated field rise time (about 1.5 ns) satisfies the conditions. Induced current effect reducing idea was confirmed. For configuration with 3 wires pair (with cross section of 2 mm) induced current in one wire is about 10% and in the wall is about 40%. However for design with plates current is about 40% and 20% respectively. Obtained magnet construction allows controlling of high field homogeneity by changing currents magnitudes in wires. In general we demonstrated the method of field optimization. Summary. Optimal kicker design was obtained. Wires using idea was substantiated.

A common problem for elliptically polarizing undulators (EPUs) is that the magnetic forces give a mechanical deflection in the magnet holder construction when changing the undulator phase. Gluing horizontally and vertically magnetized blocks together can increase the mechanical stability of the magnet holders. The gluing process of pairs of magnetized magnet blocks is time-consuming, expensive and difficult to carry out with high positional precision. A novel magnet production technique has been developed where un-magnetized pairs of blocks are glued together before magnetization. The large number of parts, the time for assembly, and the cost of the EPU can be reduced with the novel magnet production technique. The novel magnet production method has been used for a 2.6 m long EPU of APPLE-II type, which has been built in-house at the MAX IV Laboratory. The frame for the EPU is made of cast iron in order to get a small mechanical deformation when changing phase in the inclined mode. The paper includes detailed descriptions of the novel magnet production technique, including measurements of the magnetization, and the new EPU.

ELENA, the Extra Low ENergy Antiproton ring, will be a CERN facility with the purpose to deliver antiprotons at lowest energies aiming to enhance the study of antimatter. It will be a hexagonal shaped ring with a circumference of about 30 m decelerating antiprotons from energies of 5.3 MeV to 100 keV. Due to the extra-low beam rigidity the design of the magnet system is especially challenging because even small fields, for example arising from residual magnetization and hysteresis, will have a major impact both on the beam trajectory and beam dynamics. In this paper the design approach for such an extra-low beam rigidity magnet system is presented. The main challenges are outlined and solutions for the design of the magnet system are discussed.

Prediction of the Field Distribution in CERN-PS Magnets

The CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) has a circumference of 628 m and operates at an energy of up to 26 GeV. It uses one hundred combined function magnets, with pole shapes designed to create a dipolar and a quadrupolar field component. Each magnet is equipped with a main current circuit and five auxiliary current-circuits, which allows controlling the linear and non-linear magnetic fields. These magnets were installed in the 1950s, and part of the compensating circuits have been added or modified since then, resulting in the fact that detailed measurements of the field distribution in each individual magnet as a function of the six currents are not available. This study is performed to estimate, through deterministic and stochastic calculations, the expected mean value and standard deviation of the field harmonics of the installed magnets as input for beam dynamics simulations. The relevant results can be used to design correction schemes to minimise beam losses in the PS and to enable the acceleration of higher brightness beams required to reach the foreseen Large Hadron Collider (LHC) luminosity targets.

To decrease the loading on an AC septum magnet, a DC septum magnet was fabricated and applied to the extraction system of the booster ring at Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). The minimal gap is 16.44 mm; the core length is 800 mm and the pole width is 45 mm. The maximum peak field of the DC septum magnet is designed to be 0.95 T at 12 kA with 24-turn coils. The maximum bending angle of the electron beam passing through the septum magnet is 75.5 mrad. Because the electron beam would be perturbed by the leakage field from the septum magnet, shielding between the septum magnet and the booster ring is an important issue for the operation of the beam. Here we report the shielding method with two materials of the DC septum magnet, and discuss the field mapping and shielding from the leakage field.

Two collinear in-vacuum undulators (IU22) are adopted for light source of X-ray coherence beamline in Taiwan photon source. Each undulator is 3 meter and the drift space between two undulator is 3.991m. The synchrotron radiation is propagating in the longitudinal direction and will result in a serious heat load problem for undualtor downstream. The magnet array of undualtor downstream will received the synchrotron radiation of 142W from upstream bending magnet and undualtor. Heat load is a critical challenge for in-vacuum undulator in double mini-beta Y lattice and therefore details analysis in this paper.

Analytic methods of four kinds served for analysis of the magnetic field of TPS magnets that were simulated with OPERA 2D and 3D software. These analytic methods include fast Fourier transform, one-dimensional fitting, two-dimensional circular or elliptic fitting and a differential field. In this paper we discuss the precision of varied analytic methods for properties of a magnetic field in various situations.

A modern 3-GeV synchrotron radiation light source is under construction in NSRRC, named Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). Great quality of magnets is required to control the electron-beam in the required orbit in the storage ring (SR) and the booster ring (BR) of TPS. The mechanical and magnet field performance of these magnets were fully inspected in NSRRC. The standard deviation of the integral field strength of 48 SR-dipole magnets is better than 0.1%. The integral multipoles and offsets of the magnetic center of the 240 SR quadrupole and 168 SR sextupole magnets conform to strict specifications. The field characteristics of the BR combined-function dipole magnet were analyzed with an average of processing raw data. The standard deviation of the field strength of 54 BR dipole-magnets is better than 0.2%. The field quality of 36 BR pure quadrupole and 48 BR combined-function quadrupole magnets are accepted to meet the requirement of the booster ring. The field strength and multipole errors of 24 BR sextupole magnets were also examined. The detailed magnetic performance and technical issues of lattice magnets are discussed in this report.

In 2007 a second target station (TS2) was added to the ISIS pulsed neutron source at RAL. Two slow kicker magnets are operated in order to direct a 10Hz proton beam toward TS2 through the TS2 Extract Proton Beam line (EPB2). When first manufactured and tested, the M25/2 exhibited an unforeseen magnetic and thermal behaviour. It was quickly identified that this was caused by the eddy currents induced in the laminated core and the mechanical structure of the magnet. Corrective actions were taken to counterbalance their effects but no further analysis was performed at the time. Recent developments in hardware and software make this analysis more feasible. In this paper we present the results of the transient magnetodynamic simulation that was set up in order to model these eddy currents and study their impact on the M25/2 field quality.

The 42 km long CLIC Drive Beam Decelerator (DBD) will decelerate beams of electrons from 2.4 GeV to 240 MeV. ASTeC in collaboration with CERN has developed a novel type of tunable permanent magnet quadrupole for the DBD. Two versions of the design were produced, for the high-energy and low-energy ends of the DBD respectively. This paper outlines the design of the low-energy version, which has a tuning range of 3.5-43 T/m. A prototype was built at Daresbury Laboratory (DL) in 2013, and extensive magnetic measurements were carried out at DL.

The DDBA lattice upgrade for Diamond presents challenging requirements on the magnet system in order to satisfy the tight constraints on the beam optics. Advanced, combined function gradient dipoles and high gradient quadrupoles are needed. We present the tolerance specification, the design solutions and the measurement and alignment strategies.

A rapid cycling hybrid synchrotron has been proposed for the acceleration of muons from 375 to 750 GeV. The bending in a hybrid synchrotron is created with interleaved cold and warm dipoles; the warm dipoles modulate the average bending field for the different particle momenta. A key challenge for the warm dipole magnets is the ramp rate, which is equivalent to frequencies of 400-1000 Hz. Recently a design has been suggested which employs 6.5 Si steel for the return yoke and FeCo for the poles. In simulations the design has shown a good performance (up to 2T) due to the FeCo and acceptable power losses by employing SiFe with a high Si content. The paper discusses the effect of eddy currents induced in the laminations and hysteresis effects on the field quality.

A helical cooling channel (HCC) consisting of a pressurized gas absorber imbedded in a magnetic channel that provides solenoid, helical dipole and helical quadrupole fields has been shown to provide six-dimensional phase space reduction for muon beams. Such a channel can be implemented by a helical solenoid (HS) composed of short solenoid coils arranged in a helical pattern. The magnetic channel will provide the desired Bphi, Bz, and dBphi/dr along the reference path. The channel must allow enough space for RF cavities which replace energy lost in the absorber material present for the cooling process. The study will describe how to achieve the desired field while allowing sufficient space for the cavities. The limits to this design imposed by the achievable current density in the coils will be discussed.

The first step in the three-step laser assisted H− beam stripping for charge exchange injection is to remove one electron in a strong magnetic field. In order to preserve the beam emittance for the subsequent laser induced stripping of the second electron the magnetic field has to have large gradient of about 40 T/m along the beam trajectory. The required magnetic field strength for stripping 1GeV H− beam is 1.2 T in 29 mm aperture. In order to allow for undisturbed passage of high power beam during the nominal SNS operation the stripping magnet made of permanent magnet material resides in vacuum chamber and can move in and out of the beam line. This presentation describes requirements and design and the magnetic field calculation results for a stripping magnet for the Laser Stripping Experiment at SNS.
