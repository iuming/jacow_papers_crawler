A system to measure the full 6D beam parameters (not 3x2D) has been built at the SNS RFQ test stand. Such a measurement will allow detailed analysis of the beam physics from a properly measured input term. This invited provides an overview of the principles and design of this system, and reports on status and results.

The development of simple, fast, precise and robust beam diagnostics is absolutely necessary to optimize the performance of present accelerators and to satisfy the needs of future accelerators, in particular those with ex-treme properties such as high brightness FELs and plasma wake-field accelerators. This invited talk will present the underlying physics and results from simulation and experiments for a number of advanced optical beam diagnostics currently under development at various accelerator re-search laboratories including efforts at the Cockcroft Institute.

We introduce a new method for single-shot transverse phase-space measurement. Existing phase space measurement methods are based on either average multiple shots of the full beam (e.g. scanning slit and quad scan tomography) or a single-shot sample of the beam (e.g. pepper pot and multi-slit). To achieve a single-shot measurement of the full beam, we project the beam's x-coordinate to the y-coordinate and its x'-coordinate to the x-coordinate using a skew quadrupole magnet followed by a normal quadrupole magnet. We present a theoretical description of this projection scheme and a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration done at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility.
