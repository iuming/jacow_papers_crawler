Heavy-ion cyclotrons have contributed to nuclear physics research and various applications for more than several decades thanks to their compactness and relatively high-intensity beams. Many high-energy heavy-ion cyclotron facilities such as GANIL, MSU, RIKEN, HIRFL, Catania, were constructed in 80's and 90's and have been used actively aiming at promoting nuclear physics research, for example, studies of nuclei far from the stability line. Within these facilities, RIKEN constructed next-generation heavy-ion cyclotrons as post accelerators of the existing facility in its RI Beam Factory (RIBF) project and successfully upgraded beam energies and intensities. The present performance of RIBF is, for example, 345-MeV/nucleon 48Ca and 238U beams with the beam intensity of 530 pnA and 40 pnA, respectively. On the other hand, more compact cyclotrons have pioneered new research fields where heavy-ion cyclotrons can be applied. In this review, we will overview present performances of the existing heavy-ion facilities and discuss limitations and future possibilities of heavy-ion cyclotrons.
