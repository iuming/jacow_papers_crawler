An overview of the double branch 185m I14 Nano-probe beam-line under construction at DLS will be presented together with the end-station design in further detail. The end station consists of a split vacuum vessel containing a KB mirror configuration (at UHV) and the sample environment (at HV) which is just 50mm from the end of the final KB optic. An in-vacuum detector is mounted between the KB and the sample whilst two externally mounted detectors will operate between 0.25m & 3m from the sample. Four cryogenic samples can be brought into the vessel at a time and transferred remotely to the sample position with cooling provided by a Helium pulse tube cooler. With an initial 50nm size beam, stability is absolutely critical and careful attention has been paid in the design to mitigate any thermal and structural sources of vibration. An array of interferometers reference the KB mirrors and sample position and will be used to actively correct for any drifts. The very tight space constraints involved have greatly increased the complexity and duration of the design but testing of prototypes is now underway. The system is scheduled for build and test through the Autumn 2016.

SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is developing LCLS-II, a superconducting linear accelerator based free electron laser capable of a repetition rate up to 1 MHz. To deliver the FEL beam with minimal power loss and wavefront distortion, we need grazing-incidence plane mirrors with height errors below 1nm rms, under operational conditions. We also need to mitigate thermal effects of a complex photon energy-dependent thermal profile. We discuss a mirror cradle that minimizes figure error using variable length water cooling through a gallium-indium eutectic bath, and curve correction with an off-axis bender. We present thermal and mechanical analysis, design and prototyping results of figure sensitivity under bender corrections.

The infraredμspectroscopy beam line has been an In House project fully developed at ALBA as a result of a collaboration of different teams during the period 2014 where the design started to 2016 It is composed by a retractile mirror to extract the IR light from the bending magnet radiation and a system of 8 transport mirrors located by positioning systems designed for a high stability performance, to transport the extracted light outside the tunnel until the first End Station

European XFEL, the Free-Electron-Laser facility in Hamburg (Germany), is going to start user operation in early 2017. In full operation the novel facility will produce at MHz repetition rate coherent femtosecond pulses with unprecedented brilliance in the energy range from 250 eV to 25 keV. The facility comprises of a linear accelerator and three beam-lines: SASE1, SASE2 and SASE3 that covers the soft X-ray energy range up to 3 keV. The almost diffraction-limited beam is propagated along the beam-line with very long, cooled and super-polished mirrors. The plane VLS grating monochromator provides monochromatised beam and the optical layout consists of two alternatively insertable pre-mirrors and three gratings. All the optics are installed in the same vessel and mounted on a single in-vacuum baseplate. Degrees of freedom of the device are chosen and designed to guarantee the needed tunability and the maximum stability. The device has been mechanically tested and the vibrational performance measured to guarantee the adequate stability for the optics. This work reports about the concept, design, and test results of the monochromator with emphasis on the vibrational behaviour.
