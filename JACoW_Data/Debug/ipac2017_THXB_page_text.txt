An overview of the electron linacs either warm and SC technologies focused on applications of very low (5 MeV), low, medium and high-energy (300 MeV) for industrial, medical, security, environmental and society has to be given. Identify existing and emerging needs in the area. The technical challenges, technology gaps and emerging needs from the point of view of accelerators applications have to be described.
