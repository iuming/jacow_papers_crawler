In order to control the strong space charge effects, which cause large beam loss during the injection and acceleration processes, phase space painting method was used for injecting a small emittance beam from the linac into the large acceptance of the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS). During the beam commissioning, in order to control and optimize the painting results, the positions and ranges of the horizontal and vertical painting should be adjusted accurately. Therefore, the numerical calibration of the injection bump sizes was very important and need to be done as soon as possible. In this paper, a method to calibrate the horizontal and vertical bump sizes was presented and applied to China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). The numerical calibration results would be given and discussed.

In order to inject the H− beam to the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) with high precision and high transport efficiency, the injection beam parameters need to be measured and then corrected while its eccentric position or direction angle is too large. In this paper, firstly, a method to measure the injection beam parameters by using two of the four multi-wire scanners (MWSs) is presented. The injection commissioning results confirmed that this method works well. Secondly, a method to measure the signals of injection beam and circular beam by the INMWS02 is presented and the method work well during the beam commissioning.

In order to inject the H− beam into the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) of China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) accurately, different injection methods were used in different periods of beam commissioning for CSNS. In the early stage of beam commissioning, since the precise relative position of the injection beam and circular beam was unknown and the injection beam power was relatively small, the fixed point injection method was used. In this paper, the fixed point injection method is studied in detail and the beam commissioning results are given and discussed. In addition, a method to adjust the timing of the injection pulse power is presented and confirmed by the beam commissioning.

For generating high-intensity ion beams from linear ac-celerators, a multi-beam acceleration method which in-volves multiple accelerating beams to suppress the defo-cusing force from space charge effects, then integrating these beams by a beam funneling system, has been pro-posed. An Inter-digital H-mode (IH) two-beam type radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) with accelerating 108mA (54mA/channel×2) carbon ion from 5 to 60 keV/ u and an IH four-beam RFQ with accelerating 160.8mA (40.2mA/channel×4) carbon ion from 3.6 to 41.6 keV/u had been successfully designed for low energy heavy ion acceleration [1]. In order to demonstrate that an IH dual-beam drift tube linac (DB-DTL) is suitable for high-intensity heavy ion beam acceleration in middle energy region, we has been developing a DB-DTL prototype by using three dimensional electromagnetic CST MicroWave Studio (MWS) and using particles tracking Pi Mode Linac Orbit Calculation (PiMLOC) [2-3]. According to the simulation results, the beam dynamics design and elec-tromagnetic design will be presented in this paper.

Seven people have been diagnosed with cancer per minute in China, and cancer has been the leading cause of death with about one fourth of all deaths in China. As effective means and ways for cancer therapy, Boron Neutron Cancer Therapy (BNCT) has drawn greater attention. Accelerator based neutron source is a compact neutron source, and technologies of accelerating a high current beam has matured. We proposed an accelerator based BNCT (AB-BNCT), which can accelerate a 10 mA proton beam up to 7 MeV and target on a shelled-Beryllium. The dynamics of accelerators and neutron calculations will be reported in this paper.

A continuous wave (CW) four-vane radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator is under construction for the Low Energy Accelerator Facility (LEAF) at Institute of Modern Physics (IMP). The 5.96 m RFQ will operate with the capability of accelerating all ion species from proton to uranium from 14 keV/u up to 500 keV/u. In this paper, the low power test and tuning results of the RFQ accelerator, including the test of the separate sections and the whole cavity, will be presented. After the final tuning, the relative error of the quadrupole field is within 2% and the admixture of the dipole modes are below 4% of the quadrupole mode.

Hybrid RFQ is proposed as a potential good choice at the low-energy range of linear accelerator. The complexi-ty of mechanical design and difficulty of fabrication are part of reasons impeding application of it and similar structures. In order to explore the practicable structure and research on RF parameters of this accelerating struc-ture, an aluminium prototype is developed.

SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species) is an ISOL type facility for production and post-acceleration of exotic nuclei for forefront research in nuclear physics. Radioactive (RA) species (A=80/160) will be produced by fissions induced by a proton beam impinging on an UCx target: the proton beam will be delivered by a com-mercial cyclotron with a 40 MeV maximum energy and a 0.25 mA maximum current. The RA species, extracted from the Target-Ion-Source system as a 1+ beam , will be cooled in a RFQ (radiofrequency quadrupole) beam cool-er (RFQ-BC) and purified from the isobars contaminants through a High Resolution Mass Separator (HRMS). Post-acceleration will be performed via an ECR-based charge breeder, delivering the obtained q+ RA beam to a being built CW RFQ and to the being upgraded superconducting (sc) linac ALPI (up to 10 MeV/A for a mass-to-charge ratio A/q=7).

The J-PARC is a high intensity proton facility and the accelerator consists of a 400 MeV linac, a 3 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and a 30 GeV Main Ring Synchrotron (MR). Regarding 3 GeV beam from the RCS, we delivered it at 150 kW to the materials and life science experimental facility (MLF), for the neutron and muon users. The beam powers for the neutrino experiment at 30 GeV was 420 kW in May 2016, but increased to 470 kW in February 2017 thanks to the change and optimization of operation parameters. For the hadron experimental facility which uses a slow beam extraction mode at 30 GeV, we delivered beam at a power of 37 kW, after the recovery from a trouble at an electro static septum. We have experienced many failures and troubles to impede full potential and high availability. In this report, operational performance and status of the J-PARC accelerators are presented.

J-PARC 3-GeV RCS (rapid cycling synchrotron) provides a high-power beam both to MLF (materials and life science experimental facility) and MR (main ring synchrotron) by switching the beam destination pulse by pulse. The beam properties required from MLF and MR are different; MLF needs a wide-emittance beam with less charge density, while MR requires a low-emittance beam with less beam halo. To meet the antithetic requirements while keeping beam loss at permissible levels, RCS has recently initiated pulse-by-pulse switching of operational parameters (betatron tune, chromaticity, painting emittance, etc.). This paper presents the recent efforts toward the performance upgrade of RCS while discussing the related beam dynamics issues.

The 3 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) provides more than 300 kW beam to the Material and Life Science Facility (MLF) and the Main Ring (MR). In such high intensity hadron accelerator, the lost protons that are a fraction of the beam less than 0.1 % cause many problems. Those particles bring about a serious radioactivation and a malfunction of the accelerator components. Therefore, we carried out the beam study to achieve high power beam operation. Moreover, we also maintain the accelerator components to keep a steady operation. We report present status of the J-PARC RCS.

Multi-turn charge-exchange beam injection is key technique to achieve the high intensity proton beam accelerators. In the J-PARC RCS, 400MeV H− beams from the LINAC are converted to H+ beam with the stripper foils, and then injected into the ring. The stripper foil is irradiated by not only the injecting H− beams but also the circulating H+ beams. The high energy and high power beam irradiation into the foil induces the nuclear reactions, and generated secondary neutrons and protons. These secondary particles causes high residual does around the stripper foil. Now, to identify species of secondary particles and to identify energies and emission angles, activation analysis method using the sample pieces is considered. In this presentation, we report the result of the evaluation of this activation analysis with PHITS codes.

In the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) linac, the Annular-ring Coupled Structure (ACS) cavities have been stably operating. To maintain this operation availability, we manufactured three backups of the pillbox-type RF windows for the ACS cavities in fiscal year 2015 and 2017. It is desirable to minimize the RF reflection of the RF window to prevent standing waves from exciting between the cavity and the RF window, and not to significantly change the optimized coupling factor between the cavity and the waveguide. To realize the minimization, the relative permittivities of the ceramic disks of the RF windows were evaluated by measuring the resonant frequencies of the pillbox cavity containing the ceramic disk. On the basis of the evaluated relative permittivities, the pillbox-part lengths of the RF windows were determined. The measured Voltage Standing Wave Ratios (VSWRs) of the manufactured RF windows are just about 1.08 and these are applicable for the practical use.

A prototype target ion source was developed in order to produce a radioactive beam such as Li-8 as a part of the goals to establish a platform for secondary particle production at KOMAC (Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex). A beam transport system from the 100-MeV linac to prototype target ion source was designed and constructed. It consists of 8 quadrupole magnets, 2 bending magnets and beam diagnostic devices such as AC current transformers, beam position monitors, beam profile monitors and beam loss monitors. Details on the beam transport system and test results are presented.

For the practical application of Accelerator Driven System (ADS) that reduces the harmfulness of radioactive waste by transmutation, we are studying the development of a compact accelerator using a synchrotron as an accelerator capable of supplying a stable proton beam to a nuclear reactor. In this plan, we aim to realize down-sizing and high reliability by adopting an alternating high temperature superconducting magnet and a high repetition synchrotron applying resonant beam extraction. In this presentation we report the basic design of the optical system and beam acceleration sequence of this synchrotron.

The equation for the synchrotron motion was derived from the Hamiltonian, which was composed of coasting, betatron and synchrotron motions*. The betatron oscillation is　the horizontal oscillation. The synchrotron oscillation is not only an oscillation of the revolution frequency but also an oscillation of the average radius. The synchrotron oscillation is both longitudinal and horizontal oscillations and it is possible to exchange energy with the betatron oscillation. The synchrotron oscillation occurs under a constant particle velocity and the Hamiltonian is conserved.

In the KURRI FFAG synchrotron, charge-exchanging multi-turn injection is adopted with a stripping foil located on the closed orbit of injection energy. No injection bump orbit system is used and the beam escapes from the foil according to the closed-orbit shift by acceleration. The particles hit the foil many times and the emittance grows up during the injection. In this paper, the capture efficiencies are studied with different rf process, including adiabatic capture.

The concept of recirculating superconducting proton linac was recently proposed. Beam dynamics simulations were carried out in a double-pass recirculating proton linac using a single bunch. Although all the beam line elements should be installed following the designed values, in reality, there exist machine imperfections that will cause beam off-centering and even particle losses. In this paper, we report on the study of the static and dynamic errors from RF cavities and magnetic focusing elements in the double-pass recirculating proton linac.

A Variable Field Phase-Shifter for Recirculating Proton Linacs
1072

The recirculating superconducting proton linac that has a potential to substantially save accelerator cost was re-cently proposed. It consists of three sections to accelerate the continues-wave (CW) beam to multiple GeVs. In the first section, the beam passes the linac two times. In the second and third sections, the beam goes through the linac four and six times. A phase-shifter is needed to meet the synchronous acceleration condition for multi-pass accel-eration using the same RF cavity due to the phase slip-page of the proton beam. Here we present the design of a variable field rectangular bend phase-shifter in which the beam goes to a different path in each pass inside the mag-net to meet the synchronous condition.

Control of the beam-energy ramp along the length of a proton linear accelerator is required to keep the accelerator tuned according to design. Historically, the values of the field amplitudes and phases of the side-coupled, 805-MHz LANSCE linac modules are maintained using a well-known delta-t tuning procedure*. Time-of-flight measurements of the proton beam energy are now also being used to confirm and improve the overall control of the energy ramp along the linac. The time-of-flight method uses measurements of the difference in RF phases measured as the beam passes installed delta-t pickup loops. A newly developed chassis to control the 3D position of the beam centroid is used. Details of the procedure and results of measurements are presented.

Operation of an accelerator facility critically depends on stability of the field amplitudes and phases of the accelerating cavities. The LANSCE linear accelerator consists of a 201.25-MHz, drift-tube linac and an 805-MHz, side-coupled-cavity linac (SCL). Beam losses in the high-energy beamlines of the 800-MeV facility were measured versus variation of the amplitudes and phases of the 805-MHz, SCL, RF cavities. A recent study* confirms that to achieve low losses, the stability of the amplitudes and phases should be kept within 0.1% and 0.1o, respectively. This agrees with a previous study of beam losses in the 201.25-MHz linac. Details of the measurements and results are presented.

3D Beam Dynamics Modeling of MEBT for the New LANSCE RFQ Injector
1081

The new RFQ-based proton injector at LANSCE requires a specialized medium-energy beam transfer (MEBT) after the RFQ at 750 keV due to a following long (~3 m) existing common transfer line that also serves for transporting negative-ion beams to the DTL entrance. The horizontal space for MEBT elements is limited because two beam lines merge at 18-degree angle. The MEBT design developed with envelope codes includes two compact quarter-wave RF bunchers and four short quadrupoles with steerers, all within the length of about 1 m. The beam size in the MEBT is large, comparable to the beam-pipe aperture, hence non-linear 3D field effects at large radii become important. Using CST Studio codes, we calculate buncher RF fields and quadrupole magnetic fields and use them to perform particle-in-cell beam dynamics modeling of MEBT with realistic beam distributions from the RFQ. Our results indicate a significant emittance growth not predicted by standard beam dynamics codes. Its origin was traced mainly to the quadrupole edge fields. Quadrupole design modifications are proposed to improve the MEBT performance.

The Marburg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre offers hadron therapy using proton and carbon beams. The accelerator is based on a 65-m ion synchrotron by Danfysik/Siemens Healthcare. Beam extraction from the synchrotron is driven by a transverse RF knock-out (KO) system featuring Dynamic Intensity Control (DIC) of the spill. DIC allows modulation of the extraction rate by factors up to 30 on millisecond time scales. A fast response of the system to the variable intensity set-point can be obtained by careful adjustment of the RF-KO spectrum relative to the machine tune. Tracking simulations of the extraction phase have been conducted to refine that behaviour. Presently, we investigate how fast machine tune shifts, induced by an air-core quadrupole lens, can be used as a way to further improve the spill quality.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) driver linac is to accelerate all the stable ion beams from proton to uranium beyond 200 MeV/u with beam powers up to 400 kW, which will be the first large-scale, CW SRF ion linac. The beam commissioning of the front end (from the ion source to the RFQ) already began and is in progress. The Accelerator Readiness Review (ARR) for beam through the first three β=0.041 cryomodules is scheduled for May 2018. The next step is the beam commissioning through the 12 SRF cavities housed in these 3 cryomodules with 6 superconducting solenoid magnets. The cryomodules and the adjacent warm diagnostics boxes in between have been already installed and aligned in the tunnel. This paper describes the installation progress of the β=0.041 cryomodules and plans for ARR02.

The radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a 4-vane type cavity designed to accelerate heavy ion beams with charge states Q/A between 1/7 and 1/3 from 12 keV/u to 0.5 MeV/u. The RFQ was assembled in the FRIB tunnel in November 2016. Bead-pull measurements and tuning were performed with low RF power. The RFQ has been conditioned to 59 kW in August 2017, which is sufficient to accelerate the Key Performance Parameter (KPP) beams, Argon and Krypton. The RFQ has been successful-ly commissioned with KPP beams in CW regime in Octo-ber 2017. 40Ar9+ and 86Kr17+ beams were accelerated by the FRIB RFQ in the CW regime to the designed energy of 0.5 MeV/u. With the multi-harmonic buncher operation-al, the FRIB RFQ commissioning has been completed with bunched beam in February 2018. The beam trans-mission efficiency through the RFQ was in good agree-ment with PARMTEQ simulation results. The detailed results from the FRIB RFQ tuning, high power condition-ing and beam commissioning will be presented in this paper.

The commissioning of the FRIB Front End with 12 keV/u argon beam started in the spring of 2017*. Beam profile monitors were used to evaluate RMS Twiss parameters in various locations along the beam line. Beam dynamics in the LEBT was simulated using full 3D model of beam optics elements in the tracking codes. We found a good consistency between measured and simulated data. A beam image viewer was used to measure the beam density distribution in the real space. A hollow beam structure was observed in the Ar9+ beam with the current of ~20 eμA. Extensive beam dynamics study with 3D tracking code suggests that the hollow density distribution can be generated by space charge effects of the multi-component, multi-charge state ion beam just after the ECR ion source. This paper reports studies of a mechanism that can produce a hollow beam structure.

Original neutron generator* on the base of pulse accelerating vacuum tube with two targets, symmetrically located on the both sides of deuteron source is discussed. Two immersion lenses in front of each other uses as accelerating and focusing systems. Lenses cathodes are Faraday cups with targets for neutron production on the bottom. Symmetric ring magnetic elements cover immersion lenses for correcting focusing conditions. Computer simulation allows us to choose electrodes geometry and accelerating pulse value for electron flow from ion-electron emission oscillate between the targets and provide device operate as reflective triode. Estimations of neutron flow and spatio-temporal neutron field structure are done.

Scheme for thermonuclear neutron generation in compact Budker-Post trap with barrel-shaped pulsed magnetic field produced by two symmetrically located thin coils with diameter not exceed 0.05 m is proposed. During neutron generation in the trap simultaneously forms plasma which include hydrogen nuclides with density up to 1013 m-3 and two pulsed counter hydrogen nuclides flows accelerated in the diodes. Diodes consist of transparent anode with the form of sphere sector symmetrically covered by the same form grounded cathode. Diodes located symmetrically in front of each other, coaxially to magnetic trap. Computer simulation shows possibility to generate up to 1010 neutrons per pulse for deuterium-tritium compound in the diode system with transverse dimension ~0.1 m, amplitude and accelerating pulse duration 5.105 V and 100 nsec. The value of magnetic induction in the center of the trap should be approximately equal to 20 T.

Future high current proton accelerators will need to minimize beam loss due to space-charge in order to achieve safe operation while achieving the desired physics goals. One method of space-charge compensation to be tested at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at Fermilab is the Electron Column. The concept for this device is to allow a circulating beam to ionize a small region of relatively high pressure residual gas, while using electric and magnetic fields to confine and shape the resulting plasma electrons. If the profile of the electrons is matched to the beam profile transversely and longitudinally, the electrons should counteract the space-charge force of the proton beam. Simulations of the IOTA proton beam circulating through the Electron Column have been performed, with the evolution of the electron plasma and its effect on the beam studied.

The experimental development of H− laser assisted charge exchange, a.k.a. laser stripping, has been ongoing at the SNS accelerator since 2006 in a three-phase approach. The first two phases associated with proof-of-principle and proof-of-practicality experiments have been successfully completed and demonstrated >95% H− stripping efficiency for up to 10 us. The final phase is a proof-of-scalability stage to demonstrate that the method can be deployed for realistic beam duty factors. The experimental component of this effort is centered on achieving high efficiency stripping through the use of a laser power amplification scheme to recycle the macropulse laser light at the interaction point of the H− stripping. Such a recycling cavity will be necessary for any future operational laser stripping system with at least millisecond duration H− pulses. A second component of the proof-of-scalability phase is to develop a conceptual design for a realistic laser stripping scheme. The status of these efforts and challenges associated with deploying the recycling cavity into the laser stripping experiment will be described in this talk.

A new RFQ was successfully installed recently in the SNS linac to replace the old RFQ that was used for more than a decade with certain operational limitations. The new RFQ was completely tested with H− ion source in the Beam Test Facility (BTF) at SNS. For robust operation of SNS at 1.4 MW, the full design beam power and to satisfy the beam current requirement of the forthcoming SNS proton power upgrade (PPU) project, an RFQ with enhanced performance and reliability was needed. The new RFQ was built to have the beam parameters identical to those of the first RFQ but with improved RF and mechanical stability and reliability for continuous operation of neutron production. The tests confirmed that the new RFQ can run with high beam transmission efficiency at around 90 % and notably improved operational stability. In this paper, construction, test, installation, and operation of the new RFQ in SNS are discussed with the performance improvements.

High-radiation-tolerant fiber-optic strain sensors were recently developed to measure the transient proton-beam-induced strain profiles on the mercury target vessel at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). Here we report the strain measurement results and radiation-resistance performance on the latest SNS mercury target vessel equipped with helium gas injection. The results have demonstrated the efficacy of gas injection to reduce the cyclic stress on the target module.

Over the past year PPU has completed the reviews necessary for Critical Decision-1 approval. The baseline design choices are being refined, and a cost-effective approach has been identified. The beam energy will be increased by 30% and the beam current capability improved by ~50%. The sub-system improvements and anticipated schedule will be discussed.

A new 162.5 MHz RFQ has been built for a joint 973 project between Peking University (PKU) and Institute of Modern Physics (IMP). It is designed to deliver 50-mA deuteron beams to 1 MeV in CW mode, with an inter-voltage of 60 kV and a length of 1.809 m. Due to its window-type structure, the RFQ has compact cross-section, sufficient mode separation and high specific shunt impedance. It consists of two segments fabricated and installed at IMP. The assembling error of the cavity is less than 0.05 mm. The RF measurements show good electrical properties of the resonant cavity with a measured unloaded quality factor equal to 96.4% of the simulated value. After tuning, we obtained the nominal frequency and field unbalance within 1.0%. Preparation of high-power test of this RFQ is underway. This paper will cover the fabrication details and RF measurements, as well as the progress of high-power test.

The deuteron driver accelerator of the Beijing Iso-tope Separation On-Line (BISOL) facility will acceler-ate and deliver a 20 mA deuteron beam to the targets with an energy of 40 MeV. As the injector of the driver linac, an RFQ is required to bunch and accelerate the 20 mA deuteron beam to 3 MeV with very high beam quality. In order to fulfil these requirements and re-duce time spent on optimization, an RFQ design pro-gram named RFQEP has been developed to generate the input file for the PARMTEQM code. In this program, the ‘matched and equipartitioned' design strategy is adopted to prevent halo formation and to avoid struc-ture resonances in high intensity RFQs. The detailed design aspects are studied in this paper and simulation results are given for an RFQ designed by this code, which shows the accuracy and the merits of the new program.

The Compact Intense Fast NEutron Facility (CIFNEF) project aims to produce high intense neutrons via the 7Li (d, n) 8Be reaction using a 5 MeV, 10 mA deuteron linac. The main components of the linac are an ion source, a short radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) and an interdigi-tal H-mode drift tube linac (IH-DTL). The IH-DTL will accelerate the continuous wave (CW) deuteron beam from 1 MeV to 5 MeV with a total cavity length of 1.25 m using Kombinierte Null Grad Struktur (KONUS) design, achieving an accelerating gradient of 3.2 MV/m. The RF power loss for the whole cavity is estimated to be 85 kW. This high power loss is a significant challenge to the cooling design, as it could cause large rises in tempera-ture, thermal deformation and frequency drift. A detailed multi-physics analysis of the CW IH-DTL is presented in this paper.

ISIS is the pulsed spallation neutron source located at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. Operation is based on a 50 Hz, 800 MeV proton synchrotron, accelerating up to 3·1013 protons per pulse (ppp), which provides beam to two target stations. ISIS is beam loss limited, so to achieve greater beam intensity and optimal operation, losses must be reduced. Some beam loss may be attributed to resonance lines found in betatron tune space. These could be driven by higher order magnet field components, errors or misalignment. This paper describes work measuring losses against tune space around the ISIS working point. Experiments have been carried out to measure beam loss against tune in the ISIS synchrotron. The experiments were done at low intensity to minimise space charge and intensity effects. Resonance lines that cause beam loss can be clearly identified and provide new information about the machine. The experimental process has been automated in order to decrease experiment duration and to reduce systematic human error. MAD-X models that compare the beam envelope at different points in tune space to the beam pipe aperture are used to distinguish between losses caused by increased envelope size and losses induced by driven resonances.

The ISIS Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory produces intense neutron and muon beams for condensed matter research. The facility's 50Hz rapid cycling synchrotron accelerates protons from 70 to 800MeV to deliver a mean beam power of 0.2MW to two target stations. Since 2016, ISIS has routinely used commercially produced carbon based foils for beam stripping during charge-exchange injection. Recent experience and developments to increase useful foil lifetime are presented including in-house high temperature annealing of foils prior to use. The installation and performance of a new foil imaging system are described and, finally, the procedure to change the stripping foil is described. Issues with the current arrangements and options for redesign are discussed.

High Order Image Terms and Harmonic Closed Orbits at the ISIS Synchrotron

ISIS is the spallation neutron source at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. Protons are accelerated from 70 to 800 MeV in a 50 Hz rapid cycling synchrotron. Due to the intense beam, space charge forces are high during the first part of the acceleration cycle. The vacuum vessel in the synchrotron has a rectangular shape where the apertures are conformal to the design beam envelopes. At high intensities image forces interact with the beam, especially when the closed orbit is large. An analysis of image forces has been made and used to classify higher order image terms. These have been identified using simulations of round beams in rectangular vacuum vessels. The higher order image terms from harmonic closed orbits have been used with single particle resonance theory, taking account of the coherent nature of the beam response. Several predictions of beam resonance have been made. A simulation study has been carried out using a smooth focusing lattice and uniform density beams. Resonant beam behaviour has been observed and explained by the proposed theory.

An accompanying experiment was set up to evaluate the control of caesium boiler delivery in the various ISIS penning sources. Results indicate Cs flux fluctuates at constant settings, which must be accounted for to interpret graphite gettering results. Future studies to identify the cause of fluctuations are considered, and a more rigorous experiment to study the use of graphite is introduced.

ISIS is the spallation neutron source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK, which provides 0.2 MW of beam power via a 50 Hz, 800 MeV proton RCS. Detailed studies are now under way to find the optimal configuration for a next generation, short pulsed neutron source that will define a major ISIS upgrade in ~2031. Accelerator configurations being considered for the MW beam powers required include designs exploiting FFAG rings as well as conventional accumulator and synchrotron rings. This paper describes work exploring the latter, conventional options, but includes the possibility of pushing further toward intensity limits to reduce facility costs. The scope of planned studies is summarised, looking at optimal exploitation of existing ISIS infrastructure, and incorporating results from recent target studies and user consultations. Results from initial baseline studies for an accumulator ring and RCS located in the existing ISIS synchrotron hall are presented. Injection scheme, foil limits, longitudinal and transverse beam dynamics optimization with related beam loss and activation are outlined, as are results from detailed 3D PIC simulations.

Any ISOL facility pushing the boundaries of nuclear physics must be able to provide cutting-edge ion beams to its users - beams of isotopes far from stability, with few contaminants, that may be difficult to extract from an ISOL target. The development of these pure, exotic beams must be supported by continuing research and development on targets and ion sources. In the ARIEL era, new target/ion source geometries and operational modes will provide new opportunities which can only be exploited with time for development. To prioritize this, TRIUMF proposes to build a dedicated test stand for target and ion source research which will model the critical features of the new ARIEL target stations. This stand will provide a testing ground for methods of increasing efficiency and selectivity, such as investigations of new surface ion source [1,2] and FEBIAD ion source [3] designs. In addition, this will provide a development environment for new beams, either from new target materials, or through techniques such as extracting molecular beams. In order to maximize the gain from these investigations in on-line operation, the ion optical properties of the final beam will be investigated concurrently.

Recent Developments for Cyclotron Extraction Foils at TRIUMF

The TRIUMF 500 MeV H− cyclotron employs stripping foils to extract multiple beams for different experimental programs. The upgrades in foil material and foil holders lead to significant improvements in beam quality and foil life time, as well as reduction of Be-7 contamination originated in the foils. Thus, an accumulated beam charge extracted with a single foil increased from ~60 mA·hours to more than 500 mA·hours. A key role that lead to these advances was an understanding of the foil heating mechanism, major contribution to which is paid by the power deposition from electrons stripped by the foil. To further diminish this effect, we recently introduced a foil tilt from the vertical orientation that allows stripped electrons fast escape from the foil, well before losing their original momentum through the heat deposition. Other improvements were related to operational issues. Introduction of a "combo" foil consisting of wide portion and thin wire allowed both high and low intensity beam extraction without foils sacrifice. Deploying a wedge foil for extraction at 100 MeV helped reduction of beam intensity instabilities caused by beam vertical size and position fluctuations.

We report simulations of the HL-LHC dynamic aperture (DA) at collision energy in the presence of beam-beam effects (weak-strong approximation) aiming to determine its dependence on the working point in tune space. Both linear domains working points are explored, spanning over (0.028 – 0.33) in horizontal tune, and two-dimensional ones which focus on more promising sub-regions near the diagonal. The range of parameters, such as bunch intensity and emittance, are chosen to correspond to the more important HL-LHC scenarios. A comparison with the LHC as built is also made. Direct benefit from these studies is the possible identification of working points alternative to the nominal one (in terms of dynamic aperture). They also help to understand the dependence of DA on particular resonance lines present in the vicinity of the footprint. In this work, the necessary resources were provided by the LHC@home project, based on the BOINC-SixTrack platform for distributed Computing.

The Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring (ELENA) will be a critical upgrade to the unique Antiproton Decelerator facility at CERN and is currently being commissioned. ELENA will significantly enhance the achievable beam quality and enable new experiments. To fully exploit the discovery potential of this facility, advances are urgently required in numerical tools that can adequately model beam transport, life time and interaction, beam diagnostics tools and detectors to fully characterize the beam's properties, as well as in novel experiments that exploit the enhanced beam quality that ELENA will provide. These three areas form the scientific work packages of the new pan-European research and training initiative AVA (Accelerators Validating Antimatter physics). The project has received around 4M€ of funding and brings together universities, research centers and industry to train 15 Fellows through research in this area. This contribution presents the research results across AVA's three scientific work packages.

Cooling ion beams at high energy is presently considered for several ion colliders, in order to achieve high luminosities by enabling a significant reduction of emittance of hadron beams. Electron beam at cooling channel in a few to tens MeV can be accelerated by a RF/SRF linac, and thus using bunched electrons to cool bunched ions. To study such cooling process, the DC electron gun of EC35 cooler at the storage ring CSRm, IMP was modified by pulsing the grid voltage. A 0.07-3.5 micro-second pulse length with a repetition frequency of less than 250 kHz and synchronized with the ion revolution frequency was obtained. The first experimental demonstration of cooling of a coasting and bunched ion beam by a pulsed electron beam was carried out. Data analysis indicates the bunch length shrinkage and the momentum spread reduction of bunched 12C+6 ion beam as evidence of cooling. A longitudinal grouping effect of the coasting ion beam by the electron pulses has also been observed*. In this paper, we will present experimental results and comparison to the simulation modelling, particularly on the bunched electron cooling data after carefully analyzing the beam diagnostic signals.

JLEIC is the electron ion collider under design at Jefferson Lab, which will provide a luminosity up to 1034 cm-2s−1. To reach the high luminosity, short ion and electron bunches with high charge density colliding in high frequency are proposed in JLEIC design. The high charge density of the ion beam leads to strong intrabeam scattering effect, which enlarges the ion beam emittance and ruins the luminosity if not mitigated. Magnetized electron cooling is implemented to overcome the intrabeam scattering effect and to reduce or maintain the ion beam emittance. In this paper, we discuss the redistribution of the cooling effects in the longitudinal and the transverse directions by introducing the dispersion of the ion beam in the cooling section. When the charge density of the cooling electron beam varies, the dispersion of the ion beam leads to an increase of the transverse cooling rate and a reduction of the longitudinal cooling rate, while the total decrement of the Courant-Snyder invariant of the ion beam increases. Both theoretical analysis and numerical calculation are presented.

J-PARC E34 experiment aims to measure the muon g-2/EDM precisely with novel techniques including the muon linear accelerator. Slow muon source by the metal foil method in order to cool the muon beam has been developed for the muon acceleration test with RF accelerator, because the muon beam derived from the proton driver was the tertiary beam and has a large emittance. The first verification test of the muon acceleration with RFQ was carried out at the muon test beam line of J-PARC MLF in October 2017. The incident surface muons were decelerated by the thin metal foil target and produced the negative muonium ions (Mu-), which is the bound stat of a positive muon and two electrons. After Mu- were extracted by a electrostatic accelerator as the injector of the RFQ, they were accelerated with RFQ to 88.6 keV. The accelerated Mu- were identified by the momentum selection with the bending magnet after the RFQ, and the measurement of the Time-Of-Flight. Accelerated Mu- were easily distinguished from penetrated positive muons by the difference of the polarity. The latest analysis result of the world's first muon acceleration with RFQ will be reported in this paper.

The structure used for the simulations is a novel 200 MHz, 2.5 MeV, CW RFQ/RFI LINAC designed by Ion Linac Systems (ILS). The structure design and parameters are provided, simulation techniques are explained, and results from all three code families are presented. These results are then compared with each other, identifying similarities and differences. Numerous parameters for comparison are used, including the transmission efficiency, Q-factor, E-field on axis, and beam properties. Preliminary anchoring between modeling and simulation performance predictions and experimental measurements will be provided.
