We present the results of the commissioning of the pulsed linear electron accelerator with beam energy of 10 MeV, developed with the participation of scientists and engineers of the SINP MSU, LEA MSU Ltd. and JSC "RPE "Toriy". The source of RF power for accelerator is a multibeam klystron KIU-147A operating at 2856 MHz with pulse output power 6 MW and an average power of 25 kW. As a result of commissioning we received at the output of accelerator scanning system an electron beam with an energy of 10 MeV and an average power of more than 15 kW. Capture ratio and electronic efficiency of 1.24 m long accelerating structure are greater than 65%.

To meet the growing requirements of the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) in the electronic components testing, the first dedicated beamline was created in 2011. At 2014 the full value facility, consisted of three different beamlines, was successfully commissioned and routinely used. Since then, plenty of efforts were spent for upgrade of beamlines and elaboration of new methods of high energy heavy ion beam parameters evaluation and control under the SEE testing. The current status of the facility, the last news of the ion beam control at high level of LTE and the 7-year roadmap will be presented.

The paper outlines design parameters and construction features of an electron linear accelerator to be operated in the D.I.Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM). The accelerator system is intended to form electron and bremsstrahlung radiation fields of variable intensity. This shall extend characteristics of the National measurement standard to be used for calibration of a space monitoring equipment, embedded measuring means for industrial accelerator facilities and others. The accelerator system consists of an electron source, resonance accelerating structure, beam-bending magnet'separator and radiation head with a block of bremsstrahlung targets, foils and collimators. An important feature of the system is spatial steadiness of radiation field at energies varied from 5 to 20 MeV and more than tenfold variation of the accelerated particle current. The status of the project will be presented as well.
