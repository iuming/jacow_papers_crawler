In PNPI RNC KI a universal center for testing electronic components for the needs of aviation and space and other applications is created on the synchrocyclotron SC-1000 with the proton energy of 1 GeV. The center consists of two protons and one neutron stands for test facilities developed at the PNPI in collaboration with the ROSCOSMOS Interagency Testing Center. The PNPI center is equipped with all necessary systems of diagnostics and monitoring of a beam, installation of targets on a beam. There is an opportunity to vary temperature of exemplars in the wide range. A unique conjunction of proton beams with variable energy 60-1000 MeV and atmospheric like neutron beam with broad energy range (1-1000 MeV) spectrum enable to perform complex testing of the semiconductor electronic devices at the SC-1000 within a single testing cycle.

A high current cyclotron C-80 with the energy of extracted proton beam of 40-80 MeV and the current up to 200 mkA has been constructed at PNPI (Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute). Presently the work is in progress for external proton beam adjustment. The main goal of the C-80 is production of medical radionuclides for diagnostics and therapy. This cyclotron is also intended for treatment of ophthalmologic diseases by irradiation of malignant eye formation. At the beam of C-80 the radioisotope complex RIC-80 (Radioactive Isotopes at cyclotron C-80), has been designed, which ensures obtaining sources of a high activity practically for the whole list of medical radionuclides produced at accelerators. An essential peculiarity of the RIC-80 is the use of the mass-separator that will allow the production of separated high purity radionuclides very important for medicine purposes. Presently different target prototypes for the production of radionuclides at the RIC-80 are being developed. The results of different target material tests for production of radioisotopes 67Cu, 82Sr, 223, 224Ra and others have been presented.

The projected MCC-30/15 cyclotron system is intended for operation in high-technology nuclear medicine centers. The system consists of a cyclotron, target systems for production of radionuclides in liquid, gaseous and solid states and a beamline for transport of accelerated ions to final units. The updated MCC-30/15 cyclotron with new systems for external injection, RF power supply and acceleration will ensure accelerated proton and deuteron beams in energy ranges of 15 - 30 and 9 - 15 MeV and currents not lower than 200 and 70 mkA respectively. Target systems are equipped with systems for remote replacement of gaseous and liquid targets. Modular configuration of the beamline will allow the production of isotopes and carrying out of researches to be performed in separate experimental halls.

The CC-18/9M cyclotron system has been designed, manufactured and delivered to JSC "NIITFA", Moscow to be operated in a pilot PET center. Acceptance tests have been conducted; design parameters of the updated cyclotron have been obtained: energy variation of accelerated proton and deuteron beams within the ranges of 12 - 18 and 6 - 9 MeV with currents of 150 and 50 mkA respectively. For the first time in NIIEFA practice the cyclotron is equipped with a target system intended for the production of F-18 and C-11 radionuclides for PET. At present the cyclotron system in the PET center is put into commercial operation.

For a long time a gantry was considered as a mandatory element for proton/ion therapy facility. However medics from MGH (Boston) suggested alternative concept which leads to decrease both cost and size of the facility*. The concept is based on the following provisions: - immovable isocenter; - active scanning of a target volume; - different positions of patients at different fractions: - using CT on the place of irradiation after each change of positions of the patient for improvement plan; - using small change direction of the beam (like ±100). The "Planar isocentric system" developed by author can be used to enlarge the flexibility of the concept**. It's relatively chip, small and can be realized for short time. It can be used for treatment for 90% of localizations. The system can replace gantry in centers of proton/ion therapy providing significant decreasing of treatment price. The details of the system are presented and discussed.
