An Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is the highest priority for future U.S. accelerator-based nuclear physics facility following the completion of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). Two laboratories are competing to host the future EIC: Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL) and Jefferson Lab. (JLab). The baseline design of JLab’s Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC) ion complex comprises a pulsed superconducting (SC) linac injector capable of accelerating all ions from protons to lead, where proton and light ion beams can be polarized. After reviewing the design requirements for the injector linac, important design choices such as the room-temperature (RT) section design, the transition energy between the RT and SC sections and the stripping energy for heavy ions will be discussed. The design of the different linac sections will be presented as well as the results of end-to-end beam dynamics simulations for polarized deuterons and un-polarized lead ions.
