Eight of the medium and high beta cryomodules deliv-ered to ESS by CEA are tested at CEA before delivery; the two medium and high beta prototypes and the three first of each type of the series. The goal of these tests is to validate the assembly and the performances on few cryomodules before the next cryomodules of the series are delivered to ESS. This paper summarizes the general results obtained during the tests at 2 K and at high RF power, Pmax = 1.1 MW. The cavities reach the ESS re-quirements, Eacc = 16.7 MV/m (Medium beta) and 19.9 MV/m (High beta) with an efficient compensation of the Lorentz detuning by the piezo tuner over the full RF pulse length of 3.6 ms at 14 Hz. After the successful tests at CEA, the first cryomodules have been shipped to ESS where the final acceptance test are performed.

The 352.21 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) for the European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS) has been delivered by the end of 2019 by CEA/IRFU. The RFQ is designed to accelerate a 70 mA proton beam from 75 keV up to 3.62 MeV. It consists of a 4-vane resonant cavity with a total length of 4.6 m. Two coaxial power loop couplers feed the RFQ with the 1.4 MW of RF power required for beam operation. This paper first presents the main systems required for the RFQ conditioning. Then it summarizes the main steps and results of this high power RF conditioning completed at ESS from June 9 to July 29, 2021 in order to achieve the nominal field for a pulse length of 3.2ms at the repetition rate of 14Hz.

At CEA-Saclay we are currently testing the European Spallation Source (ESS) high beta cryomodules (CM). Each cryomodule is equipped with four superconducting elliptical cavities with their ancillaries (fundamental power couplers (FPC), frequency tuners and magnetic shields). The cavity are designed to accelerate protons with relativistic speed about β=0.86 and operate at an accelerating field of 19.9MV/m. During cryomodule test, operational parameters are inspected by powering up one cavity at the time. A dedicated gamma ray detection system has been designed and installed around the cryomodule in order to have a more precise insight into field emission phenomenon occurring during cryomodule operation. Recently we were able to obtain time resolved data concerning radiation emerging from the cavities due to field emission.

The quadrupole resonator (QPR) is a dedicated sample-test cavity for the RF characterization of superconducting samples in a wide temperature, RF field and frequency range. Its main purpose are high resolution measurements of the surface resistance with direct access to the residual resistance thanks to the low frequency of the first operating quadrupole mode. Besides the well-known high resolution of the QPR, a bias of measurement data towards higher values has been observed, especially at higher harmonic quadrupole modes. Numerical studies show that this can be explained by parasitic RF losses on the adapter flange used to mount samples into the QPR. Coating several micrometer of niobium on those surfaces of the stainless steel flange that are exposed to the RF fields significantly reduced this bias, enabling a direct measurement of a residual resistance smaller than 5 nano-Ohm at 2 K and 413 MHz.

Trapped magnetic flux in superconducting cavities can significantly increase surface resistance, and, thereby, limits the cavities’ performance. To reduce trapped flux in cavities, a better understanding of the fundamental mechanism of flux trapping is vital. We develop a new experimental design: measuring magnetic flux density at 15 points just above a niobium sheet of dimensions (100 x 60 x 3) mm with a time resolution of up to 2 ms and a flux resolution better than 0.5 µT. This setup allows us to control the temperature gradient and cooldown rate, both independently of each other, as well as the magnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We present data gathered on a large-grain sample as well as on a fine-grain sample. Our data suggests that not only the temperature gradient but also the cooldown rate affects trapped flux. Additionally, we detect a non-trivial relationship between trapped flux and magnitude of applied field.

New CH-DTL cavities designs of the planned Helmholtz Linear Accelerator (HELIAC) are developed in collaboration of HIM, GSI and IAP Frankfurt. The linac, operated in cw-mode with a final energy of 7.3 MeV/u, is intended for various experiments, in particular with heavy ions at energies close to the Coulomb barrier for research on SHE. Twelve sc CH cavities are foreseen, divided into four different cryostats. Each cavity will be equipped with dynamic bellow tuner. After successful beam tests with CH0, CH3 to CH11 are being designed. Based on the experience gained so far, optimization will be made, which will lead to both an increase in performance in terms of reducing the peak fields limiting superconductivity and a reduction in manufacturing costs and time. In order to optimize manufacturing, attention was paid to design many parts of the cavity, such as lids, spokes, tuner and helium shell, with the same geometrical dimensions. In addition, a tuner test rig was developed, which will be used to investigate the mechanical properties of the bellow tuner. For this purpose, different simulations were made in order to realize conditions as close as possible to reality in the test rig.

Goethe University (GU), Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) and Helmholtz Institut Mainz (HIM) work in collaboration on the Helmholtz Linear Accelerator (HELIAC). A new superconducting (sc) continous wave (cw) high intensity heavy ion linear accelerator (Linac) will provide ion beams with maximum duty factor up to beam energies of 7.3 MeV/u. The acceleration voltage will be provided by sc Crossbar-H-mode (CH) cavities, developed of Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) at GU. Cavity preparation is researched and optimized towards widely used elliptical multicell cavities. A standardized preparation protocol for CH cavities is researched in collaboration between GU, GSI and HIM on a 360 MHz 19 gap CH prototype. Baseline measurements and a 120°C 48 hour bake produced higher maximum gradient, higher intrinsic quality factor and a shorter cavity conditioning phase. As a critical preparation step, High Pressure Rinsing (HPR) with ultra pure water will be performed at HIM and is currently in preparation. HPR cycles are currently tested on a CH dummy with a new nozzle layout that is optimized towards CH cavity geometry.

Annealings of niobium cavities in UHV or nitrogen atmospheres are crucial for the performance in the later cryogenic tests and operation. Recovery methods for imperfect annealing conditions have been discussed, and a more recent proposal, the so-called "nitric acid soak" has been studied here in detail. It shows surprising recovery potential, albeit the unclear origin of this improvement. We present our investigation on the several potential origins. For this, we used SEM, SIMS and XPS measurements of niobium samples to study the surface morphology and contaminations. We can reject the favored hypothesis on the origin of the improvement, and propose an alternative origin.

Magnetic flux trapped in the niobium bulk material of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities degrades their quality factor and the accelerating gradient. The sensitivity for flux trapping is mainly determined by the treatment and the geometry of the cavity as well as the niobium grain size and orientation. To potentially improve the flux expulsion characteristics of SRF cavities and hence the efficiency of future accelerator facilities, further studies of the trapping behavior are essential. For this purpose a magnetometric mapping system to monitor the magnetic flux along the outer cavity surface of 1.3 GHz TESLA-Type single-cell SRF cavities has been developed and is currently in the commissioning phase at DESY. Contrary to similar approaches, this system digitizes the sensor signals already inside of the cryostat to extensively reduce the number of required cable feedthroughs. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and consequently the measuring sensitivity can be enhanced by shorter analog signal lines, less thermal noise and the Mu-metal shielding of the cryostat. In this contribution test results gained by a prototype of the mapping system are presented.

Many accelerator projects such as the ILC would benefit from cavities with reduced surface resistance (high Q-values) while maintaining a high accelerating gradient. A possible way to meet the requirements is the so-called nitrogen-infusion procedure on Niobium cavities. However, a fundamental understanding and a theoretical model of this method are still missing. One important parameter is the residual resistance ratio (RRR) which is related to the impurity content of the material. We report the investigated RRR on samples in a wide temperature range in a vacuum and under a nitrogen atmosphere. This comparison made it possible to make statements about the differences in the concentration of nitrogen by varying the temperature. The samples are pure cavity-grade niobium and treated in the same manner as cavities. For this purpose, a small furnace dedicated to sample treatment was set up to change and explore the parameter space of the infusion recipe. Care was taken to achieve the highest level of purity possible in the furnace and in a pressure range of 1.0·10-8 mbar in order to meet the high requirements of nitrogen infusion.

Recent technological advances and material treatments have pushed Nb SRF cavities to their maximum RF performance. A novel approach for overcoming this limitation, which takes advantage of RF field only penetrates into the superconductor at a certain distance called London penetration depth, is nano-structuring multilayers with PEALD (plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition). SIS (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) multilayers provide magnetic screening of the bulk Nb cavity, increasing the field at which the vortex penetration starts, and higher quality factor. ALD is closely related to chemical vapor deposition and bases on sequential self-limit gas-solid surface reactions facilitating conformal coatings with sub-nm precision even on complex substrates such as the interior of a cavity. As a preliminary study for SIS SRF cavities, we investigated the AlN-NbTiN/NbN multilayers grown by PEALD. Different compositions, thicknesses, and post-deposition thermal treatments have been investigated. The characterization results of superconducting properties, elemental composition, crystallinity, and cross-section are shown in this contribution.

The Mainz Energy-Recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) will be a new recirculating accelerator, which can operate in an external beam mode and an energy recovering mode. In the ERL-mode the electrons cross an internal gas-target at MAGIX and give their kinetic energy into the Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) system back after experimental use. The MESA cryomodules are based on ELBE-type cryomodules, which contain two 9-cell TESLA/XFEL-type cavities. For any maintenance the clean room infrastructure at the Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) can be used. Currently, a cryomodule from the decommissioned ALICE ERL at Daresbury, UK is in the process of refurbishment. The refurbishment includes an HPR rinse of the cavities suffering from field emission at present and various adjustments of the module for a future use in MESA, which includes adding piezo tuners and new HOM antennas. For the new antennas, different superconducting coatings (Nb3Sn and NbTiN) will be tested to reach higher critical temperatures in the future for giving the possibility to couple out more HOM power without quenching as the prospected cw beamload lays above 4 mA in MESA ERL operation. Using a superconducting 3 GHz six-cell injector cavity for the S-DALINAC the successful refurbishment of a SRF cavity by applying a high pressure rinse in the clean room infrastructure at HIM was demonstrated the first time.
* The authors acknowledge the transfer of one cryomodule to Mainz by STFC Daresbury.

The Future Circular electron-positron Collider (FCC-ee) is planned to operate with beam energies from 45.6 to 182.5 GeV and beam currents from 5.4 to 1390 mA. The purpose is to study the properties of the Z-, W- and Higgs boson and the top and anti-top quarks in four operation points. The beam current of 147 mA of the W working point requires particular care to string damp HOMs. This paper proposes 2-cell 400 MHz SRF cavities with improved damping as an alternative to the baseline 4-cell cavities for this working point. The resulting impedance of the HOM-damped cavity is then calculated and compared with the impedance budget.

Pushing beyond the existing bulk niobium SRF cavities is indispensable along the path towards obtaining more sustainable next generation compact particle accelerators. One of the promising candidates to push the limits of the bulk niobium is thin film-based multilayer structures in the form of superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS). In this work, S(I)S multilayer structures were coated by high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), having industrial upscaling potential along with provid-ing higher quality films with respect to conventional magnetron sputtering techniques (e.g., DCMS), combined with (PE)-ALD techniques for deposition of the ex-situ insulating layers. On the path towards formulating opti-mized recipes for these materials to be coated on the inner walls of (S)RF cavities, the research focuses on innovat-ing the best performing S(I)S multilayer structures con-sisting of alternating superconducting thin films (e.g., NbN) with insulating layers of metal nitrides (e.g., AlN) and/or metal oxides (e.g., AlxOy) on niobium lay-ers/substrates (i.e., Nb/AlN/NbN) in comparison to the so-called SS multilayer structures (i.e., Nb/NbN). This con-tribution presents the initial materials and superconduct-ing and RF characterization results of the aforementioned multilayer systems on flat samples.

Thin polycrystalline Nb metal foils were treated in N2 gas atmospheres at elevated temperatures of 900 °C up to 1200 °C. A combination of transmission mode Quick X-ray absorption spectroscopy (QEXAFS) at the Nb-K-edge and X-ray diffraction (XRD) used in parallel were used to investigate changes in the atomic short and long-range structure of the bulk Nb-material in-situ. A dedicated high-vacuum heating cell with a base pressure of 10-6 mbar was used to perform the heat treatments under vacuum and nitrogen gas atmosphere. The treatments typically included (i) a preheating at 900 °C under high-vacuum, (ii) a treatment in 3 mbar nitrogen gas at the desired temperature and (iii) a cooldown to room temperature under vacuum conditions. The QEXAFS and XRD data were collected in parallel during the entire process with a time resolution of 4 s. While the samples treated at 900 °C show the typical N-uptake to the octahedral interstitial sites, the samples treated at higher temperatures show the growth of distinct niobium nitride phases. The results will be discussed in more details during the conference.

LASA-INFN is developing some PIP-II β=0.61 cavity prototypes so to set up a high-Q recipe allowing to reach the PIP-II performance target in view of the series production. A single-cell cavity was treated with a XFEL-like baseline recipe, whereas a multicell cavity underwent a mid-T bake step as final surface treatment. Both cavities have been then tested at the LASA vertical experimental facility. The test results are here reported and discussed. Basing on the satisfactory results so far obtained, a strategy for the qualification and upgrade of the LASA vertical test facility is outlined.

Nb3Sn Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities has been researched and developed at Center for Applied Superconducting Accelerator (CASA), KEK. One of effec-tive tools for research on the performance of SRF cavities is a temperature mapping (T-map) system for detecting small increases in temperature. It is a thermometer array positioned precisely on an outer surface of cavity wall. Thermometer should cover at least from the range of typi-cal operating temperature of 4 K to the transition tempera-ture of 18 K, for the Nb3Sn SRF cavities. Therefore, car-bon resistor can not be used as a cheap thermometer due to low sensitivity at this temperature range. In this pro-ceeding, we report the results of the test for various com-mercially available diodes as a thermometer for T-map system. The sensitivity, stability and the repeatability are measured, cooled by a GM cryocooler.

Funding: This work was supported through KOMAC operation fund of KAERI by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (KAERI-524320-22).
A superconducting linac is developed at KOrea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex (KOMAC) for proton beam energy upgrade from 100 MeV to 200 MeV. The SRF linac consists of thirty-six half-wave resonator (HWR) cavities. 350 MHz, β = 0.56 HWR is designed to provide 3.6 MV accelerating voltage. After a fundamental RF design study, an analysis on a multipacting (MP) of HWR is carried out. The MP simulation for the HWR is performed by using CST Particle Studio. To understand a feature of the MP occurrence in the HWR, a particle-in-cell simulation is conducted while changing various conditions such as an RF amplitude, an RF phase, and an emission surface.

The bunch lengthening by the 3rd harmonic cavity reduces the electron collisions in a bunch and increases the Touschek lifetime of a storage ring. We performed the multi-physics simulations including the electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical analysis of the cavity. In the electromagnetic simulation, the geometry is optimized for the required performance of the cavity. The elliptical double-cell geometry is selected to increase the accelerating voltage and reduce the power losses of the cavity. Thermal/mechanical analyses were performed to check the deformation of the thermal and pressure contraction. The prototype cavity does not require the power coupler as it is a passive type. The conceptual design and copper prototype of the 3rd harmonic cavity will be described in this paper. Based on this design, the fabrication of Niobium cavity is in progress.

We present an overview and description of the elliptical cryomodules test activities at Lund Test Stand 2. During 2021 the test facility was commissioned with one prototype, and four series medium beta modules have now been successfully tested at ESS in Lund. This activity allowed the joint ESS and IFJ PAN team to develop all the procedures and the necessary automated tools for the different phases of the site acceptance test campaign (e.g. incoming inspections, coupler conditioning, cooldown strategies, tuning to resonance and electromagnetic/cryogenic performance verification). During the initial test period techniques for diagnostics of limiting mechanisms have been developed and improved up to a consolidated and mature state for the rest of the test campaign. Tests results and the initial statistics is presented and commented.

We present here a description of field emission (FE) measurements set-up developed for elliptical cryomodules test activities at Lund Test Stand 2. A test campaign of field emission measurements has been developed and optimized during cryomodules tests. The scintillator detectors (and their respective shields), chosen for these measurements, have been characterized and optimized. The field emission application has been developed and integrated in the cryomodules tests operator interface. The Initial test results are presented and commented.

We implemented a method to tune the ESS superconducting cavities based on the spectral analysis of the high resolution data available from the Low Level RF system (LLRF) for the transmitted power, without the need of connecting a network analyzer or any other dedicated instrumentation along the RF chain. A frequency peak up to 4 MHz off from the resonating frequency can be detected and used to control the stepper motor of the tuner until the cavity is stretched to the proper length to reach the correct operation frequency. Experience of its use at the ESS Test Stand 2 (TS2) facility at Lund during cryomodule acceptance testing is presented.

The Open XAL accelerator physics software platform has been developed through international collaboration among several facilities since 2010. The goal of the collaboration is to establish Open XAL as a multi-purpose software platform supporting a broad range of tool and application development in accelerator physics and high-level control (Open XAL also ships with a suite of general-purpose accelerator applications). This paper discusses progress in beam dynamics simulation and updated application framework along with new generic accelerator physics applications. We present the status of the project at each participating facility and a roadmap for continued development.

The Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) was conditioned at the European Spallation Source during spring 2021. We used part of the conditioning time to estimate the accelerating potential within the RFQ analyzing the x-rays bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by the electrons released and accelerated in the RFQ. The results of these measurements are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction.

Nb3Sn, NbTiN and NbN are superconductors with critical temperatures of 18.3, 12.6-17 and 11.6-17.5 K, respectively, these are higher than that of Nb at 9.3 K. Hence, at 4 K, they have an RF resistance, an order of magnitude lower than that of Nb, which leads to quality factors above those of Nb. In recent years, there has been an extensive effort converting Nb cavities into Nb3Sn. Alloying the top inner layer of the cavity using Sn diffusion at a high temperature has had some degree of success, however, the reproducibility remains a major hindering and limiting factor. In this study, we report on the PVD deposition of NbTiN inside a 6 GHz cavity, using an external magnetic coil configuration. The deposition is done at an elevated temperature of about 650 C. We report on the superconducting properties, film structure and its stoichiometry and surface chemical state. The films have been characterised with SEM, XRD, XPS, EDS and SQUID magnetometer.

The research on superconducting thin films for future radio frequency (RF) cavities requires measuring the RF properties of these films. However, coating and testing thin films on full-sized cavities is both challenging and timeconsuming. As a result, films are typically deposited on small, flat samples and characterised using a test cavity. At Daresbury Laboratory, a facility for testing 10 cm diameter samples has recently been commissioned. The cavity uses RF chokes to allow physical and thermal separation between itself and the sample under test. The facility allows for surface resistance measurements at a resonant frequency of 7.8 GHz, at temperatures down to 4 K, maximum RF power of 1 W and peak magnetic fields of a few mT. The main advantage of this system is the simple sample mounting procedure due to no physical welding between the sample and test cavity. This allows for a fast turnaround time of two to three days between samples. As such, this system can be used to quickly identify which samples are performing well under RF and should require further testing at higher gradient. Details of recent upgrades to this facility, together with measurements of both bulk niobium and thin film samples, will be presented.

Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are resonators with extremely low surface resistance that enable accelerating cavities to have extremely high quality factors (Q0). High Q0 decreases the capital required to keep the accelerators cold by reducing power loss. The performance of SRF cavities is largely governed by the surface composition of the first §I{100}{nm} of the cavity surface. Impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen have been observed to yield high Q0, but their precise roles are still being studied. Here, we compare the performance of cavities doped with nitrogen and oxygen in terms of surface composition and heating behavior with field. A simulation of the diffusion of oxygen into the bulk of the cavity was built using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Simulated results were compared to the actual surface composition of the cavities as determined from secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis. Understanding how these impurities affects performance allows us to have further insight into the underlying mechanisms that enable these surface treatments to yield high Q0.

Nb3Sn is the most promising alternative material for achieving superior performance in Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) cavities, compared to conventional bulk Nb cavities now used in accelerators. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an alternative to the vapor diffusion-based Nb3Sn growth technique predominantly used on bulk niobium cavities and may enable reaching superior RF performance at reduced cost. In collaboration with Cornell, Ultramet has developed CVD process capabilities and reactor designs to coat copper SRF cavities with thick and thin films of Nb and Nb3Sn. In this paper, we present our latest research efforts on CVD Nb3Sn-on-copper SRF cavities, including RF performance test results from two 1.3 GHz SRF cavities coated by Ultramet.

Niobium-3 Tin (Nb3Sn) is a high-potential material for next-generation Superconducting Radiofrequency (SRF) cavities in particle accelerators. The most promising growth method to date is based on vapor diffusion of tin into a niobium substrate with nucleating agent Tin Chloride (SnCl2). Still, the current vapor diffusion recipe has significant room for realizing further performance improvement. We are investigating how different chemical treatments on the niobium substrate before coating influence the growth of a smooth and uniform Nb3Sn layer. More specifically, this study focuses on the interaction between the SnCl2 nucleating agent and the niobium surface oxides. We compare the effect of different chemical treatments with different pH values on the tin droplet distribution on niobium after the nucleation stage of coating. We also look at the effect that the nucleation temperature has on the smoothness and uniformity of the tin distribution, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the recipe to coat smooth Nb3Sn cavities.

A new frontier in Superconducting RF (SRF) development is increasing the accessibility of SRF technology to small-scale accelerator operations which are used in various industrial or research applications. This is made possible by using commercial cryocoolers as a cooling source, which removes the need for expensive liquid cryogenics and their supporting infrastructure. Cornell University is currently developing a new cryomodule based on a conduction cooling scheme. This cryomodule will use two pulse tube cryocoolers in place of liquid cryogenics in order to cool the system. A new 1.3 GHz cavity has been designed with a set of four niobium rings welded at the equator and irises which allow for a direct thermal link between the cavity and cryocooler cold heads. The cavity will use two coaxial RF input couplers capable of delivering up to 100 kW total RF power for high-current beam operation. This coupler design was modified from the Cornell ERL injector couplers, including simplifications such as removing the cold RF window and most outer bellows, while retaining inner bellows for adjustable coupling.

Our goal is to develop new materials and protocols for the growth and preparation of thin-film and layered superconductors for next generation SRF cavities with higher performance for future accelerators. We are working primarily with Nb3Sn to achieve this goal, as well as other materials which aim to optimize the RF field penetration layer of the cavity. This contribution gives a general update on our most recent cavity test results. A deeper insight into RF loss distribution and dynamics during cavity testing is gained using a new global high-speed temperature mapping system (T-Map).

The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory is a high luminosity collider as the next major research facility for the nuclear physics community. Among the numerous RF subsystems in the EIC, the electron storage ring (ESR) fundamental RF cavities system is one of the most challenging. This system will handle a high beam current of up to 2.5 A and replenish up to 10 MW of beam power losses from synchrotron radiation and HOM. Variable coupling is required in the cavities due to the wide range of required total RF voltage and beam current combinations. In this paper, we will present the status of the design and future plans.

Over the last several years, alloying of the surface layer of niobium SRF cavities has been demonstrated to beneficially lower the superconducting RF surface resistance. Nitrogen, titanium, and oxygen have all been demonstrated as effective alloying agents, occupying interstitial sites in the niobium lattice within the RF penetration depth and even deeper, when allowed to thermally diffuse into the surface at appropriate temperatures. The use of nitrogen for this function has been often termed ’nitrogen doping’ and is being applied in the LCLS-II and LCLS-II HE projects. We report characterization studies of the distribution of nitrogen into the exposed niobium surface and how such distribution is affected by the quality of the vacuum furnace environment in which the doping takes place, and the complexity of nitride crystal growth on different grain orientations of surface niobium. Using state-of-the-art quantification methods by dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling in niobium, we identify several phenomena involving furnace-sourced contamination. We also highlight a potential issue with N2 flow constraints from the flange ’caps’ used during heat treatments.

Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities are fundamental building blocks of modern particle accelerators. A surface resistance in the tens of nanoOhm range is achieved when cooling these cavities to liquid helium temperature, ~2 - 4 K. One of the leading sources of residual losses in SRF cavities is trapped magnetic flux. Flux trapping mechanism depends on different surface preparations and cool-down conditions. We have designed, developed and commissioned a combined magnetic and temperature mapping system using anisotropic magneto-resistance sensors and carbon resistors, respectively, to study the flux trap mechanism in 3 GHz single-cell niobium cavities. In this contribution, we will describe the experimental apparatus and present preliminary test results.

Niobium is the material of choice to build superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, which are fundamental building blocks of modern particle accelerators. These cavities require a cryogenic cool-down to ~2 - 4 K for optimum performance minimizing RF losses on the inner cavity surface. However, temperature-independent residual losses in SRF cavities cannot be prevented entirely. One of the significant contributor to residual losses is trapped magnetic flux. The flux trapping mechanism depends on different factors, such as surface preparations and cool-down conditions. We have developed a diagnostic magnetic field scanning system (MFSS) using Hall probes and anisotropic magneto-resistance sensors to study the spatial distribution of trapped flux in 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities. The first result from this newly commissioned system revealed that the trapped flux on the cavity surface might redistribute with increasing RF power. The MFSS was also able to capture significant magnetic field enhancement at specific cavity locations after a quench.

The radio-frequency (RF) system of the future circular lepton collider (FCC-ee) must cope with different machine parameters ranging from Ampere-class operation required for the Z-peak working point to the high-gradient operation for the ttbar threshold. The Superconducting Slotted Waveguide Elliptical cavity (SWELL) concept was recently proposed as an alternative to the challenging RF baseline design of the FCC-ee. In this paper, random optimization methods are used to minimize the peak surface magnetic field and the maximum longitudinal impedance of the higher order modes (HOM) of a two-cell \unit[600]{MHz} SWELL cavity. In the next step, the waveguide slots are optimized to first have a smooth transition from the cavity to the slots to avoid large peak surface fields and second to achieve high transmission at dipole mode frequencies and low transmission at fundamental mode frequency while keeping the design compact.

The 1.6 GeV booster synchrotron of the ELSA facility at the University of Bonn uses a DESY-type RF resonator which has been driven by a conventional klystron amplifier since its early days in 1967. The setup was modified to serve the ELSA stretcher ring as booster synchrotron in 1987, but the RF infrastructure was barely altered. As repairs of the reliable, but antiquated RF source became foreseeingly impossible due to the lack of spare part availability, the replacement of the klystron amplifier chain in favour of a state-of-the-art solid state amplifier was carried out. We describe the replacement and the operation experience with the new RF power amplifier.

The KOMAC proton accelerator consists of a 100 MeV linear accelerator and beam lines for beam services. Devices of various form factors are used as control systems in accelerator control systems and beam diagnosis systems. With the recent upgrade of the control system, a Zynq-based control system has been developed that enables the latest technology and low cost. The Zynq-based DAQ system was developed by adopting Digilent’s Zybo z7 series board and AD7605 analog-to-digital data acquisition system. The Zybo z7 is an embedded software and digital circuit development board built around the Xilinx Zynq-7000 family. The Zynq is based on Xilinx All Programmable System-on-Chip (AP SoC) architecture, which tightly integrates a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor with Xilinx7-series Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic. The AD7605 is a 4-channel and 16bit ADC with 300 kSPS on all channels. The Zynq SoC-based DAQ system will be used for beam feedback control and RF signal monitoring at KOMAC. This paper introduces the development of configurations for the development of Zynq-based control systems, programmable Logic (PL) builds, and Linux and EPICS porting.

A power upgrade of the existing 8 kW solid-state driver amplifier is required for the acceleration of high intensity proton beams in the J-PARC 3 GeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). The development of a 25 kW amplifier with gallium nitride (GaN) HEMTs and based on 6.4 kW modules is ongoing. The combiner is a key component to achieve such a high output power over the wide bandwidth required for multi-harmonic rf operation. This paper presents a preliminary design of the combiner. The circuit simulation setup and results, including the realistic magnetic core characteristics and frequency response of the cables are reported.

In order to accelerate a high intensity beam in the RCS, a large amplitude of the anode current is provided by a tube amplifier to compensate a heavy beam loading. Tetrode vacuum tubes are used in the RCS, and the control grid voltage enters into a positive region to feed such a large current. The positive grid biasing affects the waveform of the control grid voltage; it is deformed due to the induced control grid current under the condition of the multi-harmonic rf driving. Furthermore, the DC bias voltage drop on the control grid is observed because of the exceeding the ability for the control grid power supply. We describe the influence of the positive grid biasing in the RCS.

The injector linear accelerator (LINAC) for the CEPC requires a higher efficiency klystron with 80MW output power than S band 65MW pulsed klys-tron currently operating in LINAC of BEPCII to reduce energy consumption and cost. The efficiency is ex-pected to improve from the currently observed 42% to more than 55% and output power will be improved from 65MW to more than 80MW with same operation voltage. In this paper, BAC bunching method is ap-plied for klystron efficiency improvement. The optimi-zation of the gun and solenoid parameters is complet-ed with 2-D code DGUN and then 3-D code CST. The preliminary design of the cavity parameters is also completed in 1-D disk model based AJDISK code and then further checked by 2-D code EMSYS. Finally, new klystron prototype will be fabricated in Chinese com-pany after design parameters are determined.

Solid state amplifiers are being increasingly used as RF power sources in accelerators around the world. Two solid state amplifiers with different output power and frequen-cy have been applied in beam test system of PAPS at IHEP. A 10kW solid state amplifier operating at 1.3 GHz is used to feed a normal conducting buncher. A 650 MHz solid state amplifier with the output power of 150 kW is used to feed two 2-cell superconducting cavities. So far, the debugging and acceptance test of solid state amplifi-ers have been finished. During the beam test system commissioning and operation, all solid state amplifiers operate stably. In this paper, the specifications and high power test results of solid state amplifiers are presented.

Within the LHC Injectors Upgrade project, the PS Booster(PSB) has been upgraded. Both the injection (160 MeV) and extraction (2 GeV) energies have been increased, bringing also changes in the injection beam revolution frequency, the maximum revolution frequency, and the beam intensity. To meet the requirements of the High Luminosity LHC a new RF system has been designed, based on the wideband frequency characteristics of Finemet® Magnetic Alloy and solid-state amplifiers. The wideband frequency response (1 MHz to 18 MHz) covers all the required frequency schemes in the PSB, allowing multi-harmonics operation. The system is based on a cellular configuration in which each cell provides a fraction of the total RF voltage. The new RF system has been installed in 3 locations replacing the old systems. The installation has been performed during 2019/2020, while the commissioning started later in 2020 and relevant results for the physics have been already observed. This paper describes the new RF chain, the results achieved and the issues that occurred during this year of operation, together with the changes made to the system to improve performance and reliability.

A magnetron suitable for 1497 MHz klystron replacements at Jefferson Lab will be constructed and tested with our novel patented subcritical voltage operation methods to drive an SRF cavity. The critical areas of magnetron manufacturing and design affecting life-cycle costs that will be modeled for improvement include: Qext, filaments, magnetic field, vane design, and novel control of outgassing. The most immediate benefit of this project is to make SRF accelerator projects more affordable for NP and other users of SRF Linacs. One of the most attractive commercial applications for SRF accelerators is to drive subcritical nuclear reactors to burn Light Water Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel (LWR SNF). A 1 GeV proton beam hitting an internal uranium spallation neutron target can produce over 30 neutrons for each incident proton to allow the reactor to operate far below criticality to generate electricity or process heat while reducing high-level waste disposal costs. This commercial application has the additional attribute of addressing climate change.

We have designed, built, and tested a new magnetron tube that generates RF power at 1497 MHz. In the tests so far, the tube has produced CW 9 kW RF power, where the measured power is limited by the test equipment. The final goal is to use it to power superconducting (SC) cavities.

N and O-alloyed superconducting radio frequency cavities exhibit extraordinary quality factors. Developing diffusion models that describe interstitial N and O in Nb is important for optimizing alloyed cavity quality factors and accelerating gradients. N and O-alloyed Nb samples are examined with SEM AND SIMS and their diffusion profiles modeled.

The concept of crystal collimation relies on the use of bent crystals which can coherently deflect high-energy halo particles at angles orders of magnitude larger than what is obtained from scattering with conventional materials. Crystal collimation is studied to further improve the collimation efficiency at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In order to reproduce the main experimental results of crystal collimation tests and to predict the performance of such a system, a simulation routine capable of modeling interactions of beam particles with crystal collimators was developed and recently integrated into the latest release of the single-particle tracking code SixTrack. A new treatment of the miscut angle, i.e. the angle between crystalline planes and crystal edges, was implemented to study the effects of this manufacturing imperfection on the efficiency of a crystal collimation system. In this paper, the updated miscut angle model is described and simulation results on the cleaning efficiency are presented, using configurations tested during Run 2 of the LHC as a case study.

Crystal collimation relies on the use of bent crystals to coherently deflect halo particles onto dedicated collimator absorbers. This scheme is planned to be used at the LHC to improve the betatron cleaning efficiency with high-intensity ion beams. Only particles with impinging angles below 2.5 urad relative to the crystalline planes can be efficiently channeled at the LHC nominal top energy of 7 Z TeV. For this reason, crystals must be kept in optimal alignment with respect to the circulating beam envelope to maximize the efficiency of the channeling process. Given the small angular acceptance, achieving optimal channeling conditions is particularly challenging. Furthermore, the different phases of the LHC operational cycle involve important dynamic changes of the local orbit and optics, requiring an optimized control of position and angle of the crystals relative to the beam. To this end, the possibility to apply machine learning to the alignment of the crystals, in a dedicated setup and in standard operation, is considered. In this paper, possible solutions for automatic adaptation to the changing beam parameters are highlighted and plans for the LHC ion runs starting in 2022 are discussed.

The current betatron collimation system in the LHC is not optimized to absorb off-momentum particles scattered out from the primary collimators. The highest losses are concentrated in the downstream dispersion suppressor (DS). Given the increased beam intensity in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), there is concern that these losses could risk quenching the superconducting DS magnets. Consequently, a dedicated upgrade of the DS has been studied. However, at this stage, the deployment for the startup of the HL-LHC is uncertain due to delays in the availability of high-field magnets needed to integrate new collimators into the DS. In this paper, we describe the expected collimation setup for the first run of the HL-LHC and explore various techniques to improve the collimation cleaning. These include exploiting the asymmetric response of the two jaws of each primary collimator and adjusting the locally generated dispersion in the collimation insertion.

CERN Linac4 Chopper Dump: Operational Experience and Future Upgrades

The Chopper Dump in the Linac4 accelerator at CERN is a beam-intercepting device responsible for the absorption of the 3 MeV H− ion beam produced by the Linac4 source and deflected upstream by an electromagnetic chopper. It allows a portion of the beam, which would otherwise fall into the unstable region of the radiofrequency buckets in the Proton Synchrotron Booster, to be dumped at low energy with minimal induced radiation. It may also be used to absorb the entire beam. With peak currents of 25 to 45 mA and shallow penetration, this results in large deposited energy densities, thermal gradients and mechanical stresses. Additional constraints arise from geometric integration, vacuum and radiation protection requirements. Material selection, beam-matter interaction studies and thermo-structural analyses are important aspects of the design process. The Chopper Dump underwent modification in 2019 following observed material degradation in the original version of the device. The experience gained, modifications made and observations noted since then are detailed herein. Against this background, the design and analysis of an upgraded device, intended to cope with future operational conditions, is outlined and discussed.

To compensate for the detrimental effect of the crossing angle on luminosity production in the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider’s (HL-LHC) interaction regions, superconducting crab cavities (vertical and horizontal) will be installed at the two interaction regions of the ATLAS and CMS experiments.  Both cavity designs use multiple Higher Order Mode (HOM) couplers to reduce beam instabilities and heat loads caused by the very high proton current in the HL-LHC.  The conceptual RF designs of the HOM couplers are firstly presented, evaluating HOM damping requirements, fundamental mode rejection and dynamic heat load constraints.  A special focus is given to the coupler’s characteristic impedance (Z0), to improve the robustness during transport and operation.  Following this, RF measurements of the HOM couplers before installation, installed on the superconducting cavities and with a circulating proton beam are detailed, analysing deviations from the simulated cases.

Higher harmonic cavities, also known as Landau cavities, have been proposed to improve beam lifetime and provide Landau damping by lengthening the bunch without energy spread for stable operations of present and future low-emittance storage rings. This contribution presents design of a passive superconducting 3rd-harmonic cavity (super-3HC) for the planned Hefei Advanced Light Facility (HALF) at University of Science and Technology of China. It is designed to provide 0.43 MV at 1499.4 MHz for the nominal 2.2 GeV, 350 mA electron beam, and 1.44 MV main RF voltage in storage ring. Through optimizations it has a low R/Q < 45 Ohm, which has potential to achieve a good bunch lengthening. Higher-order-modes are strongly damped using a pair of room-temperature silicon carbide (SiC) rings to meet the requirement of beam instabilities. In addition, preliminary engineering design for the super-3HC cryomodule is also described in this contribution.
