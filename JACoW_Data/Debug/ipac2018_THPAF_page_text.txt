Highly resolved numerical simulations have been performed using the code SPACE for the modulator, the first section of the Coherent electron cooling (CeC) device installed in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Simulation results have been benchmarked with analytical solution using uniform electron beam with realistic thermal velocities. Electron bunches with Gaussian distribution and quadrupole field with realistic settings have been applied in the simulations to predict the modulation process and final bunching factors induced by ions with reference and off-reference energies in the CeC experiment at BNL RHIC.

Start-to-end numerical simulations have been performed using the code SPACE and GENESIS for the single pass of gold ions through the coherent electron cooling (CeC) device installed in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Cooling rate of CeC experiment has been predicted using off-reference energy ions in a finite Gaussian electron beam through a realistic beam-line, in which settings of quadrupoles and free-electron laser (FEL) device are relevant to BNL RHIC.

The Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment aims to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment with a 140 parts-per-billion precision to investigate the greater than 3 standard deviation difference between the Standard Model prediction and the previous measurement by the BNL Muon g-2 experiment. The coherent betatron oscillation (CBO) beam effects must be corrected for in the decay-positron time spectra fits used in high precision muon storage ring based anomalous magnetic moment measurements. This MC simulation study indicates that the application of radio frequency (RF) electric fields to the muon storage ring beam can reduce the CBO amplitude by up to a factor of 10, as well to increase the symmetry of the beam phase space. This is achieved by correcting the mismatched oscillation phases between the high and low momentum muon populations by modulating the muon beam betatron oscillation frequencies with off-resonance RF fields.

An S-band LINAC with the operating frequency of 2856 MHz and beam current of 4 A was designed for flash X-ray radiography for hydrodynamic test. The optimization of the parameters of the LINAC was processed to obtain the minimum beam radius and the maximum energy efficiency. For the purpose of reducing the beam orbits offset at the exit of LINAC, a slotted iris accelerating structure would be employed to suppress the transverse Higher Order Modes (HOMs) by cutting four radial slots in the iris to couple the HOMs to SiC loads. In this paper, we present the design of the LINAC and the results of beam dynamic analysis.

The study of the transverse single-bunch instability has been carried out for the HEPS booster to double check whether the required single-bunch charge can be achieved. The chromaticity has been varied in our study to see how the threshold changes accordingly. Usually, the slightly positive chromaticity is expected for stabilizing the beam. However, our simulations show that the single-bunch threshold current drops significantly when the chromaticity becomes non-zero. We present the simulation methods and results in details in this paper. The analysis of the simulation results is also presented.

High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), which is proposed in China, is an ultra-low emittance storage ring based synchrotron light source. Because of the requirement of the relatively high single-bunch charge, the booster may suffer from the single-bunch instabilities. A preliminary impedance model has been developed for the studies of collective instabilities in the booster. Based on this impedance model, the longitudinal and transverse single-bunch instabilities have been studied.

The Extra Low ENergy Antiproton storage ring (ELENA), which is currently being commissioned at CERN, will further decelerate antiprotons extracted from the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) from 5.3 MeV to energies as low as 100 keV. It will provide high quality beams for the antimatter experiments located within the AD hall. At such low energies, it is important to correctly evaluate the long term beam stability. To provide a consistent explanation of the different physical phenomena affecting the beam, tracking simulations have been performed and the results will be presented in this contribution. These include electron cooling and various scattering effects under realistic conditions. The effects of several imperfections in the electron cooling process will also be discussed. In addition, analytical approximations of the temporal variation of emittance under these conditions will be presented, and compared with numerical simulation results.

Due to the relatively infrequent use of electrostatic beamline elements compared with their magnetic counterparts, there are few particle tracking codes which allow for the straightforward implementation of such beamlines. In this contribution, we present 3D tracking methods for beamlines containing electrostatic elements utilising a modified version of the Geant4 based tracking code 'G4beamline'. In 2020 transfer lines will begin transporting extremely low energy (100 keV) antiproton beams from the Extra Low Energy Antiproton (ELENA) ring to the antimatter experiments at CERN. Electrostatic bending and focusing elements have been chosen for the beamlines due to their mass independence and focusing efficiency in the low energy regime. These beamlines form the basis of our model which is benchmarked against simplified tracking simulations. Realistic beam distributions obtained via tracking around ELENA in the presence of collective effects and electron cooling will be propagated along the optimised 3D transfer model to achieve the best beam quality possible for the experiments.

RF field phase and amplitude errors are usually not correctly simulated and it is a serious problem especially when in high intensity linear accelerators, the main losses are due to particle leaving the beam acceptance. This new development implemented in TraceWin fixes this issue. The objective is to improve the longitudinal beam dynamics simulation methods, by including more close-to-real models for the cavities tuning procedure. By this way, clear distinction should be done between static and dynamic errors and longitudinal diagnostics accuracy can be clearly defined according to beam dynamics results.

The Cornell-Brookhaven Energy-recovery Linac Test Accelerator is a four-pass, 150-MeV electron accelerator with a six-cell 1.3 GHz superconducting-RF linear accelerator and a fixed-field alternating-gradient (FFAG) return loop made up of Halbach-style quadrupole magnets. The optics matching between the linear accelerator and the return loop is achieved with a conventional magnet system comprised of 50 dipole magnets and 64 quadrupole magnets in four beamlines at each end of the linac. The 42-, 78-, 114- and 150-MeV electron beams are separated into independent vacuum chambers in order to allow for the path-length adjustment required by energy recovery. We report on the first beam tests of the initial installation of the splitter/combiner section at the exit of the linac. The vacuum system of the 42-MeV S1 line was installed during the first week of April. Nine dipole and four quadrupole magnets were installed and surveyed into position the following week, and the water cooling system was commissioned. A 6-MeV beam passed through the line on April~11 with no need for adjusting pre-set magnet excitation currents. One week later, time-of-flight measurements were used to calibrate and phase the individual superconducting RF cavities. The S1 magnet settings were then scaled up to achieve 5-cavity, 42-MeV operation through the first nine FFAG permanent-magnet quadrupoles. This initial Fractional Arc Test will conclude on May 18, when the installation of the remaining seven splitter/combiner lines and the return loop will begin. CBETA operations are scheduled to begin in early 2019.

A beam-based technique is applied to determine the quadrupole impedance of large-impedance components of the CESR storage ring. Two bunches separated by ~1/3 of the ring circumference are charged to 0.85 and 0.3 mA. Each bunch is given a single kick, either horizontal or vertical. Turn-by-turn, bunch-by-bunch position information is recorded for ~16 k turns. BPM-by-BPM phase is calculated using the All-phase FFT method of spectral analysis. The difference in the BPM-to-BPM phase advance between the two bunches is a measurement of the local transverse impedance. The impedances of the small-aperture in-vacuum undulators, collimators, scrapers, RF cavities, electrostatic separators, and bulk impedance of the remaining ring are determined in this manner.

CBETA is an energy recovery linac accelerating from 6 MeV to 150 MeV in four linac passes, using a single return line accepting all energies from 42 MeV to 150 MeV. We simulate a 6-dimensional particle distribution from the injector through the end of the dump line. Space charge forces are taken into account at the low energy stages. We compare results using field maps to those using simpler magnet models. We introduce random and systematic magnet errors to the lattice, apply an orbit correction algorithm, and study the impact on the beam distribution.

Cornell University and Brookhaven National Laboratory are currently designing the Cornell-BNL ERL-FFAG Test Accelerator (CBETA). To be built at Cornell Wilson Lab, CBETA utilizes the existing ERL injector and main linac cryomodule (MLC). As the electron bunches pass through the MLC cavities, higher order modes (HOMs) fields are excited. The recirculating bunches interact with the HOMs, which can give rise to beam-breakup instability (BBU). We would present simulation results on how BBU limits the maximum achievable current, and potential ways to improve the threshold current.

The Cornell-Brookhaven Energy Recovery Linac Test Accelerator now under construction will accelerate electrons from 6 MeV to 150 MeV in four linac passes, using a single return line accepting all energies from 42 to 150 MeV. We describe the optical design of the machine, with emphasis on recent updates. We explain how we choose parameters for the wide energy acceptance return arc, taking into account 3D field maps generated from magnet designs. We give the final machine parameters resulting from iterations between desired lattice properties and magnet design. We modified the optics to improve the periodicity of the return arc near its ends and to create adequate space for vacuum hardware. The return arc is connected to the linac with splitter lines that serve to match the optics for each beam energy. We describe how matching conditions were chosen for the splitter lines and how we use them to control longitudinal motion. We simulate the injection and low energy extraction systems including space charge effects, matching the beam properties to the optical parameters of the rest of the machine.

The application of Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm optimization (MOGA) to photoemission based ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) beamlines featuring extremely low cathode mean transverse energies has lead to designs with emittances as low as 1 nm for sub-picosecond bunches with 105 electrons*. Analysis of these results shows significant emittance growth during transport: with emittance dilution as high as a factor of 200-4000% for various designs and optics settings. In this study we quantify and model the individual sources of emittance growth (slice mismatches and space charge), and explore the use of the core emittance as a strong invariant.

The synchrotron-radiation-induced buildup of low-energy electron densities in positron and proton storage rings limits performance by causing betatron tune shifts and incoherent emittance growth. The Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) Test Accelerator project includes extensive measurement and modeling programs to quantify such effects and apply the knowledge gained to the design of future accelerator projects. We report on improved measurements of betatron tune shifts along a train of positron bunches, now accurate in both horizontal and vertical planes. Improved electron cloud buildup modeling uses detailed information on photoelectron production properties obtained from recently developed simulations and successfully describes the measurements after determining ring-wide secondary-yield properties of the vacuum chamber by fitting the model to data with a multi-objective optimizer. Cloud splitting in dipole magnetic fields is seen to be the source of horizontal tune shifts decreasing at higher bunch populations.

We report on calculations of electron production by synchrotron radiation absorbed in the vacuum chamber walls of the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). These electrons are the source of electron clouds which limit the performance of storage rings by causing betatron tune shifts, instabilities and emittance growth. Until now, cloud buildup modeling codes have used ad hoc models of the production of the seed electrons. We have employed the photon scattering code Synrad3D to quantify the pattern of absorbed photons around the CESR ring, including the transverse distribution on the wall of the beam-pipe. These distributions in absorbed photon energy and incident angle are used as input to Geant4-based simulations of electron emission from the walls. The average quantum efficiency is found to vary dramatically with the location of the absorption site, owing to the distribution in impact energies and angles. The electron production energy spectrum plays an important role in the modeling of electron cloud buildup, where the interplay of production energy and acceleration by the beam bunches determines the time structure and multipacting characteristics of the cloud.

This paper reports the application of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) to optimize the linear and nonlinear beam dynamics of the different PETRA IV scenarios to transform PETRA III storage ring in a diffracted limited one. As it is well known, the dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance of these kinds of lattices are dramatically reduced due to the increase of the sextupoles strengths to compensate its strong focusing. The reduction of the dynamic aperture jeopardizes the current off-axis injection system and lower beam lifetimes increase the beam instabilities and the radiation safety concerns of the storage ring. MOGA searches the best settings of quadrupoles and sextupoles in a multi-dimensional parameter space taking into account the dynamic properties and the natural emittance as objectives at the level of ten picometers. The lattices studied are the so-called 'Twist lattice' based in a phase space exchange lattice, a solution based in the ESRF-Hybrid Multi-bend Achromat (HMA) design and finally the 'double 'I' lattice combining a non-interleaved sextupoles cell with an ESRF-HMA cell.

The performance of the 3th generation light sources relies on the beam lifetime and the injection efficiency, both related with the beam dynamic properties of the storage ring as momentum acceptance and dynamic aperture, respectively. High values of beam lifetime and injection efficiency are desirable to reduce the storage ring instabilities during injection, the radiation losses and the energy consumption of the facility. This paper reports the first application of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) to optimize the linear and non-linear beam dynamics of PETRA III storage ring. Genetic algorithms are a heuristic search that mimics the process of natural evolution to optimize problems with a high level of complexity, as in the case of PETRA III storage ring composed by hundreds of magnets. This computational method uses hundreds of CPUs. MOGA is used to maximize the dynamic aperture and the momentum acceptance finding new combinations of quadrupole and sextupole settings in a multi-dimensional parameter space maintaining the solutions in the level of ten picometers.

For the PETRA IV project at DESY it is planned to convert the 6 GeV synchrotron light source PETRA III into a diffraction limited storage ring with ultra-low emittances. PETRA IV should provide a natural emittance two orders of magnitude smaller as now. The energy and the current of 100 mA should be unchanged. Currently different lattice options are investigated to achieve an emittance in the range of 10-30 pm*rad. As one candidate for a lattice of PETRA IV a ring based on the concept of hybrid multi-bend achromats (HMBA) has been studied in detail. Due to the unique layout of PETRA III with long straight sections it is possible to use damping wigglers to reduce the emittance further. While this helps to mitigate intrabeam scattering it has the disadvantage of an increased energy spread. The linear and nonlinear parameters of this HMBA-based lattice and the influence of damping wigglers on beam parameters are discussed.

The Horizon 2020 Project EuPRAXIA (EuropeanPlasma Research Accelerator with eXcellence In Applications) aims at producing a design report of a highly compact and cost-effective European facility with multi-GeV electron beams using a plasma accelerator. LWFA with external injection from an RF accelerator is one of the most promising configurations. In order to achieve the goal parameters for the 5 GeV, 30 pC electron beam at the entrance of the undulator, a high-quality electron beam with bunch length of less than 10 fs (FWHM) and matched beta functions (~1 mm) at the plasma entrance is required. In addition, from the compactness point of view, the injection energy is desired to be as low as possible. A hybrid compression scheme is considered in this paper and a detailed start-to-end simulation is presented.

Laser wake field acceleration (LWFA) mechanism allows to produce extremely short electron bunches of a few fs length with the energy up to a few GeV in extremely compact geometries providing unique electron beam parameters, in particular, transverse beam emittance (order of 1pi mm mrad), extremely short bunch length and high beam charge (up to 100pC) . This novel acceleration method therefore opens a new way to develop compact 'laser-based' FELs. In the frame of this report we analyze effects, which lead to degradation of an electron beam quality. The chromatic and collective effects are analyzed for a compact dedicated electron beam line to transport the electron beam to an undulator. In addition, the SASE FEL performance has been discussed taking into consideration the degradation of the electron beam quality.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU), beams with double intensity with respect to the present values will have to be successfully accelerated by the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and extracted towards the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, first experience running with intensity higher than the nominal LHC beam has shown that coherent instabilities in the horizontal plane may develop, becoming a potential intensity limitation for the future high intensity operation. To understand the mechanism of these instabilities, the PyHEADTAIL code has been used to check if the SPS impedance model reproduces the observations. The instability growth rates have been studied for different machine models and different chromaticity settings. In addition, the effect of other stabilizing methods, like the octupoles and the transverse damper, has also been investigated. Measurements are presented to benchmark the simulations.

Several options of low resistivity coating have been proposed for the collimator upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. In order to study their effect on the beam dynamics a special collimator has been built and installed in the machine. Its jaws are coated with three different materials and can be moved transversely to selectively expose the beam to the chosen coating. We have measured the resistive wall tune shifts of each coating material and compared them with that of a standard Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) collimator jaw. A resolution of the tune shift of the order of 10-5 has been achieved in the measurement. The results show a significant reduction of the resistive wall tune shift with novel materials. The largest improvement is obtained with a 5 μm Molybdenum coating of a Molybdenum-Graphite jaw. The observed tune shifts show a good agreement with the impedance model and the bench impedance and resistivity measurements. Obtained results can be used to further improve the precision of the impedance model.

The resistive wall impedance of an elliptical vacuum chamber in the classical regime with infinite thickness is known analytically for ultra-relativistic beams by means of the Yokoya form factors. Starting from the longitudinal electric field of a point charge moving at arbitrary speed in an elliptical vacuum chamber, which we express in terms of Mathieu functions, in this paper we take into account the finite conductivity of the beam pipe walls and evaluate the longitudinal and quadrupolar impedance for any beam velocity. We also obtain that the quadrupolar impedance of a circular pipe is different from zero, approaching zero only for ultra-relativistic particles. Even if some of the results, in particular in the ultra-relativistic limit, are already known and expressed in terms of form factors, this approach is the first step towards the calculation of the general problem of a multi-layer vacuum chamber with different conductivities and of elliptic cross section.

The Future Circular e+e− Collider (FCC-ee) requires two 180-degree turnaround loops to transport the positron beam from the damping ring to the lower energy section of the linac. In addition bunch compression is required to reduce the RMS bunch length from 5 mm to 0.5 mm, prior to injection into the linac. A dogleg bunch compressor comprised of two triple bend achromat (TBAs) can achieve this compression. Sextupole magnets are incorporated into the bunch compressor design for chromaticity correction as well as optimisation of the second-order longitudinal dispersion, T566, and to linearize the longitudinal phase space distribution. In this paper we present the design of the transport line and the bunch compressor. Measures to limit emittance growth due to coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) are also discussed, because despite the relatively long bunch length, the large degree of bending required introduces cause for consideration of CSR.

The HL-LHC design foresees a substantial modification of the LHC layout next to the low beta Interaction Points (IPs), namely IP1 and IP5. The inner triplets will be replaced by larger aperture ones to achieve lower beta at the IPs and crab cavities (CCs) will be installed. This will add new constraints to the orbit control, which required a careful choice of location and strength of the new orbit correctors to be installed in the area. The new orbit correction system will need to correct for the unavoidable imperfections, but also provide the necessary flexibility for implementing and optimising the crossing scheme. Detailed studies of the HL-LHC layout versions HLLHCV1.0 and HLLHCV1.1 were already performed. This paper is the continuation of these works and is based on the latest layout HLLHCV1.3. A simplification of the previous analysis is proposed that helps to identify the dominant imperfections. The expected performance and tolerances of the present layout are presented.

The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will require unprecedented orbit stability at the low beta collision points (IP1 and IP5), and the effect of seismic noise might become a relevant source of luminosity loss. Many studies have been conducted in the past to characterise the actual ground motion in the LHC tunnel, and recently a few geo-phones have been installed to permanently monitor the ground stability at IP1 and IP5. An estimate of the impact of the main machine element vibration on orbit at the IPs and collimators is presented, together with a first look at the data collected by the installed geo-phones.

The CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) determines the basic bunch spacing for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by means of rf manipulations. Several rf systems in a frequency range from 2.8 MHz to 200 MHz are available for beam acceleration and manipulations. Each of the six bunches injected from the PS Booster is split in several steps into 12 bunches spaced by 25 ns, yielding a batch of 72 bunches at transfer to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). In the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project the bunch intensity must be doubled. However, with most of the planned upgrades already in place this intensity has not yet been achieved due to collective effects. One of them is uncontrolled longitudinal emittance blow-up during the bunch splittings. In this contribution, measurements of the blow-up during the splitting process are presented and compared with particle simulations using the present PS impedance model. Beam-based measurements of the impedances of the rf cavities have been performed. They revealed that to reproduce the instability an additional impedance source is required in the PS impedance model.

Improvement of the Longitudinal Beam Transfer from PS to SPS at CERN
3060

The beam transfer from the Proton Synchrotron (PS) to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN is a critical process for the production of beams for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A bunch-to-bucket transfer is performed with the main drawback that the rf frequency in the SPS (200 MHz) is five times higher than the one in the PS (40 MHz). The PS bunches are therefore shortened non-adiabatically before extraction by applying a fast rf voltage increase (bunch rotation) to fit them into the short rf buckets in the SPS. However, particles with large amplitude of synchrotron oscillations in the PS longitudinal phase space are not properly captured in the SPS. They contribute to losses at the injection plateau and at the start of acceleration in the SPS. In this contribution, we present measurements and simulations performed to identify the source of the uncaptured particles. The tails of the particle distribution were characterized by applying longitudinal shaving during acceleration. Furthermore, the rotated bunch distribution was improved by linearizing the rf voltage using a higher-harmonic rf cavity.

Nowadays, turn-by-turn beam position monitor data is increasingly utilized in many accelerators, as it allows for fast and simultaneous measurement of various optics parameters. The accurate harmonic analysis of turn-by-turn data costs beam time when needed online. Generally, the electronic noise is avoided by cleaning of the data based on singular value decomposition. In this paper, we exploit the cleaning procedure to compress the data for the harmonic analysis. This way the harmonic analysis is sped up by an order of magnitude. The impact on measurement accuracy is discussed.

Optics measurements in storage rings usually employ excitation in both transverse directions. This needs to be repeated at several different beam energies and is time-consuming. In this paper, we develop a new optics measurement technique, which excites the beam in all three spatial dimensions simultaneously. It allows measuring the linear optics and chromatic properties at the same time, leading to speed up of the optics measurements. The measurement method has been successfully demonstrated in the LHC using AC-dipoles and RF frequency modulation. Analysis methods have been derived for the 3-dimensional beam excitation case. We quantify the resolution of the measured optical quantities. The first results suggest that the added complexity does not deteriorate the resolution of the linear optics measurement. In the future, this method can serve as an operational tool to check the optics or even to correct it.

Previous studies of the 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) design have shown a sensitivity to external dynamic magnetic fields (stray fields) on the nanoTesla level. In this paper the obtained tolerances for stray fields in the 380 GeV CLIC design are presented. In order to determine potential stray field sources, a measurement sensor has been acquired and used to investigate the magnetic contamination from technical equipment. The collected measurements, as well as details of the sensor, are discussed.

Destabilising Effect of the LHC Transverse Damper

Three questions motivated this study for the CERN Large Hadron Collider in terms of beam stability: (i) why a chromaticity close to zero seemed more critical than predicted during Run 1 (in 2011 and 2012) and during Run 2 (in 2015)?; (ii) why some past simulations with a chromaticity close to zero revealed a more critical situation with the transverse damper than without?; (iii) what should be the minimum operational chromaticity in the future in the LHC and High-Luminosity LHC? A new Vlasov solver (called GALACTIC) was developed to shed light on the destabilising mechanism of the transverse damper, which is a potential contributor to explain the LHC observation. Due to the features, which are discussed in this paper, the name 'ISR (for Imaginary tune Split and Repulsion) instability' is suggested for this new kind of single-bunch instability with zero chromaticity.

Beam Impedance Evaluation for CERN PS Gate Valves by Simulation and Benchmark Measurement

The CERN High Luminosity LHC project calls for a doubling of beam intensity which requires a clear identification of possible longitudinal instability sources in the injector chain. This requirement yields the need to further improve the longitudinal impedance model for the Proton Synchrotron (PS). In this impedance model it is necessary to include not only obvious impedance sources, such as RF cavities and kickers but also seemingly innocuous elements like certain vacuum components. Individually these vacuum elements would give only a small impedance contribution, however, due to the large number of these elements in the machine, their resultant combined impedances impact the overall impedance budget. This paper presents the electromagnetic simulation analysis of the PS sector gate valves along with EM measurements confirming the simulation model. These measurements are especially crucial in this case since no complete mechanical model or drawings are available and assumptions had to be made regarding its interior mechanical structure.

The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project at CERN calls for increasing beam intensity in the injector chain. In the Proton Synchrotron (PS), a pre-injector of the LHC, these intensities can result in beam instabilities and potential RF heating of machine components, such that impedance mitigation measures are required. To study these intensity effects, the PS impedance model has been developed and is continuously updated. Each new machine element that is to be added into the accelerator requires an impedance study to minimize its contribution with respect to the machine's overall impedance budget. In such a context, this paper presents the impedance analysis of the new design of the internal beam dump for the PS, showing the design process required to reduce the impedance contribution of this element. Furthermore, the impedance analysis of the currently installed beam dump is analysed in order to compare the impedance contributions of the two designs.

Lower-Harmonic RF System in the CERN SPS

Significant beam losses increasing with intensity are observed at capture and along the SPS flat bottom for the LHC-type proton beam. The intensity should be doubled for HL-LHC and high losses may be a major performance limitation. Bunches extracted from the PS, the SPS injector, are produced in a 40 MHz RF system applying a bunch rotation at the end of the cycle and therefore cannot be perfectly matched to the 200 MHz SPS RF bucket. The possibility of using a lower harmonic additional RF capture system in the SPS was already proposed after the LEP era in preparation for transfer of the LHC beam but the bunch rotation was the preferred solution, since the induced voltage in the SPS 200 MHz RF system would be too large to ensure stability in a low harmonic system without mitigation measures. However, the use of the upgraded one-turn feedback and the 200 MHz RF system as a Landau cavity could help to improve stability. The feasibility of this scenario to reduce capture losses in the SPS is analysed and presented in this paper. The choice of an optimum RF frequency and voltage is also discussed. The transfer to the main 200 MHz is simulated using a realistic bunch distribution.

Losses and transverse emittance growth in the Super Protron Synchrotron (SPS) impose presently the main performance limitation on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ion injector chain. In this paper we present the measurements performed in 2016 with Pb82+ ions and the analysis to characterize the observations of beam degradation during the long injection plateau. Residual gas scattering, intrabeam scattering (IBS) and resonance excitation have been studied.

The performance of the CERN Low Energy Ion Ring with electron cooled ion beams is presently limited by losses occurring once the beam has been captured in the RF buckets. An intense machine study program was started by the end of 2015 to mitigate the losses and improve the performance of the accelerator. The measurements pointed to the interplay of direct space charge forces and excited betatron resonances as the most plausible driving mechanism of these losses. In this paper, we present the systematic space-charge measurements performed in 2017 and compare them to space-charge tracking simulations based on an adaptive frozen potential.

Instabilities of many different types and characteristics have been observed in the LHC during Run 2. The origin of these instabilities come from a variety of stabilising and destabilising mechanisms. Efforts to understand these instabilities and prevent their occurrence has improved the performance of the LHC in all stages of the machine cycle. This paper aims to give an overview into some of the instability observations and details the operational steps to prevent them.

The operation during the summer months of the 2017 Run of the CERN LHC was plagued with fast beam losses that repeatedly occurred in the 16th arc half-cell at the left of IP2 as well as in the collimation insertion, leading to unwanted beam dumps. Transverse coherent oscillations were observed during this fast process. We detail here the experimental observations of coherent motion that al-lowed shedding light upon parts of the mechanism and identify the potential mitigations that were successfully implemented in the second half of the Run.

A versatile symplectic integration scheme has been developed in order to produce simplified versions of non linear lattices, preserving fundamental non-linear properties such as the detuning with amplitude and energy, in addition to the linear transport. The method has been applied to the LHC and benchmarked against tracking simulations with Sixtrack. This reduced lattice is made available as a refined replacement of the simple rotation matrix often used in multi-particle studies requiring a fast beam transport routine.

The symplectic integrators CSABA & CSBAB are used in order to calculate single particles dynamics in accelerators and storage rings. These integrators include only forward drift steps while being highly accurate. Their efficiency to describe various optical and dynamical quantities for main magnetic elements and non-linear lattices is calculated and compared with the efficiency of the splitting methods used in MAD-X - PTC.

The new superconducting quadrupole and dipole magnets for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will rely on quench heaters or Coupling-Loss Induced Quench (CLIQ) units or a combination of both to protect the magnet coils in case of a quench. After the detection of a quench, the quench heater power supplies will discharge currents of several hundreds of amperes into the quench heater strips glued to the coils, and the CLIQ units will discharge an oscillating current in the order of 1~kA directly into the coils. These currents can have a significant effect on the circulating beam if the discharge occurs before the beam is dumped. In the HL-LHC inner triplet quadrupole magnets and 11 T dipole magnets, which will be installed in the collimation region dispersion suppressor, this effect will even be stronger due to the larger number of quench heaters and use of CLIQ units (triplet magnets only) as well as due to the greater value of beta function in comparison with the present LHC. In this paper, the expected effects of quench heater and CLIQ discharges on the circulating beam are summarized, and several mitigation methods are proposed and evaluated.

In order to achieve the highest beam intensities possible in the LHC the highest quality beam possible has to be supplied by the injector chain. The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN is the last accelerator in the injector chain of the LHC. One factor that is currently known to limit the intensity of the beam for injection to the LHC, is the longitudinal beam-coupling impedance in the SPS. One known source of multi-bunch instability is the vacuum flanges and campaigns to mechanically shield this source were completed in the year 2000. However, today it cannot be excluded that some of these shields may have partial or indeed full failures. Since these flanges are next to a QF magnet and are in most cases connected to a BPH (Beam Position Monitor Horizontal), it is possible to carry out via the BPH an in-situ measurement of the effectiveness of the shields. In this paper we present a methodology as well as measurement results taken with this non-intrusive in-situ method. From measurements, it is possible to identify if the flanges are without any impedance shield, equipped with either a fully functioning shield or a shield exhibiting non-ideal properties.

We demonstrate covariant beam-physics simulation through multipole magnets using Hamiltonians relying on canonical momentum. Space-charge integration using the Lienard–Wiechert potentials is also discussed. This method is compared with conventional nonlinear Lie-operator tracking and the TraceWin software package.

We propose to use the sum of TM0m0 modes to treat a radio-frequency superconducting elliptical cavity as a pill-box cavity with variable radius. The amplitudes of the different modes are obtained interpolating the field-map of the cavity with the model. Once the field is calculated, the Hamiltonian of the cavity is constructed and used to evaluate the transfer matrices associated to each step of the field-map. The multi-particle non-linear dynamics can also be evaluated using the Lie Transform of the Hamiltonian. The results are benchmarked against the ESS Linac Simulator contained in the OpenXAL suite.

An integrable Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (iRCS) has been proposed as a replacement for the Fermilab Booster to achieve multi-MW beam power for the Fermilab high-energy neutrino program.* The successful application of nonlinear integrable optics to proton synchrotrons requires careful examination of single-particle longitudinal effects, especially synchrotron motion. For example, synchrobetatron coupling may excite transverse resonances in the ring. We will use the Synergia code to simulate the effects of this synchrobetatron coupling on the iRCS design with nonlinear inserts. Our goal will be to identify new invariants in the presence of this coupling. Assuming the synchrotron tune is sufficiently small, we have identified one or more adiabatic invariants of the motion. These invariants suggest that integrable optics with synchrobetatron coupling retains integrability when averaged over a synchrotron period.

The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring is being constructed at Fermilab as a testbed for new accelerator concepts. One important series of experiments tests the use of a novel nonlinear magnetic insert to damp coherent instabilities. To test the damping power of the ele- ment, an instability of desired strength may be intentionally excited with an anti-damper. We report on simulations of beam stabilization using the Synergia modeling framework over ranges of driving and damping strengths.

Particle Tracking Simulation of Collective Modes - Parametric Landau Damping Off Coupling Resonance

Employing Synergia simulations with the DMD method we investigate the Landau damping of space charge modes in bunched beams. The simulations reveal two instances of the parametric damping mechanism in bunched beams. The first example occurs in the proximity of coupling resonance and is due to the oscillation of particles' amplitudes in the transverse plane. This oscillation modulates the mode-particle coupling with particle dependent trapping frequency. The second example is due to the modulation of the mode-particle coupling in one transverse plane by the oscillatory motion in the other plane.

Sextupole magnets provide position-dependent momentum kicks and are tuned to provide the correct kicks to particles within a small acceptance region in phase space. Sextupoles are useful and even necessary in circular accelerators for chromaticity corrections. They are routinely used in most rings, i.e. CESR. Although sextupole magnets are necessary for particle energy corrections, they also have undesirable effects on dynamic aperture, especially because of their non-linear coupling term in the momentum kick. Studies of integrable systems suggest that there is an analytic way to create transport lattices with specific transfer matrices that limit the momentum kick to one dimension. A one-dimension sextupole is needed for chromaticity corrections: a horizontal sextupole for horizontal bending magnets. We know how to make a "composite" horizontal sextupole using regular 2D sextupoles and linear transfer matrices in an ideal thin-lens approximation. Thus, one could create an accelerator lattice using linear elements, in series with sextupole magnets to create a '1d sextupole'. This paper describes progress towards realizing a realistic focusing lattice resulting in a 1d sextupole.*

Space charge (SC) in a circulating beam in a ring produces both betatron tune shift and betatron tune spread. These effects make some particles move on to a machine resonance and become unstable. Linear elements of beam optics cannot reduce the tune spread induced by SC because of its intrinsic nonlinear nature. We investigate the possibility to mitigate it by a thin McMillan lens providing a nonlinear axially symmetric kick, which is qualitatively opposite to the accumulated kick by SC. Experimentally, the proposed concept can be tested in Fermilab's IOTA ring. A thin McMillan lens can be implemented by a short (70 cm) insertion of an electron beam with specifically chosen density distribution in transverse directions. In this article, to see if McMillan lenses reduce the tune spread induced by SC, we make several simulations with particle tracking code Synergia. We choose such beam and lattice parameters that tune spread is roughly 0.5 and a beam instability due to the half-integer resonance 0.5 is observed. Then, we try to reduce emittance growth by shifting betatron tunes by adjusting quadrupoles and reducing the tune spread by McMillan lenses.

FAST linear accelerator has been commissioned in 2017. Experimental program of the facility requires high quality beams with well-defined properties. Solenoidal fields at photoinjector, laser spot shape, space charge forces and other effects can distort beam distribution and introduce coupling. This work presents results of a beam phase space tomography for a coupled 4D case. Beam was rotated in two planes with seven quads by 180 degrees and images from YaG screen were used to perform SVD based reconstruction of the beam distribution.

Pros and cons of the various methods are compared and an optimum operational scenario to guarantee the maximum stability is proposed.

The future high energy physics program at Fermilab requires that the proton complex operate with beam bunch intensities four times larger than is currently handled. At these intensities space charge nonlinear defocussing effects cause unacceptable particle losses especially in the low energy rapid-cycling-synchrotron (RCS) Booster. Focusing electron lens elements may offer a solution by providing partial space charge compensation but there is a need for detailed simulations as this technique has not been demonstrated. We report on high fidelity numerical 6D space charge simulations in a model accelerator lattice with a record high space charge tune shift approaching unity.

A Particle Beam Optics Laboratory (PBO Lab) module has been developed for the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) version of the TURTLE program commonly known as Graphic-Turtle. The PSI-TURTLE version extends the original TURTLE program by including several unique beam optics capabilities, as well as by providing a self-contained graphics package. The unique optics modeling, together with the data visualization enhancements, make the PSI-TURTLE program ideal for certain types of beam simulations. The PBO Lab environment provides a single graphic user interface (GUI) that features an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use drag-and-drop beamline construction kit. Underlying the GUI is a sophisticated object model developed specifically for the accelerator community. PBO Lab provides a common interface for multiple charged particle optics codes. Modules have been developed for a number of popular beam optics programs that cover a range of accelerator types and applications. The PSI-TURTLE Module extends those capabilities. The module is described and its main capabilities and limitations are summarized.

CRYRING@ESR is a heavy ion storage ring, which can cool and decelerate highly charged ions down to a few 100 keV/u. It has been relocated from Sweden to GSI, downstream of the experimental storage ring (ESR), within the FAIR project. The ring will be used as a test facility for FAIR technologies as well as for physics experiments with slow exotic ion beams for several FAIR collaborations: SPARC, BioMat, FLAIR and NUSTAR. CRYRING@ESR is in its commissioning phase since summer 2016. Several ion-optical measurements such as tunes, tune diagram, dispersion, chromaticity and orbit response matrix were performed at the ring. The measurements will be used for several purposes such as improvement of the theoretical model, closed orbit control and correction of unacceptable misalignments, calibration coefficients and field errors.

The Collector Ring is designed for stochastic cooling of antiprotons or radioactive ions at FAIR. Simulations of the cooling process in combination with the required RF beam manipulations have been done taking into account the improved and recently fixed ion-optics. The measured RF properties of the first of series debuncher system have been considered to evaluate the performance of the bunch rotation, de-bunching and re-bunching process within the planned CR operation cycle. The expected beam parameters and matching at extraction to the HESR storage ring are discussed in this paper. The latest hardware developments of the stochastic cooling system components are also presented.

Passive mitigation methods are effective cures for collective instabilities in ring accelerators. For decades, octupole magnets have been used as an established and well-understood passive mitigation method. Present and the future accelerator facilities, like FAIR or FCC, impose new challenges on the passive mitigation due to higher energies and smaller beam emittances. Lattice resonances usually restrict the tolerable tune-spreads which are essential for the passive mitigation methods. We study the stability of transverse bunch oscillations provided by octupole magnets and radio-frequency quadrupoles. The special focus of our study is on the interplay and role of decoherence, phase-mixing and Landau damping for the different mitigation schemes. Particle tracking simulations are performed and the tune spreads for the different mechanisms are compared with each other and also with analytical dispersion relations.

The SIS100 synchrotron is the central accelerator of the upcoming FAIR project at GSI, Darmstadt, Germany. The major challenges of the future operation are related to high-intensity, low beam loss operation for a wide range of ion species and charge states, for different operational cycles and extraction schemes. The magnet system consists of 108 dipole, 166 quadrupole and additional correction superconducting superferric magnets. The magnets are presently under production and testing, with detailed measurements of the magnetic field imperfections. This results in the construction of a complete database for the SIS100 magnet system. We analyse implications of the magnetic field imperfections for the single-particle stability, space charge induced tune-shifts and resonance crossing for the different SIS100 operation modi. Resonance compensation and magnet sorting schemes are discussed as possible measures.

One or more radio-frequency jumps are usually necessary for realizing a ≥100 AMeV/u proton or ion driver linac. Typically, such jumps happen in the range of β = 0.2-0.6 between the resonator structures fitting to this β-range, e.g. DTL, HWR, CCL or elliptical cavities. We propose to perform the first frequency jump already at low energies (β ≤ 0.1) between two RFQ accelerators, which can bring some unique advantages. First studies have been performed and the results proved that this idea is feasible and promising. Many efforts have been and are being made to address the most critical issue for the jumps i.e. the beam matching at the transition.

Dedicating more precious time to advanced research instead of spending it towards time-consuming routine tasks is a desirable goal in particle accelerator simulation and development. Requirements engineering was started at IAP in order to identify routine processes at our institute's R&D that can be automated or simplified. Results indicated that there were several areas to consider: Bead pull measurements, data processing and visualization for the beam dynamics code LORASR, CST field map processing for the use with TraceWin, conversion between different particle distribution data formats and more. Subsequently development of the LINAC-Multitool started to rationalize these processes and replace preexisting scripts also to ensure consistency of results and increase transparency and reliability of computation. In order to guarantee maintainability, expandability and platform independence, LINAC-Multitool is programmed using Java and will be open source. This contribution presents the current state of development.

The expected BESSY II upgrade to BESSY VSR requires the installation of a superconducting RF system, consisting of four cavities. Two cavities will operate at 1.5 GHz and two at 1.75 GHz. Each of them is equipped with a Fundamental Power Coupler and with Higher Order Mode (HOM) damping waveguide couplers. Dedicated simulations of these cavities and couplers have shown that at the location of the FPC the beam will see a transverse kick [*], perturbing the closed orbit and affecting transverse beam dynamics. We present the results of simulations and experiments of the impact on transverse beam dynamics of these coupler induced kicks for different FPC orientations.

Currently Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin prepares the update of the BESSY II ring to BESSY VSR. The updated ring will be capable to simultaneously store short and long bunches to satisfy the various user demands. For this sake, a cryomodule accommodating two 1.5 GHz and two 1.75 GHz superconducting cavities will be installed into the storage ring. The cavity string will be equipped with warm dielectric absorber rings at both ends. Together with the waveguide dampers of the cavities, these rings damp electromagnetic fields excited by the beam. This contribution presents the estimation of the dielectric losses in the beam pipe absorber rings of the BESSY VSR module. The presented approach is based on determining a broad band impedance of the dielectric ring by exciting the numerical model with a single broad band Gaussian bunch. Subsequently, the power deposited into the ring is estimated in frequency domain by multiplying the impedance with the square of the beam current for all considered harmonics of the beam. Finally, these power contributions are added up. In addition to details of the scheme, the contribution presents results for the recent absorber layout of the BESSY VSR string.

A Robinson wiggler is planned to be installed in the storage ring of the Metrology Light Source (the MLS). The Robison wiggler (RW) is a device consisting of a chain of combined-function magnets (CFMs), intended to manipulate the damping partition numbers and thus adjust the longitudinal emittance. The objective is to lengthen the bunch in order to improve the Touschek lifetime. However, the nonlinear perturbation of the beam dynamics due to the Robinson wiggler could limit the achievable improvement. Therefore, a symplectic method of modeling the wiggler has been established to study these nonlinear effects. Optimized solutions have been developed for both the ramping procedure and the future daily operation of the wiggler and are presented in this paper.

Several future accelerator projects, light sources and user experiments require high brightness electron beams. SRF photoinjectors operating in continuous-wave (cw) mode hold the potential to serve as an electron source generating beams of high average brightness and short bunch lengths. Different operation and design parameters of the SRF photoinjector impact the beam dynamics and thus the beam brightness. A universal multi-objective optimization program based on a genetic algorithm was developed to extract optimum gun parameter settings from Pareto-optimum solutions. After getting the first optimum results, the photoinjector is supplemented with a booster section downstream. The new optimization results are presented. Further, the optimization program is applied to evaluate the impact of the field flatness of the gun cavity on the high brightness performance.

We discuss a novel coherent beam-beam instability in collisions with a large crossing angle. The instability appears in the correlated head-tail motion of the two colliding beams. Cross wake force is introduced to represent the head-tail correlation between colliding beams. The cross wake force is localized at the collision point. Mode coupling theory based on the cross wake force is developed. Collision scheme with a large crossing angle is being very popular in design of electron positron collider. In SuperKEKB project, a collision with a large crossing angle is performed to boost the luminosity ~ 1036 cm-2s−1. Future circular collider, FCC is also designed with a large crossing angle. Strong-strong simulations have shown a strong coherent head-tail instability, which can limit the performance of proposed future colliders. The mode coupling theory using the cross wake force explains the instability. The instability may affect all colliders designs based on the crab waist scheme.
