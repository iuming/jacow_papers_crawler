The science needs for probing materials to determine electronic structure with elemental specificity, imaging, and spectroscopies, with ultrafast time resolution, drive soft X-ray FEL design. In addition to operational soft X-ray facilities, there are FEL construction projects under way that include soft X-ray laser capabilities, and planned facilities with novel capabilities. This paper provides a review of the exciting field of existing and planned soft X-ray Free Electron Lasers with the emphasis on new schemes and new technologies to achieve better performance.

LCLS has accumulated significant operational experience, now including hard X-ray self-seeding, and SACLA has successfully delivered hard X-ray laser beams to users. The European XFEL is in an advanced stage of construction, the SwissFEL and PAL-XFEL projects are in early stages of construction, and MaRIE is in planning stages. This presentation should provide an overview of progress and plans for hard x-ray facilities worldwide.
