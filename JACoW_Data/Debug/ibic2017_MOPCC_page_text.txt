Funding: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska Curie grant agreement No 675265.
The Optimization of Medical Accelerators (OMA) is the aim of a new pan-European project. As one of the largest initiatives of its kind, OMA joins more than 30 universities, research centers and clinical facilities with industry partners to address the challenges in treatment facility design and optimization, numerical simulations for the development of advanced treatment schemes, and beam imaging and treatment monitoring. This contribution starts with an overview of the project's research into beam diagnostics and imaging. It then presents specific research outcomes from investigations into applying detector technologies originally developed for high energy physics experiments (such as VELO, Medipix) for medical applications; identification of optimum detector configurations and materials for high resolution spectrometers for proton therapy and radiography; ultra-low charge beam current monitors and diagnostics for cell studies using proton beams. Finally, it summarizes the interdisciplinary training program that OMA provides to its 15 Fellows, as well as the wider medical accelerator community.

We have developed and tested a technique, which significantly improves the accuracy of the orbit bump method of local impedance measurement. This technique is based on in-phase sine-wave (AC) excitation of four fast correctors adjacent to the vacuum chamber section, impedance of which is measured. The narrow-band sine-wave signals provide better signal-to-noise ratio. Use of fast correctors to the beam excitation eliminates the systematic error caused by hysteresis. The systematic error caused by orbit drift is also suppressed because the measured signal is not affected by the orbit motion outside the excitation frequency range. The measurement technique is described and the result of experimental testing carried out at NSLS-II is presented.

Head-on beam-beam compensation had been successfully implemented routinely in the 2015 polarized proton operation in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Two electron lenses have been used to reduce the incoherent beam-beam tune spread to allow a larger proton bunch intensity and therefore a higher luminosity. Beam transfer function was used to determine the beam-beam incoherent tune spread. In this article, we carry out numeric simulations to compare the tune spreads derived from tune histogram and the beam transfer function. Then we present the experimental beam transfer function measurements and extract the tune spreads due to beam-beam interaction and electron lens. Experimental results show that the electron lens reduced the beam-beam tune spread.

Since 2015, Mg photocathodes have been applied for the ELBE SRF gun. Recently, user experiments with a bunch charge of 100 pC and beam transport experiments with 200 pC have been performed. The electron beam diagnostics will be presented, including the slit-scan measurements of the transverse phase space, the quadrupole-scan emittance measurement and the phase-scan bunch length measurement. Principles and results of these diagnostics will be introduced, as well as the error analysis. A UV laser is used to emit electron, the pulse length of which directly impacts the electron beam. A commercial cross correlator has been installed to measure the temporal profile of the UV laser. The alignment of the beam measurement results for this will be presented. Bases on the operation experiences from the current SRF gun, a new gun-lab has been proposed to build and test the next SRF gun in a separated room from the ELBE accelerator. The preliminary design of a new corresponding diagnostics beamline will be presented, featuring a fast beam-scan transverse phase space measurement and a transverse deflecting structure based measurement of longitudinal phase space.

The Superconducting Darmstadt Linear Accelerator S-DALINAC is capable of accelerating electrons to kinetic energies of up to 130 MeV. Due to its three recirculating beamlines the 30 MeV main linac can be used up to four times. The electron beam is recirculated non-isochronously with a distinct longitudinal dispersion to conserve the energy spread of the injector. Time-of-flight measurements at the beamline connecting injector and main linac will be presented, showing a non-linear dependency on the energy. This effect can be reproduced by simulations using elegant and are caused by traversing accelerating cavities with a small transversal displacement and a small angular deviation. Besides the first recirculation beamline does not provide enough degrees of freedom to set the desired longitudinal dispersion for the non-isochronous recirculation mode. This has to be compensated in succeeding recirculation beamlines or by installation of additional magnets at the first recirculation beamline. Possible beamline modifications and time-of-flight measurements representing the longitudinal dispersion will be presented.

Transverse Couple Bunch Instabilities (TCBI) have been identified at ALBA as one of the main beam current limitations since its early commissioning in 2011. In these last years, we have developed several diagnostics tools that allow us a better characterization of these instabilities. The Synchrotron Radiation Interferometry has been equipped with a Fast Gated Camera (FGC) to measure the bunch-by-bunch beam size evolution, which, in combination with the diagnostics tools of the Transverse Multibunch Feedback system, provides us with a fruitful insight of these phenomena. This paper describes these diagnostics tools, and as an example, compares the emittance and tune evolution switching on/off some of the vacuum pumps at the Storage Ring.

The non-invasive diagnostics in the ALBA Booster-to-Storage (BTS) transfer consist of Beam Position Monitors (BPM) and Synchrotron Radiation Monitors (SRM), which together provide position, size and shape of the beam. However, they were not reliable enough for a systematic improvement of the transfer efficiency in the BTS, which has been fluctuating since day one. In order to optimize it, two major upgradse have been performed: first, the BPM electronics have been upgraded for single-pass beam detection, showing a factor 10 better position resolution than the former units. Secondly, the SRMs mechanics and automation were significantly improved to provide a more robust optics alignment. Both BPMs and SRMs are now routinely used to keep transmission efficiency along the BTS constant over weeks.

A high brightness electron LINAC is being built in the Compton Gamma Source at the ELI Nuclear Physics facility in Romania. To achieve the design luminosity, a train of 32 bunches, 16 ns spaced, with a nominal charge of 250 pC will collide with the laser beam in the interaction point at two electron beam energies, namely 280 MeV and 720 MeV. Electron beam spot size is measured with optical transition radiation (OTR) profile monitors. The paper deals with the possibility of using the OTR monitors to measure also beam energy along the machine; such measurements may help monitoring the accelerating sections performances, especially when the whole bunch train is being accelerated. We discuss the measurement principle, the expected accuracy and the main characteristic of the optical line to retrieve the angular distribution of the emitted radiation.

We study Allison-type phase-space scanners by extending analytic models to include two important geometric features that are conventionally omitted, namely asymmetric slit-plate to dipole-plate gaps at the two ends and finite slit-plate thickness. Their effects can be significant for high-resolution Allison scanners and lead to two corrections in the measurement data relative to more idealized descriptions: 1) a change in the voltage-to-angle conversion relation, and 2) a data point weight compensation factor. These findings are corroborated by numerically integrated single-particle trajectories in a realistic 2D field map of the device. The improved model was applied to the Allison scanner used to measure a 12 keV/u heavy-ion beam in the front-end of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University. Preliminary measurements show that the improved model results in significant (>10%) modifications to beam moments, thus rendering the corrections important for accurate phase-space characterizations.
