Invention of the crab waist collision scheme gave birth to several projects of future colliders with luminosity by one or two orders of magnitude higher than in previous particle factories. The biggest influence in luminosity gain comes from extremely small vertical beta function, which enhances nonlinear chromaticity of the interaction region lattice. Therefore, all the projects have to compensate it. We will review two already present colliders with crab waist collision scheme DAΦNE and SuperKEKB, and three projects: SuperB (Italy), tau-charm (Novosibirsk) and FCC-ee (CERN), explain the common problems of the interaction region nonlinear properties.

FCC-ee double-ring collider must be operated in the beam energy range from 45 to 175 GeV. The 100 km circumference ring includes two IPs/ring, crab-waist scheme with local chromaticity correction system. Misalignments of magnetic elements destroy main ring parameters. For design luminosity vertical emittance must be kept small. Simulations of the magnetic elements misalignments are presented. Main contributions of emittance blow up are listed.

IHEP has proposed a circular electron and positron collider (CEPC) to study the properties of the Higgs boson. In the baseline design, the circumference of CEPC will be taken as 50-70km. The single ring scheme and the partial double ring scheme are now both under study. In the single ring scheme, the electron and positron beam will share the beam pipes, thus a special orbit is needed to avoid the beam colliding at positions except the Interaction Points (IPs). While in the partial double ring scheme, the two beams will be separated into two beam pipes in the parasitic collision positions. This paper will show the latest design of the CEPC lattice, including both the pretzel and partial double ring scheme. Some critical issues that we encountered when designing the lattices will be discussed.
