Experimental study on superconducting electron linac has been developed at Peking University. Stable operation of a DC-SRF photoinjector and a 2*9-cell SRF linac has been realized with an average beam current of mA scale in macro pulses of several ms with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. A compact high repetition rate THz radiation source has been developed based on DC-SRF photo-injector through velocity bunching. Superradiant THz radiation with a repetition rate of 16.25 MHz and a frequency that can be tuned from 0.24 to 0.42 THz was generated by varying the electron beam energy from 2.4 to 3.1 MeV. MeV UED at MHz repetition rate has been demonstrated experimentally using electron pulses from the DC-SRF photoinjector. THz undulator radiation of ~1THz central frequency with an average power of 1W has been achieved with 13MeV electron beam from SRF linac and applications are underway.

The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is a 6-GeV, kilometer-scale, ultralow-emittance storage ring light source to be built in Beijing, China. The HEPS is now under extensive design and study. In this report we will introduce the progress of the lattice design and related physics studies on HEPS, covering issues of storage ring design, booster design, injection design, collective effects, error study, insertion device effects, longitudinal dynamics, etc.

The 100km Double Ring configuration with shared super conducting RF systems has been defined as baseline by CEPC steering committee. CEPC is compatible with W and Z experiment. Requirement for energy acceptance of Higgs has been reduced to 1.1% by enlarging the ring to 100 km. For CDR, W and Z will use the same lattice as Higgs, and the luminosity for Z is at the level of 1034cm-2s-1.
