The Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) project requires the assembly, test, and installation of 37 cry-omodules (CM) in order to deliver a 4 GeV CW electron beam to the FEL undulators for production of both hard and soft X-ray pulses at a repetition rate of up to 1 MHz. All of the cryomodules will operation in continuous wave mode, with 35 operating at 1.3 GHz for acceleration and 2 operating at 3.9 GHz to linearize the longitudinal beam profile. The assembly and testing of the 1.3 GHz cry-omodules is nearing completion and the 3.9 GHz cry-omodules work is entering to assembly and testing phase. Roughly 60% of the cryomodules have been shipped to SLAC for installation in the accelerator enclosure. The status and challenges of these efforts will be reported in this paper.

APS has been developing superconducting undulators for over a decade. Presently, two planar and one helical device are in operation in the APS storage ring, and a number of devices will be installed in the APS Upgrade ring. All superconducting devices perform with very high reliability and have very minor effect on the storage ring operation. To achieve this, a number of storage ring modifications had to be done, such as introduction of the beam abort system to eliminate device quenches during beam dumps, and lattice and orbit modifications to allow for installation of the small horizontal aperture helical device with magnet coils in the plane of synchrotron radiation.

RadiaBeam, in collaboration with UCLA and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), is developing a strongly tapered helical undulator system for the Tapering Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification experiment at 266 nm (TESSA-266). The experiment will be carried out at the APS LEA facility at ANL and aims at the demonstration of very high energy conversion efficiency in the UV. The undulator system was designed by UCLA, engineered by RadiaBeam, and is presently in fabrication at RadiaBeam. The design is based on a permanent magnet Halbach scheme and includes a short 30 cm long buncher section and four 1 m long undulator sections. The undulator period is fixed at 32 mm and the magnetic field amplitude can be tapered by tuning the gap along the interaction. Each magnet can be individually adjusted by 1.03 mm, offering up to 25% magnetic field tunability with a minimum gap of 5.58 mm. A custom designed 316L stainless steel beampipe runs through the center with a clear aperture of 4.5 mm. This paper discusses the design and engineering of the undulator system, fabrication status, and plans for magnetic measurements, and tuning.

We discuss the power and spectral characteristics of an X-ray FEL, LCLS-II, operating in a double bunch self-seeding scheme (DBFEL). We show that it can reach very high power levels in the photon energy range of 4-8 keV. We discuss the system implementation on LCLS-II, including the design of a four-bounce crystal monochromator, and linac wakefields effects. Finally, we offer multiple applications of the DBFEL for high-field QED, AMO physics and single particle imaging.

The nominal single particle dynamics optimizations of the Advanced Photon Source upgrade (APS-U) lattice are performed with dense numerical simulations of local momentum acceptance and dynamic acceptance. These simulations are quite time consuming, which may take weeks for optimizing one setpoint of linear chromaticity. In this paper, an alternative optimization method is adopted to generate optimized linear and second order chromaticity setpoints for the Advanced Photon Source upgrade lattice. This method is efficient in computing time needed, which is capable to generate a grid of optimized chromaticity setpoints in a relatively short time. The performance of these lattice solutions are verified by simulations with reasonable errors. These lattice solutions with different linear (or second order) chromaticity may be useful for the future APS-U commissioning and operations.

Design work is underway for the upgrade of the Advanced Light Source (ALS-U) to a diffraction-limited soft x-rays radiation source. It consists of an accumulator and a storage ring. In both rings, coupling-impedance driven instabilities need careful evaluation to ensure meeting the machine high-performance goals. This paper presents the impedance budget of the accumulator ring both longitudinally and transversely. The budget includes the resistive wall impedance as well as the geometric impedance from the main vacuum components. Our calculations primarily rely on electromagnetic simulations with the CST code; when possible validation has been sought against analytical modeling, typically in the low-frequency limit, and good agreement generally found. Collective-instability current thresholds are also discussed.
