As the owner of an open source hardware company, I frequently encounter people who tell me why my business cannot possibly succeed. After six years of continuous growth, I would like to share my thoughts about why those people are wrong and how the mythology of invention affects perception. I'll share lessons from my background as a hacker, researcher, open source developer, and business owner and discuss the past, present, and future of science, technology, and the value of ideas.
