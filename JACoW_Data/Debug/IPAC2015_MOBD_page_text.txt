A new beam screen is needed in the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) final focusing magnets. Such an essential vacuum component, while operating in the range 40-60 K, has to ensure the vacuum performance and to prevent the beam-induced heating from reaching the cold bore which is at 1.9 K. In addition, they have to shield the cold mass from physics debris coming from the nearby beam collision points. To such purpose, energy absorbers made of tungsten alloy are installed onto the beam screen in the vacuum system. In this contribution, the proposed mechanical design is shown; it covers different thermomechanical aspects such as the behaviour during a magnet quench and the heat transfer from the tungsten absorbers to the cooling tubes. Assembly and manufacturing tolerances are also considered to evaluate the impact on the aperture. Results obtained with a short prototype assembly test are discussed.

The LHC high luminosity project envisages the use of the crabbing technique for increasing and levelling the LHC luminosity. Double-Quarter Wave (DQW) resonators are compact cavities especially designed to meet the technical and performance requirements for LHC beam crabbing. A couple of DQW crab cavities are under preparation and will be tested with beam in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) of CERN by 2017. This paper describes the design and prototyping of DQW crab cavities for the SPS test.

This paper describes the technical details of the development of a high-power solid-state amplifier for Brookhaven Laboratory. The amplifier must withstand short duration events of 100% full-power reflection, and also must guarantee delivery of continuous power into any load impedance at any angle.
