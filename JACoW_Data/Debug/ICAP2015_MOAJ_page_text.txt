I will first give a brief overview on the recent Workshop on Future of Electron Scattering sponsored by the US Department of Energy, to identify the future and frontiers in electron microscopy that can address grand challenges [1]. The workshop focused on 4 areas: Ultrafast Science; Advances in Imaging; Hybrid Instrumentation; and Measuring Functionality. Based on the ground breaking scientific opportunities in chemistry, physics, and biology laid out at the meeting, the workshop concluded that ultrafast and multidimensional microscopy are the frontier of the future electron scattering and the US government should aggressively support R&D on electron based instruments. I will then give some highlights on our recent work on the accelerator-based 2.8MeV ultrafast electron microscope at BNL using RF-gun that has achieved 120fs resolution with 106 electrons per pulse. Through quantitative electron diffraction we were able to probe the interaction between electrons, orbitals and lattice and separate various phonon modes in functional materials to address some most urgent questions in condensed matter physics. Future challenges on instrumentation development will also be discussed.

Historically particle accelerators are instrumental for high energy physics (accelerator based colliders) and photon science (accelerator based synchrotron light sources and free electron lasers). Now there is growing interest in applying accelerator technology to solve the grand challenges in probing matter at ultrafast temporal and ultrasmall spatial scales. In this talk we discuss how one can use MeV electrons produced in accelerators (e.g. photocathode rf guns) to study ultrafast dynamics at atomic scale through ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) and microscopy (UEM) techniques. We'll focus on the challenges in beam brightness, beam dynamics and beam diagnostics for this kind of facility. We will also report on the status of the MeV UED/UEM facility at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) which is expected to provide access to new sciences by producing kHz rep-rate ultrafast and ultrabright electron beams that will give researchers unparalleled power and precision in examining the fundamental nature of matter.
