The FFAG complex at KURRI is not only the first proton FFAG accelerator facility for beam users but the one aiming to have high beam power. The talk will present various efforts to increase beam power for the last few years and systematic strategy in near future toward the space charge limit.

In 2009 IBA decided to start the development of a compact superconducting synchrocyclotron as a proton-source for the small footprint proton therapy system called Proteus One ®. The cyclotron has been completely designed and constructed and is currently under commissioning at the IBA factory. Its design and commissioning results will be presented.

Much progress has been made in the FFAG design with novel ideas, for example, FFAG straight line, FFAG with race track shape, FFAG with vertical orbit excursion, etc. Some of these were demonstrated experimentally. The talk will review the recent progress around the world.
