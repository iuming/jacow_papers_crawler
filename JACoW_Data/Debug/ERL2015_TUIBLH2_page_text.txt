The proposed eRHIC electron-hadron collider uses a "non-scaling FFAG" lattice to recirculate 16 turns of different energy through just two beamlines located in the RHIC tunnel. This paper presents lattices for these two FFAGs that are optimised for low magnet field and to minimise total synchrotron radiation across the energy range. The higher number of recirculations in the FFAG allows a shorter linac (1.322GeV) to be used, drastically reducing cost, while still achieving a 21.2GeV maximum energy to collide with one of the existing RHIC hadron rings at up to 250GeV. eRHIC uses many cost-saving measures in addition to the FFAG: the linac operates in energy recovery mode, so the beams also decelerate via the same FFAG loops and energy is recovered from the interacted beam. All magnets will constructed from NdFeB permanent magnet material, meaning chillers and large magnet power supplies are not needed. This paper also describes a smaller prototype ERL-FFAG accelerator that will test all of these technologies in combination to reduce technical risk for eRHIC.

The linear non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) design for eRHIC presents challenges as well as advantages. In this report, the challenge on orbit and optics corrections for eRHIC will be discussed and the solutions will be presented as well.

The LHeC aims at delivering an electron beam for collision with the LHC proton beam. The current baseline design consists of a multi-pass superconductive energy recovery linac operating in a continuous wave mode. Here, we describe the overall layout of such ERL complex located on the LHC site. We present an optimized multi-pass linac optics enabling operation of the proposed 3-pass RLA in the Energy Recovery mode. We also describe emittance preserving return arc optics architecture; including layout and optics of the arc switch-yard. High current (>100 mA) beam operation in the linacs excites long range wake-fields between bunches of different turns, which induce instabilities and might cause beam losses. The impact of long-range wake-fields, synchrotron radiation, and beam-beam effects has been assessed in this paper.
