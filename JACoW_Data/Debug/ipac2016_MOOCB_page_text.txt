The beam alignment requirements for the next generation of lepton colliders have become increasingly challenging. As an example, the alignment requirements for the three major collider components of the CLIC linear collider are as follows. Before the first beam circulates, the Beam Position Monitors (BPM), Accelerating Structures (AS)and quadrupoles will have to be aligned up to 10 μm w.r.t. a straight line over 200 m long segments, along the 20 km of linacs. PACMAN is a study on Particle Accelerator Components' Metrology and Alignment to the Nanometre scale. It is an Innovative Doctoral Program, funded by the EU and hosted by CERN, providing high quality training to 10 Early Stage Researchers working towards a PhD thesis. The technical aim of the project is to improve the alignment accuracy of the CLIC components by developing new methods and tools addressing several steps of alignment simultaneously, to gain time and accuracy. The tools and methods developed will be validated on a test bench. This paper presents the technical systems to be integrated in the test bench, the results of the compatibility tests performed between these systems, as well as the final design of the PACMAN validation bench.

Most lattice correction algorithms, such as LOCO, rely on the amplitude of the BPM signals. However, these signals are a mixture of the BPM gain and beta-beat. Even though BPM gain can be fitted by analyzing the statistics of all the BPMs in a ring accelerator, we found the uncertainty is on the order of a few percent. On the other hand, the betatron phase advance, which is obtained from the correlation of two adjacent BPMs, is independent of the BPM gain and tilt error. It was found at NSLS-II that the measurement precision of the phase advance is typically 0.001 radian, which corresponds to about 0.2% of beta beat. The phase error can be corrected similarly using a response matrix, and at NSLS-II the phase error can be corrected to <0.005 radian (p-p) in less than half an hour. The same technique can be applied to the nonlinear lattice. By comparing the phase advance differences between the on- and off- orbit lattices, the sextupole strength error can be identified. Simulation and experimental results will be demonstrated in the paper.

Paradigm complementary to conventional matching is explored, with matching distributed across the entire line. This can have varying degrees of advantage depending on acuteness of issues in a conventional scheme: - Limited flexibility and space constraint for matching section - Neglect of beam property away from matching section - Excessive envelope/magnet strength caused by matching (sub-optimal tradeoff) - Local envelope blowup inside matching section - Low tolerance to errors and lack of recourse to matching failure - Slow computation process - Unpredictable solution - Limited option/insight/control on implementing solution. A scheme was envisioned to address these, backed by recently developed matching algorithm tailored to this demand. It can be applied to any beamline configuration, including coupled 4D or intervening elements, providing deterministic, rigorous solutions allowing insight and control pre-implementation. It also shows promise of global optimum. Combined with the distributed scheme this algorithm promises additional advantages of speed, determinism and flexibility. Preliminary results, computational demands and possibilities for extension will be discussed.
