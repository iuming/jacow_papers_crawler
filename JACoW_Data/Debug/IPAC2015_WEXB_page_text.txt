Collective beam effects, including coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR), have been studied on free-electron lasers (FELs). Here we will discuss a particular case of the CSR effects, that in energy-recovery linacs (ERLs). Special consideration is given to these machines because of their high average beam power and the architecture of the machine for energy recovery forces extreme bends. A recent study conducted on the JLab IR FEL looked at how CSR impacts both average energy and the energy spectrum of the beam. Such studies are important, both broadly, to the understanding of CSR and more specifically for a number of proposed ERL projects. A few proposed examples include the MEIC bunched beam cooler ERL design and ERL FELs for potential lithography purposes that would operate in the EUV range.

CesrTA is a test accelerator facility at Cornell University that has been configured to study physics associated with electron and positron damping rings. Electron cloud effects is a concern for positron beams for such damping rings. The presentation will give an overview of recent measurements and simulation results for CesrTA. The measurement conditions were set up in order to study single bunch phenomena by observing a "Witness bunch" behind a train of positron bunches. The beam size and the turn by turn spectra were obeserved for the witness bunch under different conditions. Simulations were performed under similar conditions using the program CMAD.

We present the concept and results of pseudo-single-bunch (PSB) operation–a new operational mode at the advanced light source–that can greatly expand the capabilities of synchrotron light sources to carry out dynamics and time-of-flight experiments. In PSB operation, a single electron bunch is displaced transversely from the other electron bunches using a short-pulse, high-repetition-rate kicker magnet. Experiments that require light emitted only from a single bunch can stop the light emitted from the other bunches using a collimator. Other beam lines will only see a small reduction in flux due to the displaced bunch. As a result, PSB allows to run timing experiments during the multibunch operation. Furthermore, the time spacing of PSB pulses can be adjusted from milliseconds to microseconds with a novel “kick-and-cancel” scheme, which can significantly alleviate complications of using high-power choppers and substantially reduce the rate of sample damage.
