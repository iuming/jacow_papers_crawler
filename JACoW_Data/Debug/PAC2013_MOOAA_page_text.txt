Particle colliders for high-energy physics have been in the forefront of scientific discoveries for more than half a century. The accelerator technology of the colliders has progressed immensely, while the beam energy, luminosity, facility size, and cost have grown by several orders of magnitude. The method of colliding beams has not fully exhausted its potential but has slowed down considerably in its progress. This paper briefly reviews the colliding beam method and the history of colliders, discusses the development of the method over the last two decades in detail, and examines near-term collider projects that are currently under development. The paper concludes with an attempt to look beyond the current horizon and to find what paradigm changes are necessary for breakthroughs in the field.

VEPP-2000 began high energy physics experiments in the end of 2010 and finished its third experimental season in July of 2013. The last season was dedicated to the energy range of 160-510 MeV per beam. Compton back-scattering based energy measurements were used for the regular energy calibration of the VEPP-2000 together with resonance depolarization and NMR based methods. The concept of the round colliding beams lattice along with the precise orbit and lattice correction yielded the high peak luminosity of 1.2×1031 cm-2s-1 at 505 MeV with average luminosity of 0.9×1031 cm-2s-1 per run. The total beam-beam tune shift up to 0.174 was achieved in the runs at 392.5 MeV. This corresponds to beam-beam parameter ξ=0.125 per one interaction point. The injection system is currently being upgraded to allow for the injection of particles at the top energy of VEPP-2000 collider and to eliminate the present lack of positrons.
