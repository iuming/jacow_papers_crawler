HDF5 and Data Formats Workshop
 


 

N.P. Rees
                       DLS, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom

 


 

This workshop will provide an introduction to the HDF library and the HDF5 Group, and include discussion on using HDF5 for storage of data and metadata. It will include a presentation about the current and future directions of the HDF5 library by a representative from the HDF Group. Other topics include: - The merits (and otherwise) of various ontologies built on top of HDF5 (e.g. NeXus) - How to use HDF5 in demanding applications (e.g. high speed detectors) - Potential future developments relevant to our community and how we can work to influence them.

Motion Control Applications in Large Facilities
 


 

B.J. Nutter
                       DLS, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom

 


 

Following the success of previous workshops on motion control, this year's workshop is intended to cover a broad range of motion control subjects pertaining to: - Experiences in motion control at the different sites: radiation damage to encoders, in house development versus industrial products, system performance validation including reliability, obsolescence management - Technical solutions in software and in low level hardware: kinematic transforms, complex trajectories, protection including collision avoidance, multi-axes and multi controller synchronization, embedded and/or hosted motion features - Motion control challenges: submicron positioning, continuous and synchronous motion control and data detector's acquisition - Motion Control and Sample Environment Automation: How should motion control fit into the increasing automation demands of high throughput beamlines

Meeting for users of the Micro Research Finland timing system to share experiences and future needs. We will be having a presentation on the latest products from MRF ' including new VME hardware and active delay drift compensation. We also are soliciting your contributions on interesting things you are doing with your timing system. If you have a paper in the Timing and Synchronization track, this would be an excellent opportunity to give a more technical presentation about your poster or your talk. Additional tutorial: This year we are also considering a 'beginners tutorial' session which will probably be held Tuesday morning after the keynote talk. The idea would be to cover the basic steps for getting started such as: - Initializing the event generator - Setting up a simple sequence - Initializing the event receiver - Setting up a pulser

EPICS Satellite Meeting

The (Southern Hemisphere) Spring 2015 EPICS collaboration meeting provides an opportunity for developers and managers from the various different sites to come together and discuss their work in progress and make plans for the future. They give a chance to see what is being done at other laboratories, and to review the specifications for new tools or enhancements to existing ones in order to maximize their usefulness to the whole community and avoid duplication of effort.

Control System Cyber-Security
 


 

S. Lüders
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

This is the 5th workshop on this popular topic. The focus will be to continue sharing and discussing counter-measures, review configuration and development procedures for secure control systems, and review the progress since the last workshop

THD3O07
Free Software Tools for Hardware Development
 


 

J. Serrano
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

Sharing hardware designs is difficult because the market for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools is fragmented and mostly dominated by proprietary tools with incompatible formats. The workshop explores the current landscape of free software tools for EDA, with an emphasis on KiCad, an application for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design. We will design a complete PCB from scratch using KiCad. If time allows and there is enough interest, we will also look at tools for Hardware Description Language (HDL) simulation and SPICE or SPICE-like analog simulation of circuits.
