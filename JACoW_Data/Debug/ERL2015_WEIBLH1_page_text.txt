High-brightness and high-average current beams from energy-recovery linacs are ideal for laser Compton sources as well as synchrotron sources and FELs. We are proposing ERL-based Compton sources, which exceed existing sources in the brightness and flux. Such Compton sources can be applied to various industrial and scientific applications such as non-destructive assay of nuclear material, research of magnetic material with circularly polarized photons, nuclear transmutation, production of medical isotopes and so on. In the presentation, we describe results of proof-of-principle experiment at the Compact ERL and overview future applications.

Using ERLs for Coherent electron Cooling

The demand for cooling of high energy hadrons requires increase in the electron beam energy as well. Electrostatic accelerators are not capable to provide sufficient voltage and should be replaced with energy recovery linacs.

ERL as High Intensity Mono-Energetic Gamma-Ray Sources

The generation of the mono energetic gamma beams using Compton source will be the main topic of this presentation. It will concentrate on the gamma energy range at the giant dipole resonance for the nuclear photofission of 238U to generate rare neutrino reach nuclei. The combination of power efficiency of ERL and Compton based gamma source generating most of its power at the top energy make such source a very attractive solution. The target in the Compton sources, the laser beam, is indestructible. This is in contrast, with a Bremsstrahlung target that will not survive any attempt to generate a hundred kilowatt in a sub millimeter gamma ray beam. Different options with laser sources from FEL to a laser enhancement cavity will be considered.
