LUNEX5 (free electron Laser Using a New accelerator for the Exploitation of X-ray radiation of 5th generation) aims at investigating the production of short, intense, coherent pulses in the 40-4 nm spectral range [1]. It comprises two types of accelerators connected to a single Free Electron Laser (FEL) for advanced seeding configurations (seeding with High order Harmonic in Gas, echo). A 400 MeV superconducting Linear Accelerator, adapted for studies of advanced FEL schemes, will enable future upgrade towards high repetition rate and multi-user operation by splitting part of the macropulse to different FEL lines. A 0.4 - 1 GeV Laser Wake Field Accelerator (LWFA) [2] will also be qualified by the FEL application. After the Conceptual Design Report, R&D has been launched on different sub components. Following transport theoretical studies of longitudinal and transverse manipulation of a LWFA electron beam enabling to provide theoretical amplification, a test experiment is under preparation.

The infrared free-electron laser offers a large tunability since the FEL gain remains high throughout the infrared spectral range, and the reflectivity of metal mirrors remains also close to unity. The main limitation comes from the diffraction of the optical beam due to the finite size of the vacuum chamber of the undulator. A solution is to use this chamber as a waveguide by adaptating the radius of curvature of the cavity mirrors to this regime. Then, as has been shown before* a minimum appears in the spectrum that can be produced by the FEL. We discuss the physical mechanism of this particular regime and compare it to experiments using vacuum chambers of different tranverse sizes. A good agreement is found with results of simulations and with a simple analytical formula.

The series production of the superconducting accelerator modules for the European XFEL requires a production rate of one module per week. For this, assembly procedures have to be well-defined and repeatable, and the punctual supply of parts from the contributing institutes has to be assured. Configuration management (CM) has been introduced for clarification of responsibilities and establishing procedures. CM provides unique identification of parts, part status and location tracking, versioning of documentation, and procedures for change control, auditing and handling non-conformities. The configuration database, which is based on DESY’s Engineering Data Management System, contains the entire information which is necessary for assembling the accelerator modules. The content ranges from work instructions how to build a cryomodule up to individual records of all produced parts. Workflow and reports help tracking production progress and establishing production quality. The presentation gives an overview of the CM solution which is in place for the assembly of the XFEL accelerator modules, and reports experience and lessons learned from series production of the first modules.

The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (E-XFEL) provides an ultra-short and high-brilliant photon pulses of spatially coherent X-rays with wavelengths down to 0.05 nm by using three undulator systems. Within these undulator systems, the orbit trajectory is required to be straight to a few micron over each gain length, so that the photon beam is capable of overlapping efficiently with the electron beam. However, this requirement is not obtainable with ordinary mechanical alignment methods. For this reason, a beam-based alignment (BBA) method using BPM readings of different beam energies is applied to the E-XFEL SASE1 undulators. In this report, we describe the BBA simulation for SASE1 including alignment errors of quadrupoles and BPMs. After correction, the desired range of the orbit trajectory is attained with high confidence. In addition, to identify the reliability of an aligned orbit trajectory acquired from the BBA simulation, we present here the SASE FEL radiation simulation, in which we observe a slight decrease of radiation energy and power.

Obtaining High Degree of Circular Polarization at X-ray FELs via a Reverse Undulator Taper
2870

Baseline design of a typical X-ray FEL undulator assumes a planar configuration which results in a linear polarization of the FEL radiation. However, many experiments at X-ray FEL user facilities would profit from using a circularly polarized radiation. As a cheap upgrade one can consider an installation of a short helical (or cross-planar) afterburner, but then one should have an efficient method to suppress powerful linearly polarized background from the main undulator. In this paper we propose a new method for such a suppression: an application of the reverse taper in the main undulator. We discover that in a certain range of the taper strength, the density modulation (bunching) at saturation is practically the same as in the case of non-tapered undulator while the power of linearly polarized radiation is suppressed by orders of magnitude. Then strongly modulated electron beam radiates at full power in the afterburner. Considering SASE3 undulator of the European XFEL as a practical example, we demonstrate that soft X-ray radiation pulses with peak power in excess of 100 GW and an ultimately high degree of circular polarization can be produced.

Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation, harmonic lasing in a high-gain FEL can provide much more intense, stable, and narrow-band FEL beam which is easier to handle if the fundamental is suppressed. We perform a parametrization of the solution of eigenvalue equation for lasing at odd harmonics, and present explicit expression for FEL gain length, taking into account all essential effects. We propose and discuss methods for suppression of the fundamental. We also suggest a combined use of harmonic lasing and lasing at the retuned fundamental wavelength in order to reduce bandwidth and to increase brilliance of X-ray beam. We discover that in a part of the parameter space, corresponding to the operating range of soft X-ray beamlines of X-ray FEL facilities, harmonics can grow faster than the fundamental. We suggest that harmonic lasing can be widely used in the existing or planned X-ray FEL facilities. LCLS after a minor modification can lase at the 3rd harmonic up to the photon energy of 25-30 keV providing multi-gigawatt power level. At the European XFEL the harmonic lasing would allow to extend operating range up to 100 keV, to reduce bandwidth and increase brilliance.

Analysis of Operation of Harmonic Lasing Self-seeded FEL

Harmonic lasing self-seeded FEL holds great potential for significant improvement of the the longitudinal coherence of the radiation. A gap-tunable undulator is divided into two parts by setting two different undulator parameters such that the first part is tuned to a sub-harmonic of the second part. Harmonic lasing occurs in the exponential gain regime in the first part of the undulator, also the fundamental stays well below saturation. In the second part of the undulator the fundamental mode is resonant to the wavelength, previously amplified as the harmonic. The amplification process proceeds in the fundamental mode up to saturation. In this case the bandwidth is defined by the harmonic lasing (i.e. it is reduced by a significant factor depending on harmonic number) but the saturation power is still as high as in the reference case of lasing at the fundamental in the whole undulator, i.e. the spectral brightness increases. Application of the undulator tapering in the deep nonlinear regime would allow to generate higher peak powers approaching TW level. The scheme is illustrated with the parameters of the European XFEL.

We present the results of the studies of coherence properties of the radiation from FLASH for fundamental harmonic and higher odd harmonics. General overview of the parameter space is performed including peak current, emittance, and external focusing. The results of our studies show that present configuration of FLASH free electron laser is not optimal for providing ultimate quality of the output radiation. We find that the physical origin of the problem is mode degeneration. The way for improving quality of the radiation is proposed.

The efficient reduction of the pulse length and the energy width of electron beams plays a crucial role in the generation of short pulses in the range of sub-picoseconds at future light sources. At the radiation source ELBE in Dresden Rossendorf short pulses are required for coherent THz generation and laser-electron beam interaction experiments such as X-ray Thomson scattering. Energy dechirping can be carried out passively by wakefields generated when the electron beam passes through suitable structures, namely corrugated and dielectrically lined cylindrical pipes or dielectrically lined rectangular waveguides (*,**,***). All structures offer the possibility to tune the resulting wakefield and therefore the resulting energy chirp through a variation of purely geometrical or material parameters. In this paper we present a semi-analytical approach to determine the wakefield in dielectrically lined rectangular waveguide, starting with the expression of the electric field in terms of the structure's eigenmodes.

FERMI, the seeded Free Electron Laser (FEL) located at the Elettra laboratory in Trieste, Italy, consists of two FEL lines. The FEL-1 facility, covering the wavelength range between 20 and 100 nm, was officially opened to external users. The shorter wavelength range, between 20 and 4 nm, is covered by the FEL-2 line, a double stage cascade operating in the “fresh bunch injection” mode, which is still under commissioning. We will report on the different FEL-1 operation modes that can be offered for users and assess the performance of the facility. The progress in the commissioning of FEL-2 will then be addressed, in particular reporting the performance attained at the lower wavelength limit; this aspect is of great interest for the user’s community of the FERMI seeded FEL since it allows to carry out experiments below the carbon K-edge.

A self-seeded XFEL system using a transmitted beam under Bragg diffraction has been developed at the first compact XFEL facility SACLA in order to generate a brilliant single-mode XFEL with high temporal coherence. High stability and unique beam characteristics of SACLA should significantly contribute to achieve reliable, high-quality seeded XFEL operation. In particular, the short-pulse property that has been achieved in routine operation enables us to switch SASE and seeded mode quickly, without changing the electron beam parameters. This is also useful for delivering different modes to multiple beamlines simultaneously. In the test experiments carried out in autumn 2013, spectral narrowing was observed at 10 keV using diamond 400 reflection. Systematic optimization on beam properties is now in progress towards experimental use of seeded XFELs in summer 2014. This talk gives the overview of the plan, achieved results and ongoing R&D.

The detector of a FEL-THz source at HUST is now in the physical design stage. The electro-optic (EO) sampling method will be employed for the coherent detection. The performances of three widely used EO crystals will be evaluated and compared numerically in the time domain detection: zinc telluride (ZnTe), gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium phosphide (GaP). The phase matching properties are analyzed to find the appropriate probe wavelength. The EO detection response is calculated to select the suitable crystal thickness and to discuss the detection ability of each crystal.

Control of microbunching instability is a fundamental requirement in modern high brightness electron linacs, in order to prevent malfunction of beam optical diagnostics and contamination in the generation of coherent radiation, such as free electron lasers. We present experimental control and suppression of microbunching instability-induced optical transition radiation by means of particles’ longitudinal phase mixing in a magnetic chicane*. In presence of phase mixing, the intensity of the beam-emitted coherent optical transition radiation is reduced by one order of magnitude and brought to the same level provided, alternatively, by beam heating. The experimental results are in agreement with particle tracking and analytical evaluations of the instability gain. A discussion of applications of magnetic phase mixing to the generation of quasi-cold high-brightness ultra-relativistic electron beams is finally given.

The PAL-XFEL, a 0.1-nm hard X-ray FEL facility consisting of a 10-GeV S-band linac, is being constructed in Pohang, South Korea. The installation of linac, undulator, and beam line will be completed by 2015. Its building construction is at its peak moment to be completed by December 2014. The major procurement contract was made in 2013 for the critical components of S-band linac modules and hard X-ray undulators. The commissioning will start in January 2016. We hope the first lasing will be achieved in early 2016.

PAL-XFEL is designed to generate 1 – 0.06-nm FEL in hard x-ray FEL line. The linac for hard x-ray generates 10-GeV, 200-pC, and 3-kA electron beam. It consists of accelerating columns, three bunch compressors, an X-band linearizer, and dog-leg line. We conduct ELEGANT simulations to obtain the optimized lattice for hard x-ray line. The candidates of the optimized lattice are obtained by Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) whose objectives are the FEL saturation power and length. These are evaluated with their error tolerances. Error tolerances are obtained by two methods of error simulations. First, the linear interpolation method is conducted in order to determine the machine tolerance. Also, we find out the dominant machine parameters to increase the beam jitter by this method. Second, the error simulations with random errors of machine parameters are conducted to verify the results of the linear interpolation method and calculate beam jittering levels. In this paper, we present the details of the optimized linac lattice for hard x-ray FEL. Also, we present the procedure of the linac lattice optimization.

Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) built a PAL-ITF at the end of 2012 to successfully complete PAL-XFEL in 2015. The PAL-ITF is equipped with various kinds of diagnostic equipment to produce high-quality electron bunches. An ICT and a Turbo-ICT were installed in the PAL-ITF. A Faraday Cup is installed at the end of the linear accelerator. These days, the quantity of electric charge occasionally is measured using a BPM Sum value. This paper focuses on the processes and results of electric charge quantity measurements using ICT, Turbo-ICT, FC and BPM. The PAL-ITF is equipped with Stripline-BPM. It is important to find a way to minimize measurement errors that can appear in the process of installing or measuring the BPM. For this, PAL-ITF separately measured the BPM electrode sensitivity and minimized BPM measurement errors through generally calibrating BPM devices by applying Lambertson's Method. A plan was made to minimize BPM measurement errors through applying the BPM electrical calibration method for BPM devices to be used by the PAL-XFEL. This paper examines the processes for checking the performance of the S-BPM installed in the PAL-ITF and the results of its measurements.

The JINR develops a project of superconducting linear accelerator complex, based on a superconducting linear accelerator, for applications in nanoindustry, mainly for extreme ultraviolet lithography at a wavelength of 13.5 nm using kW-scale Free Electron Laser (FEL) light source. The application of kW-scale FEL source permits realizing EUV lithography with 22 nm, 16 nm resolutions and beyond. JINR-IAP collaboration constructed powerful laser driver applied for photoinjector of FEL linear accelerator which can be used for EUV lithography. To provide FEL kW-scale EUV radiation the photoinjector laser driver should provide a high macropulse repetition rate of 10 Hz, a long macropulse time duration of 0.8 ms and 8000 pulses per macropulse. The laser driver operates at wavelength of 260-266 nm on forth harmonic in the mode locking on base of Nd ions or Yb ions The laser driver micropulse energy of 1.6 uJ should provide formation of electron beam in FEL photoinjector with the bunch charge about 1 nC.

In a free-electron laser (FEL), the technique of wiggler tapering enables the sustained growth of radiation power beyond the initial saturation. With the goal to develop an X-ray FEL in the terawatt power regime, it is important to utilize this technique and optimize the taper profile, giving the wiggler parameter as a function of the distance along the wiggler line. This work examines two methods of optimization, which are based on the theoretical analysis by Kroll, Morton and Rosenbluth (KMR). Using the numerical simulation code GENESIS, the methods are applied to a case for the possible future FEL at the MAX IV Laboratory in Lund, Sweden, as well as a case for the LCLS-II.

We describe the technical layout and report the status of the installation of the undulator, optical and vacuum systems of the laser heater for the EUXFEL. The laser heater is a device to increase the overall X-ray brightness stability. This is achieved by an optical laser system which induce an additional momentum spread in the electron bunches to reduce micro-bunching instabilities.

Within last decade a linear accelerating structure with an average loaded gradient of 100 MV/m at 12 GHz has been demonstrated in the CLIC study. Recently, it has been proposed to use the CLIC structure to drive an FEL linac. In contrast to CLIC the linac would be powered by klystrons not by a drive beam. The main advantage of this proposal is achieving the required energies in a very short distance, thus the facility would be rather compact. In this study, we present the conceptual design parameters of a facility which could generate laser photon pulses covering the range of 1-75 Angstrom. Shorter wavelengths could also be reached with slightly increasing the energy.

The Turkish Accelerator and Radiation Laboratory in Ankara (TARLA) will operate two InfraRed Free Electron Lasers (IR-FEL) covering the range of 3-250 microns. The facility will consist of an injector fed by a thermionic triode gun with two-stage RF bunch compression, two superconducting accelerating ELBE modules operating at continuous wave (CW) mode and two independent optical resonator systems with different undulator period lengths. The electron beam will also be used to generate Bremsstrahlung radiation. In this paper, we discuss design goals of the project and present status and road map of the project.

Turkish Accelerator Center (TAC) Project has started with support of the Ministry of Development (MD) of Turkey under the coordination of Ankara University. TAC is an inter-university collaboration with 12 Turkish Universities. An IR FEL facility (TARLA) based on Sc linac with 15-40 MeV energy under construction in Ankara as the first facility of TAC. It is expected that the TARLA facility will be commissioning in 2017. In addition to the TARLA, it is planned that Turkish Accelerator Center will include a third generation synchrotron radiation facility based on 1-3 GeV electron synchrotron (TAC SR), a fourth generation SASE FEL facility based on up to 5 GeV electron linac (TAC SASE FEL), a multi-purpose proton accelerator facility with 3 MeV-2 GeV beam energy (TAC PAF) and an electron-positron collider as a super charm factory (TAC PF). Construction phase of the proposed GeV scale accelerator facilities will cover next decade. In this presentation, main goals and road map of Turkish Accelerator Center will be explained.

The drive-beam linac which is required for generation RF power at Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) has to accelerate an electron beam with 8.4 nC per bunch up to 2.4 GeV in almost fully loaded structures. The required beam stability in both transverse and longitudinal directions are of concern for such a high bunch charge. We present different bunch compressor designs for the Drive Beam and compare their performance including the effects beam energy and phase jitters.

The next step towards the full CLARA facility is installation of the CLARA front end to comprise a 2m S-band linac section after the photoinjector gun. This will be suitable for both the velocity bunching and standard booster modes of CLARA. An S-bend will also be installed to deflect the beam into the current VELA line, enabling delivery of higher energy beams to two existing user areas. The current photoinjector beam diagnostics section can then be used to test a High Repetition Rate electron gun currently under development. We describe the proposed CLARA front end design. We define two beam dynamics working points for CLARA, one working point for sending beam from the CLARA Front End to VELA, and one working point to feed an interim user station prior to CLARA full construction in the straight-on position.

Producing high-quality x rays could have important applications to high-precision medical imaging and national security. Inverse Compton scattering involving the head-on collision of a relativistic electron bunch with a high-power laser offers a viable path toward the realization of a compact x-ray source. A method consisting in reflecting a short-pulse laser onto a “relativistic mirror” (a moving thin sheet of electrons) has been proposed and recently demonstrated as a way to enhance the back-scattered photon flux by operating in the coherent regime. In this contribution we present particle-in-cell numerical simulations of the inverse Compton scattering process and especially investigate the impact of the laser-pulse and electron-beam distributions that could substantially improve the x-ray production via coherent emission.

The LCLS-II project is a high repetition rate, high average brightness free-electron laser based on the existing facilities at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The LCLS-II will be driven by a new CW superconducting RF (SCRF) 4-GeV linac replacing the existing Cu-linac in the 1st km of the linac tunnel. The SCRF linac will include chicanes for providing full compression of the electron bunch length. After the linac, the electron beam will be directed into the existing 2-km bypass line connecting to the Beam Switch Yard (BSY), where a new spreader system will allow a high rate bunch-by-bunch deflection into the hard X-ray (HXR) or soft X-ray (SXR) transport lines, or towards the BSY high power dump. The HXR line will include a new variable gap undulator replacing the existing LCLS-I undulator and will reuse the existing LCLS-I linac-to-undulator and dump transport lines. The SXR will require a new transport line sharing the same tunnel with the HXR and will include a new variable gap undulator. Overview of the electron beam transport and the optics design are presented.

The beam stability of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) has seen many improvements over the years and has matured to a state where progress is slow and maintaining the best stability is becoming the main challenge. Single sources which are identified by various means contribute to only about 10 to 20% of the whole jitter power, meaning that their elimination gives only a small improvement of 5 to 10%. New sources need to be identified fast. Especially slow variations of a few seconds to minutes time scale are often hidden and partially corrected by feedback systems. A few episodes of increased jitter have shown the limitations of some of the feedback systems. Stability for all dimensions, transverse, longitudinal, and intensity are presented.

We study the effect of longitudinal space charge on the correlated energy spread of a relativistic beam that has been microbunched for the emission of high harmonic radiation. We show that, in the case of microbunching induced by a laser modulator followed by a dispersive chicane, longitudinal space charge forces can act to significantly reduce the induced energy spread of the beam without a reduction in the harmonic bunching content. This effect may significantly relax constraints on the harmonic number achievable in HGHG FELs, which are otherwise limited by the induced energy spread from the laser.

High-gain FEL is one of many electron-beam instabilities, which have a number of common features linking the shot noise, the amplification and the saturation. In this paper we present a new, model-independent description of the interplay between these effects and derivation of a simple formula determining the saturation and maximum attainable gain in such instabilities. Application of this model-independent formula to FEL is compared with FEL theory and simulations. We describe limitations resulting from these finding for FEL amplifiers used for seeded FELs and for Coherent electron Cooling.

In the framework of quantum theory, we consider the condition for radiation maximum shift between harmonics of SR spectrum for scalar and spinor particles. Since quantum spectrum is discrete and finite, one can find values of radiation parameters such that the maximum in radiation spectrum stays at highest harmonic. It turns out that there exists a "quantization" of magnetic field associated with shift of maximum from one harmonic to another.

Molybdenum can be used as a substrate for the bi-alkali antimonide photocathodes utilized for the generation of high brightness electron beams in a superconducting radio frequency (SRF) photoinjector cavities. Operation at high field strength is required to obtain a low emittance beam, thus increasing the probability of field emission (FE) from the cathode surface. Usually, substrates are heated in situ before alkali de- position to remove oxide layers from the surface. FE on Mo substrates was measured by means of a field emission scanning microscope (FESM). It turned out that in situ heat treatment (HT) of the Mo surface significantly changes the FE behaviour by activation of new emitters. For a better understanding of the mechanism for enhanced emission after in situ heating a witness Mo sample was investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

The Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen Site (PITZ) characterizes and optimizes high brightness electron sources for FLASH and the European XFEL. At nominal conditions the electron bunches are created from a photocathode laser with flat-top temporal distribution and sharp rise and fall times. Beam dynamics simulations using a 3D ellipsoidal cathode laser shape yielded to a significant improvement of the electron beam quality compared to the traditionally used cylindrically shaped beams. The 3D ellipsoidal laser system is under development at the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) and will be used at PITZ soon, to create high quality electron beams. The recent studies of electron beam simulations at PITZ have been devoted to the position optimization of the second accelerating cavity for the 3D ellipsoidal laser profile. Electron beam properties were compared for cylindrical and 3D ellipsoidal beams applying default and optimized booster positions. Beam tolerance studies revealed much better injector performance for the 3D ellipsoidal laser profile case with the optimized booster position. The outcome of such investigations is presented and discussed in this contribution.

Recently three RF guns were prepared at the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY, location Zeuthen (PITZ) for their subsequent operation at FLASH and the European XFEL. The gun 3.1 is a previous cavity design and is currently installed and operated at FLASH, the other two guns 4.3 and 4.4 were of the current cavity design and are dedicated to serve for the start-up of the European XFEL photo-injector. All three cavities had been dry-ice-cleaned prior their conditioning and hence showed low dark current levels. The lowest dark current level – as low as 60μA at 65MV/m field amplitude – has been observed for the gun 3.1. This paper reports in details about the conditioning process of the most recent gun 4.4. It informs about experience gained at PITZ during establishing of the RF conditioning procedure and provides a comparison with the other gun cavities in terms of the dark currents. It also summarizes the major setup upgrades, which have affected the conditioning processes of the cavities.

We present a program for the design and construction of a thermionic cathode RF gun to produce bright electron beams, consisting in the first step toward the possible development of S band linac based pre-injector at Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF). The program is aimed at the goal to attain a beam quality as requested by ILSF. As a first step within this mainstream, we are currently developing a thermionic cathode side coupling RF electron gun which is expected to deliver 100 pC bunches with emittances below 2 mm-mrad at 2.5 MeV. We report the performed simulation and design activity, as well as cold test results of first fabricated prototype, which are in good agreement with simulation results.

The Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF) RF system was conceptually designed based on ILSF requirements for a 3GeV storage ring and 400 mA beam current at 500 MHz RF frequency. The development of HOM damped cavity with simpler structure at 100MHz and advantages of reducing frequency as investigated at MAX Lab, provided an alternative of 100MHz RF system to be explored for ILSF. RF frequency change and its effects on the beam and machine parameters as well as the availability and cost of RF system components have been studied for ILSF. The conceptual design of a 100MHz RF system and the comparison between 500 MHz and 100 MHz RF frequencies are presented in this report. This paper, furthermore, provides details about the 100MHz RF cavity designed by ILSF RF group based on MAX Lab cavity.

A driver linac based on a photocathode RF gun injector system for a proposed free electron laser facility at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan is under study. This facility is designed to be operated in two modes, one for the VUV application and one for the THz application to fulfil the user needs. Generally the VUV radiation prefers a low emittance, high peak current beam free from collective instability during acceleration and magnetic pulse compression, whereas the THz radiation needs a moderate charge in hundred femtosecond bunch length free from space charge degradation in a transport line. In this paper, the schemes of bunch compression as well as the strategy to optimize and control of the beam quality will be presented.

A high brightness photo-injector is under development for single pass FEL research at NSRRC. The gun test facility (GTF) equipped with a photocathode rf gun a compensation solenoid, a S-band high power pulse klystron as well as a UV driver laser has been constructed for testing the photocathode rf gun. The gun is fabricated in house and being tested at the GTF. Since the transverse emittance is a key property of the electron beam from the rf gun, multi-slit method is used to characterize the transverse emittance of the electron beam. Another key property of the electron beam is bunch length. An S-band three-cell deflecting cavity is designed to measure the bunch length. The setup and results of emittance measurement as well as the structure design of the deflecting cavity is reported in this contribution.

A free electron laser (FEL) facility aimed for VUV and THz radiation is being studied at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan. Strong consideration has been given to minimize the cost by making maximum use of existing hardware at NSRRC. One unique consideration is to use an existing undulator for the dual functions of the THz radiator and the modulator of a HGHG section. Design emphasizes versatility of operation and beam quality control and compensation of nonlinearities, with a vision that it will allow as much as possible future upgrades as well as later R&D of FEL physics. The polarization control of the THz radiation provides novel application for the users. The facility is to be housed in the existing 38-m by 5-m tunnel of the TPS Linac Test Laboratory.

As part of the design of CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications), the proposed UK FEL test facility at Daresbury Laboratory, a high repetition rate S-band photoinjector RF gun is being developed. This gun will be able to operate at up to 400 Hz repetition rate in single bunch mode. We present the initial cavity design including its optimisation for the beam dynamics of CLARA. We also present the initial cooling design for the cavity which will enable the high repetition rates to be achieved.

A user facility VELA (Versatile Electron Linear Accelerator) based on an RF photoinjector has been commissioned at Daresbury Laboratory in April 2013, providing beam to first users in September 2013. Machine study runs in 2013-2014 have concentrated on characterisation of main beam parameters like bunch charge, its momentum, beam emittance and dependence of these parameters on the launching RF phase. Major efforts have been also concentrated on investigation of the dark current from the gun and its dependence on the RF amplitude. Significant time has been dedicated to investigation of relative stability of LLRF and drive laser having significant impact on the overall machine stability. We present here the results of these studies.

We present our first measurements of trapped ions in the Cornell energy recovery linac (ERL) photoinjector. During high intensity operation, ions become trapped inside of the electric potential generated by the electron beam and oscillate transversely with a characteristic frequency. At high beam currents, electron beam-ion interactions result in excessive radiation, primarily due to beam losses and bremsstrahlung. However, by shaking the beam at the trapped ion's oscillation frequency, we are able to drive a resonance that severely reduces or eliminates this radiation. This both confirms the viability of beam shaking as an ion mitigation strategy inside high intensity injectors, and allows us to measure the trapped ion oscillation frequencies indirectly. Experimental data for a beam energy of 5 MeV, a bunch repetition rate of 1.3 GHz, and beam currents up to 20 mA, as well as simulations to describe our data and the beam shaking principle are presented.

The design of an electron beam Final Focus System (FFS) aiming for high-flux laser-Thomson backscattering x-ray sources at ELBE* is presented. A telescope system consisting of four permanent magnet based quadrupoles was found to have significantly less chromatic aberrations than a quadrupole triplet. This allows sub-ps electron beam focusing to match the laser spot size at the interaction point. Focusing properties like the position of the focal plane and the spot size are retained for electron beam energies between 20 and 30 MeV by adjusting the position of the quadrupoles individually on a motorized stage. Since the electron beam is chirped for bunch compression upstream, the rms energy spread is increased to one or two percent and second order chromatic effects must be taken into account. For an emittance of 13 pi mm mrad, we predict rms spot sizes of about 40 um and divergences of about 15 mrad. We also present the design of the permanent magnet quadrupoles to be used for the FFS. Ferromagnetic poles ensure a high field quality and adjustable shunts allow for fine adjustment of the field strength and compensation of deviations in the permanent magnet material.

Estimation of Systematic Errors for Deuteron Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) Search at a Storage Ring

An experimental method which is aimed to find a permanent EDM of a charged particle was proposed by JEDI (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) collaboration in 2012*. EDMs can be observed by their small influence on spin motion. The only possible way to perform a direct measurement is to use a storage ring. For this purpose it was decided to carry out the first precursor experiment at the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY). Since the EDM of a particle violates CP invariance and is expected to be tiny, treatment of all various sources of systematic errors should be done with a great level of precision. One should clearly understand how misalignments of the magnets affects the beam and the spin motion. In reality, one of the methods to investigate spin behavior in the presence of misalignments in a storage ring is to mimic their influence on the beam parameters using small orbit kicks with different amplitudes. In this talk the first simulations of orbit excitations will be discussed. The corresponding spin tune shifts will be considered. The influence of the distorted orbit on the polarization build-up caused by the EDM will be examined.

The SIS100 accelerator will be built within the first realisation phase of the FAIR project. The series production of its superconducting bending magnets was started without any test model in 2013. This time saving strategy requires a careful investigation of the magnetic field quality for the first manufactured dipole. The consequences of the curved magnet design was analysed developing advanced multipoles for elliptical and toroidal magnet geometries. We present the theoretical results together with measured data obtained for the first of series dipole. A description of the rotating coil probe based measurement method will be given together with the achieved field quality as well as an estimation of the limits of the chosen field representation and its beam dynamics interpretation.

Numerical noise in PIC codes produces artifacts which affects long term beam simulations needed for accelerator as the SIS100. A detailed study on the effect of numerical noise occurring in multi-particle tracking codes is presented. The influence of the granularity of particle distributions and the fineness of the meshes of Poisson solvers on the particle dynamics was studied. These results are used to discuss the effect of the PIC numerical noise in a long term space charge benchmarking study.

Besides heavy ion operation, the heavy ion synchrotron SIS-100 will accelerate a single proton bunch of N=2*1013 particles up to the energy E=29 GeV. For the present standard scenario, optics settings have been developed which provide a transition energy according to gammatr=45.5 in order to avoid transition crossing during acceleration. At extraction energy the corresponding nonlinear momentum compaction and phase slip factors cause the formation of a so called alpha bucket. In this contribution we present the results of transverse beam loss tracking studies in the alpha bucket regime. The effects of momentum spread, magnet errors and residual closed orbit distortion are analyzed.

We present studies on the transverse baseband Beam Transfer Functions (BTFs) in bunched beams at high energies. The goal of the work is to evaluate whether transverse BTFs can be used to diagnose the tune spread arising from transverse nonlinearities such as the beam-beam effect and space charge. We employ an analytic expression to the BTFs of beams under a transverse nonlinear lens arising from a bi-Gaussian charge distribution. We obtain agreement between a simulation model of an electron-lens like configuration and the analytic results. The tune spread for this scenario can be recovered by means of a fit against the analytic expectation. The results are compared with measurements where the beam-beam effect acts as a substitute for the electron lens. A similar behaviour of the BTF is observed. This allows the conclusion that the transverse BTF can be used to diagnose tune spread from an electron-lens. Finally we discuss the problems that arise when trying to recover the tune spread from BTFs of arbitrary non-Gaussian beams and in the presence of coherent beam-beam modes.

We summarize our recent work on spin motion in storage rings *. In fact we return to our study ** of spin motion in storage rings. We again focus on spin tunes, polarization fields etc. but in contrast to ** we base the description on one turn maps and refine and expand our toolset from that in * by using a rather modern method from Dynamical-Systems theory, developed in the 1980's by R. Zimmer and others based on bundles **, ***. With this we obtain new insights into invariant spin fields, invariant frame fields, spin tunes and spin-orbit resonances. At the same time we get a unified way to treat spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles. The bundle aspect is pointed out and we briefly mention the relation to Yang-Mills Theory as well.

This article analyzes possible limitations in the method to search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) using polarized particles in a storage ring. It is well known that for detection of the electric dipole moment one needs to create such conditions where the particle's spin oscillations can be caused only by the EDM. Really, there are two possible methods for EDM search using a storage ring: resonant spin buildup in a magnetostatic ring and “frozen” spin method in an electrostatic ring with “magic” energy. Both methods have common limitations caused by spin decoherence. In the frame of self consistent theory the reasons of the spin decoherence are classified independently on method and discussed taking into consideration multipole components of external fields, as well as the nonlinearities of RF fields.

The idea of resonant spin oscillation method was modernized and improved in Forschungszentrum Julich in the proposed experiment at the COSY ring. The resonant method is based on spin tune parameterization using transverse RF magnetic or/and electric field. The spin orientation smearing due to the finite spin coherence time (SCT) plays a crucial in the proposed experiment to search for the electric dipole moment. Our analysis is based on the T-BMT differential equations for spin together with shorten motion equations. Using well developed theory of Mathieu's differential equations we have got simplified analytic solution for prediction of spin behavior. In this paper we have numerically evaluated all effects having fundamental contributions from our point of view.

An intense Gaussian laser beam, propagating through a magnetized plasma, becomes self-focused due to the ponderomotive force on the electrons. The magnetic field reduces the radius of the laser beam and enhances the self focusing of the laser beam. The self-sustained plasma channel can affect the efficiency of harmonic generation of the interacting laser beam. The radial density gradient of the channel beats with the oscillatory electron velocity to produce density perturbation at laser frequency. The ponderomotive force at second-harmonic frequency produces electrons density oscillations that beat with the oscillatory velocity to create a non-linear current, driving the third harmonic radiation. The velocity and density perturbation associated with the self-focused laser beam generates a nonlinear current at triple fold frequency of the fundamental laser. Our results show that the efficiency of third-harmonic generation of the laser beam is affected significantly due to the self-sustained plasma channel. The strength of magnetic field play a crucial role in efficiency enhancement of third-harmonic generation.

In electron storage ring a temporal perturbation to the beam makes spatial structure in a bunch, which emit short X-ray or coherent THz radiation. For this technique of bunch shape manipulation, it is important to reduce unwanted de-coherence of betatron motion, which would break the intended spatial structure. At NewSUBARU, 1.5 GeV storage ring, we kicked the beam using a vertical fast kicker and investigated the de-coherence of betetron oscillation using mainly a dual-sweep streak camera. The largest is the Landau damping by a well-known chromatic tune spread, although the phase spread comes back to zero at after a synchrotron oscillation period. On the other hand, there exists several non-linear effects, which makes accumulation of the oscillation phase spread. These are, horizontal betatron amplitude dependent vertical tune shift, synchrotron oscillation amplitude dependent synchrotron tune shift, non-linear chromaticity, synchrotron oscillation chromaticity (non-symmetry of rf bucket), longitudinal radiation excitation process, and others. The tuning knobs we had was some sets of non-linear magnets up to octupole and the rf voltage.

May 2013 we lowered the emittance of the SPring-8 storage ring from 3.5 nm¥cdotrad to 2.4 nm¥cdotrad to enhance the brilliance. At the optics change the momentum acceptance shrunk from 3.2 ¥% to 2.4 ¥%. Then, by carefully correcting the second order dispersion, we recovered the momentum acceptance up to 2.8 ¥%, which results in doubling the Touschek beam lifetime. Although the injection efficiency decreased by more than 10 ¥% by the dispersion correction, we restored it by means of suppressing the amplitude dependent tune shift. Here we describe these improvements of the nonlinear dynamics of the SPring-8 storage ring.

J-PARC Main Ring has to deliver the proton beam to ‘hadron’ experiments by using ‘slow extraction’ technique, base on the 3rd order horizontal resonance. The spill quality during the full extraction period is one of the most important requirements as well as the beam quality. The computer modeling of the slow extraction process for J-PARC Main Ring is based on a realistic machine model, which includes measured imperfections of the machine in addition to dynamic variation of the machine elements to perform the slow extraction. In frame of this report we represent the results of the modeling the slow extraction process from J-PARC Main Ring by using the PTC-ORBIT combined code. The resonance extraction has been controlled by changing the betatron tune. Control the horizontal emittance of the extracted beam has been performed by using ‘dynamic’ bumps. Control the spill quality of the extracted beam has been performed by using dedicated quadrupole magnets and the transverse RF signal (RF knockout). In addition, the spill quality can be improved by suppressing effect of the power supply ripple. On the request, the collective effects can be introduced into the model.

Simulations concern to a beam axial motion in the IBA cyclotron C230 that is a base facility in several medical centers worldwide. Because of small axial focusing of the beam in a center of the cyclotron the radial component of magnetic field imperfections leads to additional proton losses. Measured maps of the axial and radial components of magnetic field were used in the simulations. It was found that the radial component with value 5-10 G in the center and approximately 2 G in the main region of acceleration leads to decrease of the resulting beam intensity by about two times and to increase the beam axial width by 25% as well. Simulations define the requirements to the experimental radial component shaping for the next cyclotrons of this series. Providing these requirements will ensure an absence of the additional proton losses due to the axial motion perturbations.

One of the important problems in the theory of dynamical systems is to find corresponding (invariants). In this article we are discussing some problems of computing of invariant functions (invariants) for dynamical systems. These invariants can be used for describing of particle beams systems. The suggested method is constructive and based on the matrix formalism for Lie algebraic tools. We discuss two types of invariants: kinematic and dynamic. All calculations can be realized in symbolic forms, in particular, kinematic invariants are based on the theory of representations of Lie algebras (in particular, using the Casimir’s operators). For the case of nonlinear kinematic invariants we propose a recursive scheme, which can be implemented in symbolic forms using instruments of computer algebra (for example, such packages as Maple or Mathematica). The corresponding expressions for invariants can be used to control the correctness of computational experiments, first of all for long time beam dynamics.

Here we present a method for constructing a parametrization of the electric field in the superconducting elliptic cavities of the ESS linac. The parametrization is done by replicating the electric field from measured data using trigonometric and exponential functions. The field generated by the parameters exhibits a mean error of 0.28% ( maximum error of 3.8% and s.t.d. error 1.1%), with the advantage of only taking up a fraction of the required data. The field in the entire cavity is extrapolated by combining the Maxwell equations with the parametrized form of the field. We also present particle simulations based on the parametrization model to showcase some typical accelerator behaviour. Additionally we present a small extension of the parametrization method to also model spoke cavities.

Longitudinal Acceptance Evaluation from Hamiltonian

An RF cavity is designed around a reference particle; if the energy or the phase of a real particle are too far from the reference, the particle is lost. The widest area of energy-phase that allows a particle to be transported by the cavity is called acceptance of the cavity. In simulations the acceptance is evaluated tracking several particles with different energies and phases and marking when a particle is transmitted or lost. This process can be time consuming because of the large amount of tracked particles requested to characterise the cavity acceptance. In this paper we propose an alternative method to evaluate the acceptance studying directly the Hamiltonian associated to the cavity.

In the second part of 2014, the 3GeV linac at the MAX IV laboratory will enter its commissioning stage. Equipped with two guns, the linac will act as a full energy injector for the two storage rings and at the same time provide high brightness pulses to a Short Pulse Facility (SPF). Compression in the linac is done in two double achromats with fixed R56 that relies upon the RF phase introduced energy chirp, which in this case is strongly enhanced by the longitudinal wakefields. Since the longitudinal wakefields plays a major role in the compression and bunch shaping they need to be carefully investigated during the commissioning. In this proceeding we will discuss a measurement technique that will be used during commissioning to characterize the longitudinal wakefields and their precise effects on e.g. the bunch shape and the energy spread. Predictions obtained from particle tracking will be presented.

The MAX IV facility currently under construction in Lund, Sweden will include a 1.5 GeV storage ring. To prevent head-tail instability, the negative natural chromaticities of the MAX IV 1.5 GeV storage ring have been corrected to positive values using sextupole gradients in the focusing quadrupoles along with dedicated sextupole magnets. To allow adjustment of the chromaticity correction, weak correction sextupoles have been inserted into the lattice. A high-chromaticity optics has been developed for the MAX IV 1.5 GeV storage ring in case instability issues arise during commissioning. Two chromatic sextupole families were used to correct the linear chromaticity. The tune footprint was then tailored using the remaining two sextupole families with the goal of maximizing dynamic aperture and Touschek lifetime. This paper describes the recently developed high-chromaticity optics for the MAX IV 1.5 GeV storage ring and discusses performance limitations of the optics constrained by available gradient strength in the sextupoles.

Frequency Maps Analysis (FMA) has been widely used in beam dynamics in order to study dynamical aspects of the particles linear and non-linear motion, such as optics functions distortion, coupling, tune-shift and resonances. In this paper, FMA is employed to explore the dynamics of models of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) storage ring and compare them with measured turn by turn (TxT) position data. In particular, a method is proposed for estimating the momentum spread using synchrotron sidebands of the Fourier spectrum of the TxT data.

The FREIA laboratory is a Facility for REsearch Instrumentation and Accelerator Development at Uppsala University, Sweden constructed recently to develop and test accelerator components. Initially it will develop the RF system for the spoke cavities of the ESS linac and test prototype spoke cavities at nominal RF power. For this purpose we installed a helium liquefaction plant, a versatile horizontal test cryostat and two 352 MHz RF power stations, one based on two tetrodes and the other on solid state technology. Beyond these developments FREIA will house a neutron generator and plans for a THz FEL are under discussion. FREIA is embedded in the Ångström physics, chemistry and engineering campus at Uppsala in close proximity to mechanical workshops, clean room with electron microscopes, tandem accelerator and the biomedical center.

A discharge or RF-breakdown event in a CLIC acceleration structure causes the localized release of gas molecules inside a thin conduction limited system with distributed pumping. We discuss the transient behavior of such a system in the molecular flow regime that allows an analytical solution with the help of Greens functions. They describe the temporal evolution of the gas density and the gas flow ejected from the ends of thin pipes of finite length. Distributed pumping, for example through the HOM damping slits is taken into account.

A key ingredient for the Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE) at the CERN Proton Synchrotron is the beam trapping in stable islands of transverse phase space. In a previous paper a method allowing analytical estimation of the fraction of beam trapped into resonance islands as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters has been presented. Such a method applies to one-degree of freedom models of betatronic motion. In this paper, the analysis is extended to the more realistic and challenging case of two-degree of freedom systems, in which the interplay between the horizontal and vertical motion is fully included. Numerical simulations are presented and the results are discussed in detail.

After the long shut down of 2013-2014, the LHC energy will be pushed toward 7 TeV. In this range of energy, the main magnets will enter a new regime. For this reason, this paper will present a detailed study of the performance of the FiDeL model that could be critical for the operation in 2015. In particular this paper will study the saturation component and its precision in the model, together with the hysteresis error. The effect of these two components and their errors on the beta-beating is also given. Furthermore, an estimate of the dynamic effects visible in the tune and chromaticity will be presented for the 7 TeV operation.

As part of the LHC Injector Upgrade project, the CERN PS Booster will operate at higher injection and extraction energies and with nearly a factor of two increase in beam brightness. In order to better understand the machine’s limitations, a campaign of nonlinear optics measurements from turn-by-turn trajectory measurements is planned for after Long Shutdown 1. The goal of this work is to establish an efficient procedure for implementing a resonance compensation scheme after the machine’s injection energy is increased. The trajectory measurement system is expected initially to require high intensity beam in order to have good position measurement resolution, so understanding space charge effects will be important for optics analysis. We present the results of simulations of driven beam oscillations with space charge effects, and comparison with trial beam trajectory measurements.

At high intensities and at a certain working point an instability develops in the CERN PS Booster, and large coherent transverse oscillations and beam loss occur. The coherent oscillations and beam loss can be effectively controlled with the transverse damper system, but the origin of the instability is not well-understood. Recent measurements with the PSB's new trajectory measurement system have provided some insight into the nature of this instability, and these observations are presented here.

When the betatron tune is an integer in a cyclical accelerator, dipole-field errors can drive the coherent addition of betatron amplitude to the bunch eventually causing particle loss. Transverse integer tune crossing in a linear non-scaling FFAG is inevitable due to finite chromaticity. In EMMA (Electron Machine with Many Applications), as many as 6 integers may be crossed is as little as 6 turns at maximum acceleration over the 10 – 20 MeV energy range. This fast integer tune crossing, of the order 1 integer per turn, was shown to have little effect on the coherent amplitude growth and charge loss rate. Slower acceleration inside an RF bucket in EMMA allowed the experimental exploration of slower integer tune crossing speeds, of the order of a factor ten slower. The effect on the coherent oscillation amplitude was observed and the charge loss at integer tune crossings indicated resonant effects on the bunch. Simulations in Zgoubi allowed a more detailed analysis and the mechanism of slower resonance crossing in a non-scaling FFAG is discussed, including the importance of coupled longitudinal-transverse decoherence on the effective emittance.

An important asset of Fermilab’s Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) is its ability to generate flat beams with high-transverse emittance ratios. In this paper, we present a practical design and simulation of flat beam generation and compression with various bunch charges up to 3.2 nC. Emittance growth within the round-to-flat beam transformer and the impact of low energy compression is discussed in detail. Finally, it is found that the compressed flat beam could provide exciting opportunities in the field of advanced acceleration techniques and accelerator-based light source.

At low energy the AGS lattice is strongly deformed by the two strong helical snakes, required to preserve the polarization. In addition to the complex, highly non-linear field featured by the two snakes, multiple non-linear coupling resonance lines are crossed by the beam in this region. Hence, the use of realistic models for the Siberian snakes is critical for the simulation of the early part of the AGS acceleration cycle. The AGS Zgoubi model uses direct tracking through OPERA field maps of the two snakes. While many processes may be obnoxious to both beam and spin dynamics in this region, it is critical to use a realistic model of the AGS at low energy. This paper presents the current model used and some of the challenges recently faced. We will also compare experimental beam dynamics results to those predicted by the Zgoubi model.

During the early part of the acceleration of polarized protons, due to strong optical deformations of the lattice, the tune cannot be placed in the spin gap and the first two vertical intrinsic resonances are crossed. Recent multiparticle trackings using the Zgoubi code show that the spin resonances around Gg=5 could cause as much as 5% loss of polarization. The slow acceleration rate, the two vertical and two horizontal intrinsic spin resonances can contribute to the depolarization in the region. While in the current scheme only the two horizontal intrinsic resonances are jumped, it was proposed to use the tune jumps system to also accelerate the crossing of the two weak vertical intrinsic resonances and improve the polarization transmission through this region. We show the design of this new tune jumps scheme and the expected polarization gains expected from multiparticles Zgoubi simulations. We also compare experimental measurements of the polarization transmission to the Zgoubi simulations.

The AGS tune jump system consists of two fast quadrupoles used to accelerate the crossing of 82 horizontal intrinsic spin resonances. The fast tune jump of ΔQh=+0.04 within 100 μs imposes perfect localization of each of the 82 resonant conditions. Imperfect timing of the tune jumps results in lower efficiency of the system and lower transmission of the polarization through the AGS acceleration cycle. Investigations during the end of the pp AGS Run13 revealed weaknesses in the energy measurement at high energy, causing less than optimal timing of the tune jumps. A new method based on continuous polarization measurement to determine the energy during the acceleration cycle has been developed. Strong operational constraints were taken into account to provide a convenient system of energy measurement. This is also used to calibrate the usual determination of the energy based on revolution frequency of the beam or measured dipole magnetic field. This paper shows the tools developed and the results of the first tests during the AGS Run 14. Simulations of the expected tune jumps efficiency using the AGS Zgoubi model are also presented and compared to experimental results.

Crossing of horizontal intrinsic resonances is today the main source of polarization losses in the AGS, in its dual partial snakes configuration for polarized proton acceleration. Polarization losses were greatly reduced by the AGS tune jump system. However total polarization transmission through the AGS cycle is not yet achieved, still partially due to the horizontal intrinsic resonances. This paper will explore the effect of optical distortions and different horizontal tunes on the strength of horizontal intrinsic resonances. Various options will be presented and practicability will be addressed. Theoretical model and multiparticle trackings using the Zgoubi code will show the expected polarization gains of different scenarios.

The numerical noise inherent to particle-in-cell simulation of 3D high intensity bunched beams is studied with the TRACEWIN code and compared with the analytical model by Struckmeier (1994). The latter assumes the six-dimensional rms emittance or rms entropy growth can be related to Markov type stochastic processes due to temperature anisotropy and the artificial "collisions" caused by using macro-particles and calculating the space charge effect. Our entropy growth confirms the dependency on bunch temperature anisotropy as predicted by Struckmeier. However, we also find noise generation by the non-Liouvillean effect of the Poisson solver grid, which exists in periodic focusing systems even when local temperature anisotropy is absent - contrary to predictions by Struckmeier's model.

For future light source based on Energy Recovery Linac (ERL), an injector, which consists of a photocathode DC gun and superconducting RF cavities, is a key part to generate a low emittance, short pulse and high bunch charge electron beam. In compact ERL (cERL) which is a test accelerator to develop key technologies for ERL, the generation of low emittance electron beam with 0.1 mm mrad normalized emittance and 390 keV beam energy from the photocathode DC gun, and the acceleration to 5.6 MeV by superconducting cavity, were demonstrated in the first beam commissioning. To keep the high quality in the beam transportation, understanding the beam optics, which is affected by not only the focusing effects due to the gun, solenoid magnets and RF cavities but also space charge effect, is required. In this presentation, we will show that how to measure and correct the focusing effect by experimental method. Using this method, we succeeded in correcting the analytical model to give the good agreement with the measured gun focusing for low charge beam. And, we will show the space charge effect for high bunch charge beam.

Large scale particle tracking is important for the design and optimization of the Radio-frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator. In this paper, we present RFQ simulation results of new parallel software named LOCUS3D, which is developed at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is based on Particle-In-Cell method and calculates three-dimensional space charge field by an efficient parallel fast Fourier transform method. A RFQ accelerator in Tsinghua University is simulated by tracking 100 million macro particles. This RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 50 keV to 3 MeV, with peak beam current of 50 mA. As large number of particles been simulated, more accurate and detailed information have been obtained.

In collisionless approximation the nonlinear dynamics of continuous strong current intense electron beam is investigated. Nonlinear oscillations of the beam radius appear due to self-consistent nonlinear forces. To study these oscillations the model is used that automatically satisfy to Vlasov equation. The oscillations are described by means of Duffing equation. The equilibrium state is shown to exist. The solutions near the equilibrium state are analyzed. The asymptotic character of the solutions is found. Nonlinear beam transverse oscillations lead to filamentation and effective emittance growth. If particle energy dissipation is absent in the beam transportation channel the physical reason of the effective emittance growth is transfer of the part of the beam potential energy to kinetic energy of the particle transverse oscillations.

The injector part of Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) includes 750-keV H− beam transport located upstream of the Drift Tube Linac. Space charge effects play an important role in the beam transport therein. A series of experiments were performed to determine the level of beam space charge neutralization, and time required for neutralization. Measurements performed at different places along the structure indicate significant variation of neutralized space charge beam dynamics along the beamline. Results of measurements were compared with numerical simulations using macroparticle method and envelope equations to determine values of the effective beam current after neutralization, and effective beam emittance, required for beam tuning.

Realistic Modeling of 4-Rod RFQs with CST Studio
3119

RFQ accelerators are usually designed and modeled with standard codes based on electrostatic field approximations. There are recent examples when this approach fails to predict the RFQ performance accurately: for 4-rod RFQs 3D effects near the vane ends can noticeably influence the beam dynamics. The same applies to any RFQ where the quadrupole symmetry is broken, e.g., 4-vane RFQ with windows. We analyzed two 201.25-MHz 4-rod RFQs – one recently commissioned at FNAL and a new design for LANL – using 3D modeling with CST Studio. In both cases the manufacturer CAD RFQ model was imported into CST. The EM analysis with MicroWave Studio (MWS) was followed by beam dynamics modeling with Particle Studio (PS). For the LANL RFQ with duty factor up to 15%, a thermal-stress analysis with ANSYS was also performed. The simulation results for FNAL RFQ helped our Fermilab colleagues fix the low output beam energy. The LANL RFQ design was modified after CST simulations indicated insufficient tuning range and incorrect output energy; the modified version satisfies the design requirements. Our PS results were confirmed by multi-particle beam-dynamics codes that used the MWS-calculated RF fields.

The MYRRHA project currently under development at Mol, Belgium, is an Accelerator Driven System expected to be operational in 2023 with the primary purpose to study the feasibility of efficiently transmuting nuclear waste products into isotopes with much shorter lifetimes. The reactor, which is expected to have a thermal power of ~70 MW, may be operated in subcritical mode when fed by spallation neutrons obtained from a 600 MeV superconducting proton linac hitting a Liquid Pb-Bi eutectic (LBE) target with an average current of 4 mA. The challenging aspect of the MYRRHA linac resides in its very high availability (close to 100%) with a Mean Time Between Failure expected to be higher than 250 hours. This paper presents the strategic approach taken during the design of the linac and its foreseen operation to fulfill this stringent requirement. In particular we will describe the concept of a beam dynamics based control system also called Virtual Accelerator which will be mandatory for the operation of such linac.

The Compton back-scattering based compact X-ray source ThomX is under construction in LAL/IN2P3, CNRS, France. This machine will serve as a demonstrator in producing up to 1013 ph/s for imaging and cultural heritage recovery. The high level applications of the ThomX machine for the future commissioning and operations are being developed using Matlab Middle Layer (MML) which is broadly used in the modern synchrotron light sources. In this article, we report the nearest progresses of high level applications of the ThomX machine, and present the nonlinear response matrices to correct the tune, chromaticity and orbit, and the algorithm to correct the orbit in the transfer line.

The electron stretcher facility ELSA serves external hadron physics experiments with a beam of unpolarized and polarized electrons of up to 3.2 GeV energy. Its in house developed control system is able to provide real time beam diagnostics as well as steering tasks in one homogeneous environment. The existing archive engine, a simple application logging parameter changes to a file storage, was unable to cope with the rising amount of parameter updates per second. Therefore a new storage system based on the non-relational database system hypertable has been introduced. It is capable of storing huge amounts of data to distributed storage systems, thus being able to handle the recording of every parameter change at any given time. The data can be read back with low latency to a newly developed graphical data browser using a C++ interface. This contribution will give details on the setup and performance of the history storage engine on top of hypertable.

Based on the Bunch Phase Timing System (BuTiS)* local analog radio frequency reference signals (RF references) like the particle revolution frequency and their multiple harmonics will be generated. These references are used to control the phase of the accelerator cavities to altering harmonics of the bunch revolution frequency. Delay or phase shifts from the FAIR-Center to references at the BuTiS endpoints are already compensated by the BuTiS receivers. Phase shifts from the RF reference generators to LLRF electronics can be compensated by controlling the output phases of the DDS modules of the RF references. However phase shift delays of multiple harmonics at the same interconnecting electrical path are not identical at the same time. Configurable electronics** manage phase calibration of the RF references to their endpoints. Calibration may depend on frequency and harmonic of the RF reference, aging as well as on thermal effects. The electrical length and impedance of interconnecting cables for phase control loops can be compensated. This is an important feature, in particular if control loops are switched between different harmonic frequencies.

The Frankfurt Neutron Source at the Stern- Gerlach Zentrum (FRANZ) is a multi-purpose facility for experiments related to accelerator development and nuclear astrophysics. A 200 mA proton beam will produce a neutron flux by use of the reaction 7Li(p, n)7Be. To study the reliability and performance of the accelerator an effective and powerful control system will be needed. A small ion source was used for the first performance test of the control system. The design of the control loop algorithm for the High Current proton source will be discussed. Physical data routinely taken by the control system are compared with manual measurements.

The MicroTCA.4 crate standard is a powerful electronic platform for digital and analog signal processing. Besides its hardware modularity, it is the software reliability and flexibility as well as the easy integration into existing software infrastructures that will drive the widespread adoption of this new standard. The DESY MicroTCA.4 User tool kit (MTCA4U) provides drivers, and a C++ API for accessing the MicroTCA.4 devices and interfacing to the control system. The PCIexpress driver is universal for basic access to all devices developed at DESY. Modularity and expandability allow to generate device-specific drivers with a minimum of code, inheriting the functionality of the base driver. A C++ API allows convenient access to all device registers by name, using mapping information which is automatically generated when building the firmware. A graphical user interface allows direct read and write access to the device, including plotting functionality for recorded raw data. Higher level applications will provide callback functions for easy integration into control systems, while keeping the application code independent from the actual control system in use.

We have upgraded the accelerator control network system for SuperKEKB, the upgrade of the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e− collider for the next generation B-factory experiment in Japan. For SuperKEKB, the accelerator control network system with the higher performance of the wider bandwidth data transfer, and more reliable and redundant configuration, is required, to ensure the robust operations under the 40 times higher luminosity. We install the 10 gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) network switches for the wider network bandwidth and optical cables to construct the redundant network. We reconfigure the network design to connect the accelerator control network and the KEK laboratory network to enhance the security. For the beamline construction and the accelerator components maintenance, we install the new wireless network system consists with the Leaky Coaxial (LCX) cable antennas and collinear antennas, which have good radiation hardness of >1MGy, into the 3 km circumference accelerator tunnel. In this paper, we describe the design and current status of the SuperKEKB accelerator control network system.

Power subsystem has been upgraded for energy improvement of the BEPCII Linac. As a result, new control system was in need. This paper proposes the designing and implementation about the power-supply control system. There are 156 sets of power supply in the system, which is divided into 6 parts, according to function. The control system is intended to make operations more convenient and efficient in beam regulation, which provides functions to meet such situations, like single regulation; restore the beam configures from data files; one-button to switch the electronic polarity (E-/E+). What’s more, the software provides a method of slow-change to protect the power supplies, when value change is too steep. Compare to the old system, this new software is more maintainable and extensible. This software is based on Qt, the GUI library for C++, and connects to the control box through the EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System). The whole 156 sets of power supply are controlled by control boxes, which is ARM+FPGA (CPLD)-Structure front-end IO. This control system has assembled in BEPCII LINAC in September, which plays an important part in the following working.

We have measured the beam parameters properly, and also found the RMS matched beam. Now we simulate the matched beam and the mismatched beam using the IMPACT and TraceWin code. We find the simulations can succeed to reproduce the beam profiles without halo for both matched and mismatched beam, but there are some differences for the beam with halo.

The accelerator (ACC) is the first step of the accelerator driven system (ADS). A high power continuous wave ACC is required for ADS applications. An essential aspect of ACC is beam availability. It must be an order of magnitude better than current best systems. High availability is achieved by fault tolerance and redundancy of the ACC. Three factors play a key role here: use of components in a high MTBF regime, parallel and serial redundancy of components, ability to repair failing elements. In terms of ACC controls system (CS) EPICS and Linux is chosen as proven technology. High availability will be achieved through making parts of the CS redundant. Subsystems shall be redundant by design. If failure of a subsystem is detected, pre-defined scenarios should kick-in. System model or "virtual accelerator" can be implemented to predict effects of parameter change, determine required configuration of set points for optimal performance or re-configuration in case of sub-system failure. Implementation of predictive diagnostics can harvest large amount of data created by archiving service. Prediction of failure allows for controlled shutdown as opposed to abrupt stop.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) project is starting the construction of buildings June 2014. When the access to linac tunnel and gallery building is ready, the commissioning of the first sections of the accelerator starts. A proper operation of the machine relies on the services provided by different infrastructure systems (water cooling, electrical power system, ventilation, etc.) These systems will be used long before beam operation starts and need to be operated via the Integrated Control System (ICS) from the Control Room. Due to the number and variety of these systems, their heterogeneous characteristics and the different teams of designers, the integration process into ICS is challenging. Experience in other facilities [2,3] shows that a late integration produces higher maintenance and operation costs, and even impact on the reliability of the machine. This paper presents the strategy developed by two partners, the Controls and Conventional Facilities Division (CF). It is planned to capture the requirements for the interfaces and to ensure an early integration of Infrastructure Systems into the EPICS environment. First results of this approach are shown for some systems.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is an accelerator- driven neutron spallation source. The Integrated Controls Systems (ICS) is responsible for providing control and mon- itoring for all parts of the machine (accelerator, target, neu- tron scattering systems and conventional facilities) [1]. A large number of applications have been identified across all parts of the facility where PLCs will be used: cryogenics, vacuum, water-cooling, power systems, safety and protec- tion systems. The Controls Division at ESS is deploying a PLC Test Bench. The motivation is to evaluate different technologies, to test PLCs and their integration into EPICS, to prototype control systems and use the test bench as PLC software development platform. This report defines the ar- chitecture of this infrastructure. The first stage to procure a first set of hardware and to perform initial tests has already been finished, consisting of a comparison between the per- formance of the s7plc EPICS driver and the Modbus EPICS driver. The results of these tests are discussed and future plans for this infrastructure are presented.

Orbit stability in 100 nm range is essential for a very small emittance synchrotron light source. However, all kinds of vibration source such as cultural noise and technical noise might deleterious the orbit stability. A synchronous data acquisition system is promising to study connection of orbit motion and various vibration related sources. In this report, we present a synchronous data acquisition system which integrates the measurement of beam position and vibration and then this system will deploy for the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). To test the applicability of the system, systematic study orbit motion caused by vibration using this system was performed at Taiwan Light Source (TLS). Preliminary results will summary in this report.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is being constructed at the campus of the NSRRC (National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center) and commissioning expected in 2014. In order to prevent damage to accelerator components induced by various events, a global machine protection system (MPS) was installed and implemented. The MPS collect interlocks and beam dump requests from various system (thermo/flow of magnets, front-end, vacuum system, and orbit excursion interlock), perform decision, transmit dump beam request to E-Gun or RF system. The PLC based system with embedded EPICS IOC was used as a slow MPS which can delivery less than 8 msec reaction time. The fast MPS was dependent on event based timing system to deliver response time less than 5 μs. Trigger signal for post-mortem will also be distributed by the fast MPS. To ensure alive of the system, several self-diagnostics mechanisms include heartbeat and transient capture were implemented and tested. The MPS architecture, installation, and validation test results were presented in this report.

With the installation and commissioning of the third accelerating cryomodule in summer of 2014 the first phase of the radioactive ion beams postaccelerator ReA at National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) will be completed. ReA was integrated in 2013 into the Coupled Cyclotron Facility providing unique low-energy rare isotope beams. After the fast rare isotopes are stopped in a gas stopping system, mass separated and their charge state boosted in an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT), the ions are reaccelerated in a compact superconducting (SC) LINAC. For rare isotope operations, the LINAC is pre-tuned using stable pilot beams with a similar mass to charge ratio as the rare isotope beams and consequently the system is scaled. Scaling steps of up to 5\% are needed to change to the radioactive beams. To preserve the stringent beam characteristic on the experimental end station a precise online model is required. We will present the status of this online model.

Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has defined a signature science facility Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes (MaRIE) that builds on the existing Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) facility to provide unique experimental tools to develop next-generation materials that will perform predictably and on demand for currently unattainable lifetimes in extreme environments. At its core a new 42 keV XFEL will be coupled with a MW class proton accelerator. While the larger MaRIE project is working on a pre-conceptual design a smaller LANL team is working on an injector test-stand to be constructed at LANL in the course of preparation for MaRIE. The test stand will consist of a photo injector and an initial accelerating section with a bunch compression section. The goal of this facility will be to carry out studies that will determine optimal design parameters for the prototype injector, and to facilitate a direct demonstration of the required beam characteristics for MaRIE. This paper will give a brief overview of the proposed MaRIE facility and present the conceptual design for the injector test stand with the focus on the instrumentation and control system.
