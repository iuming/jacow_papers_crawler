An experiment to measure the Coherent Smith-Purcell radiation has been installed in the SOLEIL Linac. Its aim is to produce a map of Smith-Purcell radiation emissions in several planes and compare it with theoretical predictions. Coherent Smith Purcell radiation is produced when a grating is brought close from a sufficiently short charged particles beam. The experiment consist of two detectors with 5 degrees of freedom. These two detectors can be moved around the emission point to measure the intensity of the radiation at different locations. Radiation maps are recorded parasitically by moving the detectors around during normal linac operations.

Smith-Purcell radiation and Transition Radiation are two radiative phenomenon that occur in charged particles accelerators. For both the emission can be significantly enhanced with sufficiently short pulses and both can be used to measure the form factor of the pulse. We compare the yield of these phenomenon in different configurations and look at their application as bunch length monitors, including background filtering and rejection. We apply these calculations to the specific case of the CLIO Free Electron laser.

Smith-Purcell radiation is used in several applications including the measurement of the longitudinal profile of electron bunches. A correct reconstruction of such profile requires a good understanding of the underlying model. We have compared the leading models of Smith-Purcell radiation and shown that they are in agreement within the experimental errors.

CLIO is a Free Electron Laser based on a thermionic electron gun. In its normal operating mode it delivers electron 8 pulses but studies are ongoing to shorten the pulses to about 1 ps. We report on simulations showing how the pulse can be shortened and the expected signal yield from several bunch length diagnostics (Coherent Transition Radiation, Coherent Smith Purcell Radiation).

The SuperKEKB e+e− collider aims to reach a very high luminosity of 8 1035 cm-2s−1, using highly focused ultra-low emittance bunches colliding every 4ns. Fast luminosity monitoring is required for luminosity feedback and optimisation in presence of dynamic imperfections. The aimed relative precision is about 10-3 in 1ms, which can be in principle achieved thanks to the very large cross-section of the radiative Bhabha process at zero degree scattering angle. Diamond, Cherenkov and scintillator sensors are to be placed just outside the beam pipe, downstream of the interaction point in both rings, at locations with event rates consistent with the aimed precision and small enough backgrounds from single-beam particle losses. The initial configuration installed for the 2016 "phase 1" single beam commissioning will be described, including the sensors, mechanical setup, readout electronics and first stage DAQ. Preliminary measurements and analysis of beam gas Bremsstrahlung loss data collected with the luminosity monitors will be reported and compared with a detailed simulation, for several experimental conditions during the SuperKEKB commissioning.

In this paper, we present experimental and numerical studies of the signals from the Poisson-like distributions resulting from electrons incident on a diamond sensor placed near the exit of the PHIL photoinjector facility at LAL. The experiments were performed at the newly commissioned Low Energy Electron TECHnology (LEETECH) platform at PHIL. Bunches of 10x9 electrons are first generated and accelerated to 3.5 MeV by PHIL. The electrons are then filtered in LEETECH by a system of collimators, using a dipole magnet for momentum selection. The diamond sensor is located immediately after the output collimator to collect electrons in the range 2.5-3 MeV. We show that with standard scCVD diamonds of 500 micrometers thickness, the energy losses from the first three MIP (minimum ionizing particle) electrons are clearly resolved. We did not observe distinguishable peaks in cases when a significant fraction of the incident electrons had energies below a MIP. The described technique can be used as complementary approach for calibration of diamond detectors as well as to diagnose and help control accelerated beams in a regime down to a few particles.

The Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) at KEK is a prototype of the final focus system for the next generation of Future Linear Colliders(FCL). It aims to focus the beams to tens of nanometer transverse sizes and to provide stability at the few nm level. Achieving these goals requires modelling, measuring and suppressing of the transverse beam halo before the interaction point (IP). This paper presents a beam tail/halo generator based on realistic model and the investigation of vertical and horizontal beam tail/halo distribution at ATF2.

For the successful operation of various accelerator facilities a detailed bunch characterization is required. A complete description can be achieved using various diagnostic systems installed along an accelerator beamline. Ideally the diagnostic should be able to measure parameters of a single bunch in a non-destructive manner. For bunch length measurements this results in a complicated task especially for bunch duration below 1 ps. One of the possible solutions is a diagnostic based on the interaction of a low energy electron beam with electro-magnetic fields of the relativistic bunch. The bunch length can be readily deduced from the resulting scatter. In this paper bunch length measurement technique based on a low energy electron beam is introduced. Results of numerical simulations of measurements are presented. A possible setup of such diagnostic system for BERLinPro facility is proposed.

The Electron Stretcher Facility ELSA provides a polarized electron beam with energies of 0.5 - 3.2 GeV for double polarization hadron physics experiments. Monitoring the vertical electron polarization by Compton polarimetry in the stretcher ring has several advantages over the established polarization measurement by Moeller polarimetry. The Compton polarimeter setup presented consists of a 40 W cw disk laser featuring two polarized photon beams colliding head-on with the stored electron beam in ELSA. A silicon strip detector measures the vertical intensity profile of the backscattered photons. The reversal of handedness of the laser beam's circular polarization results in a polarization dependent vertical shift of this profile. From a calibration using time dependent polarization build-up due to the Sokolov-Ternov effect, the polarization degree of the electron beam can be extracted. After recent laser repairs as well as beamline and detector modifications, first measurement attempts of the electron's polarization degree were conducted. The performance of the beamline and first measurements are presented.

A ROtating System for Emittance measurements ROSE, to measure the full 4 dimensional transverse beam matrix of an ion beam has been developed and commissioned. Different ion beams behind the HLI at GSI have been used in two commissioning beam times. All technical aspects of ROSE have been tested, ROSE has been benchmarked against existing emittance scanners for horizontal and vertical projections, and the method, hard-, and software to measure the 4D beam matrix has been upgraded, refined, and successfully commissioned. The inter plane correlations of the HLI beam have been measured, yet as no significant initial correlations were found to be present, controlled coupling of the beam by using a skew triplet has been applied and confirmed with ROSE. The next step is to use ROSE to measure and remove the known inter plane correlations of a uranium beam before SIS18 injection.

The superconducting Darmstadt linear electron accelerator (S-DALINAC) of the Institute for Nuclear Physics at Technische Universität Darmstadt delivers electron beams in cw-mode with energies up to 130 MeV. The accelerator consists of a 10-MeV injector and a 30-MeV main linac where superconducting 3-GHz microwave cavities are operated at a temperature of 2 K for beam acceleration. With three recirculation beamlines the main linac can be used up to four times. To improve the energy spread and the energy stability of the beam a new scrapersystem has been developed and installed. It changes the extraction beam line into a dispersion-conserving chicane consisting of four dipole magnets and three scrapers. The system includes scraping of x- and y-halo in two positions as well as improving and stabilizing energy spread on a dispersive part. We will present the design of the system and report on its installation into the accelerator complex.

Coherent THz pulses induced by a laser-electron interac- tion are routinely produced and observed at DELTA, a 1.5- GeV synchrotron light source operated by the TU Dortmund University. At a dedicated THz beamline, measurements using a Fourier-transform spectrometer have been performed between 1 THz and 7 THz. Recently, an ultrafast Schottky- diode detector and a novel polarizing Fourier-transform spec- trometer were installed, which enable turn-by-turn-resolved spectral measurements in the frequency range below 1 THz. The commissioning results of the new spectrometer and simulations are presented.

The ANKA storage ring offers different operation modes including the short-bunch mode with bunch lengths tuned down to a few picoseconds. This can lead to the occurrence of micro-bunching instabilities coupled to the emission of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in so-called 'bursts'. To study this CSR instability we use several turn-by-turn enabled detector systems to synchronously measure both the THz signal as well as bunch profiles. The different detectors are placed at different locations around the storage ring. Here we discuss the experimental setup and calibration of the various systems' synchronisation.

The SINBAD facility (Short and INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at Desy) is foreseen to host various experiments in the field of production of ultra-short electron bunches and novel high gradient acceleration technique. The SINBAD linac, also called ARES (Accelerator Research experiment at SINBAD), will be a conventional S-band linear RF accelerator allowing the production of low charge (0.5 pC - few pC) ultra-short electron bunches (FWHM, length <= 1 fs - few fs) having 100 MeV energy. In this paper we present the current status of the technical design considerations, motivate the foreseen diagnostics for the RF gun commissioning and present examples of foreseen applications.

Micro-bunching instabilities limit the longitudinal compression of bunches in an electron storage ring. They create substructures on the bunch profile of some hundred micrometer size leading to coherently emitted synchrotron radiation in the THz range. To detect the changing THz spectrum, single-shot bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn measurements are necessary. We present recent experiments at ANKA where the spectral information is extracted by simultaneous detection with several narrowband THz detectors, each of them sensitive in a different frequency range.

A high brightness electron LINAC is being built in the Compton Gamma Source at the ELI Nuclear Physics facility in Romania. To achieve the design luminosity, a train of 32, 16 ns spaced, bunches with a nominal charge of 250 pC will collide with the laser beam in the interaction point. Electron beam spot size is measured with optical transition radiation profile monitors. In order to measure the beam properties along the train, the screens must sustain the thermal stress due to the energy deposited by the bunches; moreover the optical radiation detecting system must have the necessary accuracy and resolution. This paper deals with the analytical studies as well as numerical simulations to investigate the thermal behaviour of the screens impinged by the nominal bunch; the design and the performance of the optical detection line is discussed as well.

Bunch length measurement in linac can be carried out using a RF deflector, which provides a transverse kick to the beam. The transverse beam size on a screen, placed after the RF deflector, represents the bunch length. In this paper, the metrological characterization of the bunch length measurement technique is proposed. The uncertainty and the systematic errors are estimated by means of a sensitivity analysis to the measurement parameters. The proposed approach has been validated through simulation by means of ELEGANT code on the parameters interesting for the electron linac of the Compton source at the Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP).

The high brightness electron LINAC of the Compton Gamma Source at the ELI Nuclear Physics facility in Romania is accelerating a train of 32 bunches with a nominal charge of 250 pC and nominal spacing of 16 ns. To achieve the design gamma flux, all the bunches along the train must have the designed Twiss parameters. Beam sizes are measured with optical transition radiation monitors, allowing a quadrupole scan for Twiss parameters measurements. Since focusing the whole bunch train on the screen may lead to permanent screen damage, we investigated non-conventional scans such as scans around a maximum of the beam size or scans with a controlled minimum spot size. This paper discusses the implementation issues of such a technique in the actual machine layout.

A possible method of measuring the transverse spatial distribution of energetic ion beams is developed at Takasaki Advanced Radiation Research Institute, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (formerly, Japan Atomic Energy Agency). For this purpose, a radiochromic film, Gafchromic film (Ashland Inc.), is employed since it enables us to easily measure a large-area irradiation field distribution at a high spatial resolution. Gafchromic EBT3 and HD-V2 films are irradiated with ion beams of various species and kinetic energies extracted from a cyclotron and electrostatic accelerators at QST/Takasaki. Then, the coloration response of the films is analyzed in terms of the optical density. It is demonstrated that EBT3 and HD-V2 films are useful for the beam profile measurement at low fluence and at low energy, respectively.

Electron cloud instability is presented in most of the high intensity proton rings. During the Slow beam extraction (SX) mode at Main Ring of J-PARC, signals related with its formation were observed. An electron cloud detector is installed downstream of the ElectroStatic Septum (ESS), to measure the electron signal. Additionally, scintillation detector with photomultiplier, a proportional counter and photo-diode were set closely to the electron cloud detector to observe the beam lost. This paper presents the measurements of the electron cloud and some of the conditions which support its creation, for instance the signal of lost particle from the beam loss monitors, the residual gas in the vacuum duct by using vacuum pressure gauges, etc.

In the J-PARC main ring, the beam intensity is greatly increased to 750 kW or more in near future. Even the beam intensity become higher, the beam loss must be kept at the same level as present. Aiming to make the cause of beam loss clear, we have been developing the beam monitor to measure the beam size. The quadrupole moment is related to the beam size. In principle, monitors with more than four electrodes can measure the quadrupole moment. In addition, two monitors located at the places with different beta functions can measure the emittances and beam sizes, providing the horizontal and vertical beta functions. To obtain more precise quadrupole moment and higher multipoles, we are developing the multi-electrode monitor, tentatively, with 16 electrodes. As a reference of 16-electrode monitor, two 4-electrode BPMs are investigated to measure quadrupole moments. We will present the measurement result of 4-electrode monitors and the status of the development of the 32-electrode monitor.

Ultrashort electron beams are essential for light sources and time-resolved measurements. Electron beams can emit terahertz (THz) pulses using coherent transition radiation (CTR). Michelson interferometer is one of can-didates for analyzing the pulse width of an electron beam based on frequency-domain analysis. Recently, electron beam measurement using a photoconductive antenna (PCA) based on time-domain analysis has been investi-gated. In this paper, to improve beam diagnostics of ul-trashort electron beam, investigation of characteristics of a PCA for generation and frequency and time-domain measurement of THz pulses was conducted.

Ultrashort electron bunches have been applied in many scientific fields including accelerator physics and radiation chemistry. Pulse radiolysis is application in radiation chemistry, which is a pump-probe measurement using an electron bunch and a laser pulse. Our laboratory aims to generate the electron bunches with durations of less-than femtoseconds using an S-band linear accelerator (linac) at Osaka University in order to improve the time resolution of the pulse radiolysis system. Recently, the linac system was relocated for expanding application using ultrashort electron bunches. The parameters of generated electron bunches including the bunch lengths will be reported.

The goal of the beam diagnostic system for the SPring-8 upgrade is to deliver brilliant X-rays enabled by the new low-emittance ring to experimental stations with ultimate stability. Developments of accurate electron and photon beam position monitors (EBPM and XBPM, respectively) with both short and long-term stability are the most critical. The EBPM sensitivity is also crucial for low-current beam commissioning to accomplish the first beam storage in the ring. We designed a button electrode to obtain sufficiently high-intensity signals while suppressing high-Q trapped modes leading to impedance and heating issues. We also designed a precise EBPM block and a rigid support to achieve mechanical accuracy and stability. Another challenge is the development of a reliable and stable XBPM, which should be an accurate reference for an orbit feedback without any photon-energy dependences. A significant improvement of a blade-type XBPM or an invention of a novel XBPM detecting the core of an intense X-ray beam are necessary. The other diagnostic instrumentations can be utilized for the new ring with minor improvements.

Linear focal Cherenkov ring camera (LFC-Camera) has been developed for single shot measurement of longitudinal phase space distribution of quasi-relativistic electron beam, where the electron's velocity still depends on its energy. The LFC-camera employs velocity dependence of opening angle of Cherenkov light produced by electron beam to observe its energy (momentum) distribution. Since the Cherenkov light contains the time information if the radiator medium is thin enough, we can get the longitudinal phase space distribution measuring both time and energy spectra simultaneously using a streak camera. We employ a thin silica aerogel with water-free hydrophobic treatment as Cherenkov radiator. We have evaluated characteristics of the silica aerogel radiator, and demonstration of the LFC-camera at a beam diagnosis section of t-ATCS is being proceeded.

We have been studying an S-band Cs-Te photo-cathode rf gun at Waseda Univ. The high quality electron beam produced by the rf gun is used to generate a high-power coherent terahertz pulse via Cherenkov radiation. This terahertz pulse can be applied to terahertz imaging and material analysis. As a preliminary step towards material analysis, we conducted experiments on terahertz time domain spectroscopy by EO sampling method to reveal major parameters of the terahertz pulse such as the pulse form and the spectrum. EO sampling method has high frequency response and suitable for high peak power terahertz pulses. In terahertz time domain spectroscopy, the duration of the probe pulse needs to be much faster than that of the terahertz pulse. Therefore, we developed a mode locked Yb-fiber laser based on nonlinear polarization rotation as a reliable and cost-effective ultra-fast probe light source. The laser generates 3.80 ps chirped pulses which are compressed to 213 fs with a grating pair. In this conference, we will report the performance of the Yb-fiber laser and results of EO sampling experiments.

For proton linear accelerators used in applications such as C-ADS, due to the nature of the operation, it is essential to have beam failures at the rate several orders of magnitude lower than usual performance of similar accelerators. A fault-tolerant mechanism should be mandatorily imposed in order to maintain short recovery time, high uptime and extremely low frequency of beam loss. This paper proposes an innovative and challenging way for compensation and rematch of cavity failure using fast electronic devices and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) instead of embedded computers to complete the computation of beam dynamics. Due to the high arithmetic-computing-speed, good portability and repeatability, it is possible to realize calculation and re-adjustment online. In order to achieve the goal of instantaneous compensation and rematch, an advanced hardware design methodology including high-level synthesis and an improved genetic algorithm will be used.

This paper describes the impact on the measuring results of the stripline beam position monitor (BPM) produced by the edge of the ultra-relativistic electron beam when we take the transverse size of the beam into account. Simulations have been made by using the Wakefield Solver of CST Particle Studio. And the result of this influence at different ratio of beam horizontal width σ and the BPM inner diameter a has been obtained. This kind of influence has been observed in the stripline BPMs in the transfer line of Beijing Positron Electron Colliders upgraded version II (BEPCII). The research is useful when we design the inner diameter of the stripline BPMs for ultra-relativistic electron beam, meanwhile it provides reference to distinguish the invalid ones from the measuring results obtained by the stripline BPMs in the ultra-relativistic situation.

To reduce the beam loss in the high current linac, beam transverse emittance is a key value which has to be characterized. At Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) in Beijing the C-ADS project has started beam commissioning. A newly developed double-slit emittance meter (DEM) for pulsed proton beam from the (RFQ) has been installed in the beam line. In this paper principal of operation, instrumentation and programming of emittance meter are discussed. The emittance measurement has been carried out with the newly developed DEM at a beam energy of 3.2 MeV and a beam current of 10 mA. Typical rms emittance for x and y direction are measured to be 0.1303 and 0.1347 π mm mrad，which are well below the design standard of the RFQ.

For the third-generation light sources, the vertical emit-tance of a few pico-meter-radians which can be achieved with good coupling correction close to 0.1%, will lead to very small beam size. Several microns vertical beam sizes measurement has presented challenges for diagnostic capability in this region. A few techniques have been developed to make a precise measurement, such as visible light interferometer, x-ray imaging using Fresnel zone plates, compound refractive lenses or pinhole camera. In this paper, an x-ray reflective optics method based on the Kirkpatrick'Baez mirrors will be emphasis on discussed. The K-B mirror system will be installed and tested in SSRF to obtain the vertical beam size close to 20 microns, which is expected to be used for several microns vertical beam size measurement in the future light source named HEPS (High Energy Photon Source) in China.

Dielectric based collinear wakefield accelerator have been broadly selected for the THz accelerator due to its simplicity. In order to move the THz accelerators from the current exploratory research into the practical phase, certain common accelerator components are indispensable. Beam Position Monitor (BPM) is one of them. However, most of conventional BPM techniques are hardly scaled down to THz regime. Here we propose a BPM design which uses the dominant dipole mode excited in the dielectric wakefield accelerators to extract information of the beam position.

In this paper, development of the Shoebox BPM is presented which can be applied for the measurement of turn-by-turn position data, closed orbit and tune of Xi'an Proton Application Facility (XiPAF). The preliminary design of the physical dimensions including the electrode aperture, the pipe aperture and the gap between the two electrodes is performed by calculating their effects on BPM response respectively with the equivalent circuit model. Furthermore, the mechanical structure of the Shoebox BPM is optimized by CST simulation to achieve better performance. The dependency of the BPM sensitivity and zero offset on the frequency is diminished by adding one isolating ring, which decreases coupling capacitance of electrodes and compensates ground capacitance difference of the two electrodes. Finally one prototype of the Shoebox BPM has been fabricated and tested offline. Results show that relative position measurement error due to frequency dependency of sensitivity is less than 1% and absolute measurement error due to frequency dependency of zero offset is expected to be less than 0.1 mm.

Electron bunch length measurement is of great significance for optimizing IRFEL performance. An optical autocorrelation system using coherent transition radiation (CTR) would be set up to measure the electron bunch length at the IRFEL. CTR can be occurred when short electron bunches traverse a vacuum-metal interface. A Martin-Puplett interferometer allowed measurement of the autocorrelation of the CTR signal. The basic principle and the main components of Martin-Puplett interferometer are elaborated in this paper.

A new IR-FEL has been commissioned at NSRL. This facility provides a final electron energy from 20 to 70 MeV, beam bunch with a macro-pulse length of 5~10 μs and a general micro-pulse repetition rate of 238 MHz, pulsed radiation with up to 100 mJ at about 0.3%~3% FWHM bandwidth. So a diagnostics system is necessary to monitor the performance of the bunch and the character of the FEL radiation, such as the beam position and profile, emittance, energy spread, laser intensity, etc. The beam diagnostics system mainly consists of Flags, a diagnostics beam line, BPMs, pop-in monitors and a FEL monitor system. This paper introduces the construction of this diagnostics system.

In Hefei Light Source, the streak camera was used to measure the bunch length and longitudinal distribution using synchronous light. As the RF frequency of HLS II was 204MHz, the streak camera worked at the frequency of 102MHz (half of 204MHz). Because of the bunch lengthening, the streak camera faced the problem, the streak image on the phosphor screen will overlap when the bunch length was above 200.5ps@5% linear error and 10% overlap. In order to solve this problem, an effective solution was to change the working frequency of the streak camera to 136MHz (two thirds of 204MHz), and then the streak image on the phosphor screen will overlap when the bunch length was above 285.6ps@5% linear error and 10% overlap. So a front-end electronic was needed before the synchronizing signals feed into the streak camera. The front-end electronic was designed to convert the 204MHz synchronizing signal to 136MHz.

A new button-type beam position monitor(BPM) was designed for the IR-FEL project. Firstly, the longitudinal size of BPM needs to be short enough to save space because the entire machine of IR-FEL is very compact. And in the matter of installation problem, all four electrodes are deviated 30 degrees from the horizontal axis. Then, according to these two limited conditions and beam parameters, we builded up a simple model and did some simulated calculations to ensure a good performance of position resolution, which should be better than 50μm. The simulations include an estimation of induced signals in both time and frequency domains, horizontal and vertical sensitivities, mapping figures and so on. This button BPM will be manufactured in the near future and then we can do some off-line experiments to test it.

Bunch-by-bunch (BxB) beam current measurement is an important method to study filling pattern of injection and beam instability threshold for multi-bunch operation storage ring, also, necessary equipment for top-up injection. A high-speed high-precision ADC and FPGA are used to construct the bunch-by-bunch beam current measurement system. FPGA reads data from ADC, and transfer the data to PC via USB. A LabVIEW program is running on PC to process the data, and communicates with other accelerator equipment with EPICS by CA Lab. Besides the bunch-by-bunch beam current measurement, the BxB longitudinal tune is measured by the system, and other potential bunch-by-bunch beam diagnostics study could be done in future, like bunch-by-bunch beam life etc., to improve the performance of the storage ring of Hefei light source.

Fifth harmonic cavity resonates at 14.28 GHz (fifth harmonic of the linac fundamental frequency 2.856 GHz) with mode TM020, as this mode could provide larger cavity radius. Each cavity equipped with a filter to suppress unwanted signal. An improved bunch length calculation method was proposed. A simulation was conducted in CST Particle Studio for beam current from 100-300 mA, bunch length from 5-10 ps. Bunch length was calculated and compared by these two methods

Harmonics method in frequency domain is an effective and inexpensive bunch length measurement method. With advances in technology, it is possible to do bunch length measurement at bunch by bunch using electronic method. We design and make an electronic system to realize metering at bunch by bunch, and believe it has reasonable bunch length resolution. All selected harmonic signals will be mixed down to 500 MHz and digitized at bunch-by-bunch rate by a multi-channel DBPM processor. The primary beam experiment results will be presented and discussed in this paper.

This article proposes a new test method to evaluate the performance of cavity beam position monitors using the actual beam as the exciting signal. The new method sepa-rates the signals of different modes and improves the measurement accuracy by eliminating unwanted cou-plings from other sources.

On-axis injection is one of the critical issues for an ul-tra-low emittance storage ring which holds a rather small dynamic aperture. In order to reduce the challenges of the fast pulsed kicker design, a sin wave RF kicker is studied which is suitable for longitudinal on-axis injection. Since the injected bunch is longitudinally apart from the stored bunches, the location of the stored bunches can be at the π knot of the sin wave, while the injected bunches are launched at a phase around π/2+n·π. At this situation the injected bunches will receive a transverse kick, however the store bunches are almost un-affected.

The UED (Ultrafast Electron Diffraction) beamline of KAERI (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute) WCI (World Class Institute) Center has been successfully commissioned. A S-band co-axial RF photogun with 1.5 cylindrically symmetric cells was used to remove multiple modes of the electric filed inside the cavity. It is designed to generate sub-picosecond electron bunches with energy up to 3.3~MeV. We have developed a system consists of an in-air Faraday cup (FC) and a preamplifier for charge measurement. Tests performed utilizing 3.3~MeV electrons show the system were able to measure ultrashort bunches with tens of femtosecond pulse duration at 10 fC sensitivity. In this paper, we shall present the design, calibration and test results of this system.

The linac for generation of the 100 MeV proton beam is operating in KOMAC. The 100 MeV proton beam is used in the industrial and the scientific fields such as improvement of the material characteristics and production of the isotope. The accurate measurements of the proton beam energy and profile are necessary for increasing the efficiency of the application and minimizing the inadequate radioactivation in linac structure caused by the beam loss. The proton beam energy and beam profile are measured by using the TOF (time-of-flight) method with a BPM (beam position monitor) and the ion chamber array, respectively. The detailed measurement setup and the measured results will be given in this paper.

The 4B beamline of the Pohang Light Source-II performs X-ray microdiffraction and microfluorescence experiments using X-ray microbeams. When performing X-ray micro-experiments, an X-ray microbeam should first be prepared. Up to recently, the microbeams with vertical and horizontal sizes (full width at half maximum) of less than 3 μm have been achieved, by manually adjusting the translations and pitch angles of the vertically and horizontally focusing mirrors, in a Kirkpatrick'Baez (K-B) mirror system. In this research, we developed a program that automates the complex and cumbersome process of microbeam focusing, divided into half-cutting and focusing phases. The developed program was applied to the 4B beamline and enabled the focusing of an X-ray beam to a minimum size within one hour. This paper introduces the algorithms of the program and also examines its performance.

Femtosecond resolution electron bunch arrival time monitor (BAM) will be required for the beam-based RF phase feedback during PAL-XFEL operation. Two S-band cavity-type BAMs were manufactured for the test at the PAL-XFEL injector test facility (ITF). The resonance frequencies of the cavities are 2856 MHz and 2826.25 MHz. Electron beam induced signal from the cavities was digitized using a low level RF (LLRF) module. In this paper, the resolution of these cavities are analyzed and a possible improvement for better resolution are discussed.

The LHC Schottky system allows the measurement of beam parameters such as tune and chromaticity in an entirely non-invasive way by extracting information from the statistical fluctuations in the incoherent motion of particles. The system was commissioned in 2011 and provided satisfactory beam-parameter measurements during LHC run 1 for lead-ions. However, for protons its usability was substantially limited due to strong interfering signals originating from the coherent motion of the particle bunch. The system has recently been upgraded with optimized travelling-wave pick-ups and an improved 4.8~GHz microwave signal path, with the front-end and the triple down-mixing chain optimized to reduce coherent signals. Design and operational aspects for the complete system are shown and the results from measurements with LHC beams in Run II are presented and discussed.
