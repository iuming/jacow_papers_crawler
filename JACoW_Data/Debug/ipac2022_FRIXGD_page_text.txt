Fast beam-based Feedback systems play an important role in circular accelerators to mitigate instabilities and reduce the impact of injection oscillations and perturbations on beam quality, both in the longitudinal and transverse planes. The status and prospects of such beam-based feedback systems for circular accelerators are reviewed. This includes progress towards the fundamental limits in noise and feedback gain and the possibilities of modern digital systems to extract large amounts of data that can be used to characterise beam properties. The talk concentrates on machines with hadrons and gives an outlook on possible developments for future accelerator projects under study.
