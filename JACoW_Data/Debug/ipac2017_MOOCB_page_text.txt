Recently, a new setup for measuring the beam energy spread has been commissioned at the ANKA storage ring at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. This setup is based on a fast-gated intensified camera and detects the horizontal profiles of individual bunches in a multi-bunch environment on a single-turn base. As the radiation source point is located in a dispersive section of the storage ring, this allows time-resolved studies of the energy spread. These studies are of particular interest in the framework of short-bunch beam dynamics and the characterization of instabilities. The system is fully synchronized to other beam diagnostics devices allocated in various places along the storage ring, such as the single-shot electro-optical spectral decoding setup or the turn-by-turn terahertz detection systems. Here we discuss the results of the synchronous measurements with the various systems with special emphasis on the energy spread studies.

Recently, a high-efficiency laser assisted hydrogen ion (H−) beam stripping was successfully carried out in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator. The experiment was not only an important step toward foil-less H− stripping for charge exchange injection, it also served as a first example of using megawatt ultraviolet (UV) laser in an operational high power proton accelerator facility. This talk reports the design, implementation, and commissioning results of the macropulse laser system, laser transport line, and laser operation for the laser stripping experiment. The macropulse laser consists of a mode-locked picosecond pulsed seed laser and a burst-mode Nd:YAG laser amplifier. The general design concept can be adapted to any temporal beam structures in most accelerators. We have achieved UV pulses with the pulse widths varying between 34 to 54 ps and a maximum peak power over 3.5 MW. A laser transport line is installed to deliver the UV beam to the laser stripping chamber at a transmission efficiency of 70%. Laser operation including remote control and monitor of laser parameters will be described.

Electron bunch length in a storage ring is typically measured with streak cameras, electro-optic devices or non-linear cross-correlation techniques with a range of system complexity, signal-to-noise ratios and cost. Another straight-forward method is to construct an 'intensity interferometer' utilizing a coincidence detector to record simultaneous photon arrival events. In this configuration, visible SR light is passed through a narrow bandpass filter followed by a small pinhole to generate a stream of single-mode monochromatic wavepackets. As the interferometer delay is scanned across an electron bunch, two-photon events occurring within the longitudinal coherence time of the light cause a reduction in the measured coincidence rate. The resulting autocorrelation of the optical pulse duration reveals the electron bunch length, independent of synchrotron oscillation motion. In this paper we comment on the theory and report on preliminary measurements carried out at SPEAR3.
