Construction of a new accelerator for nuclear physics research, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), is underway at Michigan State University (MSU). The FRIB linac will use superconducting resonators at an operating temperature of 2 K to accelerate ions to 200 MeV per nucleon. The linac requires 106 quarter wave resonators (80.5 MHz, β = 0.043 and 0.086) and 248 half wave resonators (322 MHz, β = 0.29 and 0.54), all made from sheet Nb. Production resonators being delivered to MSU by cavity vendors. At MSU, the resonators are etched, rinsed, and tested in MSU's certification test facility. Certification testing is done before the installation of the high-power input coupler and the tuner. After certification, the resonators are tested in the cryomodule before installation into the FRIB tunnel. The cryomodule test goals are to verify integrated operation of the resonators, RF couplers, tuners, RF controls, and superconducting solenoids. To date, 10 cryomodules out of 48 have been fabricated, and 8 of the cryomodules have been certified. Cryomodule test results are presented in this paper.

In the Superconducting RF Test Facility (STF) in KEK, the cooldown test for the STF-2 cryomdoule with 12 cavities has been done totally three times since 2014. In 2016, the 3rd cooldown test for the STF-2 cryomodule including the capture cryomodule with 2 cavities was successfully carried out. The main achievement is the vector-sum operation with 8 cavities at average accelerating gradient of 31 MV/m as the ILC specification (2 of 8 cavities achieved 36 MV/m with piezo compensation), and the others are the measurement for Lorenz Force Detuning (LFD) and unloaded Q value, and Low Level RF (LLRF) study, etc. In this paper, the result for the STF-2 cryomodule in three cooldown tests will be presented in detail.

Four cryomodules designed to host half wave resonator(HWR) cavities have been successfully tested at IMP for the C-ADS project. The lessons of cryomodules conditioning, assemblies, and operations will be presented. Cryomodule consist of various complex subassemblies, starting from the inside with the niobium RF cavity and working out to the vacuum vessel. All of the prototypes use 6 β=0.10 HWR cavities dressed with helium vessel except the last one, which has 5 β=0.15 cavities. Early experimental results from the first cryomodule led to design improvements seen in the latest cryomodules. The cryogenic system provides 4.2 K liquid helium lines to 2 phase separator for cold mass, and 77K liquid nitrogen for thermal shield and current leads. An 1100 Aluminium shield is used as a thermal radiation shield. To meet a full period lattice structure, fewer warm-cold transitions and warm connector between cryomodules have been designed. All cryomodules have achieved the design goals both offline and online. Thus, the better three cryomodules are assembled in the linac tunnel and waiting for the running later.

CEA Saclay in collaboration with IPN Orsay is in charge of the ESS elliptical cavities cryomodule design, prototyping and series production. Two cryomodule prototypes are being developed and will be tested at CEA Saclay before starting the series production. The main cryomodule design features are first reminded. We present the cavities and couplers test results and the achieved assembly sequences of the first medium beta cavities cryomodule demonstrator M-ECCTD. The progress on the preparation of the CEA cryomodule test station is given. The procurement status and development plan of the second high beta demonstrator H-ECCTD are also reported. Finally we give the components procurement progress and the assembly strategy of the 30 series cry-omodules to be integrated at CEA before delivery to ESS at Lund.

Compact ERL (cERL) was constructed at KEK as a prototype for 3GeV ERL light source. It consists of two types of SRF cavities. Three injector 2-cell SRF cavities and two main linac 9-cell SRF cavities. The beam operation started at 2013, with 100 nA (CW). Beam current increased step by step and currently reached to 1 mA (CW). Energy recovery has successfully achieved. Performance of the SRF cavities through long term beam operation has been investigated. With the beam induced HOMs, the beam position and the beam timing were studied. cERL has suffered from heavy field emissions in operation. Field emissions of the main linac cavity started just after module assembly work, and during beam operation, performances of both the main linac and the injector SRF cavities sometimes degraded. One reason of degradation was discharges occurred at beamline components due to charge up of electrons. Pulse aging technique helped to recover SRF performances. In this presentation, details of SRF beam operation, degradation, applied recovery methods are described.
