Fermilab has been recently awarded a $115M National Quantum Center (Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, SQMS) for producing dramatic advancements in quantum technologies for computing and sensing. The center encompasses 20 partner institutions from the US and Italy including national labs, academia and industry, and will have as a main goal to build the first quantum computer at Fermilab, which will be based on SRF technology. Thanks to the long coherence time of SRF cavities in the quantum regime, the quantum computer prototype may be far superior than any quantum processors so far existing and enable new type of caluclations and simulations. This talk will explain the importance that SRF will play in the international quantum arena, highlight the National Quantum Initiative effort and the new SQMS Center activities, and in particular focus on explaining how the first quantum computer based on the SRF technology will come to life.
