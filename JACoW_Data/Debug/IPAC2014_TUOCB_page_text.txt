This paper presents a conceptual design of bending magnets to be used first in a full energy booster for a lepton machine (TLEP) and later in a low energy ring for a hadron machine (VHE-LHC). TLEP and VHE-LHC would be respectively e-ebar and p-p colliders, at the energy frontier in each category, to be installed in a 80-100 km circumference tunnel. The main requirements in terms of operating field range and field quality are discussed. Two dimensional simulations then show how an iron-dominated magnet could fulfil the specifications. The design is a "transmission-line" magnet, where the excitation current is provided by a single turn. When operating with leptons, a resistive conductor can be used. To then increase the strength needed to handle hadrons, the use of superconducting technology is needed. Recent results on similar prototypes built for different machines are recalled to point to the developments needed to assess the viability of this design.

The upcoming Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) will rely on the use of Accelerator Quality Nb3Sn Magnets which have been the focus of an intense R&D effort in the last decade. This contribution will describe the R&D and results of Nb3Sn Accelerator Quality High Field Magnets development efforts, with emphasis on the activities considered for the HL-LHC upgrades.

Design, assembly, field shimming, and performance of APPLE-II type undulators in NSRRC are described in this article. Essentially, the mechanical error has been well controlled based on the optimize design and mechanical arts. Effectively initial sorting of permanent magnets is developed to minimize several adverse effects, such as magnetic inhomogeneities, no perfection geometry of blocks, and mechanical frame issue, those challenge the sorting expectation, especially for an adjusted polarization undulator. The sorting algorithm shows a quantitative prediction of magnetic field and is verified by measurement results. 2D virtual shimming algorithm has been developed to optimize field quality, including multipole, phase error, and particle trajectory. We describe the considering of each procedure and demonstrate the optimization together with measurement results.
