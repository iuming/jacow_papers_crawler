FRIB is a heavy ion linac facility to accelerate all stable ions to the energy of 200 MeV/u with the beam power of 400 kW, which is under construction at Michigan State University in USA. FRIB driver linac is a beam power frontier accelerator aiming to realize two orders of magnitude higher beam power than existing facilities. It consists of more than 300 low-beta superconducting cavities with unique folded layout to fit into the existing campus with innovative features including multi charge state acceleration. In this talk, we overview accelerator physics challenges in FRIB driver linac with highlight on recent progresses and activities preparing for the coming beam commissioning.

HIAF is a proposed new accelerator facility in China. The facility is being designed to provide intense primary and radioactive beams for a wide range of research fields. The HIAF facility plan was approved by central government of China in December 2015. The machine studies are now mainly focused on design optimization and key technical R&D.The unique features of the first phase of HIAF are high current pulsed beams from iLinac and high intensity heavy ion beams with ultra-short bunch length from BRing. The cooled rare isotope beams also will be prepared through projectile-fragmentation (PF) method and advanced beam cooling technology. To reach the main goals of the HIAF facility, there are still several technical challenges such as operation with high intensity beams, control of the dynamic vacuum pressure, beam compression for very short pulse beam and the design of Nuclotron-type superconducting magnets. For most of those challenges solutions have been found and prototypes are being built through close international collaborations. The general description, accelerator challenges and present status are given in the presentation.

The rare isotope science project (RISP) under development in Korea aims to provide various heavy-ion beams for nuclear and applied science users. A pre-stripper linac is the first superconducting section to be constructed for the acceleration of both stable and radioisotope beams to the energy of 18.5 Mev/u with a DC equivalent voltage of 160 MV. The current baseline design consists of an ECR ion source, an RFQ, cryomodules with QWR and HWR cavities and quadruple focusing magnets in the warm sections between cryomodules. Recently we have developed an alternative design in collaboration with Argonne's Linac Development Group to layout the linac based on state-of-the-art ANL's QWR operating at 81.25 MHz and multi-cavity cryomodules of the type used for the ATLAS upgrade and Fermilab PIP-II projects. End-to-end beam dynamics calculations have been performed to ensure an optimized design with no beam losses. The numbers of required cavities and cryomodules are significantly reduced in the alternative design. The results of beam optics simulations and error sensitivity studies are discussed.

Along with the rapid development of nuclear power plants in China, treatment of the nuclear waste has become a crucial issue. Supported by the "Strategic Priority Research Program" of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), The Chinese ADS project is now on-going based on the collaboration of several Chinese institutions. In the end of year 2015, China Initiative ADS (CIADS) program is approved by Chinese government, will construct in the Guangdong province south part of China. The proton accelerator of Chinese ADS is a superconducting CW linear accelerator. Its energy is 1.5GeV, with beam current of 10mA. Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) and Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) are responsible to developing this superconducting CW linear accelerator. In the injector part there are many challenges to developing several different low beta superconducting cavities and related hardware’s such like LLRF system etc. In this paper presents the progress of two different injector development including SC cavities and related hardware’s and performance test of two injectors and key hardware’s, and also brief introduction of CIADS program.
