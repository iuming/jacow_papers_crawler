We present few examples of the ERL with a single Fixed Field Alternating Linear Gradient (FFA-LG) return lines for Electron Ion Colliders LHeC, FCC ee and eRHIC. Examples of smaller energy ERL’s with a single FFA-LG beam lines are shown as well. The large energy ERL’s require fixed field triplet quadrupoles inside of the superconducting linacs. Electrons from the linac pass through the FFA-LG single return line made of two parts: the adiabatic transition beam line where the cell lengths decreases adiabatically and the arc section with repetitive triplet cells. The time of flight of different energies are corrected by additional orbit oscillations of smaller and higher energies as the FFA-LG time of flight dependence is a parabolic function with respect to the energy.

BERLinPro is an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) project currently being set up at HZB, Berlin. Commissioning is planned for early 2020. HZB triggered and supported the development of release 2.0 of the particle tracking code OPAL, that is now also applicable to ERLs. OPAL is set up as an open source, highly parallel tracking code for large accelerator systems and many particles. Thus, it is idially suited to serve attempts of applying machine learning approaches to beam dynamics, as demonstrated in [1]. OPAL is used to calculate hundreds of randomized machines close to the commissioning optics of BERLinPro. This data base will be used to train a neural network, to establish a surrogate model of BERLinPro, much faster than any physical model including particle tracking. First steps, like the setup of the sampler and a sensitivity analysis of the resulting data are presented. The ultimate goal of this work is to use machine learning techniques during the commissioning of BERLinPro. Future steps are outlined. [1] A. Edelen, A. Adelmann, N. Neveu, Y. Huber, M.

A dual axis asymmetric SCRF ERL has been recently proposed as a possible way to drive a high average current electron beam while avoiding the BBU instability excitation. Such high current ERLs can be attractive for the next generation light sources, beam cooling in electron ion collider and isotope production. Here the results of the studies of band-pass modes and HOMs will be shown. The field distribution of the modes will be shown and asymmetric field distribution of HOMs will be demonstrated and HOMs excitations using dipole couplers will be discussed. The original design of the dual axis asymmetric cavity has been optimised to minimize the peaks of magnetic and electric fields on the cavity surface, to increase the distance between operating mode and neighbouring parasitic mode as well as to reduce the cavity manufacturing cost. To reach the goals several solutions have been suggested leading to simplification of the manufacturing as well as bringing the fields amplitudes on the cavity surface to the acceptable values. The new design of the cavity will be presented and possible applications of such a high-current ERL will be discussed.

ERL makes it possible to transport the short electron bunch with a high repetition frequency of 1.3 GHz. Coherent THz radiation from such short electron bunches is so intense as to be expected to utilize for many applications. We demonstrated the oscillation of the coherent diffraction radiation in the resonant optical cavity. In this presentation, we show recent progress.
