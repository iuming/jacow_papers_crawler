Summary of the 4th Workshop on Control System Cyber-Security in HEP

Over the last decade modern accelerator and experiment control systems have increasingly been based on commercial-off-the-shelf products (VME crates, PLCs, SCADA systems, etc.), on Windows or Linux PCs, and on communication infrastructures using Ethernet and TCP/IP. Despite the benefits coming with this (r)evolution, new vulnerabilities are inherited, too: Attackers against control systems are now regularly reported. Unfortunately, control PCs cannot be patched as fast as office PCs. Even worse, vulnerability scans using standard IT tools have shown that commercial automation systems lack fundamental security precautions: Some systems crashed during the scan, others could easily be stopped or their process data being altered. The 4th (CS)2/HEP workshop held the weekend before the ICALEPCS2013 conference was intended to raise awareness; exchange good practices, ideas, and implementations; discuss what works & what not as well as their pros & cons; report on security events, lessons learned & successes; and update on progresses made at HEP laboratories around the world in order to secure control systems. This presentation will give a summary.
