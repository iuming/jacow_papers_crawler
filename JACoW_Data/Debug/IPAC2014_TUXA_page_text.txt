J-PARC is currently upgrading their linac from 181MeV to 400 MEV with a new ACS section (annular coupled structure). This includes a triple frequency jump, and there should be some interesting results to report. As the result of the injector linac upgrade at J-PARC, the Rapid Cycle Synchrotron (RCS) will achieve a record-high intensity as a proton accelerator. This talk describes the recent performance of the RCS together with its beam-dynamical issues.
