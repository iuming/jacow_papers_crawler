                       FRIB, East Lansing, Michigan, USA

 


 

This talk should cover current state of the art of integrated design of cryogenic refrigeration, distribution, and cryomodules for SRF installations. This should include optimization experience of the FRIB cryogenic and cryomodule system, based on experiences from SNS at ORNL and the 12 GeV project at Jefferson Lab.

To meet the stringent beam dynamic specs of TPS with high brilliance and low emittance characteristics, also to align the girders precisely and quickly with less manpower, the girder system for TPS (Taiwan Photon Source) storage ring is of an auto-tuning design. Each girder can be fine adjusted in 6 axes with 6 motorized cam movers of kinematic mounting design on 3 pedestals. With sensors between each girder, there are 72 girders to make up a whole ring auto-alignment girder system. All the sub-systems were carefully assembled and calibrated in a rented factory outside NSRRC during the civil construction period. Mock-up systems were set up and the auto–alignment processes were examined to modify interferences or mistakes between sub-systems. After the TPS building was nearly completed, the laser tracker alignment network was set up first and then the installation took place. When all the girders and sensors were installed into the tunnel, the auto-alignment procedures were carried out to fine tune all the girders. This paper describes the design, preparation, installation and implementation of this auto-alignment girder system for TPS storage ring.
