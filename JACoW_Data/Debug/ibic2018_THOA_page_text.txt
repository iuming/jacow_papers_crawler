From their introduction in the eighties, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have grown in size and performance for several orders of magnitude. As the FPGA capabilities have grown, so have the designs. It seems that current tools and languages (VHDL and (System)Verilog) do not match the complexity required for advanced digital signal processing (DSP) systems usually found in experimental physics applications. In the last couple of years several commercial High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have emerged, providing a new method to implement FPGA designs, or at least some parts of it. By providing a higher level of abstraction, new tools offer a possibility to express algorithms in a way which is closer to the mathematical description. Such implementation is understood by a broader range of people, and thus minimizes the documentation and communication issues. Several examples of DSP algorithms relevant for beam instrumentation will be presented. Implementations of these algorithms with different HLS tools and traditional implementation in VHDL will be compared.

The rapid development in the field of digitizers is leading to Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) with ever higher sampling rates. Nowadays many high-speed digitizers for RF applications and radio communication are available, which can sample broadband signals, without the need of down converters. These ADCs fit perfectly into beam instrumentation and diagnostic applications, e.g. Bunch Arrival time Monitor (BAM), klystron life-time management or continuous wave synchronization. To cover all these high-frequency diagnostic applications, DESY has developed a direct sampling FMC digitizer board based on a high-speed ADC with an analog input bandwidth of 2.7 GHz. A high-speed data acquisition system capable of acquiring 2 channels at 800 MSP/s will be presented. As first model application of the versatile digitizer board is the coarse bunch arrival time diagnostics in the free electron laser FLASH at DESY.

We present the recent developments of a study aiming at measuring the transverse beam profile using the Heterodyne Near Field Speckles (HNFS) method. The HNFS technique consists of a suspension of nanoparticles suspended in a liquid and illuminated by synchrotron radiation (either in the visible or in X-ray wavelength range). The transverse coherence of the source, and therefore, under the conditions of validity of the Van Cittert and Zernike theorem, the transverse electron beam size is retrieved from the interference between the transmitted beam and the spherical waves scattered by each nanoparticle. We here describe the fundamentals of this technique, as well as the recent experimental results obtained with 12 keV radiation at the NCD beamline at ALBA. The applicability of such technique for future accelerators (e.g. CLIC or FCC) is also discussed.

Optical pulses and particle beams with ultrashort temporal duration have been powerful probes for capturing ultrafast processes. An X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) based on the self-amplified spontaneous emission scheme is a newly developed ultrafast light source with femtosecond duration. The ultrafast XFEL pulses are generated from the electron bunches (e-bunches) that are accelerated to a relativistic speed with strong compression to a femtosecond regime. Evaluation of the temporal profile of the e-bunch is therefore essential for optimizing accelerator parameters for achieving XFEL amplification, as well as for characterizing the XFEL pulse duration. As a new temporal diagnostic scheme for e-bunches, we recently propose an X-ray intensity interferometry using spontaneous X-ray beam generated by the e-bunch [1]. In this presentation, I will talk about the concept of the X-ray intensity interferometry for determination of ultrashort e-bunch duration. Also, I will report on the temporal diagnostics of 8.1-GeV e-bunch at SPring-8 Angstrom compact free-electron LAser (SACLA) using the X-ray intensity interferometry.
