The information age has seen a boom in the area of data analytics, largely spurred by online applications, but with impact across many spheres of human endeavour. One such sphere is science, which is seeing a revolution brought about both on the demand side, by modern scientific instruments that generate massive quantities of data, and on the supply side by the capacity of modern data analytics to provide new forms of insight. This talk will provide a tour of the key modern data analysis methods, with examples of how they are being applied in science.
