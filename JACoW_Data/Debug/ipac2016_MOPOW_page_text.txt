The reconstruction work of accelerator complex for the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011 had been conducted in Research Center of Electron Photon Science, Tohoku University. Since restoration of the user machine time in 2013, the approved beam time have been regularly implemented as scheduled. Currently, the 1.3 GeV Booster STorage (BST) ring has been well utilized to generate the high energy gamma-rays as before the disaster. The high energy gamma-rays were produced via Bremsstrahlung by inserting an internal target wire to the beam orbit after the beam acceleration. Since the user machine time was recovered, there were some improvements so far, i.e. realignment of synchrotron magnets, orbit correction in energy ramping process by updating the control of power supplies for steering magnets etc., which brought an increase of the beam current in the maximum energy. Present operational status and recent progress of beam performance in the BST ring are reported.

Error propagation of RF phase jitter is analysed for various linac layout configurations and the sensitivity of the compression ratio due to RF phase jitter is analysed. Multiple sources of jitter have the opportunity to destructively interfere, and (perhaps counter intuitively) found to not add in quadrature. Results are compared to Elegant simulations.

Current horns are ubiquitous in Free Electron Laser (FEL) bunch compression. In this paper, we analyse the formation of these current spikes and identify the cause as caustic formation in the electron trajectories. We also present a possible solution to avoid or mitigate the current horns from developing through using optical linearization.

The ERC grant COXINEL aims at demonstrating experimentally Free Electron Laser (FEL) amplification with electrons generated by laser plasma acceleration (LPA). Because of the still limited electron beam performance (especially energy spread and divergence) in view of the FEL requirements, the electron beam transfer line has been specifically designed with adequate diagnostics and strong focusing variable strength permanent magnet quadrupoles, an energy de-mixing chicane and second set of quadrupoles for further dedicated focusing in the FEL interaction region, in a U20 in-vacuum undulator, enabling to operate at 200 nm with a 180 MeV electron beam. The first observation and transport of electrons in the COXINEL line is presented here.

The installation of the main linear accelerator in the 2 km European XFEL (X-Ray Free-Electron Laser) tunnel is currently under way. The accelerator consists of nine so-called cryo-strings. A typical cryo-string comprises 12 accelerator modules, which will be fed by three RF stations. Furthermore, the installation of electronic racks, cables, power and water supply etc. takes place. To enable a most effective installation of the accelerator components, planning and controlling methods, which had first been developed for the RF system work package, were adapted for the entire main linear accelerator. As a first step, a process plan was developed in cooperation with the work package leaders. On the basis of this plan, the installation process is promoted by several measures: The status of the installation is precisely registered by weekly queries which enable monitoring of the progress and feedback to everyone involved. With this information at hand, the installation process can be controlled and plan deviations can be corrected. Furthermore, the experience gained at one cryo-string is used to optimise the plan for the next cryo-string installation.

DESY has established a powerful configuration management solution for the construction of the European XFEL. It tracks the status and location of accelerator components during fabrication and installation, and it contains workflows for reviews, change control and the handling of non-conformities. It provides extensive progress monitoring and reporting for the production and installation of accelerator components. This way, it collects on-the-fly a comprehensive documentation of the accelerator, which serves as a thorough foundation for asset and maintenance management during the upcoming operation. The poster gives an overview of the application and summarizes its status, benefits and experience.

Baseline design of a typical X-ray FEL undulator assumes a planar configuration which results in a linear polarization of the FEL radiation. However, many experiments at X-ray FEL user facilities would profit from using a circularly polarized radiation. As a cheap upgrade one can consider an installation of a short helical afterburner, but then one should have an efficient method to suppress powerful linearly polarized background from the main undulator. We describe a method for such a suppression: an application of the reverse taper in the main undulator*. In a certain range of the taper strength, the density modulation (bunching) at saturation is practically the same as in the case of non-tapered undulator while the power of linearly polarized radiation is suppressed by orders of magnitude. Then strongly modulated electron beam radiates at full power in the afterburner. The scheme was successfully tested at LCLS** and is routinely used in user experiments. In this contribution we present the theoretical description of the method as well as the results of experiments with reverse taper at FLASH2.

Studies of Harmonic Lasing Self-seeded FEL at FLASH2

A concept of the Harmonic Lasing Self-Seeded (HLSS) FEL was proposed in*,**. A gap-tunable undulator is divided into two parts such that the first part is tuned to a sub-harmonic of the second part. Harmonic lasing occurs in the exponential gain regime in the first part of the undulator, also the fundamental stays well below saturation. In the second part of the undulator the fundamental mode is resonant to the wavelength, previously amplified as the harmonic. The amplification process proceeds in the fundamental mode up to saturation. In this case the bandwidth is reduced by a significant factor depending on harmonic number but the saturation power is still as high as in the reference case of lasing at the fundamental in the whole undulator, i.e. the spectral brightness increases. Application of the post-saturation tapering would allow to generate higher peak power than in SASE mode due to an improved longitudinal coherence. We present feasibility study of the application of the HLSS FEL scheme at FLASH2 and show that it allows to achieve a higher power and a smaller bandwidth than in a standard SASE regime. First experimental tests are eventually discussed.

FLASH, the superconducting free-electron laser at DESY delivers up to several thousand photon pulses per second with wavelengths ranging from 52 nm down to as low as 4.2 nm and with pulse energies of up to 500 uJ to photon users at the FLASH1 beamline. In 2014 and 2015 a second beamline, FLASH2, has been commissioned in parallel to user operation at FLASH1. FLASH produces bunch trains of up to 800 bunches in 0.8 ms with a train repetition rate of 10 Hz. Each train can be split in sub-trains for FLASH1 and FLASH2, such that both beamlines receive bursts of bunches with full 10 Hz. Operational highlights are the latest SASE energy record of 600 uJ at 15 nm in FLASH2, and the first simultaneous SASE lasing of three undulator systems: FLASH1 (13.7 nm), sFLASH (38 nm), and FLASH2 (20 nm). sFLASH is the seeding experiment in the FLASH1 beamline. Moreover we will report on recent technical and operational improvements. A major success is the improved reliability and stability of the whole facility with shorter SASE tuning times.

The program of low charge mode of operation is under development at free electron laser FLASH aiming in single mode radiation pulses. A short pulse photoinjector laser has been installed at FLASH allowing production of ultrashort electron pluses with moderate compression factor of the beam formation system. Here we present pilot results of free electron laser FLASH operating at the wavelength of 13.1 nm and driven by 70 pC electron bunches. Relevant theoretical analysis has been performed showing good agreement with experimental results.

The radiation from SASE FEL has always limited value of the degree of transverse coherence*. When transverse size of the electron beam significantly exceeds diffraction limit, the mode competition effect does not provide the selection of the ground mode, and spatial coherence degrades due to contribution of the higher azimuthal modes. An important consequence of this effect are fluctuations of the spot size and pointing stability of the photon beam**. These fluctuations are fundamental and originate from the shot noise in the electron beam. The effect of pointing instability becomes more pronouncing for shorter wavelengths. We analyze in detail the case of optimized SASE FEL* and derive universal dependencies applicable to all operating and planned x-ray FELs. We show that the hard x-ray FELs driven by low energy beams may exhibit poor spatial coherence and bad pointing stability.

Application of Statistical Methods for Measurements of the Coherence Properties of the Radiation from SASE FEL

Radiation of the SASE FEL operating in the linear regime possesses the properties of completely chaotic polarized light which happens due to start up of the amplification properties from the shot noise in the electron beam*. One of the features of this statistical object is that probability distribution of the radiation pulse energy follows gamma distribution. Parameter of this distribution is the number of modes in the radiation pulse which is equal to inverse deviation of the energy fluctuations. Statistical analysis of the radiation energies measured within different spatial apertures allows us to determine the number of longitudinal and transverse modes. In addition, knowledge of the saturation length allows to determine the duration of the lasing part of the electron bunch, photon pulse duration, and coherence time**. Knowledge of the number of transverse modes allows one to determine the degree of transverse coherence. In this report we present theoretical background of the proposed method and experimental results obtained at free electron laser FLASH.

Structure of the dark current passed through the undulator is a matter of great concern. Two effects can contribute to the dark current: emission of electrons from "hot" spots in the gun, and generation of "ghost" bunches due to possible leakage of the photoinjector laser. MCP based photon detector has been used for measurements of radiation energy from electron bunch. For small radiation densities the light is detected by direct illumination of the MCP plate, and for large densities a small angle scattering scheme is realized when metallic mesh scatters tiny fraction of light on the MCP plate. In the present experiment we used geometry of direct illumination of MCP plate aiming detection of "ghost" bunches which may generate parasitically from the laser driven electron gun. Reduction of background conditions allowed us to detect light produced by electron bunches with extremely small charges, down to a few femtocoulmb. We measured for the first time structure of the dark current passing through the FLASH undulator. We have also been able to measure a high contrast of radiation produced by the photoinjector laser pulses switched on and off by a 1 MHz repetition rate Pockels cells.

The demand for the photon beams for basic research is growing in India. To address the requirements, a project to develop a compact Light Source based on the principle of Free Electron Laser has been initiated at the Inter University Accelerator Centre (IUAC). In the first phase of the project, a normal conducting RF gun will be used to produce electron beam of energy ~ 8 MeV by using copper photocathode and subsequently by Cs2Te photocathode. A high power fiber laser with short pulse length is planned to be used to produce the pre-bunched electron beam by splitting the single laser pulse in to 16 pulses ("comb beam"). The electron beam will be injected in to a compact, variable gap undulator magnet to produce the THz radiation whose frequency can be tuned by varying the undulator field strength and the time separation of the comb beam. In the second and third phases of the project, superconducting RF gun and superconducting accelerating structure will be used to increase the energy of the electron beam up to ~ 40 MeV which will be used to produce IR radiation by using long undulator magnets and to produce X-rays by colliding the electron beam with another high power laser beam.

We propose generation of narrow-bandwidth GeV photons, gamma-rays, via Compton scattering of hard X-ray photons in X-ray free-electron laser oscillators. The gamma-rays have a narrow-bandwidth spectrum with a sharp peak, ~0.1% (FWHM), due to the nature of Compton scattering in relativistic regime. Such gamma-rays will be a unique probe for studying hadron physics. We discuss features of the gamma-ray source, flux, spectrum, polarization, tunability and energy resolution.

To equip SACLA with wide ability to provide a laser beams in EUV and soft X-ray regions to experimental users, we have constructed a new free electron laser facility for SACLA beamline-1. Injector components, such as a thermionic electron gun, two buncher cavities, a S-band standing wave accelerator, S-band travelling wave accelerator and their RF sources, were relocated from the SCSS test accelerator, which was a prototype machine of SACLA. At the downstream of a bunch compressor chicane, three C-band 40 MV/m acceleration units were newly installed to effectively boost a beam energy up to 470 MeV. Two in-vacuum undulators were remodeled by changing the period of magnet array from 15 mm to 18 mm to increase SASE intensity by a larger K-value of 2.1. Beam commissioning was started in autumn 2015. So far SASE radiation at a 33 nm wavelength driven by a 470 MeV electron beam was observed. We will install the third undulator in this winter to obtain SASE saturation and additional C-band accelerator units in the next summer to raise the maximum beam energy to 750 MeV. In this presentation, the overview of the facility and the commissioning status will be reported.

Resent study [Z. Huang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 204801 (2012)] shows that the transverse-gradient undu-lator (TGU) together with electron beams with constant dispersion can reduce the sensitivity to energy spread for FEL. In this study, we numerically study FEL using TGU with external focusing. In spite of the dispersion varia-tion, through parameter optimization, FEL using TGU with TGU achieves similar radiation to that without ex-ternal focusing. To achieve a high energy exaction effi-ciency, the initial dispersion should be set with a shift from that corresponding to the resonant condition, and a variation of the transverse gradient in different undulator section is preferred. Other approaches, such as tapering and detuning frequency control, are also discussed to further improve the radiation power and are demonstrated with global parametric optimizations base on simulation.

Transverse phase space matching of electron beam to the undulator optics is important for achieving good performance in free-electron lasers. Usually there are dedicated matching quadrupoles distributed in the beamline, by measuring the beam phase space the matching quadrupoles are calculated and adjusted to match to the designed Twiss parameters. Further adjustment of the quadrupoles to overcome collective effects or realistic beamline errors is typically required for performance improvement. In this paper, we studied a method to decompose the Twiss parameters for an independent control of the phase space. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations are both presented to show that through combining the quadrupoles into some multi-knobs, we can control the Twiss parameters independently. We also show some experimental results at the LCLS.

Dalian coherent Light Source (DCLS) is a FEL user facility working at 50-150 nm, now under commissioning in Dalian, China. The facility based on HGHG mode, requires high brightness electron beam with small energy spread and low emittance. To linearise the longitudinal phase space before the bunch compression, an X-band linearizer is considered before the bunch compressor. In this paper, we study the performance improvement of DCLS FEL radiation by using such a harmonic cavity, including the jitter of central wavelength induced by arriving time and a larger bunch compression ratio for femtosecond FEL application.

Harmonic lasing of the Free Electron Laser can be achieved by disrupting the electron interaction with the usually dominant fundamental while allowing the increasing of a harmonic interaction. It's a cheap and relatively efficient way to extend the photon energy range of a particular FEL. In this paper, we discussed the possibility of harmonic lasing concept at Dalian Coherent Light Source by using the combination of tapered undulators and phase shifters. Our calculation shows that it's feasible with the present layout to provide intense, stable, and narrow-band harmonic radiation, the FEL wavelength could be down to 20 nm and the corresponding pulse energy is about 10 μJ.

We present the promise of generating mode-locked multichromatic radiations in a seeded free electron laser based on high gain harmonic generation (HGHG). 3D start-to-end simulations have been carried out and analysis & comparisons have been made to have a research on the properties of each system. In these schemes, either the electron beam density or the seed laser intensity is modulated to produce a coherent radiation pulse train that yields multiple spectral lines in FEL output. Stable peak power at gigawatt level can be generated in the undulator finally.

Shot to shot pulse energy fluctuation is one of the most critical issues for two-stage cascaded high gain harmonic generation (HGHG) free electron lasers (FELs). In this paper, we study the effects of various electron parameters jitters on the output pulse energy fluctuations based on Shanghai Soft X-ray free electron laser facility (SXFEL). The results show that the relative timing jitter between the electron beam and the seed laser is proved to be the most sensitive factor. The energy jitter and charge jitter make some contributions and are non-ignorable as well. Some comparisons between our facility and FERMI have been made and we hope the conclusions draw from this study would be a reference for the optimization of future seeded FEL facilities based on cascading stages of HGHG.

X-ray free electron laser driven by SASE probes the evolution of the new generation light source in high brightness, transverse coherence. However, since SASE achieves lasing from random shotnoise, Poor longitudinal coherence and relative wide bandwidth of SASE FEL limit the operation of many type experiments. Self-seeding as a promising scheme produces longitudinal coherence and even narrower bandwidth radiation by a monochromatic seeding instead of external seeding. The self-seeding system design based on the grating monochromator is carried out for SXFEL user facility across the photon energy from 800-1200 eV. The grating monochromator with a resolution power of 〖10〗-4 can provide a monochromatic seeding pulse to the seeding undulator. The layout design and simulations of the scheme are presented. It is showing that the self-seeding system for SXFEL user facility is able to improve SASE FEL longitudinal coherence significantly.

We propose a compact scheme of THz free electron laser (FEL) amplifier within a 3.5 m long beam line. The amplification of a tunable THz seed laser in an FEL amplifier is driven by an rf photoinjector*. The THz seed laser is an optical parametric amplifier** pumped by a 1064-nm microchip laser and an external-cavity tunable diode laser. By varying the beam energy and undulator parameter, the radiation frequency of the THz FEL amplifier can be tunable in a broad spectral range between 1.5 and 3.0 THz. Moreover, to extract more radiation power from the electron beam within a short undulator, we employ a linearly tapered undulator in our design. The influence of the seed power on the electron-laser interaction in the undulator is studied in some detail for the FEL amplification. Our simulation results show that the radiation power of the THz FEL amplifier can achieve few MW with a 10-W seed power.

A design effort for a new generation of compact, cost-effective, power-efficient FEL facilities, based on X-band technology, has been launched. High-frequency X-band acceleration implies strong wakefields, tight alignment and mechanical tolerances, and challenging stability issues. In this paper a design is proposed for the injector and the linacs, including the two bunch compressors. RF gun and injector simulations have been performed, successfully meeting the stringent requirements in terms of minimum projected emittance, sliced emittance and minimum bunch length. In the design of the linac and bunch compressors wakefield effects and misalignment have been taken into account. Start-to-end tracking simulations through the optimized lattice are presented and discussed.

We present recent developments in the accelerator design of CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications), the proposed UK FEL test facility at Daresbury Laboratory. In order to prioritise FEL schemes requiring the shortest electron bunches, the layout has changed significantly to enable compression at higher energy. Four proposed modes of operation are defined and tracked from cathode to FEL using ASTRA. Supplementing these baseline mode definitions with CSR-enabled codes (such as CSRTRACK) where appropriate is in progress. The FEL layout is re-optimised to include shorter undulators with delay chicanes between each radiator.

An X-ray free electron laser can be built in an oscillator (XFELO) configuration by employing an X-ray cavity with Bragg mirrors such as diamond*. An XFELO at the 5th harmonic frequency may be implemented at the LCLS II using its 4 GeV superconducting linac. The XFELO will provide stable, coherent, high-spectral-purity hard x-rays. In addition, portions of its output may be enhanced by the LCLS amplifier for stable pulses of ultrashort duration determined by the electron bunch length. Much progress has been made recently on the feasibility of an XFELO: Analytical and numerical methods have been developed to compute the performance of a harmonic XFELO. The energy spread requirement over a sufficient length of the bunch can be met by temporal shaping of the photo-cathode drive laser**. Experiments at the APS have shown that Be-compound refractive lenses are suitable for a low-loss focusing and that the synthetic diamond crystals can withstand the intense x-ray exposure, in accord with estimates based on molecular dynamics considerations***. A strain-free mounting of thin diamond crystal (< 100 microns) can be realized by shaping a thick diamond into a blind alley****.

High efficiency, terawatt peak power X-ray Free Electron Lasers are a promising tool for enabling single molecule imaging and nonlinear science using X-rays. Increasing the efficiency of XFELs while achieving good longitudinal coherence can be achieved via self-seeding and undulator tapering. The efficiency of self-seeded XFELs is limited by two factors: the ratio of seed power to beam energy spread and the ratio of seed power to shot noise power. We present a method to overcome these limitations by producing a strong X-ray seed and amplifying it with a small energy spread beam. This is achieved by selectively suppressing lasing for part of the bunch in the SASE section. In this manner we can saturate with the seeding electrons and amplify the strong seed with 'fresh' electrons downstream of the monochromator. Simulations of this scenario are presented for two systems, an optimal superconducting undulator design and the LCLS. In the case of the LCLS we examine how betatron oscillations leading to selective suppression are induced by using the transverse wakefield of a parallel plate dechirper. We also discuss extending the selective suppression scheme to chirped electron bunches.

We present results on the commissioning of the two-module RadiaBeam / SLAC dechirper system at LCLS. This is the first installation and measurement of a corrugated dechirper at high energy (4.4 - 13.3 GeV), short pulses (< 200 fs) and while observing its effect on an operational FEL. Both the transverse and longitudinal wakefields allow more flexible electron beam tailoring. We verify that, for a single module at a given gap, the strength of the longitudinal wake on axis and the dipole near the axis agree well with the theoretical values. Using direct longitudinal phase space mapping and X-ray FEL spectrum measurements we demonstrate the energy chirp control capabilities.

Free electron lasers in the X-ray regime require a good slice alignment along the electron bunch to achieve their best performance. A transverse beam slice shift reduces this alignment and spoils projected emittance and optics matching. Coherent synchrotron radiation, specifically for over-compression going through full compression, and transverse wakefields are major contributors to this. In the case of the large-bandwidth operation, with a strong energy chirp on the bunch, this misalignments furthermore reduce the spectral bandwidth of the FEL pulse. Well-defined manipulation of dispersion allows to compensate for this slice centroid shifts, therefore enhancing lasing power and in case of the large bandwidth mode, spectral bandwidth. This work shows the first application of this correction on an X-ray FEL resulting in increase in beam-power and bandwidth.

We discuss the possibility of using the RadiBeam/SLAC dechirper recently installed at LCLS for measuring the bunch length of very short bunches, less than 1 fs perhaps as short as 100 atto second. When a bunch travels close to one of the jaws the particles of the bunch get a transverse kick depends upon the position of a particle in a bunch. The tail particles get more kick. The transverse force also gets a nonlinear dependence on the transverse position. The stretched bunch can be measured at the YAG screen that is 100 m downstream the dechirper. The most important aspect of this measurement is that that no synchronization is needed. The Green's function for the transverse kick was evaluated based on the precise wake field calculations of the dechirper corrugated structure*. Using this function we can restore the longitudinal shape of the bunch. This may also help to see if a bunch has any micro-bunch structure.

The LCLS-II is a high repetition rate, high average brightness free-electron laser (FEL) under construction at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The LCLS-II will include new major components: a high repetition-rate injector, a superconducting, CW (continuous wave), 4-GeV linac with a bunch compressor system, a 3-way beam spreader, with independent hard X-ray (HXR) and soft X-ray (SXR) FEL undulators. The design is based on the existing SLAC facilities, including the LCLS linac and beam transport lines. The new SXR line will utilize a variable-gap undulator sharing the same tunnel with the new HXR horizontal-gap vertically polarizing undulator that will replace the existing LCLS undulator. We describe the current state of the electron optics design and the latest developments.

With the aim of delivering a lower horizontal emittance beam to the users of the present SOLEIL ring, a systematic lattice study is carried out. The goal is to discover feasible optics solutions having the horizontal emittance notably lower than the present value of 3.9 nm rad, while fulfilling all the physical requirements and without changing the current magnet structure in the lattice. The strategy adopted is a cell-wise optimization of the linear lattices in the two types of double-bend cells that constitute the SOLEIL ring. In the second step they are concatenated via finer matching. A global scan of the 5 quadrupole families for the search of stable solutions is performed. The statistical properties are given. One can easily select possible solutions without matching. For the second type of cell having 10 quadrupole families, another scan of quadrupoles and a matching using a quadrupole triplet are applied for linear optics characteristics. Finally, the nonlinear optimization is performed with modern nonlinear optimization algorithms.

ThomX Compact X ray source is a 50 MeV storage ring, and a linear accelerator based on a photo-injector. As the electron beam in the ring will not be damped by synchrotron radiation, the transfer line should rely on a precise injection in the ring. In order to fulfill this requirement, especially in terms of optics function and orbit correction, different tools have been prepared and tested on the accelerator toolbox of Matlab Middle Layer. We will present the different tools and the underlying physics for the ThomX transfer line.

ThomX is a compact Compton based X-ray source under construction at LAL in Orsay (France). The ThomX facility is composed by a 50-70 MeV linac, a transfer line and a 18 meters long Storage Ring (SR). The Compton scattering between the 50 MeV electron bunch of 1 nC and the 30 mJ laser pulses stacked in the Fabry-Perot cavity results in the production of photons with energies (up to 90 keV) with a maximum flux of 1013 photons/s. The ThomX construction will start shortly aiming to be completed in the middle of 2017. The preparation to the SR commissioning as far as a control system and beam physics applications are concerned is progressing gradually in order to prepare and test all the tools well ahead the start of the machine. The SR commissioning will face with many challenges providing the low energy, compactness, the nonlinear beam dynamics, the limited beam storage and need for the precision and stabilization in the Interaction Region. Several techniques used at the Synchrotron Light Sources should be modified/adapted to meet all the specificity of the ThomX. This is a report on preparation of the ThomX SR commissioning, its  status, planning, main challenges and expectations.

Injection studies using a non-linear kicker for the Diamond storage ring have been carried out previously*. These studies have been recently extended to investigate whether the non-linear kicker can be located in the injection straight downstream of the septum and outside the existing dipole kicker bump. If so, injection with a non-linear kicker becomes independent of the optics used, making it suitable for use in both standard and low alpha mode. With this configuration, the existing injection scheme could also be left in place, leaving open the possibility to study both schemes in situ before potentially removing the existing dipole kickers at a later date. In order to operate with the non-linear kicker, the injected beam needs to exit the transfer line at an angle of 3mrad; this has been successfully demonstrated during machine development time. The concept and feasibility studies of this scheme are presented in this paper.
