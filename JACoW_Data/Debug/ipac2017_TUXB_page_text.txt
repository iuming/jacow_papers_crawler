This paper will present an overview and comparison between beam induced fluorescence, residual gas ionization and gas jet based beam profile monitors, based on recent experimental and theoretical results at different labs. The achievable image/profile quality and resolution limits will be discussed, along with design consideration for different particle species and primary beam energies. Details may be provided about different classic and novel approaches to gas jet shaping, including nozzle-skimmer and Freznel Zone Plate configurations. Finally, particular challenges such as those arising from monitoring multiple beams in parallel (e.g. proton and electron beam in HLLHC) and solutions for targeting the energy limit within the HLLHC project will be presented.
