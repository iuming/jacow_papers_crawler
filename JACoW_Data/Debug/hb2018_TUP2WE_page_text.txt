The SNS uses charge exchange injection to minimize losses during the accumulation of the accelerated beam in the ring. A stripper foil implements this by removing the electrons from the high intensity H− beam coming from the linac. At a beam power of 1.2 MW, the foil lasts for many weeks, sometimes months. However, given the upgrade to 2.8 MW, it is important to know the current temperature of stripper foil in order to estimate its lifetime for the new beam power and beam size. In this paper, we discuss several methods to measure the temperature of stripper foil exposed to current operating conditions of the SNS accelerator. Given the high radiation in the vicinity of the foil, the uncertainty in the foil's emissivity, and available resources, we chose a two-wavelength pyrometer that is located 40 m from the foil. The pyrometer is composed of two mirrors, a refracting telescope, and two photodiodes. We present the calibration data and the temporally resolved measurements made with this pyrometer.

A large flux of spallation neutrons will be produced at the European Spallation Source (ESS) by impinging high power proton beam on the tungsten target. Until the 5 MW proton beam is stopped by the spallation target, it travels through a number of beam intercepting devices (BIDs), which include the proton beam window, a multi-wire beam profile monitor, an aperture monitor, the beam entrance window, spallation material and the target shroud. The beam-induced thermo-mechanical loads and the damage dose rate in the BIDs are largely determined by the beam energy and the beam current density. At ESS, the proton beam energy will be commissioned step-wisely, from 570 MeV towards 2 GeV. The beam current density on the BIDs in the target station is equally painted by raster beam optics. The ESS Linac and its beam optics will create rectangular beam profiles on the target with varying beam intensities. In this paper, we study the impacts of different plausible beam intensities and beam energies on the thermo-mechanical loads and radiation damage rates in the BIDs at the ESS target station.

The radiation damage model in the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS) has been developed using the screened Coulomb scattering to evaluate the energy of the target Primary Knock on Atom (PKA) created by the projectile and the secondary particles which include all particles created from the sequential nuclear reactions. For the high-energy proton incident reactions, a target PKA created by the secondary particles was more dominant than a target PKA created by the projectile. To validate prediction of DPA values in metals irradiated by >100 MeV protons, we developed a proton irradiation device with a Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler to cryogenically cool wire samples. By using this device, the defect-induced electrical resistivity changes related to the DPA cross section of copper and aluminum were measured under irradiation with 125 and 200 MeV protons at cryogenic temperature. A comparison of the experimental DPA cross sections with the calculated results indicates that the athermal-recombination-corrected displacement damage (arc-dpa) provide better quantitative descriptions of the DPA cross section than NRT-dpa without defect production efficiencies.

The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) Project at CERN calls for increasing beam brightness and intensity. In this scenario most equipment has to be redesigned and rebuilt. In particular, beam intercepting devices (as dumps, collimators, absorbers and scrapers) have to withstand impact or scraping of the new intense HL-LHC beams without failures. Further, minimizing the electromagnetic beam-device interactions is also a key design driver since they can lead to beam instabilities and excessive thermo-mechanical loading of devices. In this context, the present study assesses the conceptual design quality of the new LHC injection dump, the Target Dump Injection Segmented (TDIS), from an electromagnetic and thermo-mechanical perspective. This contribution analyzes the thermo-mechanical response of the device considering two cases: an accidental beam impact scenario and another accidental scenario with complete failure of the RF-contacts. Further, this paper presents the preliminary results for the simulation of the energy deposited by the two counter-rotating beams circulating in the device.
