The AWAKE project at CERN uses a self-modulated §I{400}{GeV/c} proton bunch to drive GV/m wakefields in a §I10{m} long plasma with an electron density of npe = 7 × 1014 \rm{electrons/cm}3. We present the upgrade of a proton beam diagnostic to indirectly prove that the bunch self-modulated by imaging defocused protons with two screens downstream the end of the plasma. The two-screen diagnostic has been installed, commissioned and tested in autumn 2016 and limitations were identified. We plan to install an upgraded diagnostics to overcome these limitations.

Today's industrial ion source applications often require high beam currents with long source lifetime and low maintenance. Filament powered ion sources produce high beam currents but are limited by the short lifetime (~5000 mA*h) of the filament, while RF ion sources with external antennas do not require such maintenance. By changing the filament back plate of our TRIUMF licensed ion source to the ceramic window, planar coil antenna and 13.56 MHz RF amplifier of our University of Jyväskylä licensed ion source, we are able to directly compare the effect of the two technologies for powering sources on negative ion production in volume-cusp ion sources for the case of H-, D- and C2- using our ion source test facility.

FLASHForward is a beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration facility, currently under construction at DESY (Hamburg, Germany), aiming at the stable generation of electron beams of several GeV with small energy spread and emittance. High-quality 1 GeV-class electron beams from the free-electron laser FLASH will act as the wake driver. The setup will allow studies of external injection as well as density-downramp injection. With a triangular-shaped driver beam electron energies of up to 5 GeV from a few centimeters of plasma can be anticipated. Particle-In-Cell simulations are used to assess the feasibility of each technique and to predict properties of the accelerated electron bunches. In this contribution the current status of FLASHForward, along with recent experimental developments and upcoming scientific plans, will be reviewed.

Numerical simulations are heavily relied on for evaluating optimal working points with plasma accelerators and for predicting their performance. These simulations produce high volumes of complex data, which is often analyzed by scientists with individually prepared software and analysis tools. As a consequence, there is a lack of a commonly available, quick, complete and easy-to-use data visualizer for Particle-In-Cell simulation codes. VisualPIC is a new application created with the aim of filling that void, providing a graphical user interface with advanced tools for 2D and 3D data visualization, post-processing and particle tracking. The program is developed under the principles of open source and with a modular design, an approach and architecture which allow interested scientists to contribute by adding new features or compatibility for additional simulation codes.

The use of external injection in plasma acceleration is attractive due to the high control over the electron beam parameters, which can be tailored to meet the plasma requirements and therefore preserve its quality during acceleration. However, using this technique requires an extremely fine synchronization between the driver and witness beams. In this paper, we present a new scheme for external injection in a laser-driven plasma accelerator that would allow, for the first time, sub-femtosecond timing jitter between laser pulse and electron beam.

Plasma wakefield accelerators can be driven by either a powerful laser pulse (LWFA) or a high-current charged particle beam (PWFA). A plasma accelerator combining both schemes consists of a LWFA providing an electron beam which subsequently drives a PWFA in the highly nonlinear regime. This scenario explicitly makes use of the advantages unique to each method, particularly exploiting the capabilities of PWFA schemes to provide high-brightness beams, while the LWFA stage inherently fulfils the demand for compact high-current electron bunches required as PWFA drivers. Effectively, the sub-sequent PWFA stage operates as beam brightness and energy booster of the initial LWFA output, aiming to match the demanding beam quality requirements of accelerator based light sources. We report on numerical studies towards the implementation of a proof-of-principle experiment at the DRACO laser facility at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR).

External injection into laser wakefield accelerators is one of the possible routes towards high energy, high quality electron beams through plasma acceleration. Among other reasons this is due to the increased control over the electron beam parameters and overall experimental setup when compared to other plasma schemes, such as controlled self-injection. At the future SINBAD (Short INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility at DESY this technique is planned to be tested experimentally through injection and acceleration of a sub-femtosecond electron beam, produced from a conventional RF-injector, with a charge of around 0.7 pC and initial mean energy of 100 MeV at the plasma entrance. A summary of optimisation steps for the potential experimental setup is presented in this paper, including considerations regarding effects of electron beam self-fields and matching of the beam into the plasma stage. The discussion is complemented by first start-to-end simulations of the plasma accelerator setup based on these findings.

A linear beam transport system, experimentally tested at the Laser Wakefield Accelerator in Jena, Germany, has been carefully analyzed in order to gain a deeper understanding of the experimental results and to develop experimental strategies for the future. This analysis encompassed a detailed characterization of the focusing magnets and an investigation of the effects of source parameters as well as magnet and alignment errors on the observables accessible in the experiment. A dedicated tracking tool was developed for these investigations. In this contribution we review the main results of these studies.

A proof-of-principle experiment for the AWAKE experiment is ongoing at the Photo-Injector Test Facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ). The goal of the experiment is to observe and measure the energy and density self-modulation of a long electron beam passing through a laser-generated Lithium plasma*. Key devices of the experiment are a heat pipe based plasma cell, a photocathode laser system which enables production of long electron beams with sharp rising edges and well-developed diagnostics at PITZ, including a transverse deflecting cavity and a high-resolution electron spectrometer. In this report we present the current status of the experiment, including the latest updates of the experimental setup. The plasma cell is a lithium heat pipe oven with inert gas buffers at all input/output ports. An ArF ionization laser is coupled through side ports. Main improvements of the second generation plasma cell are an altered geometry of side arms and a new heat pipe design. Among other updates are an improved ArF laser beamline and new electron windows. We present here measurements of plasma density and homogeneity as well as results of beam transport studies for the experiment.

Plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the acceleration of particles in a plasma wakefield driven by high current-density particle bunches, is one of the most promising candidates for a future compact accelerator technology. A key aspect of this type of acceleration is the ratio between the accelerating fields experienced by a witness beam and the decelerating fields experienced by the drive beam, called the transformer ratio. As for longitudinally symmetrical bunches this ratio is limited by the fundamental theorem of beamloading to 2 in the linear regime*, a transformer ratio above this limit is considered high. This can be reached by using a modulated drive bunch or a shaped train of drive bunches. So far, only the latter case has been shown for wakefields in a RF-structure**. We show the experimental setup, simulations and first, preliminary results of high transformer ratio acceleration experiments at the Photoinjector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ).

Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) represents a very reliable technique to carry out non-invasive measurements of plasma density and plasma temperature in the range of tens of eV. Instead of other diagnostics, it also allows to characterize the different populations of neutrals and ionized particles constituting the plasma. At INFN-LNS, OES techniques have been developed and applied to characterize the plasma generated by the Flexible Plasma Trap, an ion source used as testbench of the proton source built for European Spallation Source. This work presents the characterization of the parameters of a hydrogen plasma in different conditions of neutral pressure, microwave power and magnetic field profile along with the perspectives for further upgrades of the OES diagnostics system.

The fundamental aspect of coupling between microwave and plasma of the Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) and Microwave Discharge Ion Source (MDIS) is hereinafter treated together with ad hoc microwave-based plasma diagnostics, as a key element for the next progress and variations with respect to the classical ECR heating mechanism. The future challenges for the production of higher-charge states, higher beam intensity, and high absolute ionization efficiency also demand for the exploration of new heating schemes and synergy between experiments and modeling. An overview concerning microwave transport and coupling issues in plasma-based ion sources for particle accelerator will be given in the paper, along with perspectives for the design of next generation sources.

Plasma wakefield acceleration is the most promising acceleration technique known nowadays, able to provide very high accelerating fields (10-100 GV/m), enabling acceleration of electrons to GeV energy in few centimeters. Here we present all the plasma related activities currently underway at SPARC_LAB exploiting the high power laser FLAME. In particular, we will give an overview of the single shot diagnostics employed: Electro Optic Sampling (EOS) for temporal measurement and optical transition radiation (OTR) for an innovative one shot emittance measurements. In detail, the EOS technique has been employed to measure for the first time the longitudinal profile of electric field of fast electrons escaping from a solid target, driving the ions and protons acceleration, and to study the impact of using different target shapes. Moreover, a novel scheme for one shot emittance measurements based on OTR, developed and tested at SPARC_LAB LINAC, used in an experiment on electrons from laser wakefield acceleration still undergoing, will be shown.

Plasma Wakefield Accelerators are based on the excitation of large amplitude plasma waves excited by either a laser or a particle driver beam. The amplitude of the waves, as well as their spatial dimensions and the consequent accelerating gradient depend strongly on the background electron density along the path of the accelerated particles. The process needs stable and reliable plasma sources, whose density profile must be controlled and properly engineered to ensure the appropriate accelerating mechanism. Plasma confinement inside gas filled capillaries have been studied in the past since this technique allows to control the evolution of the plasma, ensuring a stable and repeatable plasma density distribution during the interaction with the drivers. Moreover, in a gas filled capillary plasma can be pre-ionized by a current discharge to avoid ionization losses. Different capillary geometries have been studied to allow the proper temporal and spatial evolution of the plasma along the acceleration length. Results of this analysis obtained by varying the length and the number of gas inlets will be presented.

High transformer ratio (HTR) Plasma Wakefield Accelerator (PWFA) based on shaped electron bunches is an important topic of plasma wakefield acceleration for future light sources and colliders [1]. To explore the possibility of implementing PWFA at SXFEL, we performed 3D PIC simulations using shaped electron beam parameters obtained by start-to-end beam line simulations [2]. The PIC simulations show that an average transformer ratio around 4 can be maintained for about 10 cm long low density plasma, and the energy gain of the trailing bunch eventually reaches 5.9 GeV. Simulations and analysis are also performed to check the effects of transverse beam size on HTR acceleration. In addition, plasma density downramp injection has also been tested as a possible high brightness injection method for HTR acceleration, and preliminary results will be presented.

We present the study of positrons capturing dynamics in the wakefield of plasma generated either by a laser or electron beam. Only simplified linear wakefield models were used as first order approximation. By analysing the phase space and beam dynamics, we show that phase space for capturing is rather small, only high brightness beam with very short pulse length can be captured with reasonable rate for wakefields of 1 - 10 GeV/m and wave-length of 100 micron.

With the main aim of a compact machine for 18F and 11C radioisotope production, AMIT cyclotron relies on a superconducting 4T magnet with an internal cold cathode PIG ion source for H− production. Given the limited access to the ion source in the cyclotron as well the reduced number of beam diagnostics, an experimental facility was proposed for the commissioning of such ion source. The versatility of this test bench, which includes a movable puller, gives us the opportunity to validate and characterize the ion source behavior as well as to optimize the H− production. In a first stage, the discharge characteristics of the ion source has been studied in the CIEMAT IST facilities.

Beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration is an acceleration scheme promising accelerating fields of at least two to three orders of magnitude higher than in conventional radiofrequency accelerating structures. The scheme relies on using a charged particle bunch (driver) to drive a non-linear plasma wake, into which a second bunch (witness) can be injected at an appropriate distance behind the first, yielding a substantial energy gain of the witness bunch particles. This puts very special demands on the machine providing the particle beam. In this article, we use simulations to show that, if driver-witness-bunches can be generated in the photo-cathode electron gun, the MAX IV Linear Accelerator could be used for plasma-wakefield acceleration.

AWAKE will be the first proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment worldwide. The facility is located in the former CNGS area at CERN and will include a proton, laser and electron beam line merging in a 10 m long plasma cell, which is followed by the experimental diagnostics. In the first phase of the AWAKE physics program, which started at the end of 2016, the effect of the plasma on a high energy proton beam will be studied. A proton bunch is expected to experience the so called self-modulation instability, which leads to the creation of micro-bunches within the long proton bunch. The plasma channel is created in a rubidium vapor via field ionization by a TW laser pulse. This laser beam has to overlap with the proton beam over the full length of the plasma cell, resulting in tight requirements for the stability of the proton beam at the plasma cell in the order of ~ 0.1 mm. In this paper the beam commissioning results of the ~810 m long transfer line for proton bunches with 3·1011 protons/bunch and a momentum of 400 GeV/c will be presented with a focus on the challenges of the parallel operation of the laser and proton beam.

National Science Center Kharkov Institute of Physics & Technology (NSC KIPT) together with ANL, Chicago, USA developed up to date scientific facility that is Neutron Source on the base of subcritical assembly driven with 100 MeV/100 kW electron accelerator. During bombarding of the Tungsten or Uranium targets the electron beam generates the original neutrons that are multiplied in the facility core of low enriched uranium trough the fission process. The maximal value of the neutron multiplication factor is 0.98. So the total neutron flux output is increased as much as 50 times and is 2·10 13 n·cm-2·c-1. The subcriticality of the system eliminates the possibility of self-sustained chain reaction existence that increases the nuclear safety of the facility drastically. The neutron source mentioned above is the first facility of such type in the world. The results that will be obtained at studies of neutron characteristics of the neutron source with low enriched uranium core and during optimization of the operation modes of the facility systems will became the scientific background for the further development of the safe, ecological nuclear energetics of the future.

FFAGs have been considered for a high power proton source for a neutron target by means of an internal target. In an internal target type ring, protons are repeatedly passed through a thin foil, producing neutrons and other secondary particles. This technique has the potential to produce higher secondary particle fluxes with modest beam currents and energies. Scattering of the protons causes emittance growth in the beam, but this can be partially offset by energy lost through ionisation of the foil, which causes ionisation cooling. The resultant beams typically have large position and momentum spread, with transverse emittances of order mm. In this paper, the design of a solenoid-focussing ring is studied which may enable containment of large emittance beams.

Compact storage rings require a compact acceleration solution. We propose the use of a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) as an injector for compact electron storage rings to produce synchrotron radiation. In particular, we study the injection of 0.7 GeV and 3 GeV electrons into the DIAMOND storage ring and consider implications for future storage ring design. Whilst laser-based acceleration is well-known as a driver for future electron-positron colliders and future free-electron lasers, here we propose it is also advantageous to provide electrons for 3rd-generation storage rings. The electron beams produced by LWFAs have a naturally very small emittance around 1 nm and moderate energy spread of a few percent. Combining these beam parameters with the compact size of a LWFA makes them highly favourable compared to traditional linac or booster synchrotron injector chains.chains.

Protons that collide at the interaction points of the FCC-hh may contribute to the background in the subsequent detector. Due to the high luminosity of the proton beams this may be of concern. Using DPMJET-III to model 50 TeV proton-proton collisions, tracking studies have been performed with PTC and MERLIN in order to gauge the elastic and inelastic proton cross-talk. High arc losses, particularly in the dispersion suppressor regions, have been revealed. These losses originate mainly from particles with a momentum deviation, either from interaction with a primary collimator in the betatron cleaning insertion, or from the proton-proton collisions. This issue can be mitigated by introducing additional collimators in the dispersion suppressor region. The specific design, lattice integration, and the effect of these collimators on cross-talk is assessed.

The Muon Accelerator Program (MAP) completed a four-year study on the feasibility of muon colliders and on using stored muon beams for neutrinos. That study was broadly successful in its goals, establishing the feasibility of lepton colliders from the 125 GeV Higgs Factory to more than 10 TeV, as well as exploring using a ' storage ring (MSR) for neutrinos, and establishing that MSRs could provide factory-level intensities of 'e (''e) and ''' ('') beams. The key components of the collider and neutrino factory systems were identified. Feasible designs and detailed simulations of all of these components were obtained, including some initial hardware component tests, setting the stage for future implementation where resources are available and clearly associated physics goals become apparent.

An FPGA based fast orbit feedback system developed at the Australian Synchrotron aims to improve the stability of the electron beam by reducing the impact of moving insertion devices and targeting orbit perturbations at the mains frequency (50 Hz, 100 Hz and 300 Hz). The feedback system uses a PI controller with harmonic suppressors in parallel to specifically target perturbations at the mains frequency and its harmonics. This report will present the results of the commissioning of the FOFB system demonstrating a reduction in the integrated RMS motion up to 300 Hz by 75% to 90%.

In order to generate time structured synchrotron radiation the 6GeV ESRF storage ring can be operated with 16 buckets filled with 15nC separated by 16 gaps of 61 nearly perfectly empty buckets. The contrast required by some users between the population of the main and empty buckets is 1011. In order to obtain these empty buckets some RF knock out (cleaning) of the parasitic bunches is needed. Until now this cleaning was performed on the beam stored in the storage ring. Recently we have started to deliver this 16 bunches filling in a so called top up mode, drastically increasing the rate of the storage ring refills. In this top up mode it is very penalizing to perform the cleaning in the storage ring so we are now performing it in the booster synchrotron which accelerates the 200MeV beam coming from the linac up to 6GeV. We describe the set up used to perform the cleaning in the booster and all the measurement and experiments performed in order to correctly understand the origin of the unwanted electrons populating buckets of the gaps separating the 16 main bunches.

The Berlin Energy Recovery Linac Prototype (BERLinPro) at Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin (HZB) aims to deliver a continuous-wave (cw) electron beam of high average current (100 mA) and brilliance (normalized emittance below 1 mm mrad). The achievement of these demanding goals depends significantly on the performance of the electron source, a superconducting RF (SRF) photoinjector. A critical component for the quality of the generated beam is the superconducting solenoid magnet. In order to optimize its operation and minimize parasitic contributions, special attention has been given to the precise alignment of this element using a hexapod mover. Due to the strict limitations inside a cryostat, a complex coupling between the solenoid in vacuum and the hexapod in air has been realized, requiring sophisticated software and hardware mechanisms to prevent collisions. Along with this setup, the developed beam-based alignment procedure and its performance are demonstrated in this article.

Neutron radiation fields at synchrotron light sources are caused by bremsstrahlung from electron losses in accelerator components. Inside the enclosure and in transversal direction neutron and gamma radiation is of the same order of magnitude but high energy neutrons are much more penetrating. This causes outside the shielding neutron spectra with two broad maxima at about 1 MeV and 100 MeV. Standard Anderson-Braun or Leake neutron monitors measure thermalized neutrons in a proportional counter tube by nuclear reactions which limits the measurement range to neutron energies < 10 MeV. This implies two considerable systematic errors: Pulsed neutron beams causes dead-time losses due to the time structure of injections and the moderators are not sufficient to moderate high energy neutrons down to thermal energies. We determined and fixed these measurement errors by faster preamplifiers and by a more effective moderator developed by us, which expands the measurement range up to several GeV. Examples of the application at BESSY are presented.

A new steering software for cycle-to-cycle closed orbit as well as trajectory control is currently under development for FAIR's planned control system. It has been successfully tested with beam at the SIS18 in 2016. COAT (i.e., Controlling Orbits And Trajectories) has been realized as a distributed, Java-based application. It consists of a background daemon process that handles the actual beam-based feedback logic, and independent clients that provide visualization and various user-interaction capabilities. Built on top of the LSA settings management system, code-shared and also used at CERN, the system is kept generic. Furthermore, it is designed to support multiple accelerators, transfer lines and users in parallel. In particular, it can handle continuously changing optics and other in advance known changing beam parameters. The COAT computer program is part of a set of newly developed beam-based feedback tools* for FAIR. Preliminary results of our proof-of-concept prototype studies indicate, e.g., in view of the observed SIS18 machine reproducibility, that such a cycle-to-cycle feedback control scheme may be adequate also for the other FAIR accelerators and transfer lines.

The 'Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research' (FAIR) presently under construction, extends and supersedes GSI's existing infrastructure. Its core challenges include the precise control of highest proton and uranium ion beam intensities, the required extreme high vacuum conditions, machine protection and activation issues while providing a high degree of multi-user mode of operation with facility reconfiguration on time-scales of a few times per week. To optimise turn-around times and to establish a safe and reliable machine operation, a comprehensive suite of semi-automated measurement applications, as well as fully-automated beam-based feedbacks will be deployed, covering the control of orbit, Q/Q', spill structure, optics, and other machine parameters. These systems are based on the LSA settings management framework, code-shared with and also used at CERN. The concepts, software architecture and first prototype beam tests at the SIS18 in 2016 are presented. As an initial proof-of-concept, a cycle-to-cycle orbit* and macro-spill feedback, as well as a semi-automated magnetic quadrupole- and sextupole-centre measurement tool have been selected.

The 'Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research' (FAIR) which is presently under construction, extends and supersedes the existing GSI. Present operation still largely relies on laborious manual tuning based on analogue signals routed directly to the existing control room. The substantial scope increase from 3 to more than 8 FAIR accelerators requires more intricate and precise control across longer accelerator chains, while providing a high degree of multi-user operation, with facility reconfiguration required on time-scales of a few times per week. A new FAIR Control Centre (FCC) is being planned to accommodate the required larger accelerator crews as well as accelerator-based experiments. While targeting a single control room for up to ~35 people, emphasis is put on ergonomics, operational processes, and minimising unnecessary strain on personnel already during the design stage. This contribution presents digital control room concepts, console layout, and beam-production-chain paradigms aimed at achieving good operational performances and that influence the new FCC design. Prior to FCC completion, interim upgrade options of the existing control room are being investigated.

During acceleration in SIS18/SIS100 at GSI/FAIR longitudinal beam-oscillations are expected to occur. To reduce emittance blow-up, dedicated LLRF beam feedback systems are planned. To date longitudinal beam oscillations have been damped in machine experiments with a finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter controller with 3 filter taps[1]. An alternative approach implementing the FIR filter as a derivative estimator controller is simulated and tested. This approach shares the same controller topology and can therefore be easily integrated in the system. It exploits the fact that the sampling rate of the feedback hardware is considerably higher than the frequency of the beam oscillations. It is therefore capable of damping oscillations without overshoot within one oscillation period.

The presentation provides an overview of the ChimeraTK framework. The project started from a demand for software libraries that provide convenient access to PCIE bus based cards on the MicroTCA.4 platform. Previously called MTCA4U, ChimeraTK is evolving towards a set of frameworks and tools that enable users to build up control applications, while abstracting away specifics of the underlying system. Initially, the focus of the project was the DeviceAccess C++ library and its bindings for Matlab and Python, along with a Qt based client that used DeviceAccess under the hood. However, ChimeraTK has expanded to include more tools like the ControlSystemAdapter, VirtualLab and ApplicationCore. The ControlSystemAdapter framework focuses on tools that enable application code to be written in a middle ware agnostic manner. VirtualLab focuses on facilitating testing of application code and providing functional mocks. The ApplicationCore library aims at unifying application interfaces to other tools in the toolkit and improving abstraction. We present an update on improvements to the project and discuss motivations and applications for these new set of tools introduced into the toolkit.

The Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) at Forschungszentrum Jülich is currently carrying out the preparation for a direct measurement of the electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of the deuteron using an RF Wien filter*,**. In a magnetic storage ring with the spin vector aligned along the direction of motion, the EDM manifests in a buildup of the vertical spin component. Besides this signal, radial magnetic fields due to a distortion of the vertical closed orbit can produce a similar signal. This signal is a systematic limit of the proposed measurement procedure. Based on simulation studies***, a vertical closed orbit distortion with a RMS smaller than 0.1 mm is required to achieve a sensitivity of 10-19 e.cm or better. In order to accomplish this challenging goal, a slow orbit feedback system was proposed and recently commissioned at COSY. The design and commissioning results will be presented, and the future plan will also be discussed.

The Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) develops, tests and characterizes high brightness electron sources for FLASH and European XFEL. Since these FELs work with superconducting accelerators in pulsed mode, also the corresponding normal-conducting RF gun has to operate with long RF pulses. Generating high beam quality from the photo-cathode RF gun in addition requires a high accelerating gradient at the cathode. Therefore, the RF gun has to ensure stable and reliable operation at high average RF power, e.g. 6.5 MW peak power in the gun for 650 μs RF pulse length and 10 Hz repetition rate for the European XFEL. Several RF gun setups have been operated towards these goals over the last years. The latest gun setup is in operation since March 2016 and includes RF Gun 4.6 with an improved contact spring design. The RF input distribution consists of a coaxial coupler, a T-combiner and 2 RF windows from DESY production. In this contribution we will present statistics on the high average power operation and results from the characterization of the produced electron beam.

The electron guns at PITZ, FLASH and European XFEL are standing wave structures which operate at high average power (>40 kW) to produce long trains of high quality beams. This amount of power heats the cavity surface enough to change signi'cantly the gun resonance frequency. As consequence, to keep the re'ection low, the RF power ramp must be enough slow to permit the water cooling system to keep the gun temperature close to the set-point. Also, as the temperature probe sits close to the surface of the iris, the required gun temperature set-point to maintain the gun on resonance is a function of the average power. The RF power ramping is a difficult process in which temperature and re'ection must be monitored to adjust accordingly the temperature set-point and the ramping speed of the RF power. An automatic software to adjust the RF frequency and the temperature set-point of the PITZ gun in parallel to the RF power ramping has been developed. The use of this software has signi'cantly reduced the time spent to start up the gun or to recover from interlocks, increasing the time spent at nominal parameters which would also be very important for user facilities.

A transverse intra-bunch feedback system is currently under study at CERN for the SPS, to mitigate beam instabilities caused by electron clouds and coupled transverse modes (TMCI). This feedback system is designed for a bandwidth of 1 GHz, and based on a digital feedback controller and broadband power amplifiers. For the kicker, a periodic, quasi-TEM slotted transmission-line structure is foreseen which promises to meet the bandwidth requirements. This paper discusses the electromagnetic design and the mechanical implementation of a prototype kicker, demonstrating its performance and limitations based on numerical simulations.

IPM E-Linac is a 10 MeV electron linear accelerator presently under construction at Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM). It will accelerate electron from 45 keV to 10 MeV along the 160 cm accelerating tube. One of the beam energy measurement devices is designed based on the production of bremsstrahlung radiation. Target of the electron linac presents a key role in the production of bremsstrahlung. In this paper, we present the simulation results for an investigation on the bremsstrahlung radiation production based on target thickness, radius and atomic number, Z. We have applied Fluka Monte Carlo code for collecting the dose equiva-lent of generated bremsstrahlung along the target central axis at 30cm located downstream the target.

The new Gamma Beam System (GBS), within the ELI-NP project, under installation in Magurele (RO) by INFN, as part of EuroGammas consortium, can provide gamma rays that open new possibilities for nuclear photonics and nuclear physics. ELI-GBS gamma rays are produced by Compton back-scattering to get monochromaticity (0,1% bandwidth), high flux (1013 photon/s the highest in the world), tunable directions and energies up to 19 MeV. Such gamma beam is obtained when a high-intensity laser collides a high-brightness electronbeam with energies up to 720 MeV. The RF-Gun, made with the novel clamping gasket technique, working in '-mode at 100 Hz with a max. RF input of 16 MW, RF peak field of 120 MV/m and filling time of 420 ns was fully tested and conditioned few month ago at ELSA. This paper will describe the real-time fast-interlock system based on waveform mask technique used during RF Gun conditioning in order to monitor on-line reflected RF signals for a faster pulse-to-pulse detection of breakdowns and to ensure the safety of Gun and modulator tripping such devices before next RF pulse.

An advanced Machine Protection System was developed in order to ensure proper operation for this challenging facility. Such system operate on different layers of the control system to be interfaced with all sub-systems of the control system. It's equipped with different beam loss monitors based on Cherenkov optical fiber, hall probes, fast current transformer together with BPM and an embedded system based on FPGA with distributed I/O over EtherCAT to monitor vacuum and RF systems which requires fast response to be interlocked within the next RF pulse.

Norway contributes in kind to the building of ESS. Part of this work concerns the human factors aspects of the control-rooms for the operators of the machine. IFE is applying international standards on human factors (e.g., ISO 11064) to the design of the main control-room (MCR) and a local control-room (LCR). The work is also intended to satisfy regulatory requirements. So far, for the MCR, we have completed a concept design. User requirements clarification involved interviews with stakeholders and visits to similar facilities. Concept design for the MCR was iterative and involved a user reference-group set up for the project. During several workshops, alternatives for layout and workstations were discussed and modeled using 3D graphics. The chosen concept design and 3D model were then checked against standards. The resulting design was approved by the user-group and now goes forward to detailed design and realization. We have also completed detailed design of the LCR so that it is available for commissioning before the MCR is built. IFE also contributes to the human-machine interface design in other projects, such as for alarm system design and a logbook software application.

The interlock system is an essential component for an accelerator facility. A configurable software interlock system(SIS) is designed for Hefei Light Source II (HLS-II), which complements the hardware interlock system to ensure equipment and operators' safety. The system is developed using Python under the EPICS framework with the method of separating the configuration file from the interlock program. The interlock logic is completely determined by the configuration file and its nested tree structure is easy to expand. The test results indicate that the new software interlock system is reliable, flexible and convenient to operate. This paper will describe the design and the construction of HLS-II SIS.

With the development of technology and theory of particle accelerator, the new particle accelerators will be built in the near future. Comparing with the running accelerators, higher efficiency and accuracy of installation and alignment are required. It is necessary for all the storage ring magnets to be placed with a high relative accuracy to meet the stringent demands of accelerator physics. Smoothing analysis is a practical method considering both relative accuracy and work efficiency. This article mainly introduces the principle and application of smoothing analysis.

This article describes a software for smoothing magnet track in particle accelerator. This paper introduces the development process of the software from the aspects of interface design, algorithm analysis, parameter meaning and so on. Magnet track smoothing means that under the conditions of meeting absolute accuracy, if the relative position error of the adjacent magnet is too large, it will cause the loss of beam, we call the track curve is not smooth enough. Smooth analysis can find these magnet components, the curve is smooth after a reasonable ad-justment. The software is based on the least square method. The software is tested by using the data of HLS storage ring, the results meet the needs of the work.

The Hefei Light Source (HLS) is undergoing a series of upgrades to prepare for the top-off operation. To ensure radiation safety in the experimental hall under abnormal beam loss, simulations under various system errors in the HLS storage ring are performed to get in-depth understanding of the induced radiation nature. To make the radiation shielding more effective, a beam scraper is used to decrease the aperture opening of the vacuum chamber, and additional shielding is installed around the scraper. Simulation and beam test results are reported in this paper.

Superconducting devices in particle accelerator demand strict operating environment: cryostat with ultra high vacuum and almost absolute zero temperature 2K-4K. This brings a big problem to survey and alignment work: how to preserve the magnets alignment precision in the cryostat, especially after such a big range temperature change. The complicate structure of magnet girder and cryogenic pipes make it difficult to do precise contraction simulation. So wire position monitor (WPM) is designed to measure the device contraction in cryomodule. Accelerator Driven System (ADS) Injector-I is a proton Linac, WPM system was assembled in its first cyomodule TCM. WPM is precisely calibrated, assembled at the same height as magnets. System noise, contraction stability and repeatability are analyzed in detail. Contraction coefficient of girder system is calculated by contraction data and temperature data, the result matches with the thermal coefficient of stainless steel very well. After commissioning, two thermal cycles were recorded, average contraction value was 1.35mm. The commissioning data shows about 0.2mm contraction difference with the same girder structure.

Now when a failure on the China Accelerator Driven System (CADS) is detected, the beam will be stopped by the machine protection system (MPS) immediately. But because of the demand of the beam trip (more than 5 min) rate which should be less than 50 times per year [1], it is important to avoid cutting beam down or recover the beam in a short time. The compensation and rematch is of great importance. If the failure is on a cavity, the other cavities should retune to compensate the beam energy, position and phase in order to recover the beam in short time depending on the time of online calculation.

A free-electron laser terahertz radiation source(THz-FEL) with a table-top scale is constructed in Huazhong University of Science & Technology. The whole facility is under joint-debugging currently, and main measured parameters have already matched with design targets. This paper describes the main control system of the Linac-based injector, especially auto-matching and auto-commissioning modules. The former occurs at the begin of daily operation, which contains one key pre-heating and searching the best electric parameters and RF parameters automatically based on last operation status. The later applies in beam commissioning for both Linac and transport line combining with beam diagnostic system, which could save operation time and improve commissioning efficiency. Moreover, real-time monitoring and controlling for water-cooling and vacuum states are inserted in the main control system to protect the accelerator.

The storage ring which is located in the National Synchrotron Radiation Center SOLARIS works under the TANGO control system. So far the correction of an electron beam orbit has been performed with an algorithm implemented in the Matlab Middle Layer (MML). To ensure consistency of the correction process with the entire control system, a new implementation of this algorithm has been developed. The algorithm of orbit correction based on SVD has been implemented as a TANGO Device, which is one of the fundamental blocks used in the Tango control system. The entire code has been written in the Python.

A single vertical beam halo collimation system has been installed in ATF2 in March 2016 to reduce the background in the IP and Post-IP region. In this paper, we present the results of an experimental program carried out during 2016 in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the vertical collimation system and measure the wakefields induced by such a system. Furthermore, a comparison of the measurements of the collimation system wakefield impact with CST PS numerical simulations and analytical calculations is also presented.

In the framework of the PACMAN project we have developed a test set-up to measure the electromagnetic centre of high gradient accelerating structures for alignment purposes. We have demonstrated with previous simulation studies that a resolution of 1 m is possible. The improvements applied on the technique and on the set-up, calibrations and the equipment instrumentation allows the measurement of the electromagnetic centre, with a final precision of 1.09 m in the horizontal plane and 0.58 m in the vertical plane. The experimental measurements and the simulation studies as a support to justify the numbers obtained are presented and discussed.

The objectives of the PACMAN* project are to improve the precision and accuracy of the alignment of accelerator components. Two steps of alignment are concerned: the fiducialisation, i.e. the determination of the reference axis of components w.r.t alignment targets, and the initial alignment of components on a common support assembly. The main accelerator components considered for the study are quadrupoles, 15 GHz BPM and RF structures from the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) project. Different methods have been developed to determine the reference axis of these components with a micrometric accuracy, as well as to determine the position of this reference axis in the coordinate frame of the common support assembly. The tools and methods developed have been validated with success on dedicated test setups using CLIC components. This paper will provide a compilation of the main achievements and results obtained.
* PACMAN is an acronym for a study on Particle Accelerator Components' Metrology and Alignment to the Nanometre scale.

The European Spallation Source target system is, together with the proton linac, the main component in the spallation process. ESS will use a 4-ton, helium-cooled, rotating tungsten target for this purpose, and its protection and availability is paramount to the success of ESS. High demands are placed on all of the target equipment, including cooling, movement, rotation, and timing, in order to reach the facility-wide 95% availability goal for neutron production. Machine protection has defined a set of protection functions that are to be implemented for the target system. This paper describes the development of these protection functions through the use of classic HAZOPs combined with modern safety standard lifecycle management. The implementation of these functions is carried out through close collaboration between the target system owners and the machine protection group at ESS.

The European Spallation Source faces a great challenge in succeeding with its ambitious availability goals. The aim is to construct a machine that allows for 95% availability for neutron beam production. This goal requires a robust protection system that allows for high availability by continuously monitoring and acting on the machine states, in order to avoid long facility downtimes and optimize the operation at any stage. The normal conducting section consists of the first 48 meters of the machine, and performs the initial acceleration, bunching, steering, and focusing of the beam, which sets it up for optimal transition into the superconducting section. Through a fit-for-purpose risk management process, a set of protection functions has been identified. The risk identification, analysis, and treatment were done in compliance with modern safety and ISO standards. This ensures that the risks, in this case downtime and equipment damage, are properly prevented and mitigated. This paper describes this process of defining the protection functions for the normal conducting linac at ESS.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a collabora-tion of 17 European countries to build the world's most powerful neutron source for research. ESS is under con-struction since 2014 and it will produce first neutrons in 2019. The linear proton accelerator is composed of nor-mal conducting sections plus the superconducting linac. When operational, such facilities include various hazards, such as ionizing radiation, high voltage and oxygen defi-ciency. The accelerator Personal Safety System (PSS) limits exposure to them and ensures personnel safety in the accelerator tunnel. It will be developed in accordance with IEC 61508 standard (Functional Safety of Electri-cal/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems), which has become a good practice in similar facilities to develop safety related systems. This paper gives an overview of the accelerator PSS and its subsys-tems. The progress of the accelerator PSS design and the selected software and hardware technologies will also be described.

Approximately 350 resistive magnets, 110 vacuum gate valves and 30 interceptive devices will be installed in the 600 m long linear accelerator at ESS, transporting the proton beam from the source to the target station. In order to protect this equipment from damage and to take the appropriate actions required to minimise recovery time, a dedicated set of PLC based interlock systems are being designed. The magnet powering interlock system will safely switch off a Power Converter (PC) upon the detection of an internal magnet or PC failure. The interceptive devices interlock system will protect Faraday cups, wire scanners, EMUs and LBMs from a beam mode that they cannot withstand by allowing/removing permission for movement. The vacuum gates interlock system will protect the gate valves in case of unexpected closing. The target interlock system will protect the target system by acting on motors, compressors, etc. These interlock systems will inform the beam interlock system to inhibit further beam operation by stopping beam if required. The methodology, design and physical deployment of the four interlock systems will be presented.

FREIA (Facility for REsearch and Instrumentation for Accelerator development) Laboratory at Uppsala University, Sweden, is a new facility, inaugurated 2013. Initially FREIA is testing and developing superconducting accelerating cavities and high power RF sources in collaboration with the European Spallation Source (ESS). Later projects include testing of superconducting cavities and magnets for the high luminosity LHC. The high level control, alarm system and archiving is implemented in EPICS. Presently this includes a helium liquefaction plant, a horizontal test cryostat, two high power RF amplifiers, a low level RF system, environment monitoring and safety systems. Some attention will be given to integration of commercially acquired systems as well as the safety system, interlocks and radiation monitoring. The implementation of the EPICS environment follows closely that of ESS and thus can provide a test bench for developments at ESS.

To increase by more than 10 times the luminosity reach w.r.t the first 10 years of the LHC lifetime, the HL-LHC project will replace nearly 1.2 km of the accelerator during the Long Shutdown 3 scheduled in 2024 [1][2][3]. This paper presents the HL-LHC alignment and internal metrology requirements of all the new components to be installed, from the magnet components to the beam instrumentation and vacuum devices. As for the LHC, a combination of Hydrostatic Levelling Sensors (HLS) and Wire Positioning Sensors (WPS) is proposed for the alignment of the main components, but on a longer distance (210 m instead of 50 m), generating technical challenges for the installation of the stretched wire and for the maintenance of the alignment systems. Innovative measurements methods and instrumentation are under study to perform the position monitoring inside a cryostat of cold masses and crab cavities, in a cold (2K) and radioactive (1 MGy/year) environment, as well as to carry remote measurements in the tunnel of the intermediary components. The proposed solutions concerning the determination of the position and the re-adjustment of the components are detailed in this paper.

Modelling the Radioactivity Induced by Slow-Extraction Losses in the CERN SPS

Resonant slow extraction is used to provide an intense quasi-DC flux of high-energy protons for the Fixed Target (FT) physics programme at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The unavoidable beam loss intrinsic to the extraction process activates the extraction region and its equipment. Although the radiation dose to equipment has an impact on availability, the cool-down times required to limit dose to the personnel carrying-out maintenance of the accelerator also pose important restrictions, and ultimately limit the number of protons on target. In order to understand how the extracted proton flux affects the build-up and subsequent cool-down of the induced activation, a model based on a simple empirical relationship has been developed and shown to predict the measured radioactive decay at ionisation chambers located along the extraction region. In this contribution, the empirical model is described, its strengths and limitations discussed, and its application as a predictive tool for estimating cool-down times as a function of extracted proton flux demonstrated.

Each beam of CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) stores 360 MJ at design energy and design intensity. In the unlikely event of an asynchronous beam dump, not all particles would be extracted immediately. They would still take one turn around the ring, oscillating with potentially high amplitudes. In case the beam would hit one of the experimental detectors or the collimators close to the interaction points, severe damage could occur. In order to minimize the risk during such a scenario, a new interlock system was put in place in 2016. This system guarantees a phase advance of zero degrees (within tolerances) between the extraction kicker and the interaction point. This contribution describes the motivation for this new system as well as the technical implementation and the strategies used to derive appropriate tolerances to allow sufficient protection without risking false beam dump triggers.

In the CERN accelerator complex the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is used as injector of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Statistics on the injection and beam availability in 2015 showed that too much time is spent at injection. Reducing this time could improve LHC availability and luminosity over the year. Currently, useful data to diagnose the problems is sparse and shown in different applications. Operators time is wasted in debugging and checking for the source of the problem before trying another injection. A new Software application for diagnostics of the LHC Filling is under development which collects data from multiple inputs of the CERN Control System and concentrates them in one central view. The inputs are processed and matched with a set of rules (or assertions) that need to be fulfilled for an injection to be successful. Whenever a problem occurs, the operator can check the Filling Diagnostic for hints on what is the source of the problem during the injection. Filling Diagnostic also produces statistics of the LHC injections and the causes of failed injections, this will allow significantly better analysis of the LHC performance for next year.

Studies on luminous region and pile-up density are of great interest for the experiments at the future High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) in order to optimize the detector performance. The evolution of these parameters at the two main interaction points of the HL-LHC along optimum physics fills is studied for the baseline and alternative operational scenarios with the latest set of parameters, including a refined description of the longitudinal bunch profile. Results are discussed in terms of a new figure-of-merit, the effective pile-up density.

Transverse feedback systems are used in synchrotrons and storage rings to damp injection oscillations and suppress transverse instabilities. Especially instabilities driven by high intensity beams in future circular colliders such as the FCC set challenging requirements for transverse feedback systems. In order to develop a transverse feedback system able to meet those requirements, sophisticated simulation tools are required. For this purpose, a new modular framework for modeling a transverse feedback system has been developed in Python. The framework can be used as a transverse feedback module in the macro-particle beam dynamics simulation code PyHEADTAIL or as a separate tool for studying a feedback model from a control theory point of view by using a simple signal models for the beam. The main principle of the code is presented and simulation methods used for the conceptual design of the FCC are discussed.

The LHC Transverse Feedback System is designed to damp and counteract all possible coupled bunch modes between the lowest betatron frequency and 20 MHz. The present study reveals that the analogue frontend processing scheme based on down converting the pick-up signal at the LHC RF frequency to baseband considerably extends the detected bunch movements visible to the feedback system to beyond 1 GHz. We develop an analytical model of the signal processing chain to explore the impact of even-symmetric and odd-symmetric intra-bunch movements on the detected beam position as a function of the longitudinal bunch shape. A set of equations is derived suitable for numerical simulations, or as a complement in particle tracking codes to further refine the behaviour of the LHC transverse feedback system.

Transverse Feedback Parameter Extraction from Excitation Data

In this paper we present a simple and fast approach to extract essential parameters of a transverse feedback system such as phase advances between pick-ups and kickers, fractional tune, kicker delay, or per-bunch transverse activity from discrete-time samples of position signals. In this approach the beam is excited and subsequent beam oscillations are recorded. Given that any number of pick-ups can be evaluated at once with only a marginal increase of transverse beam size this method is suitable for regular health checks of a transverse feedback system, e.g., for every injection. The fundamental idea relies on the reconstruction of the transverse phase space by means of digital filters. We sketch a simple mathematical model to illustrate the underlying method. Examples are given together with a set of filter kernels for the fractional tunes of the LHC transverse feedback system.

Possibilities for Transverse Feedback Phase Adjustment by Means of Digital Filters

In transverse feedback systems a phase adjustment is generally required to convert a beam position signal from a pick-up into a momentum correction signal used by a transverse kicker. In this paper we outline several possibilities for phase adjustments using only single pick-ups or the vector combination of two pick-ups. Analytical expressions are given as a function of the fractional tune and the betatron phase advance between the pick-up location and the kicker. The shortest possible digital filter is formulated, including a notch for closed orbit suppression and a free parameter to adjust for betatron phase. We introduce a novel, fully parametrized digital filter with the feature to be insensitive to variations in fractional tune. Examples are given for the SPS transverse feedback system and compared with measurements.

Data-Driven Controller Design for High Precision Pulsed Power Converters for Bumper Magnets of the PS Booster

A new data-driven approach using the frequency response function of a system is proposed for designing robust digital controllers for the injection bumper magnet (BSW) power supplies of the PS Booster. The powering of the BSW requires high precision 3.4 kA to 6.7 kA trapezoidal current pulses with 2 ms flat-top and 5 ms ramp-up and ramp-down time. The tracking error must remain within ± 50 parts-per-million (ppm) during the flat-top of the trapezoidal reference, and ± 500 ppm during the ramp-down. The BSW is powered with a four quadrant switch-mode power converter and the current through the magnet is controlled in closed-loop form with a 2-degree-of-freedom controller at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. A convex optimization algorithm is performed for obtaining the controller parameters. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by designing the controller for a full-scale prototype of the BSW system at CERN, which is in the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project.

The high luminosity requirement for a future linear collider sets a demanding limit on the beam quality at the Interation Point (IP). Even the natural motion of the ground could misalign the quadrupole magnets to such an extent that the resulting dipole kicks would require compensation. The novel technique described in this paper uses seismometers to measure the positions of the quadrupole magnets in real time and a kicker to counteract the effect of their misalignment. The prototype system deployed at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK in Japan has already demonstrated a reduction in the pulse-to-pulse vertical position jitter of the beam by about 10%. Based on the observed correlation of the beam position to the quadrupole positions the maximum possible jitter reduction from such a system is estimated to be about 25%. This paper details the latest improvements made to the system with the aim of achieving this limit.

The geodetic network for the Compact LInear collider (CLIC) will consist of a combination of overlapping wires stretched in parallel and Wire Positioning Sensors (WPS). Such a configuration will limit the propagation of errors (maximum deviation w.r.t. a fit line) below 10 micrometres over 200 metres. These first results were obtained through simulations in 2009, with hypotheses remaining to be validated. New experimental results have been obtained allowing to reconsider the precision and accuracy of WPS sensors and the knowledge of stretched wires. This paper presents the experimental results obtained on dedicated calibration benches and on a facility made of three overlapping stretched wires over a length of 140 metres including WPS sensors measurements. It confirms the possibility to have a propagation of error below 10 micrometres using overlapping stretched wires combined with WPS sensors.

The first stage of the CLIC is proposed to be at 380 GeV. So the Ring To Main Linac (RTML), which transport the beams from the damping ring to main linac with minimal emittance growth, should be restudied due to the new beam properties. In this paper the two bunch compressors in the RTML are redesigned. Then a complete study of the static beam-based alignment techniques along RTML is presented. The beam-based correction includes one-to-one and dispersion-free steering, then a global correction using tuning bumps is applied to reduce the final emittance and mitigate the effects of coupling. The results showed that the emittance growth budgets can be met both in the horizontal and vertical planes.

The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) scheme presents several challenges in terms of reliability and availability. The goal of the study is to demonstrate the requirements for availability and reliability by identifying the key factors on failure effects and analysing possible operational scenarios and designs. Hence, a good knowledge on CLIC system structures, failure modes and failure effects is needed. This paper reports about the set-up of the studies from the definition of the CLIC failure catalogue to the implementation of the models and analysis of the results. It will present in detail the steps that need to be followed when performing such a study. Finally, the CLIC Drive Beam Quadrupoles powering system will be presented as a use-case.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is the latest generation of 3 GeV synchrotron light source which subsystem includes magnet, power supply, vacuum, RF system, insertion device, control system, etc. The operating procedures and checking items are complex. To speed up the machine start-up and shut-down procedures, check the system's status, and prevent misoperation, we summarize the procedures for routine operation and develop the integrated control interface, which concentrates most machine information and control functions into a single window. This interface clearly indicates the machine status and improves operational efficiency.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) has been successfully commissioned and has reached now stable operation. Now, the machine must be turned off routinely for week-ly maintenance. While following standard machine turn-on procedures for now, we have developed an automatic turn-on program to accelerate operation, for automatic system status checks and to prevent human errors. The turn-on program process flow includes: turn-on of the LTB (linac to booster transport line), the BTS (booster to storage ring transport line), the SR (storage ring), the BR (booster ring) power supplies and BR&SR pulsers as well as degaussing magnets, turning on the BR&SR RF sys-tems, activating the linac electron source, opening all insertion device (ID) gaps to their parking positions, set-ting all ID phases to zero, controlling all front ends (FEs) and loading the desired machine lattice. Individual pro-cedures can be executed alone depending on the desired practical situation. Experience so far shows, that it takes about 30 minutes to proceed from tunnel safety search to the injection ready state of the light source, including a 20 minute period for magnet degaussing.

Space-charge effect is not negligible during the early stage of beam acceleration in a photoinjector rf linac that is operated for generation of short electron pulses by velocity bunching. A solenoid with iron shield can be used to provide the required axis-symmetric magnetic field to balance the radial space-charge force of the beam. However, the iron shield cannot be perfectly symmetric because openings are reserved for feeding water pipes and electrical cables to the coils. In addition, alignment errors of the solenoid may also spoil the symmetry of the focusing field. In this study, simulation is carried out to investigate how does the non-axisymmetric solenoid field of different origins influence beam properties, such as beam size, transverse emittance during the rf bunch compression.

We plan to replace the existing horizontal stripline kicker of the transverse feedback system with an improved design. Large reflected power was observed at the downstream port of stripline kicker driven by the feedback amplifier. A rapid surge of vacuum pressure was observed when we tested the high current operation in TPS storage ring in April 2016. A burned feedthrough of the horizontal stripline kicker was discovered during a maintenance shutdown. The improved design is targeted to reduce the reflection of driving power from feedback system and to reduce beam induced RF heating. This major modification of the design is described. The results of RF simulation performed with the electromagnetic code GdfidL are reported as well.

Three long straight sections with double-mini beta-y lattice were created in the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) for which the effects of focusing elements and phase shifters between the collinear undulators result in incorrect calculations of the brilliance while assuming a Gaussian-approximation. Therefore, an on-axis Wigner distribution function (WDF), which includes effects of wave phenomena, is a natural way to measure the intensity of synchrotron radiation and is used in this article as the definition of brilliance.

A Cornell-type superconducting RF cavity module was installed in the Taiwan Light Source (TLS) in 2004. New control electronics for the existing SRF modules have been designed, based on the original designs. In addition to the functions for operation, this SRF electronics system in the TLS also provides protection for the SRF modules and cryogenic system. This paper presents the SRF electronics modifications, which will enhance machine protection and make it easy to adjust and optimize operational parameters.

The CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications) test facility is designed to experimentally demonstrate innovative FEL schemes for future light source applications. Such schemes can place strict requirements on the accelerator beam properties as well as the relative alignment of the beam in the FEL radiators and modulators. Beam-based alignment (BBA) of the FEL section is therefore an operational requirement for all advanced FEL facilities. In this paper we demonstrate results of CLARA BBA simulations, and also report initial simulation results from the use of non-linear algorithms to optimise the FEL performance directly.

The issue of particle accelerator reliability is a problem that currently is not fully defined, understood nor addressed. Conventional approaches to reliability (e.g. RBDs) struggle due to a lack of data about specific component/system reliability and failure. There is a large body of beam current data retrievable from operating accelerators that contains detailed information about the accelerator behaviour, both before and after a machine trip has occurred. Analysing this data could provide insight and help develop a new approach to address accelerator reliability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to detecting emergent behaviour in particle accelerators. Instead of attempting to identify every possible failure of a machine we propose an alternative approach based around a change in perspective, to knowing the normal default operational behaviour of a machine. Taking action when a ghost in the machine emerges that causes accelerator wide aberrant changes to normal machine behaviour.

A high-resolution, low-latency beam position monitor (BPM) system has been developed for use in feedback systems at particle accelerators and beamlines that operate with trains of particle bunches with bunch separations as low as several tens of nanoseconds, such as future linear electron-positron colliders and free-electron lasers. The system was tested with electron beams in the extraction line of the Accelerator Test Facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan. The fast analogue front-end signal processor is based on a single-stage RF down-mixer, with a measured latency of 15.6 ± 0.1 ns. The processor has been optimised, doubling the maximum operating beam intensity up to 1.6 nC, and the signal processing in the custom digital acquisition board has been upgraded in order to improve the resolution beyond the 300 nm level measured previously. The latest results, demonstrating a position resolution of order 150 nm with single-pass beam, will be presented.

The International Linear Collider (ILC), as described in its Technical Design Report (TDR), must maintain strict control of its electron and positron beams in order to achieve the desired luminosity at each of its proposed center-of-mass energies. Controlling the beam parameters requires a dynamic system, capable of adjusting to a myriad of perturbations and errors. One of the components used to control the beam is the Interaction Point (IP) feedback system, which is used to dynamically steer the beams back into collision within nanoseconds. This work will show the simulation of the IP Feedback system's compensation for ground motion model K at the ILC.

Progress Towards Nanometre-Level Beam Stabilisation Using a Cavity BPM System at ATF2
1986

A low-latency feedback system has been designed and tested to achieve inter-bunch position stabilisation at the final focus of the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2) at KEK. This system has now been enhanced through the use of position information from two cavity beam position monitors (BPMs) to enable beam stabilisation at a third, intermediate location where a witness BPM measures the correction. Low-Q cavity BPMs were used, along with custom signal processing electronics designed for low latency and optimal position resolution. A custom stripline kicker, power amplifier and digital feedback board were used to provide beam correction and feedback control. The system was tested in single-pass, multi-bunch mode with the aim of providing inter-bunch beam stabilisation on electron bunches of charge ~1 nC separated in time by 280 ns. In 2015 a single BPM feedback system demonstrated beam stabilisation to below 75 nm. To date the two BPM input feedback system has demonstrated beam stabilisation to 83 ± 6 nm. This performance is limited by the current understanding of the cavity BPM resolution. Work will be described with the aim of improving this result.

At Diamond Light Source, the Double-Double Bend Achromat (DDBA) lattice upgrade involved the conversion of one cell of the storage ring from a double bend achromat (DBA) structure to a double-DBA (DDBA). The new cell includes corrector magnets that are different in design to the DBA corrector magnets. The DDBA vacuum chamber cross section is also different from the DBA cells and includes both stainless steel and copper sections over which corrector magnets are fitted. The performance of the Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB) used for electron beam stabilisation with the DDBA cell installed is presented in this paper. Firstly the different corrector magnet dynamic responses are characterised and secondly the closed loop performance of the FOFB is measured and analysed for the upgraded lattice.

In order to avoid longitudinal multibunch instabilities potentially caused by the addition of normal conducting RF cavities into the Diamond storage ring, a longitudinal feedback was installed. The main components are newly developed feedback electronics, in-house built modulator and amplifier, and a low Q kicker cavity. This paper describes the performance of the cavity as well as the full longitudinal feedback system as it is installed on the machine and tested before the installation of the normal conducting RF cavities.

Upgrading one Double Bend Achromat cell to a Double Double Bend Achromat (DDBA) cell in the Diamond Light Source storage ring* necessitated a broad range of changes to the overall control system. These changes covered developments to the interface layer of the controls system to incorporate changes to the underlying instrumentation, associated development of user interface, changes to real-time feedback and feed-forward processes and to the online accelerator model. Given the pressures to minimise the shutdown length, the control system developments were optimised for time effective installation and commissioning. This paper outlines the control system developments for DDBA, the management process and lessons learnt from this process.

Phase synchronization between Booster extraction and Recycler injection has been done with the phase lock loop at Booster extraction. The phase Lock Loop control rf phase by changing radial position at extraction and it causes ± one bucket error, not phase error at Recycler injection. By switching a mode of operation for the phase lock loop by measuring the extraction gap position, the jitter was eliminated. The beam loss at the Recycler injection was reduced by 20%. Beam studies and the phase lock system will be discussed in this paper.

The Booster Beam Notch is a beam gap needed to allow extraction kickers to reach full field strength for a single turn extraction scheme. The Notch is created at injection energy by kicking 3 out of the 84 bunches to a dedicated absorber. The kicker voltage, pulse length and geometry of the absorber must be optimized to minimize the beam loss due to the notch creation. Beam studies, simulation and implementation as well as the optimization and improvement of the notch system will be discussed in this paper.

We present recent measurements demonstrating control of unstable beam motion in single bunch and bunch train configurations at the SPS. The work is motivated by anticipated intensity increases from the LIU and HL-LHC upgrade programs, and has included the development of a GHz bandwidth reconfigurable 4 GS/S signal processor with wideband kickers and associated amplifiers. The system was operated at 3.2GS/s with 16 samples across a 5 ns RF bucket (4.2 ns bunch at injection). The experimental results confirm damping of intra-bunch instabilities in both Q20 and Q26 optics configurations for intensities of 2x1011 P/bunch. Instabilities with growth times of 200 turns are well-controlled from injection, consistent with the achievable gains for the 2 installed stripline kickers with 1 kW broadband power. Measurements from multiple studies in single-bunch and bunch train configurations show achieved damping rates, control of multiple intra-bunch modes, behavior of the system at injection and final damped noise floor. We present an analysis method to study the relative phase of slice motion during a transient to discriminate between TMCI and other types of Head-Tail instabilities.

DASEL (Dark Sector Experiments at LCLS-II) is a new accelerator and detector facility proposed to be built at SLAC. Its primary target is a direct observation of dark matter produced in electron-nuclear fixed-target collisions. DASEL takes advantage of the LCLS-II free electron laser (FEL) under construction at SLAC which will deliver a continuous electron beam from a 4-GeV superconducting linac. DASEL will operate parasitically to the LCLS-II FEL by extracting low intensity unused dark current bunches downstream of the FEL kickers. The DASEL key accelerator components include a 46-MHz gun laser system providing controlled intensity and timing of the dark current, a fast (MHz) kicker with 600-ns flat-top, a new transport line connecting the LCLS-II to the existing A-line and to End Station-A where the experiments will take place, and a spoiler and collimator system in the A-line for final shaping of the DASEL beam. An overview of the DASEL accelerator system is presented.

SPEAR3 operates with a large cross-section copper vacuum chamber, mode-damped RF cavities and low-impedance insertion devices. As a result, the beam is passively stable for 280-bunch circulating beam current up to 500ma when the background gas pressure is low. In the future, more small-gap insertion devices will be installed and plans are underway to implement resonant bunch-crabbing for the ultrafast x-ray research program. These requirements drive the need for a fast, bunch-by-bunch feedback system to control beam instabilities, remove unwanted satellite bunches and resonantly crab select bunches on demand. In this paper we present a conceptual design for the transverse bunch-by-bunch stripline kickers.

Recently a collaboration between Brookhaven National Laboratory and Cornell University was established, aiming to build the CBETA accelerator. CBETA is a 150 MeV electron test accelerator, which prototypes essential technologies of eRHIC, which is a proposed upgrade to the existing Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) hadron facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Similar to eRHIC, CBETA employs an FFAG lattice for the arcs. The arcs require short, large aperture quadrupole magnets, which are located close together. BNL has been working on a design employing permanent magnets; we show the concept and the engineering design of these magnets. Prototype magnets have been constructed recently; we report on magnetic field quality measurements and their agreement with computer simulations.
