LEAF (Low Energy heavy ion Accelerator Facility) is a low energy high intensity heavy ion accelerator complex for multidiscipline researches that features a high performance superconducting ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) ion source, and a high current heavy ion beam lianc. The facility has been put into commissioning since 2018. The RFQ has successfully accelerated the beams with M/q within 2~7 in the CW regime. High transmission efficiencies (typically higher than 97%) were relatively easy to achieve for beam currents of ~0.1 emA level. Experimental research such as C-C burning investigation in nuclear astrophysics needs intense heavy ion beam of a broad beam energy variation while maintaining very low energy spread. A setup of ion beam energy modulation system has been developed, which is mainly composed of a drift tube linac (DTL) for beam energy tuning and two quarter wave resonator (QWR) re-bunchers placed at upstream and downstream of the DTL respectively for beam quality control and longitudinal matching. More than 0.05 pmA carbon beam with an energy spread of <0.3% (FWHM) has been delivered to the experimental terminal.

This paper presents the physics design of the superconducting linac for CSNS-II project which starts in this year. In the CSNS upgrade project, the linac energy will be incresed to 300MeV from 80MeV with both 324MHz spoke cavities and 648MHz ellipse cavities. It will be the first superconducting H− linac as a RCS injector. It is required to keep a high stability of the injection beam energy.

The ISAC facility uses the ISOL technique to produce radioactive ions for experiments. The post-accelerator consists of a room temperature linac (ISAC-I) and a su-perconducting linac (ISAC-II). After more than two dec-ades of beam delivery in ISAC, the RF systems have met various challenges regarding increased operation require-ments, system stability issues and performance improve-ments. This paper discusses the detailed challenges in recent years in both ISAC-I and ISAC-II. The upgrade plan or mitigation solution to address each challenge is reported respectively. A hint of the long-term vision at ISAC is also briefly described at the end of the paper.

IAEC/SNRC (Israel) is constructing an accelerator fa-cility, SARAF, for neutron production. It is based on a linac accelerating 5 mA CW deuteron and proton beam up to 40 MeV. As a first phase, IAEC constructed and operated a linac (SARAF Phase I), from which remains an ECR ion source, a Low-Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) line and a 4-rod RFQ. Since 2015, IAEC and CEA (France) are collaborating in the second phase, consisting in manufacturing of the linac (Figure 1). The injector control-system has been recently updated and the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) line has been installed and integrated to the infrastructure. It has been partially commissioned during the first semester of 2022. This paper presents the results of the integration, tests and commissioning of the injector and MEBT, be-fore delivery of the cryomodules.

New neutron sources are needed both for Canada and internationally as access to reactor based neutrons shrinks. Compact Accelerator-based Neutron Sources (CANS) offer the possibility of an intense source of pulsed neutrons with a capital cost significantly lower than spallation sources. In an effort to close the neutron gap in Canada a prototype, Canadian compact accelerator-based neutron source (PC-CANS) is proposed for installation at the University of Windsor. The PC-CANS is envisaged to serve two neutron science instruments, a boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) station and a beamline for fluorine-18 radioisotope production for positron emission tomography (PET). To serve these diverse applications of neutron beams, a linear accelerator solution is selected, that will provide 10 MeV protons with a peak current of 10 mA within a 5% duty cycle. The accelerator is based on an RFQ and DTL with a post-DTL pulsed kicker system to simultaneously deliver macro-pulses to each end-station. Several choices of Linac technology are being considered and a comparison of the choices will be presented.

Techniques have been developed for fast (less than one hour), fully automated tune-up a high power proton SCL, as well as fully automated recovery from a cavity failure with no human intervention. These methods have been developed and demonstrated at the SNS SCL but are applicable to hadron SCL operation in general and will be especially relevant to future ADS applications
