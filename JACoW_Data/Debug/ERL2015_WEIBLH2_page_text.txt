Cornell University has finished building a 10 m long superconducting accelerator module as a prototype of the main linac of a proposed ERL facility. This module houses 6 superconducting cavities- operated at 1.8 K in continuous wave (CW) mode - with individual HOM absorbers and one magnet/ BPM section. In pushing the limits, a high quality factor of the cavities (2•1010) and high beam currents (100 mA accelerated plus 100 mA decelerated) were targeted. We will review the design shortly and present the results of the components tested before the assembly. This includes data of the quality-factors of all 6 cavities that we produced and treated in-house, the HOM absorber performance measured with beam on a test set-up as well as testing of the couplers and the tuners.

We developed ERL injector cryomodule and main linac for Compact ERL (cERL) project. The injector cryomodule includes three 2-cell L-band superconducting cavities. The main linac cryomodule includes two 9-cell L-band superconducting cavities. After construction of cERL injector and recirculaton loop, beam operation was started with 20 MeV beam and after precise beam tuning, energy recovery operation was achieved with more than 80uA. Injector and main linac cavity were stable for ERL beam operation with Digital LLRF system. Field emission is the severe problem for main linac and heating of HOM coupler is the problem for injector. We mainly describe the cavity performances of two cERL cryomodules during long-term beam operation.

In recent years, high current superconducting cavity is much more important for the development of ERL light source. Several ERL light sources were proposed and high current low impedance superconducting cavity is the key role. To deliver an ampere beam current for multi-GeV ERLs, slotted cavity was proposed in 2010. And the test prototype cavity made of pure niobium was fabricated in 2014. The room temperature RF test shows the cavity has extreme low HOM impedance and very high HOM damping. 4.2 K vertical test was done in March, 2015 and the test results show the potential of the cavity in ERL applications and circular colliders. In this paper, we will show the design, fabrication and test results of the slotted cavity.

A test facility for superconducting RF acceleration and ERL techniques are under development at Peking University. The electron source for the test facility, DC-SRF photoinjector, has been in operation since 2013. Great efforts have been made to drive the photoinjector toward stable operation. A linac cryomodule, which comprises two 9-cell TESLA-type cavities, is to be assembled soon. It is expected to be in position this summer for preliminary RF and beam tests. The beam line for the accelerator straight section is under construction, which consists of a 3-dipole merge section to transport the electron beam to the linac, a 4-dipole chicane after the linac for bunch manipulation, and the required matching optics. In this presentation, we will report our our latest progress, especially on the commissioning of DC-SRF photoinjector and the construction of the linac cryomodule and the accelerator straight section.
