Recent recommendations from the Basic Energy Science Advisory Committee (BESAC) and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) will have a significant long-term impact on accelerator development at SLAC. Most importantly, in summer 2013 BESAC recommended the number of FEL photon beam-lines in the 0.2 to 4 KeV range be increased substantially. This recommendation resulted in the proposal (LCLS-II), now accepted, to build a new 4 GeV CW superconducting linac in the same housing as the existing SLAC LCLS linac. The LCLS-II project involves contributions from several US partner-labs and is now in full-swing. BESAC also supported fully integrating the two FEL-linacs so that photon beam-line equipment could be used for either the high energy low-repetition rate beam or the moderate energy very high-repetition rate beam. The P5 report, on the other hand, strongly supported US involvement in the proposed International Linear Collider development, based in Japan. Both projects rely on the L-band superconducting RF technology under development for the last 25 years. The talk will report on recent technical developments and describe plans for future work.

Superconducting detectors have grown in scale and sensitivity, and now can greatly improve both measurements of the cosmic microwave background and x-ray spectroscopy at x-ray light sources. Superconducting x-ray spectrometers provide high spectral resolution along with high photon-collection efficiency at x-ray light sources (more than two orders of magnitude higher than provided by gratings) and simultaneous measurement of the full spectrum in each pixel. They operate by measuring a temperature pulse from the absorption of individual x-rays. The temperature pulse is sensed by a superconducting film and amplified by a superconducting amplifier. The development of multiplexed superconducting amplifiers has enabled the construction of arrays of pixels. Kilopixel x-ray calorimeter arrays are planned for both synchrotron and free-electron-laser beamlines, and technology development is underway to scale to megapixel arrays, which would allow nearly 2*pi solid angle coverage and extremely high count rates. Similarly, the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be determined by measuring a temperature change induced by cosmic microwave background photons from a millimeter-wave telescope. The BICEP-2 experiment at the South Pole recently reported the most sensitive measurement to date of the polarization of the CMB with superconducting detectors, and the first detection of a curl, or "B-mode" pattern in the polarization of the CMB at degree angular scales. Primordial B-mode polarization is the distinctive signature of gravitational waves from inflation at the energy scale of Grand Unification, but additional non-primordial sources of B-mode polarization also exist, including polarized dust and gravitational lensing. I will describe the role of superconducting detectors in x-ray light source measurements, in the BICEP-2 experiment, and also their use in efforts to further understand B-mode signals in the CMB.
