The high beam rate and flexible pulse structure of the LCLS-II combined with the high brightness requirements necessitates the development of new diagnostics and a new accelerator control system. This talk summarizes the requirements, implementation challenges, and current development status of this system for LCLS-II.

Digital bunch-by-bunch feedback systems for betatron and synchrotron oscillation are powerful tools for suppression of beam instabilities and are indispensable for stable operation of storage rings. This invited talk reviews the world activities on transvers and longitudinal bunch-by-bunch feedback for storage rings.

The Advanced Photon Source (APS) is currently in the preliminary design phase for a multi-bend acromat (MBA) lattice upgrade. Beam stability is critical where the requirements are driven from the beam size which is expected to approach 4 microns vertically at the insertion device (ID) source points. AC rms beam stability requirements are defined as 10 % the minimum source size at the ID in the band 0.01-1000 Hz. The vertical plane stability goal is the most ambitious requiring a stability of 400 nm at the ID source point. In addition, long term drift defined as motion over a seven day timescale can be no more than 1 micron. In order to achieve these demanding beam stability requirements, a suite of beam diagnostics will be required including rf BPMs, X-ray BPMs, a mechanical motion measurement system, beam size monitors and a real time orbit feedback system. In addition, a tune measurement system, transverse multi-bunch feedback system and current monitors are planned for the upgrade. We report on the beam diagnostics design and APS storage ring R&D results used to inform the design.

The transverse mode coupling instability (TMCI) in the SPS has been identified as one of the potential performance limitations for future high intensity LHC beams that will be required for the High Luminosity (HL)-LHC era and is being addressed by the LHC Injector Upgrade Project (LIU). A potential mitigation can be provided by wideband feedback systems with a frequency reach of about 1 GHz . For this reason, the development of a prototype system has been started in a CERN collaboration within the US-LARP framework in 2008. In this report we present latest experimental results in 2017 where this prototype system was used in single and multi-bunch studies. In particular, a successful mitigation against TMCI at injection could be demonstrated in single bunch studies.

A system of three low-Q cavity beam position monitors (BPMs), installed in the interaction point (IP) region of the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2) at KEK, has been designed and optimised for nanometre-level beam position resolution. The BPMs are used to provide an input to a low-latency, intra-train beam position feedback system deployed in single-pass, multi-bunch mode with the aim of demonstrating intra-train beam stabilisation on electron bunches of charge ~1 nC separated in time by 280 ns. In 2016 the BPM resolution was demonstrated to be below 50 nm using the raw measured vertical positions at the three BPMs. New results will be presented utilising integrated sampling of the raw waveforms, improved BPM alignment and modified cavities to demonstrate a vertical position resolution on the order of 20 nm.
