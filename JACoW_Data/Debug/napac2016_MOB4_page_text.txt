A Muon Collider promises unique opportunities both as an energy frontier machine and as a factory for detailed study of the Higgs boson and other particles. However, in order to achieve a competitive level of luminosity a number of demanding requirements to the collider optics should be satisfied arising from short muon lifetime and relatively large values of the transverse emittance and momentum spread in muon beams that can realistically be obtained with ionization cooling. Basic solutions which make possible to achieve these goals with Nb3Sn magnet parameters are presented.

A pulsed multi ion injector linac is being developed by ANL for Jefferson Laboratory's Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC). The linac is designed to deliver both polarized and non polarized ion beams to the booster synchrotron at energies ranging from 135 MeV for hydrogen to 43 MeV/u for lead ions. The linac is composed of a 5 MeV/u room temperature section and a superconducting section with variable velocity profile for different ion species. This paper presents the results of the RF design of the main components and the beam dynamics simulations of the linac front-end with the goal of achieving design specifications cost-effectively.
