J-PARC is on the way to 1 MW operation step by step. J-PARC linac complected upgrade to 50 mA/400MeV in 2014, and the next main tasks of beam study are to optimize beam loss and output emittance for 40 mA and 50 mA operation. Residue radiation level at a lower repetition predicted that the beam loss becomes close to the maintenance limit in case of full operation at 50 mA. And intra-beam stripping (IBSt) effect in the H− beam is found to be the dominant source of the beam loss here. IBSt is only sensitive to lattice, so that the only solution is to be away from J-PARC baseline design with equipartitioning condition, in a safe way. In the previous work, emittace exchange and break of periodicity were predicted by the simulation and they are consistent with the "Hofmann chart". Series of experiments were carried out, not only for investigation of new lattice with controlled beam loss and emittance but also for a better understanding of rules of lattice optimization and the physics behind.

In the context of an advanced machine investigation program supporting the ongoing UNILAC (Universal Linear Accelerator) upgrade program, a new uranium beam intensity record (10 emA, U29+) at very high beam brilliance was achieved last year in a machine experiment campaign at GSI. The UNILAC as well as the heavy ion synchrotron SIS18 will serve as a high current heavy ion injector for the new FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) synchrotron SIS100. Results of the accomplished high current uranium beam measurements applying a newly developed pulsed hydrogen gas stripper (at 1.4'MeV/u) will be presented. The paper will focus on the evaluation and analysis of the measured beam brilliance and further implications to fulfil the FAIR heavy ion high intensity beam requirements.
