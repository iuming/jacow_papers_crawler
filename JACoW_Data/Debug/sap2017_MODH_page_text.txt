The emittance describes the quality of a beam. In this paper, a whole transverse emittance measurement control system based on EPICS is presented. Using slit and wire, a slit-grid method is for the emittance measurement. The aim of this control system is focusing on the motion control and data acquisition during the synchronization process. The position of slit is fixed for one direction in one control period, the wire is scanned in the beam sized range and the slit position, the wire voltage and position are collected at the same time. Motor and acquisition board use a common trigger to make sure the system have a synchronization operation. A soft input output controller (IOC) is build. The process variable (PV) values which matched with the driving values and data are obtained. Processing the data in the soft IOC, the emittance could be calculated. Using operating interface software CSS, the online measurement emittance is shown.

The high power ion source is the key parts of neutral beam injector. Generally speaking, the beam power should matching the extraction voltage for a given accelerator. In order to get higher beam power with lower beam extraction voltage, the beam optics of accelerator was analyzed based on the structure of EAST-NBI tetrode accelerator. The beam optics of a tetrode accelerator and a new designed three-electrode accelerator was analyzed with beam energy of 50 keV. The results shown that, the two types of accelerator can get high beam perveance (4.6μp) with lower beam divergence angle compare to the EAST-NBI accelerator (2.8μp ). And the tetrode accelerator can gets lower beam divergence angle compare to the three-electrode accelerator, but the electric field between two electrode is much higher than three-electrode accelerator. The results can help for the ion source design of high power ion source.
