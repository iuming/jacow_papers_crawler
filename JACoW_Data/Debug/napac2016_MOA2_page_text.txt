A custom state-of-the-art RF BPM (EBPM) has been developed and commissioned at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). A collaboration between Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Advanced Light Source (ALS) and BNL has proven to be a key element in the success of the NSLS-II EBPM. High stability coherent signal processing has allowed for demonstrated 200nm RMS spatial resolution and true turn-by-turn position measurement capability. Sub-micron 24 hr. stability has been demonstrated at NSLS-II by use of 0.01C RMS thermal regulation of the electronics racks without the need of active pilot tone correction.

Measurements of amplitude-dependent tune shift are critical for understanding of nonlinear single particle dynamics in storage rings. The conventional method involves scanning of the kicker amplitude while having a short bunch train at the top of the kicker pulse. In this paper we present a novel, alternative technique that uses a long continuous bunch train, or a sequence of bunch trains, that are spread along the ring, such that different bunches experience different kick amplitudes with a single shot of a kicker pulse. With these beams, a curve of tune shift with amplitude can be extracted from the recently added new NSLS-II BPM feature called gated turn-by-turn (TbT) BPM data that can resolve bunches within a turn, either alone or together with a bunch-by-bunch BPM data. This technique is immune to pulse-to-pulse jitters and long-term machine drift.

The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will demonstrate ionization cooling, the only technique that, given the short muon lifetime, can reduce the phase-space volume occupied by a muon beam quickly enough. MICE will demonstrate cooling in two steps. In the first one, Step IV, MICE will study the multiple Coulomb scattering in liquid hydrogen (LH2) and lithium hydride (LiH). A focus coil module will provide focusing on the absorber. The transverse emittance will be measured upstream and downstream of the absorber in two spectrometer solenoids (SS). Magnetic fields generated by two match coils in the SSs allow the beam to be matched into flat-field regions in which the tracking detectors are installed. This paper will present preliminary results and present plans for data taking of MICE Step IV, together with the design of the MICE Cooling Demonstration Step (Step DEMO), which requires addition of RF systems in the current setup.
