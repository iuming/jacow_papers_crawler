Modern heavy-ion accelerators require intense heavy-ion beams with high charge state. Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) sources are the primary tool for generating such beams. Advances in magnet technology and an improved understanding of the ECR ion source plasma physics have led to significant improvements in ECR source performance over the last several decades. The current state of the art is represented by third-generation sources operating at frequencies around 28 GHz and peak coil fields of about 7 T using NbTi conductor. Fourth-generation ECR ion sources with an operating frequency above 40 GHz have the potential to quadruple the source output beam current. These sources will need to incorporate advanced conductor technologies and/or novel coil configurations in order to exceed the limitations of the present structures. This talk will present worldwide efforts currently underway to develop high-performance ECR sources using new design approaches in support of next-generation nuclear physics facilities.
