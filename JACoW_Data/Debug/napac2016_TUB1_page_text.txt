The use of the term 'beam emittance' as a description of beam performance often has a contextual meaning, which may not be obvious to the reader. This tutorial presents a general discussion on the topic of beam emittance to differentiate between the various descriptions and definitions and where they are best applied. The tutorial begins with an overview of Hamiltonian dynamics and Liouville's Theorm to define the beam emittance based on canonical coordinates. The goal in accelerators is often to preserve the beam emittance. Discussion is therefore given to phenomena causing emittance non-conservation. We conclude with a statistical analysis of beam emittance, often calculated with beam tracking simulation codes, and how they are practically measured in particle accelerators. Examples demonstrate the subtleties of various definitions, particularly to reveal the many contributors to the emittance in a space-charge dominated and magnetized electron bunch.

The peak current required by a high gain free electron laser (FEL) is not deemed to be compatible with the multi-bunch filling pattern of synchrotrons. We show that this problem can be overcome by virtue of magnetic bunch length compression in a ring section and that, after lasing, the beam returns to equilibrium conditions without beam quality disruption*. As a consequence of bunch length compression, the peak current stimulates a high gain FEL emission, while the large energy spread makes the beam less sensitive to the FEL heating and to the microwave instability. The beam large energy spread is matched to the FEL energy bandwidth through a transverse gradient undulator. Feasibility of lasing at 25 nm is shown for the Elettra synchrotron light source (SLS) at 1 GeV. Viable scenarios for the upgrade of existing or planned SLSs to the new hybrid insertion devices-plus-FEL operational mode are discussed, while ensuring little impact on the standard beamlines functionality.

Improvements in brightness and coherent flux of about two orders of magnitude over operational storage ring based light sources are possible using multi bend achromat lattice designs. These improvements can be implemented as upgrades of existing facilities, like the proposed upgrade of the Advanced Light Source (ALS-U). The upgrade proposal will reuse much of the existing infrastructure, thereby reducing cost and time needed to reach full scientific productivity on a large number of beamlines. We will report on the accelerator design progress as well as the details of the ongoing R+D program.
