The design process, tuning, and operation of high-power linacs are discussed. The inconsistencies between the basic beam physics principles used in the design and the operation practices are considered. The missing components of the beam physics tools for the design and operations are examined, especially for negative hydrogen ions linacs. The diagnostics and online models necessary for tuning and characterization of existing states of the linac are discussed.

Nonlinear Integrable Optics to Facilitate High Intensity Operation

The nonlinear integrable optics is a novel concept for the use in storage rings. The benefits of strongly nonlinear betatron dynamics include the large particle frequency spread, which facilitates the Landau damping of coherent beam instabilities, and the potential to suppress the nonlinear resonances induced by forces such as space-charge. This talk discusses the recent progress in the numerical studies of the nonlinear integrable optics in high-intensity synchrotrons, presents the status of the first tests at Fermilab's IOTA ring, and provides an outlook for future research.
