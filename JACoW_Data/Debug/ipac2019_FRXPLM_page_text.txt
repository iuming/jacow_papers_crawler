In 2018, the SNS begins operation at the design proton beam power of 1.4 MW. This talk will present the critical technical challenges that were overcome in order to take the final step in beam power with a higher than 90% reliability. In addition, the future project of the SNS for doubling the beam power from 1.4 MW to 2.8 MW and construction of second target station will be discussed.
