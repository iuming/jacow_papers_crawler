Turkish Accelerator and Radiation Laboratory in Ankara (TARLA) facility is proposed as an IR FEL and Bremsstrahlung facility as the first facility of Turkish Accelerator Center (TAC) in Golbasi Campus of Ankara University. TARLA is proposed to generate oscillator mode FEL in 3-250 microns wavelengths range and Bremsstrahlung radiation. It will consist of normal conducting injector system with 250 keV beam energy and two superconducting RF accelerating modules in order to accelerate the beam 15-40 MeV. The electron beam will be in both continuous wave (CW) and macro pulse (MP) modes. The bunch charge will be limited by 77pC and the average beam current will be 1 mA. To detect electron beam position inside beam line, BPM (Beam Position Monitor) has to use through beam line. Wall current monitor based systems button type TARLA BPM are briefly mentioned. In this study, simulation results of the calculations in CST, production and test studies for button type TARLA BPMs are presented. Mechanical and electronic designs, antenna simulations, and the latest testing procedures are determined for button type BPMs.

Vertical beam instabilities have been observed at SPEAR3 when a newly installed in-vacuum undulator (IVUN) is operated at a set of narrow gap settings. The source of the instabilities is believed to be vertically deflecting trapped modes inside the IVUN tank that are excited by the beam. We have used beam-based measurements to characterize the frequencies and strengths of the excited modes using both our bunch-by-bunch feedback system and a spectrum analyzer. Using numerical simulations of our IVUN structure, we have found modes with high shunt impedance near the measured frequencies. Recently, we have successfully measured these IVUN modes during our current downtime. In this paper, we will report on the measurements, simulations, and plans to damp these modes.

Stripline kickers are generally assumed to have equal contributions from the electric and magnetic field to the total deflection angle, for ultra-relativistic beams. Hence parameters of the striplines, such as the characteristic impedance, the field homogeneity and the deflection angle are typically determined by simulating the striplines from an electrostatic perspective. However recent studies show that, when exciting the striplines with a trapezoidal current pulse, the magnetic field changes during the flat-top of the pulse, and this can have a significant effect upon the striplines performances. The transient solver of Opera2D has been used to study the magnetic field, for the striplines to be used for beam extraction from the CLIC damping rings, when exciting the electrodes with a pulse of 1 us flat-top and 100 ns rise and fall times. The time dependence of the characteristic impedance, field homogeneity and deflection angle are presented in this paper. In addition, two solutions are proposed to improve the flatness of the magnitude of the magnetic field throughout the flat-top of the pulse, and the predicted results are reported.

The new orbit feedback system required for the APS multi-bend acromat (MBA) ring must meet challenging beam stability requirements. The AC stability requirement is to correct rms beam motion to 10 \% the rms beam size at the insertion device source points from 0.01 to 1000 Hz. The vertical plane represents the biggest challenge for AC stability which is required to be 400 nm rms for a 4 micron vertical beam size. In addition long term drift over a period of 7 days is required to be 1 micron or less at insertion device BPMs and 2 microns for arc bpms. We present test results of the MBA prototype orbit feedback controller (FBC) in the APS storage ring. In this test, four insertion device BPMs were configured to send data to the FBC for processing into four fast corrector setpoints. The configuration of four bpms and four fast correctors creates a 4-bump and the configuration of fast correctors is similar to what will be implemented in the MBA ring. We report on performance benefits of increasing the sampling rate by a factor of 15 to 22.6 kHz over the existing APS orbit feedback system, limitations due to existing storage ring hardware and MBA orbit feedback design.

The LHC started high-energy operation in 2015 with new tertiary collimators, equipped with beam position monitors embedded in their jaws. The required resolution and stability of the beam orbit measurements linked to these BPMs were addressed by the development of a new Diode ORbit and OScillation (DOROS) system. DOROS converts the short BPM electrode pulses into slowly varying signals by compensated diode detectors, whose output signals can be precisely processed and acquired with 24-bit ADCs. This scheme allows a sub-micrometre orbit resolution to be achieved with robust and relatively simple hardware. The DOROS system is also equipped with dedicated channels optimised for processing beam oscillation signals. Data from these channels can be used to perform betatron coupling and beta-beating measurements. The achieved performance of the DOROS system triggered its installation on the beam position monitors located next to the LHC experiments for testing the system as an option of improving the beam orbit measurement in the most important LHC locations. After introducing the DOROS system, its performance is discussed through both, beam and laboratory measurements.

The operating parameters for Brookhaven National Laboratory's Low Energy RHIC Electron Cooling (LEReC) project create a unique challenge. To ensure proper beam trajectories for cooling, the relative position between the electron and the ion beam needs to be known to within 50μm. In addition, time of flight needs to be provided for electron beam energy measurement. Various issues have become apparent as testing has progressed, such as mismatches in cable impedance and drifts due to temperature sensitivity. This paper will explore the difficulties related to achieving the level of accuracy required for this system, as well as the potential solutions for these problems.

The ESRF storage ring is going to be upgraded into an Extremely Bright Source(EBS). The orbit correction system of the EBS ring will require 320 BPMs and 288 correctors instead of 224 BPMs and 96 correctors for the present ring. On the new ring, we are planning to reuse 192 Libera Brilliance electronics and 96 fast correctors power supplies and the 8 FPGA controllers of the present system and to add 128 new BPMs electronics and 196 new correctors power supplies. These new BPM electronics and power supplies will not have the fast 10 KHz data broadcast capability of the components of the present system. So we plan to implement an hybrid slow/ fast correction scheme on the SR of the EBS in order to reuse the present fast orbit correction system on a reduced set of the BPMs and correctors and combine this fast orbit correction with an orbit correction performed at a slower rate using the full set of BPMs and correctors. We have made simulations to predict the efficiency of this scheme for the EBS and tested on the present ring a similar orbit correction scheme using only 160 BPMs and 64 correctors for the fast corrections . We present the results of our simulations and experiments.

The Advanced Photon Source (APS) is currently in the preliminary design phase for the multi -bend achromat (MBA) lattice upgrade. Beam stability is critical for the MBA and will require long term drift defined as beam motion over a seven-day timescale to be no more than 1 micron at the insertion device locations and beam angle change no more than 0.5 micro-radian. Mechanical stability of beam position monitor (BPM) pickup electrodes mounted on insertion device vacuum chambers place a fundamental limitation on long-term beam stability for insertion device beamlines. We present the design and implementation of using prototype mechanical motion system (MMS) instrumentation for quantifying this type of motion specifically in the APS accelerator tunnel and experiment hall floor under normal operating conditions. The MMS presently provides critical position information on the vacuum chamber and BPM support systems. Initial results of the R&D prototype systems have demonstrated that the chamber movements far exceed the long-term drift tolerance specified for the APS Upgrade MBA storage ring.

Submicron orbit stability for a low emittance synchrotron light source are essential. Besides locating and removing the existing perturbations, active orbit feedback is applied to improve the orbit stability below sub-micron range from DC to a few hundreds of Hertz. Efforts to investigate orbit stability and stabilization at TPS will be addressed in this report.

Resonant Cavity Beam Position Monitors (RF-BPMs) are diagnostic instruments capable of achieving beam position resolutions down to the nanometre scale. To date, their nanometric resolution capabilities have been predicted by simulation and verified through beam-based measurements with particle beams. In the frame of the PACMAN project at CERN, an innovative methodology has been developed to directly observe signal variations corresponding to nanometric displacements of the BPM cavity with respect to a conductive stretched wire. The cavity BPM of this R&D study operates at the TM110 dipole mode frequency of 15GHz. The concepts and details of the RF stretched wire BPM test-bench to achieve the best resolution results are presented, along with the required control hardware and software.

In the paper the MicroTCA.4 based optical frontend readout (OFR) electronics and its applications for beam arrival time monitor (BAM) and fast beam based feed-back (BBF) is presented. The idea is to have a possibility to monitor the modulation density of the optical laser pulses by the electron bunches and apply this information for the BBF. The OFR composed of double width fast mezzanine card (FMC) and advanced mezzanine card (AMC) based FMC carrier. The FMC module consists of three optical channel inputs (data and clock), two optical channel outputs (beam arrival time), 250 MSPS ADCs, clock generator module (CGM) with integrated 2.8 GHz voltage control oscillator (VCO). The optical signals are detected with 800 MHz InGaAs photodiodes, conditioned using 2 GHz current-feedback amplifiers, filtered by 3.3 GHz differential amplifiers and next direct sampled with 16-bit 900 MHz of analog bandwidth ADCs. The CGM is used to provide clock outputs for the ADCs and for the FMC carrier with additive output jitter of less than 300 fs rms. The BAM application has been implemented using Virtex 5 FPGA and measured with its performance at Free Electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) facility.

Synchrotron light sources generate intense beams of X-ray light for beamline experiments, and the stability of these X-ray beams has a large impact on the quality of the experiments that can be performed. User experiments increasingly utilise micro-focus techniques, focusing the X-ray beam size to below 10 microns at the sample point, with beamline detectors operating at kHz bandwidths. Thus, there is a demand for non-invasive diagnostic techniques that can reliably monitor the X-ray beam position with sub-micron accuracy in order to characterise X-ray beam motion, at corresponding kHz bandwidths. Reported in this paper are measurements from single-crystal CVD diamond detectors, and a comparison with the previous-generation of polycrystalline CVD diamond detectors is offered. Single-crystal diamond is shown to offer superior uniformity of response to incident X-rays, and excellent intensity and position sensitivity. Measurements from single-crystal diamond detectors installed at Diamond Light Source are presented, and their use in feedback routines in order to stabilise the X-ray beam at the sample point is discussed.

The ELBE linear accelerator supports a great variety of possible beam options ranging from single bunches to 1.6 mA CW beams at 13 MHz bunch repetition rate. Accordingly high are the dynamic range requirements for the BPM system. Recently, we are testing the Libera Spark EL electronics to supplement our home-built BPM electronics for low repetition rate operation. Here, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two completely different detection schemes. For integration of the Libera Spark EL into our accelerator control system we are implementing an OPC-UA server embedded into the device. The server is based on the free Open62541 protocol stack which is available as open source under the LGPL.

The Advanced Photon Source is developing its next major upgrade (APS-U) based on the multi-bend achromat lattice. Improved beam stability is critical for this upgrade and will require keeping short-time beam angle change below 0.25 μrad and long-term angle drift below 0.5 micro-radian. A reliable white x-ray beam diagnostic system in the front end is a key part of the planned beam stabilization system for the APS-U. This system includes an x-ray beam position monitor (XBPM) based on x-ray fluorescence (XRF) from two specially designed GlidCop A-15 absorbers, a second XBPM using XRF photons from the Exit Mask, and two white beam intensity monitors using XRF from the photon shutter and Compton-scattered photons from the front end beryllium window. We present orbit stability data for the first XBPM used in the feedback control during user operations, as well as test data from the second XBPM and the intensity monitors. The data demonstrated that the XBPM system meets the APS-U beam stability requirements.

Two pCVD diamond based beam loss monitors (dBLM) are installed near the primary collimators of the LHC, with a dedicated, commercial readout-system used to acquire their signals. The system is simultaneously able to produce a high sampling rate waveform and provide a real-time beam loss histogram for all bunches in the machine. This paper presents the data measured by the dBLM system during LHC beam operation in 2016.

Monitoring of the 6 GeV electron losses around the ESRF storage ring is presently done by a hybrid system consisting of ionization chambers and scintillators. It allows a rough localization of the losses, but has numerous limitations : size, weight, time-resolution, sensitivity, versatility, and costs. A new system was developed consisting of a detector head (BLD) and the electronics for signal acquisition and control (BLM). The BLD is compact, based on a scintillator coupled to a small photo-multiplier module. The BLM controls 4 independent BLDs and acquires data with sampling rates up to 125 MHz. Measurements performed on different configurations of BLD prototypes have lead to an optimized design that allows, together with the flexible signal processing performed in the BLM, to cover a wide range of applications: measurement of fast and strong losses during injection is just as well possible as detection of very small variations of weak losses during the slow current decay. This paper describes the BLD/BLM design, its functionality and performance characteristics, and shows results from prototypes installed in the injection zone and in close vicinity to in-vacuum undulators.

It is of vital importance to provide a continuous and comprehensive overview of the functionality of beam loss monitoring (BLM) systems, with particular emphasis on the connectivity and correct operation of the detectors. At CERN, a new BLM system for the pre-accelerators of the LHC is currently at an advanced stage of development. This contribution reports on a new method which aims to automatically and continuously ensure the proper connection and performance of the detectors used in the new BLM system.

During 5 years of operation in the 3 GeV storage ring of ALBA, the 124 beam loss monitors (BLM) have provided stable measurements of relative losses around the machine, with around 10% breakdown of units. We have analyzed these BLM failures and correlated the integrated received dose with any special conditions of each BLM location which might have led to their breakdown. We also show studies of beam losses in the insertion devices, with particular attention to the results in the multipole wiggler (MPW), where the vacuum chamber is (suspected to be) misaligned and high BLM counts are detected.

The High Intensity and Energy (HIE) upgrade to the on-line isotope separation facility (ISOLDE) facility at CERN is currently in the process of being commissioned. The very tight space available between the superconducting acceleration cavities and a challenging specification led to the design of a compact 'diagnostic box' with a number of insertable instruments on a common vacuum chamber. The box was conceived in partnership with the engineering firm AVS and produced as a completed assembly in industry. 14 diagnostic boxes have been installed and are now operational. This paper will describe the design, the construction and first results from operation of these HIE ISOLDE diagnostic boxes.

Brookhaven National Laboratory's BLIP facility produces radioisotopes for the nuclear medicine community and industry, and performs research to develop new radioisotopes desired by nuclear medicine investigators. A raster scanning system was recently completed in December 2015 and fully commissioned in January 2016 to provide improved beam distribution on the targets, allow higher beam intensities, and ultimately increase production yield of the isotopes. The project included the installation of horizontal and vertical dipole magnets driven at 5 kHz with 90 deg phase separation to produce a circular beam raster pattern, a beam interlock system, and several instrumentation devices including multi-wire profile monitors, a laser profile monitor, beam current transformers and a beam position monitor. The first year operational experiences will be presented.

The aim of the AMIT cyclotron is to deliver an 8.5 MeV, 10 μA CW proton beam to a target to produce radioisotopes for PET diagnostics. Such a small cyclotron poses some challenges to the diagnostics design due to its small size. Two sets of diagnostics have been designed, each one aiming at a different phase of the machine lifecycle. During normal operation the stripping foil and the target will be used to measure the current, a dual transverse profile monitor based on a scintillating screen and a Fluorescence Profile Monitor will measure the beam position and the transverse profile. During first stages of commissioning the dual transverse profile monitor and the target will be substituted by an emittance monitor based on a pepperpot. A movable interceptive Beam Probe will be located inside the cyclotron to give information about the beam during acceleration. Additionally, a test bench for the characterization of the beam right after the exit of the ion source has been built with different instruments to measure the beam current and the transverse profile. In this paper the present status of the design, simulation and tests of the diagnostics for the AMIT cyclotron are described.

DONES will be a 40 MeV, 125 mA deuteron accelerator. The 5 MW beam will impact in a lithium flow target to yield a neutron source The detailed design of the DONES accelerator is being designed within EUROFUSION-WPENS project. One of the most critical tasks of the accelerator will be to identify the layout of beam diagnostics along the accelerator. This instrumentation must guarantee the high availability of the whole accelerator system and the beam characteristics and machine protection. This contribution will describe the beam diagnostics selected along the accelerator, focusing in the High Energy Beam Transport line, in charge of shaping the beam down to the high power target. The main open questions will be analyzed and the path to obtain the detailed design by the end of the project detailed.

Under RISP project, wide variety of intense rare isotope ion beams will be provided. An EBIS charge breeder has been designed to charge breed these beams. Its optimum operation requires injection of bunched beam with high quality. An RFQ cooler buncher RFQCB is designed to meet these requirements. To meet the EBIS beam requirements, RFQCB should efficiently accept high intensity continuous beams and deliver to the EBIS bunched beams with small emittance (3 '.mm.mrad), low energy spread (< 10 eV) and short bunch width (2-10 μs). A new design concept to be implemented in this RFQCB have been developed, including a novel injection/extraction electrodes geometry, new RF voltages with frequency up to 10 MHz and amplitude up to 10 kV with improved differential pumping system. Simulations have shown the efficient handling of beam intensities which were never handled so far with improved beam quality. An overview of the RFQCB design concept will be presented. Simulated performance of the device and design of different sub-systems will be discussed. Beam parameters will be measured using Faraday cups and emittance meter. The design of these diagnostics tools will be described as well.

For comparison, a Turbo-ICT and a conventional ICT were installed on the BELLA petawatt beamline, both sharing the same vacuum flanges. We report on measurements performed using a gas-jet and a capillary-discharge based laser plasma accelerator. In both setups the Turbo-ICT was able to resolve sub-picocoulomb charges.

The real event selection, timing resolution, position resolution and energy response of the EJ-200 plastic scintillation detector have been analyzed using timing window coincidence measurement. The detector was simulated based on Monte Carlo, including its geometry, energy deposition, photon collection and signal generation. The detection efficiency and the real events selection have been obtained while the background noise has been reduced by using two-end readout timing window coincidence. We developed an off-line analysis code, which is suitable for massive data from the digitizer. We set different coincidence timing windows, and did the off-line data processing respectively. We find the detection efficiency increases as the width of the timing window increases, and when the width of timing window is more than 10ns, the detection efficiency will slowly grow until it reaches saturation. Time, position and energy response have been measured by exposing to radioactive sources. The best timing window parameter as 16ns is obtained for on-line coincidence measurement, and the position resolution is up to 12cm. Energy response of the detector was linear within the experimental energy range*.

At CERN, the circulating beam current measurement is provided by two types of transformer, the Direct Current Current Transformer and the Fast Beam Current Transformer. Each transformer is built based on toroidal cores made from a soft magnetic material. Depending on the type of measurement to be performed these cores require different magnetic characteristics for parameters such as permeability, coercivity and the shape of the magnetisation curve. In order to study the effect of changes in these parameters on the current transformers, several interesting raw materials based on their as-cast properties were selected. The materials have been characterised to determine their crystallisation, melting and Curie Temperatures in order to determine suitable annealing processes to tailor their properties. They have been analysed by several techniques including Electron Microscopy and X-ray Diffraction. As-cast magnetic properties such as the permeability, the B-H curve and Barkhausen noise have also been measured to enable the study of the effect of thermal treatment in the microstructure of the alloys, and the correlation of this with the change in the magnetic properties.

Electron beams with a maximum energy of 2.5 MeV and a macropulse current of 1 A are produced from a thermionic RF-gun of the linear accelerator system at Chiang Mai University, Thailand. An RF rectangular waveguide and a side coupling cavity of the RF gun introduce asymmetric field distribution inside the gun cavities. To investigate the effect of the asymmetric field distribution on electron beam production and acceleration, measurements and simulations of the electron beam properties were performed. In this study we use well calibrated current transformers, alpha magnet energy slits, and a Michelson interferometer to measure the electron pulse current, the beam energy, and the bunch length, respectively. This paper presents the measurement data of the electron beam properties at various location along the beam transport line and compares the results with the beam dynamic simulations by using the particle tracking program ELEGANT. Moreover, the RF field feature and the cathode power were optimized in order to achieve the high qualities of the electron beam produced from the RF gun. This result implies and correlates to the electron back-bombardment effect inside the gun cavities.

The fast beam intensity measurement systems for the LHC currently use an analogue signal processing chain to provide the charge information for individual bunches. This limits the possibility to use higher level correction algorithms to remove systematic measurement errors coming from the beam current transformer and the associated analogue electronics chain. In addition, the current measurement system requires individual settings for different types of beams, implying the need for continuous tuning during LHC operation. Using modern technology, the analogue measurement chain can be replaced by an entirely digital acquisition system, even in a case of the short, pulsed signals produced by the LHC beams. This paper discusses the implementation of the new digital acquisition system and the calculations required to reconstruct the individual LHC bunch intensities, along with the presentation of results from actual beam measurements.

In order to reduce the background that could limit the precision of the diagnostics located in the ATF2 post-IP beamline, a single vertical beam halo collimation system was installed in March 2016. In this paper we present the measurements done in March and May 2016 in order to characterize the collimation system performance. Furthermore, the collimator wakefield impact has also been measured and compared with theoretical calculations and numerical simulations in order to determine the most efficient operation mode of the collimation system in terms of halo cleaning and negligible wakefield impact.

Wall Current Monitors are the devices of choice to observe the instantaneous beam current in proton accelerators. These entirely passive transformers deliver a high-fidelity image of the beam intensity in a bandwidth spanning from about 100kHz up to several GHz. They serve as a signal source for a diverse set of applications including Low Level RF feedback and longitudinal diagnostics such as bunch shape measurements and phase-space tomography. They are appreciated for their excellent reliability, large bandwidth and unsurpassed dynamic range. We describe the design of a new Wall Current Monitor for the CERN Proton Synchrotron with a useful bandwidth of 100kHz to 4GHz. Two such devices have been installed in the PS machine and are now used in regular operation. Some usage examples will be shown.

At the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (ATLAS) we designed and built a hybrid particle detector consisting of a gas ionization chamber followed by an inorganic scintillator. This detector will aid the tuning of low intensity beam constituents, typically radioactive, with relatively high intensity (>100x) contaminants. These conditions are regularly encountered during radioactive ion beam production via the in-flight method, or when charge breeding fission fragments from the CAlifornium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU). The detector was designed to have an energy resolution of ~5% at a rate of 105 particles per second (pps), to generate energy loss and residual energy signals for the identification of both Z and A, to be compact (retractable from the beamline), and to be radiation hard. The combination of a gas ionization chamber and scintillator will enable the detector to be very versatile and be useful for a wide range of masses and energies. Design details and testing results from the prototype detector are presented in this paper.

Using bunch shape monitors (BSMs), we measured the longitudinal bunch lengths of negative hydrogen ion beams in the J-PARC linac. A BSM was installed between two linacs, separate-type drift tube linac (SDTL) and an annular-ring-coupled structure linac (ACS), having acceleration frequencies of 324 and 972 MHz, respectively. We used radio-frequency amplitude modulation of bunches in the beam transport between the SDTL and ACS to minimize emittance growth and beam loss. We conducted amplitude scanning and compared the results with the twiss-parameters obtained from the transverse profiles. In this paper, we discuss the results of amplitude tuning of the buncher cavity at the point of beam loss and emittance. We also discuss the measurement results for various equipartitioning settings of quadrupole magnets.

Absolute measurement of vane voltage is essential to understand RFQ transmission. We used a non-intrusive technique of bremsstrahlung X-ray measurement. Several windows were installed at SNS to allow measurement of the X-ray spectrum in different locations of the RFQ. A CdTe spectrometer was used to estimate spectrum cutoff energy that corresponds to the vane voltage. Different device setups are described as well as measurement accuracy and interpretation of experimental data.

Emittance control is important for polarization preservation of proton beam in the Alternative Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). For polarization preservation, two helical dipole partial snake magnets are inserted into the AGS lattice. In addition, the vertical tune has to run very high, in the vicinity of integer. These helical dipole magnets greatly distort the optics, especially near injection. The beta functions along the energy ramp have been modeled and measured at the locations of the Ion Profile Monitor (IPM). For the measurements to be valid, the betatron tune, dipole current and orbit responses have to be carefully measured. This paper summarize the experiment results and comparison with the model. These results will lead to understanding of emittance evolution in the AGS.

Non-perturbative measurement of low-intensity charged particle beams is particularly challenging for beam diagnostics due to the low amplitude of the induced electromagnetic fields. In the low-energy Antiproton Decelerator (AD) and the future Extra Low ENergy Antiproton (ELENA) rings at CERN, an absolute measurement of the beam intensity is essential to monitor operational efficiency and provide important calibration data for all AD experiments. Cryogenic Current Comparators (CCC) based on Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) have in the past been used for the measurement of beams in the nA range, showing a very good current resolution. However these were unable to provide a measurement of short bunched beams, due to the slew-rate limitation of SQUID devices and their strong susceptibility to external perturbations. Here, we present the measurements and results obtained during 2016 with a CCC system developed for the Antiproton Decelerator, which has been optimized to overcome these earlier limitations in terms of current resolution, system stability, the ability to cope with short bunched beams, and immunity to mechanical vibrations.

Absolute calibration of systems with no DC response requires pulsed calibration circuits. This paper presents a precise pulsed current source designed primarily for remote calibration of a beam intensity measurement system. However, due to its simple and flexible design, it might also prove interesting for other applications. The circuit was designed to drive a load of 10 Ω with current pulses lasting a few hundred microseconds with an amplitude of 1 A and precision in the order of 0.01%. The circuit is equipped with a half-bridge for precise determination of the absolute output current using the 0 V method. This paper presents the circuit topology and discusses in detail the choice of the critical components along with their influence on the final achieved accuracy. The performance of the built prototype of the current source is presented with laboratory measurements.

Ultra-short, high brightness electron beams, with applications to next generation light sources or advanced accelerators, require enhanced resolution of the longitudinal bunch properties to study effects such as the micro-bunching instability. In this paper, we describe a diagnostic that has the promise to achieve sub-femtosecond longitudinal resolution. The diagnostic employs a laser-electron beam interaction in an undulator magnet in tandem with a RF bunch deflecting cavity to impose a angular-longitudinal coordinate correlation on the bunch which is resolvable with standard optical systems. The fundamental underlying concepts of the diagnostic have been tested experimentally at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Accelerator Test Facility (BNL ATF) with the high-brightness electron beam and >100GW IR laser operating in the TEM10 mode. The results include a systematic study of the effects of this laser mode, and energy, on the beam angular projection. Initial runs from the x-band deflecting cavity will also be presented here.

Measurement of the temporal duration of FEL pulses is important both for the operators to monitor the performance of the machine and the users performing pump-probe measurements with FEL beam. The light-field streak camera is a promising methods for the photon pulse length measurement that uses the electric field of an IR/THz laser to streak the photoelectrons*. This contribution presents a simulation of the performance of a streak camera using a single-cycle THz pulse**. The simulation recreates the photoionization process and generates electron spectra in presence of the THz field and without it. Using these spectra the photon pulse lengths are calculated and compared to the initial values. Most of the parameters used in the simulation are chosen based on experiments performed earlier.*** This contribution presents the simulation method and the obtained results. It validates the pulse length calculation analysis method and estimates the expected measurement accuracy and precision for the THz streak camera measurement technique. The simulations were done for different FEL pulse lengths ranging from about 1 fs to 40 fs both in soft and hard X-ray range.

A low energy electron beam can be used to characterize the high energy ultra-relativistic bunches. This technique allows one to obtain the bunch transverse profiles as well as the bunch length within a non-destructive single shot measurement. In this paper the bunch length measurement technique based on the interaction of the low energy electron beam with an ultra-relativistic bunch is described. Results of numerical simulations of measurements related to BESSY II are presented. A possible setup of such diagnostic system for BESSY II and in future for BESSY VSR is proposed.

The Laser Applications at Accelerators network (LA≥NET) was selected for funding within the European Union's 7th Framework Programme. During its 4 year duration the project has successfully trained 19 Fellows and organized numerous events that were open to the wider laser and accelerator communities. The network linked research into lasers and accelerators to develop advanced particle sources, new accelerating schemes, and in particular beyond state-of-the-art beam diagnostics. This contribution summarizes the research results in laser-based beam diagnostics for accelerators and light sources. It discusses the achievable resolution of laser-based velocimeters to measure the velocity of particle beams, the resolution limits of bunch shape measurements using electro-optical crystals, position resolution of laser wire scanners, and limits in energy measurements using Compton backscattering at synchrotron light sources. Finally, it also provides a summary of past and future events organized by the network and shows how an interdisciplinary research program can provide comprehensive training to a cohort of early career researchers.

The streak camera has been used to measure the bunch length since the ALBA storage ring commissioning in 2011. Previously, we developed an optical calibration system based on the Michelson interferometry. Similar to the work at the DLS*, in this report we show the calibration kit based on the different electrical delays which can be used via rf switches. We compare both calibration systems and we show measurements of the longitudinal impedance obtained with the new calibration.

This research aims to design and develop an elec-tron linear accelerator system and beam diagnostic instruments for natural rubber and polymer research at the Plasma and Beam Physics Research Facility, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. The accelerator con-sists of a DC thermionic electron gun and an S-band standing-wave linac. The system can produce electron beams with the energy range of 0.5 to 4 MeV for the pulse repetition rate of 30 to 200 Hz and the pulse duration of 4 μs. Commissioning of the accelerator system and development of beam diagnostic instru-ments to measure electron beam energy, electron pulse current and electron dose are underway. This contribu-tion presents and discusses on the RF commissioning progress as well as status of design and construction of the beam diagnostic system.

Femtosecond-level synchronization is required for various systems in modern accelerators especially in fourth generation light sources. In those high precision synchronization systems the phase detection accuracy is crucial. However, synchronization to a low noise electrical source is corrupted by a phase detection error originating in the electrical components and connections due to thermal and humidity-related drifts. In future, we plan to implement calibration methods to mitigate these drifts. Those methods require a calibration signal injection, called second tone, into the system. Intrinsically, the injection circuit remains uncalibrated therefore it needs to be drift-free. We performed drift characterization of a set of RF components, which could serve for implementation of a signal injection circuit, namely selected types of couplers and splitters. We describe the measurement setup and discuss the challenges associated with this kind of measurement. Finally, we provide a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the measurements results.

The measurement of the RMS bunch length with high resolution is very important for latest generation light sources and also a key parameter for the optimization of the final beam quality in high gradient plasma accelerators. In this contribution we present progress in the development of novel single shot, RMS bunch length diagnostic techniques based on imaging the near and far fields of coherent THz diffraction radiation (CTHzDR) that is produced as a charged particle beam interacts with a solid foil or an aperture. Recent simulation results show that the profile of a THz image of the coherent point spread function (CSF) of a beam whose radius is less than the PSF, i.e. the image produced by a single electron, is sensitive to bunch length and can thus be used as a diagnostic. The advantages and disadvantages of near field and far field imaging are examined and the results of a recent high energy (20 GeV) CTHzDR experiments at SLAC/FACET are presented. Plans for experiments to further validate and compare these imaging methods for both moderate and high energy charged particle beams are also discussed.

Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) is used in accelerators to measure the filling pattern and perform bunch purity measurements. The most used photon detectors are photomultipliers (PMTs), generally used to detect visible light; and Avalanche Photo-Diodes (APDs), which are often used to detect X-rays. At ALBA synchrotron light source, the TCSPC using a standard PMT has been developed and is currently in operation and further tests are performed using an APD. This work presents the experimental results using both detectors, and compares their performances.

A dissector is an electron-optical device designed for measurement of periodic light pulses of subnanosecond and picosecond duration. LI-602 dissector developed at BINP SB RAS is widely used for routine measurements of a longitudinal profile of electron and positron beams at BINP electron-positron colliders and other similar installations. LI-602 dissector is a part of many optical diagnostic systems and provides temporal resolution of about 20 ps. Recently a new generation of picosecond dissectors were created on the basis of the PIF-01/S1 picosecond streak-image tube designed and manufactured at the GPI Photoelectronics Department. The results of the measurements of instrument function of the new dissector based on PIF-01/S1, which were carried out in the static mode, showed that temporal resolution of the dissector can be better than 3-4 ps (FWHM). The results of temporal resolution calibration of the new-generation picosecond dissector, carried out at the specialized set-up based on a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser, and recent results of longitudinal beam profile measurements at BINP accelerators are given in this work.

A first prototype of in-Air X-ray Detector (AXD) has been installed on the SOLEIL storage ring. An AXD simply consists of a scintillator, an objective and a camera installed in air behind the absorber of the bending magnet's synchrotron radiation layer. The radiation vertical profile analysis easily enables to retrieve the vertical beam size of the electron beam at the source point. This simple diagnostics opens large perspectives of beam size measurement all around the ring for an accurate caracterization of the beam and improvment of its stability survey.

Smith-Purcell radiation has been successfully used to perform longitudinal profile measurements of electron bunches with sub-ps lengths. These measurements require radiation to be generated from a series of gratings to cover a sufficient frequency range for accurate profile reconstruction. In past systems the gratings were used sequentially and so several bunches were required to generate a single profile, but modern accelerators would benefit from such measurements being performed on a bunch by bunch basis. To do this the radiation from all three gratings would need to be measured simultaneously, increasing the mechanical complexity of the device as each grating would need to be positioned individually and at a different azimuthal angle around the electron beam. Investigations into gratings designed to displace the radiation azimuthally will be presented. Such gratings could provide an alternative to the rotated-grating approach, and would simplify the design of the single-shot monitor by reducing the number of motors required as all of the gratings could be positioned using a single mount.

The DAΦNE Beam Test Facility (BTF) is operational in Frascati since 2003. In the last years the beam diagnostics tools have been completely renewed and the services for users have been largely improved. We describe here the new transverse beam diagnostics based on new GEM TPC detectors and MEDIPIX Silicon pixel detectors, the renewed DAQ system and the data caching system based on MEMCACHED and the integration of the new sub-systems in the new data-logging. Results on the optimization of the transverse beam spot and divergence are reported as well as the real-time diagnostics and feedback user experience.

The SwissFEL wire-scanner (WSC) composes of an in-vacuum beam-probe - motorized by a stepper motor - and an out-vacuum pick-up of the wire-signal. In SwissFEL, WSCs will absolve two main tasks: high precision measurement of the beam profile for determining the beam emittance as a complement to view-screens; routine monitoring of the beam profile under FEL operations. In order to fulfill the aforementioned tasks, the design of the in-vacuum component of the SwissFEL WSCs followed the guidelines to ensure a mechanical stability of the scanning wire at the micrometer level as well as a significative containment of the radiation-dose release along the machine thanks to the choice of metallic wires with low density and Atomic number. Beam-loss monitors have been suitably designed to ensure a sufficient sensitivity and dynamics to detect signals from scanned beams in the charge range 10-200 pC. The design, the prototyping phases, the bench and electron-beam tests - performed at SITF (Paul Scherrer Institut) and FERMI (Elettra, Trieste) - of the entire SwissFEL WSC set-up will be presented.

The CESR Test Accelerator (CesrTA) program targets the study of beam physics issues relevant to linear collider damping rings and other low emittance storage rings. This endeavor requires new instrumentation to study the beam dynamics along trains of ultra-low emittance bunches. A key element of the program has been the design, commissioning and operation of an x-ray beam size monitor capable, on a turn by turn basis, of collecting single pass measurements of each individual bunch in a train over many thousands of turns. The x-ray beam size monitor development has matured to include the design of a new instrument which has been permanently integrated into the storage ring. A new beam line has been designed and constructed which allows for the extraction of x-rays from the positron beam using a newly developed electro magnet pair. This new instrument utilizes custom, high bandwidth amplifiers and digitization hardware and firmware to collect signals from a linear InGaAs diode array. This paper reports on the development of this new instrument and its integration into storage ring operation including vacuum component design, electromagnet design, electronics and capabilities.

The LEReC RF diagnostic beamline is supposed to ac-cept 250 us long bunch trains of 1.6 MeV ' 2.6 MeV (kinetic energy) electrons. This beamline is equipped with a YAG profile monitor. Since we are interested in observ-ing only the last bunch in the train, one of the possibilities is to install a fast kicker and a dedicated dump upstream of the YAG screen and related diagnostic equipment. This approach is expensive and challenging from an engineer-ing point of view. Another possibility is to send the whole bunch train to the YAG screen and to use a fast gated camera to observe the image from the last bunch only. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the last ap-proach, which significantly simplifies the overall design of the RF diagnostic beamline.

Double-slit interferometers are useful tools to measure the transverse the cross-section of relativistic charged particle beams emitting incoherent synchrotron radiation. By rotating the double-slit about the beam propagation axis, the transverse beam profile can be reconstructed including beam tilt at the source. The interferometer can also be used as a sensitive monitor for vertical emittance control. In this paper we outline a simple derivation of the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem, present results for a rotating double-slit measurement and demonstrate application of the interferometer to vertical emittance control using the Robust Conjugate Direction Search (RCDS) optimization algorithm.

Synchrotron radiation from dipole magnets is linearly polarized in the plane of acceleration and evolves toward circular polarization with increasing vertical observation angle. The intensity of the x-y field components can be modeled with Schwinger's theory for the angular-spectral power distribution. Combined with Fresnel's laws for reflection at a mirror surface, it is possible to model field polarization of visible SR light in the laboratory. The polarization can also be measured with a polarizer and quarter wave plate to yield Stokes' parameters S0-S3. In this paper we present measurements and modeling of the visible SPEAR3 SR beam in terms of Stokes' parameters and plot on the results on the Poincaré sphere.

For the planed Mainzer Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz a diagnostic test-beam-line has been build up. The beam-line comprises three analyzing stations to investigate space charge caused transverse emittance growth of an 100 keV electron beam. To create the electron bunches two different rf syncronized laser diodes (405 nm & 520 nm) are used. Furthermore, a circular deflecting cavity allows to measure the longitudinal bunch intensity profile. The components and the latest results will be described and an outlook towards further applications will be given.

In this work we describe a novel beam diagnostic method based on coherence characterization of broad-spectrum bending magnet radiation through the Heterodyne Near Field Scattering (HNFS) technique. HNFS is a self-referencing technique based on the interference between the transmitted beam and the spherical waves scattered by each particle of a colloidal suspension. The resulting single-particle interferogram shows circular fringes modulated by the spatio-temporal Complex Coherence Factor (CCF) of the radiation. Superposition of a number of these patterns results in a stochastic speckle field, from which spatial and temporal coherence information of the source can be retrieved in near field conditions. Here we describe the basics of this technique, the experimental setup mounted along the hard X-ray pinhole at the ALBA synchrotron light source, and the possibility of transverse electron beam size retrieval from the spatial coherence function of the emitted dipole radiation. We also show preliminary results concerning power spectral density of visible synchrotron radiation as obtained from temporal coherence.

The CERN Large Hadron Collider is equipped with two Beam Synchrotron Radiation (BSR) systems, one per beam, used to monitor the transverse distribution of the beam, its longitudinal distribution and the abort gap population. During the 2015-2016 winter shut-down period, one of the two BSR systems was equipped with a prototype beam halo monitor, based on the coronagraph technique, classically used in astrophysics telescopes to measure the sun corona. The system design, as well as its optics, was inherited from the coronagraph used in the KEK Photon Factory with some modifications made in order to satisfy the LHC BSR source constraints. This project is in the framework of the HL-LHC project, for which there is the requirement to monitor the beam halo at the level of 10-6 of the core intensity. This first prototype has been designed as a demonstrator system aimed at resolving a halo-core contrast in the 10-3 to 10-4 range. After discussing the design of the LHC coronagraph and its technical implementation, this contribution presents the result of the first tests with beam and the planned system upgrades for 2017.

Single Shot Transversal Profile Monitoring of Ultra Low Charge Relativistic Electron Bunches at REGAE

Relativistic electron microscopes are increasingly under consideration in dream experiments of observing atomic scale motions as they occur. Compared to ordinary electron microscopes with energies limited to few tens of keV, relativistic electrons reduce strongly the space-charge effects. This enables packing more electrons in shorter bunches and thereby capturing atomic scale ultra-fast dynamics in single shot. A typical relativistic-electron-microscope, based on an RF-gun, can provide experiments with couple of thousands to millions of electrons bunched in a few μm length and a transversal dimension of a fraction of a mm. After scattering from a sample and at the position of detector, electrons are distributed over transversal dimensions typically two orders of magnitude larger. For transversal diagnostics before scattering a cost effective solution is implemented while for diffraction pattern detection objective is single-electron imaging with good signal to noise ratio in single shot. In this contribution the implementations and results at REGAE will be presented.

The CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) delivers a wide spectrum of particle beams (hadrons, leptons and heavy ions) that can vary greatly in momentum and intensity. The profile and position of these beams are measured using particle detectors. However, the current systems show several problems that limit the quality of such monitoring. We have researched a new monitor made of scintillating fibres read-out with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM), which has the potential to perform better in terms of material budget, range of intensities measured and available detector size. In addition, it also has particle counting capabilities, extending its use to spectrometry or Time-Of-Flight measurements. Its radiation hardness is good to guarantee years of functioning. We have successfully tested a first prototype of this detector with different particle beams at CERN, giving accurate profile measurements over a wide range of energies and intensities. It only showed problems during operation with lead ion beams, believed to come from crosstalk between the fibres. Investigations are ongoing on alternative photodetectors, the electronics readout and solutions to the fibre crosstalk.

CADS Injector-I accelerator is a 10-mA 10-MeV CW proton linac, which uses a 3.2-MeV normal conducting 4-Vane RFQ and superconducting single-spoke cavities for accelerating. Eight wire scanners are designed and used to measure the beam profile of CADS Injector-I. In this paper principal of operation, instrumentation and programming of these wire scanners are discussed. Some results of beam profile and emittance measurement with these wire scanners are also presented.

Beam observation systems, based on charged particles passing through a light emitting screen, are widely used and often crucial for the operation of particle accelerators as well as experimental beamlines. The AWAKE experiment, currently under construction at CERN, requires a detailed understanding of screen sensitivity and the associated accuracy of the beam size measurement. We present the measurement of relative light yield and screen resolution of seven different materials (Chromox, YAG, Alumina, Titanium, Aluminium, Aluminium and Silver coated Silicon). The Chromox and YAG samples were additionally measured with different thicknesses. The measurements were performed at the CERN's HiRadMat test facility with 440 GeV/c protons, a beam similar to the one foreseen for AWAKE. The experiment was performed in an air environment.

Luminescent screens hit by accelerated charged particle beams are commonly used as beam diagnostics to produce a visible emitted light, which can be sensed by a camera. In order to investigate the characteristics of the luminescence response of several scintillators, the beam shape and the observation of the transverse position, experiments were done with different low intensity proton beams produced by two different test benches. This study is motivated by the need to identify scintilla-tor materials for the development of a 4-dimensional emittancemeter which will allow the characterization of the beams, in particular the emittance measurement (size, angular divergence). This paper describes the experimental setups and our investigations of the optical properties of various scintillating materials at two different proton beam energies respectively about 30 keV and 3 MeV. The light produced by these screens is characterized by yield, flux of the emitted light versus the beam intensity, time response, and long life-time and they are compared.
