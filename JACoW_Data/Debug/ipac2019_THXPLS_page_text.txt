Cancer therapy with ion beams presents several advantages as compared to proton therapy or conventional radiation therapy but its diffusion is limited by the size and cost of the accelerator facility. The ion therapy facilities are presently in operation have generated important developments in particular to the gantry, beam delivery technique, and beam scanning system, while new treatment facilities being planned in United States, Europe, and Asia. This talk will present the current status of this field, as well as the future perspective.
