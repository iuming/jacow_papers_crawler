Linux Distribution and Ecosystem Evolution in Control Systems Workshop
 


 

T. Oulevey, F. Vaga
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

The Linux distribution landscape keeps evolving and new technologies emerging. It’s a good time to discuss new concepts for operating system deployment and distribution of in-house software. From Workstation and Servers to Embedded Systems, this workshop aims at gathering participants to present their use-cases and have an open discussion on operating system life cycle and associated challenges. One key point is also to review the status of emerging architectures such as aarch64, ppc64le, RISCV and see how it may impact future choices.

TANGO Workshop
 


 

V. Hardion
                       MAX IV Laboratory, Lund University, Lund, Sweden

 


 

This workshop is a continuation in the series of ICALEPCS workshops on Tango. Tango is a toolkit for building modern distributed control systems in C++, Python, and/or Java. It is destined for people who are new to Tango but also for those who want to get an update on the latest tools in Tango. The workshop provides hands-on exercises and examples which attendees can try during or after the workshop. Attendees will acquire a good understanding of the concepts of Tango and its tools for building an object oriented distributed control system.

Data Science and Machine Learning Workshop

The fields of large scale data analytics and machine learning have made impressive progress in recent years. Many applications have been successful in applying techniques in these fields for problems in areas such as health, language processing, search engines, etc Many tools have been developed to facilitate the application of these techniques (e.g. libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Apache Spark, etc). A growing number of examples of applications in accelerators and experimental physics installations have started to appear in the last years. The workshop will aim to share the experience gained in the development of some of these applications, whether successful or not. This should contribute to the continuous growth of the use of these methods in our systems.

PLC Based Control Systems Workshop
 


 

E. Blanco Viñuela, B. Fernández Adiego, B. Schofield, J.O. Vidal
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

This workshop intends to create a collaborative space where attendees will show their best practices, tools employed and return of experience when engineering PLC based control systems. Topics that will be addressed: 1.Specifications, requirements trace, documents: analysis, design, implementation. 2.Software development: standards and/or frameworks, novel paradigms (e.g. automatic code generation, object orientation), language choice and coding conventions, best practices. 3.Testing and verification: methodologies and tests (FAT, SAT), simulation, static analysis, verification (e.g. formal methods). 4.Application management: versioning, deployment, online changes, upgrades, reverse engineering. 5.Technology evolution: embedded communications (e.g. OPC-UA, MQTT…), edge computing, new domains of application.

Like the previous editions, The ICALEPCS MOCRAF workshop group will be a multidisciplinary workshop devoted to the latest developments on motion control, with, this year, a special focus on Mechatronics. Its purpose is to get feedback from attendees to make the workshop as interesting and pleasurable as possible. This group will remain alive after the workshop to be the input for the future ICALEPCS MOCRAF meetings.
