A new project for the production of a very intense neutrino beam has arisen to enable the discovery of leptonic CP violation and neutrino mass hierarchy. This facility will use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund to deliver the neutrino super beam. The ESS linac is expected to be fully operational at 5 MW power by 2022, producing 2 GeV and 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. An upgrade of the power to 10 MW and a frequency of 28 Hz, in which half is for the neutron beam, is necessary for the production of the neutrino beam. The primary proton beam-line completing the linac will consist of switchyards and accumulator rings. The secondary beam-line producing neutrinos will consist of a four-horn/target station, decay tunnel and beam dump. A megaton scale water Cherenkov detector will be located at a baseline of about 500 km in one of the existing mines in Sweden and it will measure the neutrino oscillations. The elements of the primary and secondary beam-lines and all the possible scenarios impacting the design of the ESSnuSB facility as well as the safety issues due to the high irradiation produced are presented and discussed in this paper.

The EUROnu project was a 4 year FP7 design study to investigate and compare three possible options for future, high power neutrino oscillation facilities in Europe. These three facilities are a Neutrino Factory, a neutrino superbeam from CERN to the Frejus Laboratory and a so-called Beta Beam. The study was completed at the end of 2012 and has produced conceptual designs for the facilities and preliminary cost estimates. The designs were used to determine the physics performance. These have been used to compare the facilities. This paper will describe the designs, physics performance and costs and summarise the recommendations of the study.

The completion of the international Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment (MICE) Step V will involve the construction, commissioning and use of RF cavity and Coupling Coil (RFCC) Modules. The RFCCs consist of 4 RF cavities and a solenoid magnet, and are expected to act as a source of potentially damaging electrons (dark currents) and X-rays. Ongoing work to create a high-statistics simulation of the dark current production, within RF cavities, is described. Current results predict the energy and angular spectra of emitted electrons for an RFCC, and include particle tracking, realistic field maps and ionisation energy losses in cavity windows. Individual electron emitters, parametrised by the Fowler-Nordheim equation, are used and are user-definable, allowing potential worst-case scenarios to be simulated and upper/lower limits for the total dark current to be estimated. These data are being used within the MICE Analysis and User Software (MAUS) to estimate the potential detector backgrounds and the damage that may be inflicted upon the scintillating fibre trackers.

A radiation monitor will be required for the Muon Ionisation Cooling experiment (MICE) beyond Step IV, when the RF cavities are installed. The role of the radiation monitors will be to protect the particle tracking detectors (Trackers) from dangerous levels of RF dark currents and the as- sociated photon fluxes that could potentially be produced in the RF cavities. If such levels of radiation should occur the radiation monitor will ensure that the radiation shields (shutters) are closed thereby protecting the Tracker modules. The radiation monitor will be positioned on these radiation shields and will monitor x-rays, gamma-rays and electrons up to a few MeV. It is expected that the spectrum will peak at very low energies, since the peak voltage across the cavities is 8 MV/m and so the maximum energy that an electron could gain is 12 MeV (maximally accelerated from all four RF cavities). The design, positioning and expected sensitivity of the radiation monitors will be described here along with their readout and inclusion into the MICE interlocking systems. The schedule for the work and progress so far will also be presented.

The efficiency of using magnetic horns as a pion collection device has been recognized by several neutrino projects. In the study, we began with a “NuMI-like” horn, which was applied to collect the secondary pions from bombarding the target with 120 GeV/c protons in the nuSTORM proposal. The necessity of optimizing the horn for a non-conventional neutrino beamline like the nuSTORM pion beamline was then acknowledged. This paper presents a detailed description of the optimization objectives, the Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm developed for this specific purpose, and the results of the optimization. With the full G4beamline simulation results, the success of the optimization provides an increase of 16\% in the useful muons in the ring. This methodology can be applied to any neutrino beamline configuration.

The nuSTORM FODO decay ring is designed to achieve both a large phase space acceptance of 2 mm and a large momentum acceptance of 3.8±10\% GeV/c. The goal is challenging, not only because the high dispersion needed at the Beam Combination Section (BCS) of the ring enlarges the beam size, but also because of the nonlinear beam dynamics. In this paper the preliminary design of the nuSTORM ring is presented, which includes the requirements, the ring parameters, and also the tracking results in the MADX PTC\TRACKING module.

A concept is presented for a Target System in a staged scenario for a Neutrino Factory and eventual Muon Collider, with emphasis on initial operation with a 6.75 GeV proton beam of 1 MW power, and 50 Hz of pulses 3-ns long. A radiation cooled graphite target will be used in the initial configuration, with an option to replace this with a free-liquid-metal-jet target should 4-MW beam power become available at a later stage.

Experiments on EMMA have shown that with rapid acceleration (~10 turns) a linear non-scaling FFAG can accelerate through several integer tunes without detrimental effects on the beam [1]. Proton and ion applications such as hadron therapy will necessarily have a slower acceleration rate, so their feasibility depends on how harmful resonance crossing is in this regime. A simple and useful tool to answer such fundamental questions is the S-POD linear Paul trap at Hiroshima University, which can be set up to simulate the dynamics of a beam in an FFAG. We report here results of experiments to explore different resonance crossing speeds, quantify beam loss and study nonlinear effects. We also discuss the implications of these experimental results in terms of limits on acceptable acceleration rates and alignment errors.

FFAG rings with a racetrack configuration are very promising as their flexible design allow for dedicated spaces for injection/extraction, RF cavities etc. A racetrack FFAG is considered as an option for the nuSTORM facility, which aims to deliver neutrino beams produced from the decay of muons stored in a ring with long sections pointing towards detectors. In this paper we discuss the definition of dynamic aperture in these machines and use the PyZgoubi framework to compute the many turn motion in the nuSTORM ring. The roles of machine imperfections and symmetry are discussed.

Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Commission under the FP7 project HiLumi LHC, GA no. 284404, co-funded by the DoE, USA and KEK, Japan.
The High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) aims to achieve an integrated luminosity of 250-300 fb-1 per year. This upgrade includes the use crab cavities to mitigate the geometric loss of luminosity arising from the beam crossing angle. The tight space constraints at the location of the cavities leads to cavity designs which are axially non-symmetric and have a potentially significant effect on the long term dynamics and dynamic aperture of the LHC. In this paper we present the current status of advanced modelling of crab cavities.

Superconducting RF particle sources combine the advantages of normal conducting RF sources and high duty cycle non-RF sources. The Rossendorf SRF gun was the first to demonstrate this injecting electrons into the ELBE accelerator at 13 MHz. Recently, a new 3-1/2-gun cavity has been prepared at Jefferson Lab for its use in an updated injector which is expected to increase the electron energy from 2.4 to 7.5 MeV. Along with this new cavity, a new gun cryostat has been introduced. It combines several minor updates to the setup with the installation of a superconducting solenoid right at the exit of the gun, compensating the emittance growth of the electron bunch at an early stage. The poster is going to conclude the results of the commissioning of the new cryostat including the solenoid and compare it to the prior concept using a normal conducting solenoid outside the cryostat. As it is of great importance to this subject, studies of the magnetic shielding are going to be presented as well.

In the ELSA stretcher ring electrons are accelerated by a fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s to a beam energy of 3.2 GeV. The high energetic electrons ionize the residual gas molecules in the beam pipe by collisions or synchrotron radiation. The generated ions in turn accumulate inside the beam potential, causing several undesired effects such as tune shifts and beam instabilities. These effects are studied experimentally at ELSA using its full diagnostic capabilities. Both tune shifts due to beam neutralization and transversal beam-ion instabilities can be determined from the beam spectrum. Additionally the beam's transfer function can be measured using a broadband transversal kicker. In the stretcher ring at a beam energy of 1.2 GeV, a periodic beam blow-up was detected in the horizontal plane. Additional measurements of the transversal beam spectrum and ns-time resolution observations with a streak camera identified this blow-up as a coherent dipole oscillation of the beam. This horizontal instability is presumably caused by trapped ions, as there is a strong correlation with the high voltage-bias of the clearing electrodes.

During particle tracking with self-consistent space charge artificial collision between the macro-particles lead to diffusion-like, numerical effects. The artificial collisions generate a stochastic noise spectrum. As a consequence the entropy and the emittance of the particle beam can growth along periodic focusing structures. The growth rates depend on the number of simulation macro-particles and on the space charge tune shifts. For long-term tracking studies the numerical diffusion can lead to incorrect beam loss predictions. In our study we present analytical prediction for the numerical friction and diffusion in 2D and 3D simulations. For simple focusing structures with derive a relation between the friction coefficient and the entropy growth. The scaling of the friction coefficient with the macro-particle number and the space charge tune shift is obtained from 2D and 3D simulations and compared to the analytic predictions.

The FAIR project foresees to deliver an intense single bunch beam with 2·1013 protons of 50ns duration to the experiments. Besides the original γt-shift scenario, an alternative RF proton cycle has been recently studied: the transition energy is crossed with possibly a gamma transition jump. The flexibility of the lattice allowing to change the value of γt, a transition crossing has been considered for two possible energies. This challenging scenario is limited by several constraints such as space charge, a small momentum acceptance and by the required RF manipulations aiming to produce the final single bunch beam in the future SIS-100. This paper focuses on how the high intensity beam would suffer of the mismatch in bunch length at transition and new sets of beam parameter are defined for the proton beam. The jump quadrupole system is also presented. The applicability of the foreseen longitudinal feedback system to cure quadrupolar oscillations is also discussed in this paper.

Recent studies show that the space charge limited (saturated) electron cloud generated by relativistic bunches has strongly inhomogeneous distribution. In particular, a dense electron sheath is formed near the pipe wall. This feature modifies the stopping powers and the microwave transmission compared with the uniform cloud case. In this paper we investigate further the influence of the space charge limited electron cloud on relativistic bunches. In particular, we focus on the incoherent tune spread and compare the results with the homogeneous cloud case. We derive analytical expressions governing the pinch dynamics of the saturated cloud in round geometry. The contribution of the electron cloud sheath to the wake fields is investigated as well. Findings of the analytical theory are then successfully compared with numerical particle-in-cell simulations.

In SuperKEKB, high beta section exists in the interaction region. Fast head-tail instability and incoherent emittance growth due to electron cloud are enhanced in the high beta section. Especially high beta sections are located every betatron phase advance pi. Nonlinear force due to electron cloud is coherently accumulated. Incoherent eminence growth dominates.

The SuperKEKB B-factory is now under construction. The designs of the components for the SuperKEKB have mostly been finished. This paper summarises the updated results of longitudinal impedance calculations for various components of the main rings. By summing up all available impedances, a pseudo-Green wake function with bunch length of σz=0.5 mm is constructed as an impedance model for consequent studies of collective effects. The results of these studies are also reported in this paper.

In Hadron colliders, luminosity degrade various mechanism. Beam-beam related emittance growth is caused by resonances induced by crossing angle. Tune spread due to chromaticity enhances the resonances effect. A bunch shortening phenomenon related to beam-beam interaction has been observed in LHC. The bunch length has an anti-correlation with transverse emittance. This phenomenon has been studied using a weak-strong beam-beam simulation (BBWS code).

The J-PARC MR delivers a proton beam for nuclear physics experiments with slow extraction. The beam is debunched at flat top to obtain a coasting beam by turning off the rf voltage. The controlled emittance blow-up before the flat top has been investigated to mitigate the microwave instability. Beam loading effect can disturb the uniformity of the debunching at the flat top. We describe the results of the particle tracking simulation whole acceleration cycle including the controlled emittance blow-up and the beam loading effect.

To represent the space charge forces of beam a software based on analytical models for space charge distributions was developed. Special algorithm for predictor-corrector method for beam map evaluation scheme including the space charge forces were used. This method allows us to evaluate the map along the reference trajectory and to analyze beam envelope dynamics. In three dimensional models the number of computing resources we use is significant. For this purpose graphical processors are used. This software is a part of Virtual Accelerator concept which is considered as a set of services and tools of modeling beam dynamics in accelerators on distributed computing resources.

Interplay of Touschek Scattering, Intrabeam Scattering, and RF Cavities in Ultralow-emittance Storage Rings

When it goes into operation in 2016, the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring will be the first ultralow-emittance storage ring based on a multibend achromat lattice. These lattices make use of a large number of weak bending magnets which considerably reduces the amount of power radiated in the dipoles in comparison to power radiated from insertion devices. Therefore parameters such as emittance, energy spread, and radiated power are no longer constant during a typical user shift. Since the charge per bunch is usually high, intrabeam scattering (IBS) becomes very strong creating a dependence of emittance on stored current. Since the bunch length can vary as insertion device gaps change, the emittance blow-up from IBS is not constant either. Therefore, the emittance, bunch length, and hence the resulting Touschek lifetime have to be calculated in a self-consistent fashion taking into account the bare lattice, RF cavity settings, bunch charge, and gap settings. This paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (insertion devices, emittance coupling), longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic Landau cavities), and choice of stored current.

With MAX IV construction well underway and storage ring commissioning expected to commence in July 2015, first studies have been launched to improve the optics of the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring with the goal of further reducing the emittance from the baseline design (328 pm rad) towards 150 pm rad while improving the matching of the electron beam to insertion devices to further improve the resulting photon brightness. We report on progress in the development of this new optics taking into account the strong impact from intrabeam scattering and insertion devices on the resulting equilibrium emittance. We present initial results and sketch a path towards a first MAX IV upgrade.

The CERN PS Booster will be upgraded with an H− injection system. The chicane magnets for the injection bump ramp-down in 5 ms and generate eddy currents in the inconel vacuum chamber which perturb the homogeneity of the magnetic field. The multipolar field components are extracted from 3D OPERA simulations and are included in the lattice model. The beta-beating correction is computed all along the ramp and complete tracking simulations including space-charge are performed to evaluate the impact of these perturbations and their correction.

The Extremely Low ENergy Antiproton ring (ELENA) is a small synchrotron equipped with an electron cooler, which shall be constructed at CERN to decelerate antiprotons to energies as low as 100 keV. Scattering of beam particles on rest gas molecules may have a detrimental effect at such low energies and leads to stringent vacuum requirements. Within this contribution scattering of the stored beam on rest gas molecules is discussed for very low beam energies. It is important to carefully distinguish between antiprotons scattered out of the acceptance and lost, and those remaining inside the aperture to avoid overestimation of emittance blow-up. Furthermore, many antiprotons do not interact at all during the time they are stored in ELENA and hence this is not a multiple scattering process

The CERN PS Booster is one of the machines of the LHC injector chain which will be upgraded within the LIU (LHC Injectors upgrade) project. The injection energy of the PSB will be increased to 160MeV in order to mitigate direct space charge effects, considered to be the main performance limitation, thus allowing to double the brightness for the LHC beams. In order to better predict the gain to be expected, space charge simulations are being carried out. Efforts to establish a realistic modeling of field and alignment errors aim at extending the basic model of the machine towards a more realistic one. Simulations of beam dynamics with strong direct space charge and realistic errors are presented and analysed in this paper.

The LHC injection kicker magnets experienced significant beam induced heating of the ferrite yoke, with high intensity beam circulating for many hours, during operation of the LHC in 2011 and 2012. The causes of this beam coupling impedance were studied in depth and an improved beam screen implemented to reduce the impedance. Results of measurements and simulations of the new beam screen design are presented in this paper: these are used to predict power loss and temperature of the ferrite yoke for operation after long shutdown 1 and for proposed HL-LHC operational parameters.

We describe a precise beam dynamics model of the production set up of the Injector 2 Cyclotron at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). Injector 2 is a 72 MeV separate-sector cyclotron producing a high intensity proton beam up to 2.7 mA CW, which is then injected into the 590 MeV Ring Cyclotron. The model includes space charge and is calculated for optimised matched initial conditions. It has been verified with measurements. Based on this model we estimate the limits to the intensity obtainable from Injector 2. The precise beam dynamics model is based on the OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library) simulation code, a tool for charged-particle optics calculations in large accelerator structures and beam lines including 3D space charge.

We describe a numerical model for measurements of the formation of long-lived electron clouds in a quadrupole magnet in the CESR storage ring. The shielded stripline detector measures the electron flux incident on the vacuum chamber wall directly in front of one of the poles of the magnet. The model includes photo-electron production by synchrotron radiation, electrostatic forces from the bunched positron beam and the cloud, macroparticle tracking in the field of the quadrupole, secondary electron emission from the 9.5-cm-diameter cylindrical stainless steel beam-pipe and an analytic calculation of the transmission function of the holes in the vacuum chamber which allow cloud electrons to reach the stripline collector. These modeling studies provide a quantitative understanding of the trapping mechanism which results in cloud electrons surviving the 2.3-microsecond time interval prior to the return of a train of positron bunches. These studies have been performed in the context of the CESR Test Accelerator program, which aims to quantify and mitigate performance limitations on future low-emittance storage and damping rings.

Recent reports from CesrTA have shown measurement and calculation of beam size versus current in CesrTA beams at 2.1 GeV. Here, the effect of changing the energy of IBS-dominated beams is reported. IBS growth rates have roughly a γ-3 dependence. Measurements at 1.8, 2.1, 2.3, and 2.5 GeV are shown and compared with predictions from IBS theory.

Fast Ion Instability can lead to deterioration of an electron beam (increasing emittance and instability of a train of bunches) in storage rings and linacs. We study this at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring Test Accelerator using a 2.1 GeV low emittance beam. As the source of ions is residual gas, our measurements are conducted at various pressures, including nominal vacuum as well as injected gas (Ar, Kr). We measure turn-by-turn vertical bunch size and position, as well as the multi-bunch power spectrum. A detailed simulation is then used to compare theory with observations.

In this report we derive rigorous and approximate dispersion relations for the round resistive thin-wall waveguide. The features of the distributions of dispersion curves of the waveguide axisymmetric TM modes are obtained. Cases of splitting and degeneracy of modes under consideration are detected and regularities of their behaviours are established.

The AREAL linear accelerator will produce electron beam with 5 MeV energy and further upgrade up to 20 MeV. At the first stage of the operation the construction of the beam diagnostic section of complex shape and layout is planned thus making the radiation source definition difficult. FLUKA particle tracking simulation code was used to calculate produced radiation dose rates and define an appropriate radiation shielding.

In linear accelerators or transfer lines beam-based alignment (BBA) techniques are important tools for beam orbit steering. In this paper BBA correction algorithm based on difference orbit multiple measurements is proposed. Numerical simulation results for European XFEL SASE1 and FLASH undulator section are presented, according to which the orbit alignment can be achieved within accuracy of about 2 microns and 5 microns respectively. The influence of quadrupole gradient errors is also discussed.

At high charge, relativistic electron bunches circulating in storage rings undergo an instability, the so-called microbunching or the CSR (Coherent Synchrotron Radiation) instability. This instability is due to the interaction of the electrons with their own radiation and leads to the formation of microstructures (at millimeter scale) in the longitudinal phase space. Thanks to a new type of detector, based on superconducting thin film YBCO, it is now possible to observe directly these microstructures and follow their temporal evolution*. These experimental observations open a new way to make severe comparisons with theory. Here we present results of the modeling of the dynamics at UVSOR-III using a one dimensional Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. We show that to obtain a relatively good agreement between numerical simulations and experiments, we have to take into account several types of impedance such as the shielded CSR impedance but also the resistive and inductive impedances.

BESSY-VSR, a scheme where 1.5 ps and 15 ps long bunches (rms) can be stored simultaneously in the BESSY II storage ring has recently been proposed*. The strong longitudinal bunch focusing is achieved by superconducting high gradient RF cavities. This paper presents investigations of coupled bunch instabilities driven by HOMs of superconducting multi cell cavities in BESSY-VSR. Analytical calculations and tracking simulations in time domain are performed in the longitudinal and the transverse planes and factors that influence the threshold currents are being discussed. Suitable candidates of cavities which are presently available or in the phase of design are compared with respect to their instability thresholds.

BERLinPro is using the new energy recovery linac technology. As, maintaining the low emittance and energy spread is of major importance in an ERL, the deep understanding and control of effects which can degrade the emittance and energy spread such as space charge effects are of interest. The microbunching caused by the longitudinal space charge forces can lead to an increase in emittance and energy spread in the arcs of the loop. In this contribution, the impacts of the microbunching instability on the beam quality and its implication for BERLinPro are discussed.

For the quantification of intensity thresholds due to coherent instabilities and beam induced heating in the FAIR synchrotron SIS100 a detailed knowledge of transverse and longitudinal beam coupling impedance is required. Due to the rather long proton and heavy-ion bunches, the relevant spectrum is below 100MHz. For the computation of beam coupling impedances in the low frequency regime, frequency domain methods are more advantageous than (explicit) time domain methods. We show the setup of a 2D finite element code that allows to compute the impedance for arbitrary longituninally homogeneous beam and structure shapes. Perfectly conducting pipes, a dispersive ferrite tube, and thin resistive beam pipe serve as test cases. The influence of the beam velocity on the coupling impedance is studied.

Ions generated by synchrotron radiation and collisions of the beam with the rest gas in the vacuum chamber could be a limiting factor for the operation of electron storage rings and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL). In order to develop beam instability mitigation strategies, a deeper understanding of the ion-cloud behaviour is needed. Numerical simulations of the interaction between electron beams and parasitic ions verified with dedicated measurements can help to acquire that knowledge. This paper presents results of detailed simulations of the interaction in quadrupole magnets and drift sections of the Electron Stretcher Accelerator ELSA in Bonn. The focus is on the evaluation of the dynamics of different ion species and their characteristic distribution in quadrupole magnets.

Open cell conductive foams (OCMF) have been recently suggested as an alternative to perforated metal patches for efficiently handling gas desorption from the beam pipe wall due to intense synchrotron radiation, yielding superior performance in terms of residual gas concentration and beam shielding. Experimental work is ongoing to assess their properties, including secondary emission yields and beam coupling impedances. In this communication we attempt a review of the Literature about electromagnetic modeling of OCMF, and outline a general framework for computing the surface impedance of OCMF walls and deriving the longitudinal and transverse beam coupling impedances thereof, based on effective medium theory and electromagnetic reciprocity. A critical analysis of the relevant modeling approximations is included.

The luminosity is limited by the electron cloud effects in presently running and proposed future storage rings. The evolution of the electron density during the electron cloud formation can be reproduced using a bunch-to-bunch iterative map formalism. By performing simulation codes this approach has been used to obtain a numerical prediction of the coefficients in the map, while in the presence of a magnetic field an analytic formula has been obtained for the linear coefficient. The next goal is finding a theoretical prescription of the quadratic coefficient at least in the presence of magnetic dipole. Then it will be possible to reproduce, by using the map formalism, the dynamics of electron cloud without performing the simulations.

The High Luminosity LHC project is aimed at increasing the LHC luminosity by an order of magnitude. One of the key ingredients to achieve the luminosity goal is the beam intensity increase. In order to keep under control beam instabilities and to avoid excessive power losses a careful design of new vacuum chamber components and an improvement of the present LHC impedance model are required. Collimators are the main impedance contributors. Measurements with beam have revealed that the betatron coherent tune shifts were by about a factor of 2 higher with respect to the theoretical predictions based on the current model. Up to now the resistive wall impedance has been considered as the major impedance contribution for collimators. By carefully simulating their geometric impedance we show that for the graphite collimators with half-gaps higher than 10 mm the geometric impedance exceeds the resistive wall one. In turn, for the tungsten collimators the geometric impedance dominates for all used gap values. Hence, including the geometric collimator impedance into the LHC impedance model enabled us to reach a better agreement between the measured and simulated collimator tune shifts.

In the SPring-8 storage ring, various kinds of bunch filling pattern are available. Under some bunch filling patterns, residual gas ions created by scattering process between high energy electrons and residual gas molecules can be trapped stably around the electron beam and disturb the original motion of the beam. We have considered the stability of the electron beam due to the ion related phenomenon under several bunch filling patterns by computer simulation. In the simulation, we have modeled the electron bunch as single particle and the residual gas ions as macroparticles. The number of the trapped ions, size of the ion cloud and change in betatron oscillation amplitude of the beam under several filling pattern conditions will be discussed. We have also performed experiments for stability of the beam under equally spaced bunch filling patterns which give severe condition for the ion related instability. The numerical calculations and the experimental results will be discussed in the presentation.

The transverse impedance of the extraction kicker magnets is the most dominant beam instability source in the 3-GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron of J-PARC. The instability occurs when chromaticity is fully corrected during acceleration but on the other hand no instabilities are observed for a full chromatic correction only at the injection energy even for a beam power up to 500 kW. However, the situation may change for a beam power of 1 MW and also for the upgraded injection beam energy from the present 181 MeV to the 400 MeV, as space charge effect in the non-relativistic region is believed to suppress the growth rate of beam instability. In order to study the kicker impedance in detail, recently we have introduced measured time dependent impedance source in the ORBIT simulation code in a realistic manner. The ORBIT code itself has also been well upgraded and given realistic features for application to synchrotrons. We have also carried out a systematic experimental study for a maximum beam power of 500 kW. In this paper, a detail comparison between measurements and corresponding simulations including 1 MW simulation results are presented.

Measurements of the vertical single bunch mode detuning and the TMCI threshold at zero chromaticity were carried out and their results were compared to the theoretical expectation. Around 65% of the found mode detuning can be explained by a developed transverse impedance model. A good bunch length parametrisation with current contributed essentially to this result. The analysis of single bunch measurements at non-zero chromaticity will also be presented.

Collective effects in MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring are strongly enhanced by the combination of low emittance, high current and small effective aperture. Three passive harmonic cavities (HC) are introduced to lengthen the bunches, by which beam stabilization is anticipated via decoupling to high frequency wakes, along with Landau damping. The role of the ransverse impedance budget of the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring as a source of collective beam instabilities was determined. With the help of the macroparticle multi-bunch tracking code mbtrack that directly uses the former as input, we studied the influence of geometric and resistive wall impedance in both transverse planes, as well as that of chromaticity shifting. A fully dynamic treatment of the passive harmonic cavities developed for this study allowed us to evaluate their effectiveness under varying beam conditions.

The UA9 piezo-goniometer has been designed to guarantee micro-radians-accuracy angular positioning of a silicon crystal for a crystal collimation experiment in the LHC, and to minimize the impact on the LHC beam-coupling impedance. This paper presents a Finite Element Method (FEM) study of the device, in both parking and operational positions, to evaluate its impact on the LHC impedance budget. The study has been a progressive simulation work, started from the simplification of the original detailed design, and aimed at highlighting the effect of single details (e.g. objects in confining chambers) on the longitudinal and transverse components of beam-coupling impedance. In addition, the shielding contribution of the RF gaskets has been carefully evaluated, with the objective to assess the consequences for operation in case of their failure. Sensitivity analyses to simulation parameters are also performed, in order to test the FEM model robustness. A final word is drawn on the overall device impedance criticality.

Resistive-wall impedance usually constitutes a significant percentage of the total beam-coupling impedance budget of many accelerator structures (e.g. for LHC, it can be more than 50%). Reduction techniques for resistive-wall components entail high electrical-conductivity coatings. This paper proposes the use of metamaterials, having negative values of magnetic permeability or dielectric permittivity (or both), for sensibly reducing or theoretically nearly cancelling the resistive-wall component of beam-coupling impedance. The proposed approach is developed by means of an equivalent transmission-line model, whose results show the potential reduction of both longitudinal and transverse impedance when using metamaterial insertions. The effects on the real and imaginary part have been singled out. The effectiveness of such materials is discussed both for negative-permittivity and for negative-permeability cases, which actually show different impacts and can be then target of proper engineering. This first-stage study opens the possibility of considering metamaterials for impedance mitigation or for setting up proper experimental setups.

Different measurements of the longitudinal impedance of the LHC done with single bunches with various intensities and longitudinal emittances during measurement sessions in 2011-2012 are compared with particle simulations based on the existing LHC impedance model. The very low reactive impedance of the LHC, with Im(Z/n) around 0.1 Ohm, is not easy to measure. The most sensitive observation is the loss of Landau damping during acceleration, which shows at which energy bunches become unstable depending on their parameters. In addition, the synchrotron frequency shift due to the reactive impedance was estimated following two methods. Firstly, it was obtained from the peak-detected Schottky spectrum. Secondly, a sine modulation in the RF phase was applied to the bunches with different intensities and the modulation frequency was scanned. In both cases, the synchrotron frequency shift was of the order of the measurement precision.

Single bunch instability thresholds and the associated coherent tune shifts have been evaluated in the transverse plane for the damping rings (DR) of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). A multi-kick version of the HEADTAIL code was used to study the instability thresholds in the case where different impedance contributions are taken into account such as the broad-band resonator model in combination with the resistive wall contribution from the arcs and the wigglers of the DR. Simulations performed for positive values of chromaticity showed that higher order bunch modes can be potentially dangerous for the beam stability.

A protection septum has been installed in the CERN PS section 15 in order to mitigate irradiation of the magnetic septum 16 for fast extractions towards the SPS. Impedance studies have been performed, showing that beams circulating in the septum during extraction generate sharp resonances in the coupling impedance. Impedance measurements with the wire technique have been performed, showing a good agreement with simulations. Instability rise times of trapped modes have been evaluated and compared to extraction duration. Solutions for reducing the impact on the stability of the beam have been considered.

The current knowledge of the transverse impedance of the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) has been established by theoretical computations, electromagnetic simulations and beam-based measurements at different energies. The transverse coherent tune and phase advance shifts as a function of intensity have been measured in order to evaluate the total effective transverse impedance and its distribution in the accelerator. In order to understand the beam dynamics, the frequency dependence of the impedance budget has also been evaluated considering the individual contribution of several machine devices. 3D models of many PS elements have been realized to perform accurate impedance simulations, while resistive wall and indirect space charge impedances have been evaluated with theoretical and numerical computations. Finally comparisons between the total budget and the measurement results are presented.

The performance of 25 ns beams in the LHC is strongly limited by the electron cloud. To determine the amount electron cloud in the cold sections of the machine, it is very important to be able to disentangle the beam induced heating due to the beam coupling impedance from that attributable to electron cloud. This paper will focus on the calculation of the first contribution. First, the impedance model used for the calculation of the beam induced power loss is briefly discussed. Then, the methods for the calculation of the beam induced power loss in regions with one or two beams are also described. Finally, the calculated power loss is compared with the measured heat loads for both 25 and 50 ns beams in both the LHC arcs and in the inner triplets (ITs).

The infinite length approximation is often used to simplify the calculation of the beam coupling impedance of accelerator elements. This is expected to be a reasonable assumption for devices whose length is greater than the transverse dimension but may be a less accurate approximation for segmented devices. In this contribution we present the extension of the study of the beam coupling impedance of a finite length device to the transverse plane. In order to take into account the finite length, we decompose the fields in the cavity and in the beam pipe into a set of orthonormal modes and apply the Mode Matching method to obtain the impedance. To validate our method, we will present comparisons between analytical formulas and 3D electromagnetic CST simulations.

In the framework of the PS-Booster upgrade project an accurate impedance model is needed in order to determine the effect on the beam stability and assess the impact of the new devices to be installed in the machine. CST 3-D EM simulations are widely used to estimate the impedance contribution of the different devices along the CERN accelerator complex. Unlike the highly relativistic case, in which the reliability of the EM solver has been proved in many specific cases by comparing simulations with analytical results, the nonrelativistic case has been so far not yet benchmarked. In order to use systematically CST 3-D EM simulations for the PS-Booster, or even lower energy machines like the antiproton decelerator ELENA, a validation campaign has been carried out. The main complication to single out the beam coupling impedance, as resulting from the interaction of the beam with the surroundings, consisted of removing reliably the strong contribution of the direct space charge of the source bunch, which is included in the EM calculation. The simulation results were then benchmarked with the analytical results for the case of a PEC cylindrical tube and of a ferrite loaded kicker.

At the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA) experiments have been studying the interaction of the electron cloud (EC) with 2.1 GeV stored electron and positron beams. These experiments are intended to characterize the dependence of beam–EC interactions on various beam parameters, such as bunch spacing and vertical chromaticity. Most experiments were performed with 30 or 45-bunch trains, at a fixed current of 0.75 mA/bunch. Earlier experiments with positrons had varied the bunch spacing between 4 and 56 ns at three different vertical chromaticity settings. More recent measurements have included electron-bunch trains to contrast the build up of EC between electron and positron beams. The dynamics of the stored beam was quantified using: a gated Beam Position Monitor (BPM) and spectrum analyzer to measure the frequency spectrum of bunches in the trains; an x-ray beam size monitor to record the bunch-by-bunch, turn-by-turn vertical size of each bunch within the trains. We report on recent ob-servations from these experiments and additional studies, using witness bunches trailing 30 or 45-bunch positron trains, which were used for the generation of the ECs.

The RHIC luminosity upgrade program aims for an increase of the polarized proton luminosity by a factor 2. To achieve this goal a significant increase in the beam intensity is foreseen. The beam coupling impedance represents a source of detrimental effects for beam quality and stability at high bunch intensities. In this paper, we evaluate a new global transverse impedance in both RHIC and the AGS with recent measurements of tune shift as a function of bunch intensity. The results are compared to past measurements and present impedance model.

Bunch-by-bunch feedback systems provide an important component in the reliable operation of electron storage rings. Modern digital bunch-by-bunch feedback systems allow efficient mitigation of multi-bunch instabilities, and at the same time offer valuable beam diagnostics. In this contribution, setup and performance of the bunch-by-bunch feedback systems at BESSY II and the MLS are presented. Longitudinal and transverse instabilities are studied under different machine conditions. The developed data analysis techniques and experimental measurements are discussed.

The main synchrotron SIS100 of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) will be equipped with a bunch-by-bunch feedback system to damp longitudinal beam oscillations. In the basic layout, one three-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter will be used for each single bunch and oscillation mode. The detected oscillations are used to generate a correction voltage in dedicated broadband radio frequency (RF) cavities. The digital filter is completely described by two parameters, the feedback gain and the passband center frequency, which have to be defined depending on the longitudinal beam dynamics. In earlier works*, the performance of the closed loop control with such an FIR-filter was analyzed and compared to simulations and measurements with respect to the damping of coherent dipole and quadrupole modes, the first modes of oscillation. This contribution analyzes the influence of cavity beam loading on the closed loop performance and the choice of the feedback gain and passband center frequency to verify future high current operation at FAIR.

A new digital three dimensional fast bunch by bunch feedback system has been installed and commissioned at ANKA. Immediate improvements to stored current and lifetime were achieved for normal user operation. For this, the feedback has to be running during the injection and the energy ramp to 2.5 GeV. Additionally, the feedback system was also incorporated into the diagnostic tool-set at ANKA and opened up new possibilities of automated and continuous measurements of certain beam parameters. The system can operate in different modes such as the low alpha operation mode, which has different requirements on the feedback system compared to normal user operation. Results on the various aspects will be presented as well as future improvements.

The top-up operation established since 2010 at the Elettra third-generation synchrotron light source has solved the problems related to thermal drifts and beam current dependence, and a series of feedback loops acting on the machine optics and radio-frequency systems made easier to setup and operate the ring. Those systems together with the fast orbit feedback in operation since 2007, contributed to a very high electron beam orbit stability. A description of the active systems and their performance, future perspectives as well as some still open issues will be presented and discussed.

A common Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB) application is planned for the new storage rings at MAX IV laboratory and SOLARIS. The application will run in the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) electronics (Libera Brilliance+). Global orbit data concentration will be conducted inside the gigabit data exchange (GDX) modules with a Virtex6 field programmable gate array, which will be daisy-chained around the storage ring. The feedback calculation algorithm is based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) – the PI controller will be applied in the modal space for individual eigenmodes. The calculations will be distributed over all GDX modules to reduce overall latency. Each GDX module will calculate setpoints for four correctors, horizontal or vertical. The new setpoints will be sent directly to the magnet power supply controllers over a serial point-to-point link. This article presents details on FOFB implementation and control topology.

According to the Conceptual Design Report, the power to accelerate the main colliding beams of CLIC is taken from parallel high intensity (100 A), low energy (2.37 GeV) beams. These beams are generated by long trains, accelerated by conventional klystrons and then time-compressed in the so called Drive-Beam Recombination Complex (DBRC). A scaled version of the DBRC has been built at the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) at CERN in order to prove its principle and study any arising feasibility issues. One of the main constraints is the emittance control during the recombination process. This work presents an overview of the studies ongoing at CTF3, keeping in view possible improvements of the nominal CLIC design. In particular, a generic feedback algorithm to solve (quasi-)linear systems has been implemented and used in order to optimise the process by tuning the energy of the beam and steer the orbits in the different lines, as well matching the design dispersion. Current results and possible room for further optimisation will be shown.

Since initial operation for users in Jan 2007, Diamond Light Source has developed to support a suite of 22 experimental stations. These stations have resulted in the installation of 24 undulators and two superconducting wigglers in the storage ring. To preserve optics, tune and coupling with the operation of these devices has necessitated the implementation of a number of feed-forward and feedback schemes. The implementation and operation of these correction schemes will be described.

The Diamond storage ring is currently operated with 26 insertion devices (IDs), including 14 in-vacuum IDs, 7 APPLE-II type helical undulators and 2 superconducting wigglers. Differences in the design, construction and operation of these devices, combined with different Twiss parameters at the source point, mean each has a different impact on tune stability and beta-beat. In turn, these parameters affect the on and off-momentum dynamic aperture and ultimately impact on the injection efficiency and lifetime. Another source of optics variation arises from the coherent tune shift with current, which when injecting from zero current causes the tune to span the available good-tune region. In this paper we discuss the difficulties of operating the Diamond storage ring in top-up mode with these effects, and present the various measures taken to stabilise the storage ring optics.

Since March 2013, the Diamond storage ring has been operated with a target vertical emittance of 8 pm.rad. This condition is achieved by first applying a LOCO* optics correction with IDs set to their typical gaps, then offsetting the skew quadrupole magnets in order to increase the vertical emittance again to the desired value. Whilst a feedback application** is able to stabilise the vertical emittance during ID gap and phase changes in the short to medium term, regular applications of LOCO are still required to maintain good coupling control in the longer term. In this paper we describe measures taken to speed up the optics correction procedure, including a fast orbit response matrix measurement, a reduction of the number of magnets used to measure the data, and a distribution of the LOCO calculations to run in parallel.

We present the expanded system architecture in development for the control of intra-bunch instabilities in the SPS. Earlier efforts concentrated on validating the performance of a single-bunch demonstration processor. This minimal system was successfully commissioned at the SPS just prior to the LS1 shutdown. The architecture is now in expansion for more complex functionality, specifically multi-bunch control, control during energy ramps, and the expansion of the system front-end dynamic range with more sophisticated orbit offset techniques. Two designs of wideband kicker are being developed for installation and evaluation with the beam. With these GHz bandwidth devices and new RF amplifiers we anticipate being able to excite and control internal motion of the beam consistent with modes expected for Ecloud and TMCI effects. We highlight the expanded features, and present strategies for verifying the behavior of the beam-feedback system in the next series of machine measurements planned after the LS1 shutdown.

The feedback control of intra-bunch instabilities driven by electron-clouds or strong head-tail coupling requires bandwidth sufficient to sense the vertical position and apply multiple corrections within a nanosecond-scale bunch. These requirements impose challenges and limits in the design and implementation of the feedback system. This paper presents model-based design techniques for feedback systems to address the stabilization of the transverse bunch dynamics. These techniques include in the design the effect of noise and signals perturbing the bunch motion. Different controllers are compared based on stability margins and equivalent noise gain between input-output of the processing channel. The controller design uses as example the bunch dynamics defined by the SPS ring including the Q20 optics.

In order for the SPS to meet the beam intensity demands for the HL-LHC upgrade, control and mitigation of transverse beam instabilities caused by electron cloud and TMCI will be essential. For this purpose a wideband intra-bunch feedback method has been proposed, based on a 4 GS/s front end data acquisition and processing, and on a back end frequency response extending to at least 1 GHz. A slotted type kicker, similar to those used for stochastic cooling, as well as an array of stripline kickers have been considered as the terminal elements of the feedback system. A slotted TEM type kicker has been designed fulfilling the bandwidth and kick strength requirements for the SPS application. In this paper we present an updated version of the design and electromagnetic characteristics, leading into the mechanical design and construction of the kicker occurring later this year.

With pinpoint accuracy, the next generation of Linear Collider such as CLIC will collide electron and positron beams at a centre of mass energy of 3 TeV with a desired peak luminosity of 2*1034 cm-2s−1. One of the many challenging features of CLIC is its ability to collide beams at the sub-nanometer scale at the Interaction Point (IP). Such a high level of accuracy could only be achieved by integrating Active Vibration Isolation system (AVI) upstream the collision to prevent the main source of vibration; Ground Motion (GM). Complementary control systems downstream the collision (Interaction Point FeedBack (IPFB), Orbit FeedBack(OFB)) allow low frequency vibration rejection. This paper focus on a dedicated AVI table designed for the last focusing quadrupole QD0 where the specifications are the most stringent. Combining FeedForward (FF) and FeedBack (FB) techniques, the prototype is able to reduce GM down to 0.6 nm RMS(4Hz) experimentally without load. These performances couldn’t be achieved without cutting edge-technology such as sub-nanometer piezo actuator, ultra-low noise accelerometer and seismometers and an accurate guidance system. The whole AVI system is described in detail.

Two techniques to perform Beam-Based Alignment are presented. These techniques are intended for the difficult case arising in circular accelerators characterized by a nonlinear dependence of the Response Matrix on misalignments of the magnetic sources, where the standard approach fails. The developed algorithms have been successfully used to reconstruct misalignments in the transverse position of the quadrupoles installed in the main rings of the DAΦNE collider.

The misalignment of the linac beamline components amounted to be a millimeter level during the operation of KEKB, though the requirement of 0.1mm in mind. The limited effort toward improving such big misalignments has long been pursued but could not finish especially after the earthquake in March 2011. This linac is now under upgrade to the SuperKEKB, where the required alignment is 0.1mm in σ for the short distance in 100m span, while 0.3mm through the whole linac for the emittance preservation. The straight line as a reference for the alignment was defined by laser beam over 500m. The actual hardwares are set with respect to this reference line by using a laser tracker. The alignment present status is reported in this paper. On the other hand, we noticed, through the alignment measurements over months, that the tunnel floor moved in the range of 0.1mm or maybe more. The evaluation of this movement is on-going to discuss about how to achieve the required emittance and how to keep the situation. Various measurements to evaluate the movement are presented also in the paper.

The beam line of the KEKB injector linac is under realignment as the restoration after the big Earthquake in 2011, but with the refinement for the SuperKEKB in mind. The linac consists of two straight sections connected by a 180 degree ARC. Precise alignment of the ARC magnets is one of the key issues for the emittance preservation of the electron beam. The ARC beam line was defined by measuring these two straight lines. Then, the misalignment of the ARC magnets were reduced from 3 mm maximum down to 0.1mm in the errors perpendicular to the beam direction. This paper describes how we defined the ARC beam line and performed the alignment. The connection method of the laser tracker data needed for the definition of the ARC was also studied and described.

Alignment of superconducting cavities is one of the important issues for linear collider and/or future light source like ERL and X-FEL. To measure the cavity displacement under cooling to liquid He temperature more precisely, we newly developed the position monitor by using white light interferometer. This monitor is based on the measurement of the interference of light between the measurement target and the reference point. It can measure the position from the outside of the cryomodule. We applied this monitor to the main linac cryomodule of Compact ERL (cERL) and successfully measured the displacement during 2K cooling with the resolution of 10um. However, some drift come from outer temperature and humidity were observed. In this paper, we describe the upgraded version of this monitor to suppress these drift for cERL beam operation.

CERN is currently studying the feasibility of building a high energy e+ e− linear collider: the CLIC (Compact LInear Collider). One of the engineering challenges is the pre-alignment precision and accuracy requirement on the alignment of the linac components. For example, the magnetic axis of a Drive Beam Quadrupole will need to be aligned within 20 um rms with respect to a straight reference line of alignment. The fiducialisation process which is the determination of the magnetic axis with respect to external alignment targets, that is part of this error budget, will have to be performed at an accuracy never reached before. This paper presents the strategy proposed for the fiducialisation of the Drive Beam quadrupole, based on a combination of CMM measurements, WPS measurements and Laser tracker measurements. The results obtained on a dedicated test bench will be described as well.

Aligning accelerator components over 200m with 10 μm accuracy is a challenging task within the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) study. A solution based on laser beam in vacuum as straight line reference is proposed. The positions of the accelerator’s components are measured with respect to the laser beam by sensors made of camera/shutter assemblies. To validate these sensors, laser pointing stability has to be studied over 200m. We perform experiments in air and in vacuum in order to know how laser pointing stability varies with the distance of propagation and with the environment. The experiments show that the standard deviations of the laser spot coordinates increase with the distance of propagation. They also show that the standard deviations are much smaller in vacuum (8 μm at 35m) than in air (2000 μm at 200m). Our experiment validates the concept of laser beam in vacuum with camera/shutter assembly for micrometric positioning over 35m. It also gives an estimation of the achievable precision.

Since several years CERN is studying the feasibility of building a high energy e+ e− linear collider: the CLIC (Compact LInear Collider). The pre-alignment precision and accuracy requirement for the transverse positions of the linac components is typically 14 micrometers over a sliding window of 200m. One of the challenges is precise adjustment of Drive Beam quadrupole’s magnetic axis. It has to be done with micrometric resolution along 5 DOF in a common support’s coordinate system. This paper describes the design and the study of a solution based on flexural components in a type of “Stewart Platform” configuration. The engineering approach, the lessons learned (“know how”), the issues of adjustment solution and the mechanical components behaviors are presented.

At the electron accelerator ELSA, a new external beamline is under construction, whose task is to provide a primary electron beam for detector tests. In the future the accelerator facility will not only be offering an electron beam to the currently implemented photoproduction experiments for hadron physics, but to the new "‘research and technology center detector physics"',whose task is to develop detectors for particle and astroparticle physics. To dump and simultaneously measure the current of the electron beam behind the detector components a Faraday cup consisting of depleted uranium is used. The residual radiation leaving the cup is absorbed in a concrete casing. The radiation protection concept for the entire area of the new beamline was designed with the help of the Monte Carlo simulation program Fluka. In addition the concrete casing, radiation protection walls were taken into account to allow a safe working environment in the room created by the shielding walls. The presentation gives an overview of the different radiation protection concepts for the new beamline for detector tests at ELSA. Furthermore, progresses at the beamline will be reported.

The Superconducting Darmstadt Linear Electron Accelerator S-DALINAC has been running since 1991. It consists of an injector linac, a main linac with two recirculations and is mainly used for in-house nuclear physics experiments as well as accelerator physics and technology. Radiation safety regulations demand an interlock system during operation of the accelerator. Amongst other major projects increasing the versatility and operation stability of the S-DALINAC, the existing, hardware based, interlock system is going to be replaced in the next shutdown period. The new interlock system is based on a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and will provide two subsystems, a personnel interlock system as well as a machine safety interlock system. Whereas the first subsystem is to protect staff and visitors from being harmed by ionizing radiation, the latter subsystem prohibits the S-DALINAC beam transport and vacuum elements from being damaged due to malfunctioning of any components during accelerator operation. This contribution will give an overview on this new system and will show the latest status.

A proton therapy test facility with a beam current lower than 10 nA in average, and an energy up to 85 MeV, has to be sited at the Frascati ENEA Research Center, in Italy. The accelerator is composed by a sequence of linear sections. From the radiation protection point of view the source of radiation for this facility is almost completely located at the final target. Physical and geometrical models of the device have been developed and implemented into a radiation transport computer code based on Monte Carlo method. The main scope is the assessment of the dose rates around the radiation source for supporting the safety analysis. For the assessment was used the FLUKA (FLUktuierende KAskade) computer code. A general purpose tool for the calculation of particle transport and interaction with matter, covering an extended range of applications including proton beam analysis. The models implemented into the code are described and the results are presented. The calculated dose rates are reported at different distances from the target. Considerations about personnel safety are issued and the shielding requirements are anticipated.

Since 2011, high power lasers have been delivered stably to the users at SACLA, the SPring-8 Angstrom compact free electron laser, and the upgrades have been performing to obtain the high quality of the laser continuously. Optical fiber based Cherenkov beam loss monitors have been successfully operated from the commissioning phase. This monitor covers the undulator section of beam lines and the electron beam transporting tunnel from SACLA to SPring-8. This monitor is made good use of not only beam transport but also detection of the small beam loss such as electron halos hitting the magnets of undulator. In this presentation, we will report the present status of the Cherenkov beam loss monitor and its usage experience.

Neutrons generated by a 345 MeV/u uranium beam bombardment on a 3-mm-thick Be target were measured outside the target chamber using activation detectors of bismuth, aluminum and carbon at 60, 70 and 90 degrees from the beam axis. After a few days irradiation, the activation detectors were removed, and the energy spectra of photons from radionuclides generated by reactions of 209Bi(n, xn)210-xBi(x=4~10), 12C(n, 2n)11C and 27Al(n, alpha)24Na were measured using a germanium detector. Photo peak counts of corresponding photon energies were analyzed with considering detector efficiencies and a beam intensity fluctuation during the irradiation. The production rates of the radionuclides were obtained for all reactions. Monte Carlo simulation using the PHITS code was also performed. Fluxes of neutrons at the activation detectors were tallied and the energy spectra were obtained. Production rates of the radionuclides were obtained by folding the thus obtained energy spectra with activation cross section data. Comparisons with the measurements showed agreements within about 60%.

An important aspect in the design and operation of high-energy particle accelerators is the planning of maintenance interventions. In the planning of these interventions, optimizing the exposure of the maintenance workers to ionizing radiation is a core issue. In this context, we have addressed the need for an interactive visual software tool. The intervention planning has been modelled mathematically. A proof-of-concept software tool has been implemented using this model, providing interactive visualization of facilities and radiation levels, tools for trajectory planning and automatic calculation of the expected integrated equivalent radiation dose. We explore the use of the software using a large experimental hall at CERN as a case study. Interactive visualization of the facilities and radiation levels, tools for interactive trajectory planning as well as automatic calculation of the expected integrated equivalent dose contracted during an intervention are explored. The obtained results prove the relevance of the developed methodology and software tool and demonstrate, among others, a better exploitation of the simulation data, leading to a potential accuracy gain.

According to the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) operations plan the facility components are replaced, when they reach their end-of-life due to radiation induced material damage or burn-up or because of mechanical failure or design improvements. During operation these components are exposed to a severe radiation environment and builds up significant activity during its service lifetime. These components must be safely removed, placed in a container for storage, and transported from the site. In order to classify components and suggest appropriate shipping container an accurate estimate of the radionuclide inventory is performed. On the base of calculated radionuclide inventory the spent component is classified and appropriate container for transport and storage is suggested. Container it is being modelled with the facility component, placed inside, in order to perform transport calculations to ensure that the container is compliant with the waste management regulations. Dose rate analyses are performed as well for the exposure prediction of personnel during components change out.

REGAE (Relativistic Electron Gun for Atomic Exploration) at DESY in Hamburg is a linear accelerator for electron diffraction experiments. It is upgraded to allow for laser driven wake field accelerator experiments. The bunch length is around 10 fs and the wakefield structure is about 100 fs and the synchronization of the laser and the electron bunch needs to be in order of the bunch length. To achieve this, a RFbased scheme will be used, comparing the phase of a beam induced signal with the reference clock. To improve the performance for the operation with charges well below 1 pC a beam arrival time cavity (BAC) at 3.025 GHz is foreseen as a highly sensitive pickup. To provide the maximum energy to the measurement electronics, the cavity needs a high R=Qvalue and an optimized coupling. An over-coupled setting might be beneficial as it provides a higher signal-to-noise ratio for the first samples. In this paper the concept of the beam arrival time cavity, the influence of the dark current on the measurement and parameter studies and optimization of the cavity itself are presented.

In this paper we present a compact and efficient approach for laser synchronization based on MTCA.4 platform. Laser pulses are converted to the RF signals using a photo-diode detector. The RF section performs filtering, amplification and down-conversion of a narrowband, CW signal. The resulting IF signal is sampled by a high resolution digitizer on the AMC (Advanced Mezzanine Card) side and transported via point-to-point links to an adjacent AMC board. The processing electronics on this board drives a digital-to-analog converter on the rear-side. The analog signal is then filtered and amplified by a high voltage power amplifier which drives the piezo stretcher in the laser. Some preliminary results of laser to RF locking with such a scheme are presented.

This paper presents development of a new tag supply system for the data-acquisition (DAQ) system for SACLA user experiments. The X-ray Free-Electron Laser facility in SPring-8, SACLA, has delivered X-ray laser beams to users since March 2012 [1]. For the user experiments at SACLA, a dedicated DAQ system has been developed. The DAQ system is currently capable to operate with maximum ten sensors of multiport Charge-Coupled Device (MPCCD) for X-ray detection. The data of ten sensors are read out with individual readout modules. We implement a new tag supply system to ensure the reconstruction of the diffraction image of the user experiments. The tag data are used to synchronize the data. One master server receives a signal given by accelerator and the delivery of the tag data follows to five experimental halls at SACLA and some of monitors at SACLA accelerator. We employ dedicated communication lines to deliver the tag data. The longest distance to deliver the tag data is about one kilometer. We need to update entire softwares of DAQ system for the implementation. We will implement the new system to the DAQ system by the spring 2014.

The Event Timing System of Injector Linac at KEK is upgraded to satisfy the new requirements for the SuperKEKB project. After finishing the design and feasibility studies*, we have constructed the new system at Main Trigger Station of Linac. The new functions are developed in this system to perform the injection control of positrons with the newly constructed damping ring. Besides, we integrate the capability to adjust the trigger timing just 20 ms before injection so that the injection RF-bucket of the ring can be decided at the last minute. Now, both the new system and the current working system are operational at Main Trigger Station. This is important for the smooth taking over of Event Timing System. Even during the construction period, Linac must be operated to provide beams into the two light source rings. In this situation, we can carry out enough tests with the actual condition. These tests do not disturb the regular operation and brush up the Event Timing System to enable the quick startup of the SuperKEKB operation. We report about the detailed configuration of the new system and its commissioning performed in the 2014 spring run period.

In August 2013, the Japanese ILC Site Evaluation Committee has recommended the Kitakami area in northern Japan as the technically preferred site for the International Linear Collider (ILC) in Japan. With this decision, the ILC planning has moved into a new stage where the Technical Design Report baseline design has to be adapted to the specific site, and refined in preparation for a possible construction project. Engineering data management provides the methods and supporting tools to create and maintain the design data throughout the entire life of the ILC project. The Management and integration of engineering data from the design teams around the globe that contribute to the ILC requires a carefully structured body of documentation, clearly defined processes including configuration control, and efficient vision sharing through 3D modelling.
