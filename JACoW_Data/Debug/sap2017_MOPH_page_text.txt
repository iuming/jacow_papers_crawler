A 100 MeV H− compact cyclotron (CYCIAE-100) has started operation from 2016 at China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The continuous proton beams of 75 MeV - 100 MeV has been extracted in dual opposite directions by charge exchange stripping devices. In order to analyze the extracted proton beam characteristics and control the beam loss for extracting 200 μA proton beam, the acceleration and stripping extraction process for the pulsed beam for CYCIAE-100 are simulated with the code of COMA in detail in this paper. The simulations are mainly done for the different RF acceptance or acceleration phase width. Due to the simulation results, the extraction turns are more for the large phase width and it will be reduced effectively with small phase width. The transverse beam distribution and the extracted beam profile are not affected by the initial phase width due to the simulation, that's the characters of the cyclotron with the stripping extraction mode.

Proton Therapy is a high accuracy cancer treatment way with little side effects and widely investigated in recent years. Introducing superconducting technologies, China Institute of Atomic Energy has designed a cyclotron to extract 230 MeV proton for cancer therapy. Extracted beam loss is one of the very crucial parameter in this machine. A low beam loss has benefit in reducing the dose level inside the cyclotron and preventing device damage, and consequently keeps the machine operate stable in long time. Two electrostatic deflectors are installed in the adjacent magnet hills to deflect the beam for extraction. The Vr=1 resonance and precession motion are introduced in extraction region to enlarge the turn separation. After the deflectors, passive magnetic channels provide radial focusing force to restrain the beam dispersion in the edge field. In this paper, the design process and simulation results will be introduced in detail. Also, the extraction element layout will be illustrated.

Along with the fast development of cyclotrons, more and more compact cyclotrons are used in the medical treatment and the scientific research. Because of the compact structure, the magnetic field in the extraction area is complex and there is no room for the focusing elements, the methods to control beam envelope in extraction area are needed. In this paper, the influence of envelope caused by the angle between the foil and the beam has been studied, the experiment on a 14 MeV compact cyclotron that construct in CIAE (China Institute of Atomic Energy) has been done, the result is well agrees with the theoretic design. For the small medical cyclotrons, this method can be used to adjust the beam spot on the liquid target which installs on the exit of the cyclotron.

CYCIAE-230 superconducting cyclotron, a medical accelerator for proton therapy, is designing and constructing at CIAE now. An internal PIG source was adopted to attain a compact and simple design. Central region electric and magnetic field design will directly affect the beam quality and reliability of the cyclotron in terms of phase selection, beam loss and beam stability. Moreover, a favourable central region will ensure single-turn extraction efficiency. The central region study was based on detailed orbit tracking results, including the beam behaviour in the push-pull RF mode and phase selection and axial focusing in the latest magnetic field and electrical field distribution from calculation. The physical design results of central region beam dynamics are presented here.

The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is a 6GeV ultra-low emittance light source proposed to be built in Beijing. It will utilise a full energy booster synchrotron operating at a frequency of 1Hz as its injector. For meeting the requirement of high charge when using swap-out mode, the booster need to have the ability of beam ac-cumulation. In this paper, a FODO lattice with 4 dispersion-free straight sections is presented.

PDR is a choice of CEPC design scheme, at any given time will contain a train of 50-70 bunches populate adjacent buckets and the remaining buckets unfilled. A consequence of an uneven filling scheme in the storage ring is that within train the synchronous phase will vary from bunch to bunch. This paper is to describe the tracking of the stability of longitudinal beam dynamic for CEPC, with the aim of including the main effects affecting the beam dynamics (i.e. the bunch-by-bunch feedback, the effect of the HOMs, the synchrotron radiation).

The off-axis injection scheme is also considered at HEPS. A large beta insertion section is need in the case, which breaks the symmetry of the machine. We introduce two designs of the injection section. There exist clear difference for the dynamic aperture between the two designs. The low-order nonlinear resonance driving terms is calculated and compared. The results show a correlation between momentum acceptance and the off-momentum driving terms. We enlarge the dynamic aperture by tuning the on-momentum and off-momentum non-linear driving terms with a multi-objective optimization code.

The effects of magnetic errors at CSNS/RCS are studied systematically, including the magnetic field tracking errors between different magnets, the field divergences between the magnets powered by the same power supply, and the fringe field effects. For RCS, because of the magnetic saturation and the eddy current effects, there may be magnetic field tracking errors between different magnets. A new method of harmonic compensation for magnets of RCS was investigated to reduce the magnetic field tracking errors at CSNS/RCS. For CSNS/RCS, 24 dipoles are powered by the same power supply, and 48 quadrupoles are powered by five power supplies. The field divergences between the magnets powered by the same power supply can induce beam closed orbit distortion (COD) and beta-beating. The sorting of magnets is performed at CSNS/RCS to reduce the COD and beta-beating induced by the field divergences. The magnetic field measurement results for the magnets of CSNS/RCS show that the fringe fields falloffs shape keeps varying during the exciting current rapid ramping. The fringe field effects of the rapid ramping magnet are studied systematically at CSNS/RCS.

The China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) plans to build XFEL light source. In the beam dynamics simulation there are many parameters to be considered, so we need a high efficient method to find the optimal pa-rameters. Genetic algorithm (GA) [1] is wildly used as one kind of evolutionary algorithm and it can help us to find the optimal parameters in a shorter time. In this paper, we will use genetic algorithm to do the beam dynamics sim-ulation of an L-band electron gun used for the XFEL. We put emphasis on the optimization of the transverse nor-malized projected emittance and the relevant result will be given and discussed.

Distributed X-ray sources, a single vacuum chamber containing multiple x-ray sources, open the way to innovative system concepts in x-ray and CT. This paper proposed a novel electron beam focusing scheme for distributed x-ray sources. The sources used dispenser cathode as electron emitter, mesh grid to control emission current, and two electrostatic lenses for beam shaping, focusing and deflecting or not. Because the mesh is a non-linear optical system, after beam passes the mesh, the beam emittance grows. In order to minimize this emittance growth, the first lens was placed behind the mesh. The second lens, called focusing lens, with two semi-ellipses opening make the beam shaping, deflecting or not. If the voltages of two semi-elliptical electrodes are different, the beam will deflect after passing through the focusing lens. The voltage difference between the two semi-elliptical focusing lens is set to +V, 0, -V. Then three focal spots will be obtained on the anode target. So that we can use fewer cathodes to get more sources, thereby reducing cost and the difficulty of thermal management, increasing the count of focal spots and improving the image quality.

In this paper, we propose a new lattice concept of multi-bend achromat (MBA) for designing a diffraction-limited storage ring, which is inspired by the hybrid MBA concept proposed by ESRF EBS and the locally symmetric MBA concept recently proposed by ourselves. In this new MBA concept, two pairs of dispersion bumps are created in each cell, which accommodate sextupoles to correct chromaticities. For each pair of dispersion bumps, from the point of view of two different representations of a cell, many nonlinear effects caused by itself are cancelled out within one cell. For the two pairs of dispersion bumps, from the nonlinear cancellation point of view, they are interleaved. Compared to the hybrid MBA where only one pair of dispersion bumps is created in each cell, this new MBA can provide more knobs so as to better control tune shift terms, which is especially beneficial for enlarging dynamic momentum aperture.

The Spectrometer Ring at High-Intensity Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility tuned in the isochronous ion-optical mode offers unique possibilities for measuring short-lived and very exotic nuclides. However, many factors limit the time resolution. One point is a limit in time resolution inversely proportional to the transverse emittance. At the same time, most of the time aberrations can be corrected and others become small for large number of turns. We show the relations of the time correction to the corresponding transverse focusing and that the main correction for large emittance corresponds directly to the chromaticity correction for transverse focusing of the beam. In these calculations the influence of magnet inhomogeneities and extended fringe fields are considered.

Intrabeam scattering is the main reason of degradation of the beam brightness and shortening of brightness lifetime in the collider, light source and storage ring. Electron cooling was chose to suppress the effect of intrabeam scattering, another unexpected effect happened during the cooling. The distribution of ion beam quickly deviates from the initial Gaussian type, form a denser core and long tail. The ions standing in the tail of beam will loss soon due to large amplitude. This solution will focus on the investigation on the suppression of intrabeam scattering in the high intensity heavy ion beam in the storage ring with the help of longitudinally modulated electron beam. The stronger cooling was expected in the tail of ion beam and the weaker cooling was performed in the tail of ion beam. The particle in the outside will experience stronger cooling and will be driven back into the centre of ion beam. The ion loss will be decreased and the lifetime will be increased. The intensity of ion beam in the storage ring will be kept and maintain for long time.

The HIAF is a new accelerator complex under design at IMP to provide intense primary and radioactive ion beams for nuclear physics, atomic physics, high energy density physics and other applications. As a key part of HIAF, the Booster Ring (BRing) is designed to accumulate and accelerate heavy ion beams provided by iLinac up to high intensity and energy. The high quality, well focused, strongly bunched intense Uranium beam (U34+) with high energy and high intensity of 1011 will open a new area for the HED physics research in laboratory. Based on the beam parameters of 238U34+ proposed by the BRing, the two critical issues of producing short bunch with high beam intensity are studied. One is efficiency of adiabatic capture which can be a necessary prerequisite to ensure the beam intensity, and the other one is bunch compression in longitudinal which is an effective way of producing short pulse duration bunch. In this article, the analytical calculations and tracking simulations are described, the capture efficiency and possible bunch length under the action of planning RF system are presented

A combination of electron cooling and RF system is an effective method to compress the beam bunch length in storage rings. A simulation code based on multi-particle tracking was developed to calculate the bunched ion beam cooling process, in which the electron cooling, IntraBeam Scattering (IBS), ion beam space charge field, transverse and synchrotron motion are considered. In the paper, the cooling process was simulated for C beam in HIRFL-CSRm, and the result was compared with experiments, according to which the dependence of the minimum bunch length on beam and machine parameters was studied in the paper.

China has payed comprehensive attention to the study of proton therapy in recent years. Radiation effects induced by beam losses in compact, high energy superconducting cyclotrons are being taken into crucial considerations. The proton beam is extracted out of HUST SCC250 superconducting cyclotron by electrostatic deflectors. The fierce impinging between proton beam and the deflector septum is the main cause of beam losses, which will bring about radiation effects leading to activations in devices and coil quenching. This paper presents the simulation result of radiation effects between beam and septum by utilizing Geant4 code based on Monte Carlo method. The energy deposition of beam losses is figured. Meanwhile, the yields and energy distributions of secondary particles are investigated. The result focused on radiation effects will provide us with valuable implications for the design of this superconducting cyclotron.

A S-band LINAC with the operating frequency of 2856MHz and beam current of 4 A was designed for flash X-ray radiography for hydrodynamic test. The optimization of the parameters of the LINAC was processed to achieve the minimum beam radius and the proper energy efficiency. For the purpose of reducing the beam orbits offset at the exit of LINAC, a slotted iris accelerating structure would be employed to suppress the transverse Higher Order Modes (HOMs) by cutting four radial slots in the iris to couple the HOMs to SiC loads. In this paper, we present the design of the LINAC and the results of beam dynamic analysis.

A standard bunching system is usually composed of a SW PB, a TW B and a standard accelerating structure. In the industrial area, the bunching system is usually simpli-fied by eliminating the PB and integrating the B and the standard accelerating structure together to form a β-varied accelerating structure. The bunching efficiency for this kind of simplified system is lower than that for the stand-ard one. The HB has been proved to be an innovative attempt to reduce the cost but preserve the beam quality as much as possible. Here, the HAS is proposed by inte-grating the PB, the B and the standard accelerating struc-ture together to exclusively simplify the standard bunch-ing system. Compared to the standard bunching system, the one with the HAS is more compact, and the cost is lowered to the largest extent without fairly degrading the beam performance. The proposed HAS can be widely applied in the industrial area.

In an electron linac, the composition of the bunching system is determined by the synthetical consideration of the beam performance and the construction cost. In the industrial area, the bunching system is usually simplified to reduce the construction cost by eliminating the PB and integrating the B and the standard accelerating structure to form the β-varied structure. The bunching performance for this kind of system is relatively worse than that for the standard one. To keep the beam performance of the standard bunching system and reduce the construction cost as much as possible, the HAS is proposed by integrating the PB, the B and the standard TW accelerating structure together. The HAS can be widely applied in the industrial area to enhance the beam performance of the industrial linac but not increase the cost. In this paper, the design studies on an S-band (2856 MHz) HAS is presented. The HAS studied here is composed of 2 SW cells, 40 TW cells and 2 coupler cells. The on-axis electric field amplitude distribution simulated by HFSS can fully meet the beam dynamics requirement.

A 1.3 GHz CW room temperature buncher is located between the DC gun and the superconducting accelerator modules in the PAPS project. A brief beam dynamic study of the buncher system will be presented in this paper. According to the beam dynamic study, the effective cavity voltage should be more than 120 kV. The designed cavity has a unload Q of 23000 and a shunt impedance of 5.3 MΩ. 3-D electromagnetic simulation codes CST MWS and HFSS are used to optimize the inner dimensions of the buncher cavity. The multi-physics analysis is carried out to determine the cooling scheme and the mechanical sizes of the metal body. The RF coupler design and HOM analysis will also be presented in this paper.

We propose a novel rotational symmetry 1.6 cell photocathode RF gun in this paper. A coaxial cell is concatenated to the first cell at the cathode end to form a new resonant cell. The multi-pole field of the perfect rotational symmetry structure has been discussed in detail using the CST Microwave Studio. The profile of the RF gun is optimized using the SUPERFISH code. The optimal results are that the mode separation is 15.1 MHz, the shunt impedance is 47.9 MΩ/m and the surface peak field is located at the photocathode center. A detailed study of beam dynamics is discussed to optimize the beam parameter using the ASTRA code. A plenty of results are analyzed to achieve a transverse normalized rms emittance of about 0.71 π mm mrad for 11 ps pulse with 1 nC charge in the presence of a solenoid magnetic field used for emittance compensation. Finally, considering the filling time, a coupling coefficient 2 of a side coupling slot is designed to couple the input power into the RF gun.

The CAEP THz-FEL facility is the first high average power THz radiation user facility in China. The superconducting accelerator including double 4-cell superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities is one of the most important components for this facility. The construction and horizontal test of the superconducting accelerator have been finished. At 2K state, the effective gradients of both cavities have reached our designed goal, 10 MV/m. This paper mainly presents the commissioning results of the superconducting accelerator. In the commissioning experiments, the kinetic energy of 5mA electron beams can be accelerated to 8 MeV successfully, with the energy spread less than 0.2%, much better than our design goal. Further beam loading experiments are in progress.

In the large aperture-to-length ratio quadrupoles, there will be long fringe field. When putting three of this type quadrupoles next to each other, the field will overlap and change the beam dynamics of "hard-edge" model of Triplet quadrupoles. By numeric integration, we find that the transfer matrix difference is quite significant at the first part of MEBT of CADS Injector II. By re-exploring the 'hard-edge' model, the traditional definition of quadrupole's effective length and effective gradient are found to be just rough approximations and not right in this condition. The finding explains the good prediction of beam dyanamics model of MEBT by emittance measurements with different current settings of the triplet quadrupoles, and may be also helpful in explaining some discrepancies in beam lines around the world

The Injector II for the C-ADS is designed to accelerate a proton beam to 10 MeV in continuous wave (CW) mode with beam current up to 10 mA, which is the demonstration of the key technologies for CiADS. The LEBT section physical length and dynamic lattice is calibrated recently, and the more receivable beam parameters has been reconstructed at the input of LEBT. AS the transport of high current beams at low energies is critical, for at kinetic energies of a few MeV, the beams are space charge dominated. This paper will introduce beam parameters reconstruction based on emittance measurement experiment and PIC code TraceWin to reconstruct with space charge considered.

Quarter-wave resonators (QWR) are being widely used in linac for acceleration of ions with low-velocity. Two effects of this kind of cavities are the beam steering effect and RF defocusing effect caused by geometric asymmetry. Measurement for these two effects has been conducted by BPM and wire in a QWR at IMP. The experimental result and simulation result matches well.

Orbit correction is one of the most fundamental process-es used for beam control in accelerators. The CADS is a CW machine and a few particle loss will cause serious damage to the machine. Therefore, the quality of the or-bit control is an essential component towards the effi-ciency in operation, flexibility in machine studies. This paper describes an orbit correction implementation using singular value decomposition(SVD) of the response ma-trix and the simulation of its application to the CIADS injector II. This effort was achieved by exploiting the capabilities of Python, which provided the hands-on modules to develop the GUI code easily. Also involved in this effort was the code TraceWin, which was used to construct the virtual machine by providing the parame-ters of the Linac optics. Several iterations of the orbit correction may be required in order to obtain a satisfac-tory control of the orbit, because the the response matrix changes with iteration in an attenuating mode. After ap-propriate removal the redundancy steerers, a promising result of the orbit control was achieved.

The design and low power RF measurement of the radio frequency quadruple (RFQ) for the front end of China Material Irradiation Facility (CMIF), which is an accelera-tor based neutron irradiation facility for fusion reactor material qualification, has been completed. The RFQ, which operated under CW mode, is specified to accelerate 10 mA deuteron beam from the energy of 20 keV/u to 1.5 MeV/u. To reduce the possibility of beam loss in supper conducting section, the output longitudinal emittance need be optimized. The idea of 'Kick-drift' is adopted in beam dynamic design. The challenge for CW RFQ is not only the beam dynamic design but also in the design of cavity structure and cooling of structure. With the experi-ence obtained in the design of the RFQ for CIADS injec-tor II, the structure design and cooling design have been finished. The results of low power RF measurement show the flatness and asymmetry are below 4% for each mod-ule.

China Initiative Accelerator Driven System (CiADS) project is a strategic plan to solve the nuclear waste problem and the resource problem for nuclear power plants in China. For CiADS driven linac, which has a long superconducting accelerator section, traditional ways to calibrate the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) are not always available. In order to calibrate the BPM offsets in cryomodule so as to adjust the beam orbit effectively and accurately, we have tried to scan the superconducting solenoid's current, read the BPM values, and fit the data to get BPM offsets.
