Recently, several ideas to upgrade mid-size existing light sources to low emittances have been proposed. In these machines it is more difficult to get down to 100pm level while simultaneously keeping the beam lines as they are. This talk reviews the various ideas to achieve this goal, and presents examples of ongoing projects.
