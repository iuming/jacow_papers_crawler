BEPCII is designed not only for synchrotron radiation light source but also a collider. Topup operation for the synchrotron radiation facility has been realized in 2015. In order to improve the integral luminosity during the data taking of high energy physics, BEPCII began the dedicated upgrade to realize topup operation for the collider from the beginning of 2017. The modification of hardware devices have been finished at the end of 2019. The commissioning of the topup injection in the collision operation of BEPCII will be introduced in detail in this paper.

FCC-ee Civil Engineering and Infrastructure Studies

The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is planning a Future Circular Collider (FCC), to be the successor of the current Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Significant civil engineering is required to accommodate the physics experiments and associated infrastructure. The 91.2 km, 5.5 m diameter tunnel will be situated in the Geneva region, straddling the Swiss-French border. Civil engineering studies are to incorporate the needs of both the FCC lepton collider (FCC-ee) and the FCC hadron collider (FCC-hh), as the tunnel will host both machines consecutively.

Methods and Experiences of Automated Tuning of Accelerators

Automated tuning, or beam-based optimization, is a general approach to improve accelerator performances. The approach is different from the other common approach of beam-based correction. The differences between these two approaches and the advantages of the optimization approach are discussed. Two online optimization methods, the robust conjugate direction search (RCDS) and the multi-generation Gaussian process optimizer (MG-GPO), are described. Experiences of apply the methods to storage ring nonlinear dynamics optimization at SPEAR3 and APS storage rings, as well as application to other machines, are presented.
