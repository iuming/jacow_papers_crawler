The paper describes the recent efforts in establishing a consistent basis for beam physics simulations and machine requirements, magnet design and manufacture, and magnetic measurements. Magnetic field measurements serve for the quality assurance of the magnet production, and for validating numerical field simulation (FEM) tools and magnet design techniques. In order to study the performance of the accelerator and to allocate a budget for magnet misalignment in the tunnel, the beam physicists require the field maps and multipole field errors of the magnet system, either from validated numerical models or from magnetic measurements. When dynamic effects in the magnet exceed the capability of numerical simulations, online field measurements are done for monitoring of the magnet behavior and thus providing direct feedback to the accelerator control room for adjusting the magnet current cycles, and to tune the high-frequency accelerator cavities. The paper describes the approaches and techniques in magnetic field measurements and numerical field computations, discusses their limitations and attempts to make them consistent with the requirements from beam physics and magnet design.

The fast and accurate ion-optical models of the large-aperture fragment separators are necessary in order to provide an effective operating during experiments. The challenge of the interface between the magnetic fields of the separator's large aperture elements and the ion-optical codes is in the representation of the field non-uniformities. In large aperture magnetic elements it's technically impossible to produce highly uniform fields due to magnetic properties of the yokes and production and transportation processes. Hence, the ion optical model should take the non-uniformities in account. Within this work the different approaches to describe the magnets of large separators will be compared; the study of the measurement errors propagating will be presented.

The behavior of orbits in charged-particle beam transport systems, including both linear and circular accelerators as well as final focus sections and spectrometers, can depend sensitively on nonlinear fringe-field and high-order-multipole effects in the various beam-line elements. Surface fitting algorithms provide a robust and reliable method for extracting this information accurately from 3-dimensional field data provided on a grid. Based on these realistic field models, Lie or other methods may be used to compute accurate design orbits and high-order symplectic maps about these orbits. We describe the implementation of a general method for treating magnetic elements with curved reference trajectories that is especially well-suited for extracting symplectic transfer maps for large-sagitta bending dipoles with fringe fields.
