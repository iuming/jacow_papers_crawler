The new ISOL facility SPIRAL2 is currently being built at GANIL, Caen France. The commissioning of the accelerator is in progress since 2015. SPIRAL2 will produce a large number of new radioactive ion beams (RIB) at high intensities. In 2019, the DESIR facility will receive beams from the upgraded SPIRAL1 facility of GANIL (stable beam and target fragmentation), from the S3 Low Energy Branch (fusion-evaporation and deep-inelastic reactions). In order to deliver the RIB to the experimental set-ups installed in the DESIR hall, 110 meters of beam line are studied since 2014. This paper will focus on the recent studies which have been done on these transfer lines: beam optics and errors calculations, quadrupoles, diagnostics and mechanical designs.

The GSI UNILAC has served as injector for all ion species since 40 years. Its 108 MHz Alvarez DTL providing acceleration from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u has suffered from material fatigue and has to be replaced by a new section. The design of the new post-stripper DTL is now under development in GSI. An optimized drift tube shape increases the shunt impedance and varying stem orientations mitigate parasitic rf-modes. This contribution is on the beam dynamics layout.

Research and development of CW applications is an important step in RFQ design. The RF potential should be limited by 1.3-1.5 of Kilpatrick criterion for the CW mode. A 2 MeV RFQ is under development for the compact CW research proton accelerator, as well as for planned driver linac* in Russia. The maximum beam current is fixed to10 mA; the operating frequency has been set to 162 MHz. The new RFQ linac design will be presented and beam dynamics simulation results will be discussed. Calculations of beam dynamics are provided using the codes BEAMDULAC (developed at MEPhI for linac design) and DYNAMION. A comparison of the software performance is presented.

China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is a high intensity accelerator based facility. Its accelerator consists of an H− injector and a proton Rapid Cycling Synchrotron. The injector includes the front end and linac. The RFQ accelerates the beam to 3MeV, and then the Drift Tube Linac (DTL) accelerates it to 80MeV[1]. An Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) matches RFQ and DTL, and the DTL consists of four tanks. Commissioning of the MEBT and the first DTL tank (DTL1) have been accomplished in the last run. Due to the difference of actual effective length and theoretical effective length of magnets in MEBT and DTL1, in order to compare its impact of beam transport, this paper takes a beam dynamics simulation on beam transport in MEBT and DTL1 with IMPACT-Z code[2]. Meanwhile, the transport of beam with different emittance in MEBT and DTL1 is studied because of the large emittance at RFQ exit. All the simulation includes magnet error and RF error.

A parallelized, time-dependent 3D particle simulation code is under developing to study the high-intensity beam dynamics in linear accelerators. The self-consistent space charge effect is taken into account with the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method. In this paper, the structure of program and the parallel strategy are demonstrated. Then, we show the results of code verification and benchmarking. It is proved that the solvers in P-TOPO code and parallel strategy are reliable and efficient. Finally, the beam dynamics simulation of C-ADS Injector-I at IHEP are launched with P-TOPO and other codes. The possible reasons for the differences between results given by separated codes are also proposed.

The RAON accelerator of Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) has been developed to accelerate various kinds of stable ion beams and rare isotope beams for a wide range of science experiments. In the RAON accelerator, the superconducting linac (SCL) will be installed for the acceleration of the beams and it is composed of tens of cryomodules which include superconducting radio frequency cavities. Between two cryomodules, there is a warm section and two quadrupoles are located in the warm section with a beam diagnostics box in between. Also, in this warm section, one horizontal corrector and one beam position monitor (BPM) are mounted inside of first quadrupole, and one vertical corrector is located inside of second quadrupole for the beam steering. With these correctors and BPMs, the beam steering studies are carried out as varying the number of correctors and BPMs in the SCL of the RAON accelerator and the results are presented.

The analytical approach is proposed to study the various achromatic structures. The method is based on the self-consistent time-dependent models, which allow to describe the dynamics of both continuous and bunched beam in external magnetic fields. The fully kinetic models are implemented in this approach. The kinetic distribution functions dependent on the motion integrals allow to obtain accurate Vlasov equation solutions as KV-model does it. The method allows to solve the envelope equation both analytically and by ODE system numerical integration, and to predict the beam phase portrait behavior in magnetic fields of the structure. The advantages of the method are the possibility of easy scaling and the wide physical generality, which is important for the multi-parameter problem of the high-intensity high-brightness beam formation. The results of the method application for the bending magnets and the quadrupoles are presented.

Funding: This project is now supported by the COST Action CA15139 "Combining forces for a novel European facility for neutrino-antineutrino symmetry-violation discovery" (EuroNuNet).
A new project for the production of a very intense neutrino beam has arisen to enable the discovery of a leptonic CP violation. This facility will use the world’s most intense pulsed spallation neutron source, the European Spallation Source (ESS) under construction in Lund. Its linac is expected to be fully operational at 5 MW power by 2023, using 2 GeV protons. In addition to the neutrinos, the ESSnuSB proposed facility will produce a copious number of muons at the same time. These muons could be used by a future Neutrino Factory to study a possible CP violation in the leptonic sector and neutrino cross-sections. They could also be used by a muon collider or a low energy nuSTORM. The layout of such a facility, consisting in the upgrade of the linac, the use of an accumulator ring, a target/horn system and a megaton Water Cherenkov neutrino detector, is presented. The physics potential is also described.

A new method for H− laser assistant charge exchange injection using femtosecond laser pulses is considered. The existing method uses a divergent laser beam that allows compensation of angular and momentum spread of the stripped beam. The femtosecond laser pulse has a similar property that can compensate the spread and yield efficient laser stripping. Results of simulations with realistic femtosecond laser and H− beam parameters are discussed. The proposed method may have some benefit for particular technical conditions compared with others.

In hadron accelerators, the characterization of the beam transverse halo can lead to a better understanding of the beam dynamics and ultimately to a reduction of the beam losses. Unfortunately the effect of losses on beam instrumentation implies a reduction of the instrument sensitivity due to the background noise. In this paper, we will discuss the effect of losses on the wire scanner scintillator foreseen for the ESS linac, in particular the different hypothesis for the input will be described and preliminary results will be presented.

Effects of Energy Deposition Models and Conductive Cooling on Wire Scanner Thermal Load, Analytical and Finite Element Analysis Approach

One of the main limitations of the wire scanner in high intensity linac is the inability of the wire to survive at high duty cycle. For the commissioning of such machines, duty cycle must be reduced to preserve interceptive devices. A good thermal model of the wire is needed to insure a safe operation of the wire scanner and set the limits of acceptable beam duty cycle. In this paper, we will discuss the influence of the energy deposition model and the efficiency of conductive cooling on the wire temperature, based on the ESS beam parameters.

Transverse emittance is one of the key measurements to be performed during the commissioning of the low energy sections of an hadron linac. The good knowledge of the beam transverse phase space allows a safe and efficient operation of the machines by using the results of the measurement for beam dynamic simulations. In this paper we will discuss the accuracy and the limits of the transverse emittance measurement performed with the slit-grid method based on the ESS beam parameters at the RFQ (beam energy equal to 3.62 MeV) and DTL tank 1 (beam energy equal to 21 MeV) output.

In the ESS linac, during commissioning and restart phase, wire scanner will be used intensively to characterize the transverse beam profiles. At low energy, the mode of detection is based on Secondary Emission (SE), while at energies above 200 MeV, the primary mode of detection will be the measurement of the hadronic shower created in the thin wire. In this paper we will present the design and the output signal estimation of the shower detector, based on inorganic crystal and silicon photodetector.

Abstract: We have developed a computer program interfaced with the ACNET environment for Fermilab accelerators to measure energy spread of the proton beam from the LINAC at an injection kinetic energy of 400 MeV. It uses a digitizing oscilloscope and provides the user the ability to configure scope settings for optimal data acquisition from a resistive wall monitor. When the program is launched, it secures complete control of the scope. Subsequently, a special “one-shot” timeline is generated to initiate the beam injection into the Booster. After the completion of the beam injection from the LINAC, a gap of about 40 ns is produced in the Booster beam using a set of kickers and line-charge distribution data is collected for next 200 μs. The program then analyzes the data to extract the gap width, beam revolution period and beam energy spread. We illustrate a case with an example. We also present results on beam energy spread as a function of beam intensity from a recent measurement.

The Fermiab Booster accelerates beam from 400 MeV to 8 GeV at 15 Hz. In the PIP (Proton Improvement Plan) era, it is required that Booster deliver 4.2·1012 protons per pulse to extraction. One of the obstacles for providing quality beam to the users is the longitudinal quadrupole oscillation that the beam suffers from right after transition. Although this oscillation is well taken care of with quadrupole dampers, it is important to understand the source of these oscillation in light of the PIP II requirements that require 6.5·1012 protons per pulse at extraction. This paper explores the results from computer simulations, machine studies and solutions to prevent the quadrupole oscillation after transition.

The Rapid Cycling Synchrotron plays an important role in the China Spallation Neutron Source. RCS accumulates and accelerates the proton beams from 80MeV to 1.6GeV for striking the target with the repetition rate of 25Hz. RCS demands low uncontrolled loss for hands on maintenance, and one needs a tight tolerance on magnet field accuracy. Magnet sorting can be done to minimize linear effects of beam dynamics. Using closed-orbit distortion (COD) and beta-beating independently as the merit function, and considering maintaining the symmetry of the lattice, a code based on traversal algorithm is developed to get the dipoles and quadrupoles sorting for CSNS/RCS. The comparison of beam distribution, collimation efficiency and beam loss are also investigated according to beam injection and beam accelerating.

An alternative beam loading based calibration method is investigated in this paper, which might become useful online/real time calibration method.
