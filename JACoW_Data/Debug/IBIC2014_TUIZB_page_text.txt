Radiation generated by high-energy particle beams is widely used for beam diagnostic purposes. Depending on the mechanism of radiation generation, the emitted wavelength range extends from the THz up to the X-ray region, thus allowing the measurement of beam profiles in the longitudinal and the transverse plane over a wide range. In this talk, basic considerations for radiation based profile measurements will be discussed with special emphasis on the mechanism of radiation generation and the impact on beam diagnostic measurements.
