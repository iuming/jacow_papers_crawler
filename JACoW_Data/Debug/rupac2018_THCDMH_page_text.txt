The paper concerns to the final parameters of the magnetic field distribution of the new H-minus isochronous cyclotron C-80 and results of 3D computer calculations and experimental measurements before the installation of the vacuum chamber into the cyclotron gap. The cyclotron C-80 with variably energy 40 - 80 MeV and current up to 100 mkA is planned to be used as for applied physics program - for production of medicine isotopes, for therapy of eye melanoma and surface forms of cancer, for radiation resistance tests of electronic components - as well as for fundamental research in nuclear physics, solid state physics and biology.

This report is a survey of lifetime tests with cold-cathode TPI-thyratrons or pseudospark switches (PSS) in kickers of various accelerators. Descriptions of design and electrical circuits of power kickers as well as test results of devices utilizing 75kV TDI- and TPI-thyratrons in NIKA installations (JINR) and accelerator U70 in Kurchatov's Institute - IPHE are presented.

NICA is the new accelerator collider complex under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. Operating pressure in the beam pipes of booster and collider is not more than 2×10-9 Pa. Operating temperature of the beam chambers 85% surfaces from 4.2K to 80K. These parts can not be baked. Maximum temperature of bake out is 80C. The beam pipes have high length and low conductance. The paper describes problems and paths of decision of achievement ultra-high vacuum in the beam pipes of the NICA complex. For this purpose, in collaboration with Vakuum Praha Company (Prague, Czech Republic), a test bench for the most effective pumping of the accelerator chamber of the superconducting fast cycling synchrotron has designed and built. The article provides the simulation results of vacuum distribution in superconducting accelerators with "warm" chamber parts at room temperature. The specialized programming code was developed for this purpose. The simulation has revealed a necessity of installation additional pumping equipment along the booster perimeter. To solve this problem, development of original design of titanium sublimation pump operating at cryogenic temperatures has started in collaboration with the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia).

The VEPP-5 injection complex serves to obtain high-intensity electron and positron bunches for injection into colliders of the Institute of Nuclear Physics SB RAS. The old RF System operated at 700 MHz - the 64-the harmonic of the revolution frequency. Due to the large beam length from LINAC up to 70% of the particles were lost during injection. Therefore, in 2015, the decision was made to install into the ring the new RF cavity operated at the first harmonic of the ring revolution frequency of 10.94 MHz. To reduce the geometric dimensions, ferrites were used in the cavity. The RF cavity was manufactured, an RF power amplifier and a new RF control system were prepared. After testing the RF system at the stand, in August 2017 the RF cavity was installed instead of the former 700 MHz cavity. The new RF system is now in operation since September 2017. The paper presents main features of the cavity design and fabrication. RF power amplifier and operation of the control system are described.
