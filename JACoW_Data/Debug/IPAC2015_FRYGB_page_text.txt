High Power Proton Beam Facilities: Operational Experience, Challenges, and the Future

High power proton accelerators are increasingly popular as drivers for secondary beams with a large variety of applications, such as neutron sources for materials science and neutrino factories for high energy physics. In the last few decades, average beam powers have increased substantially, giving rise to an array of challenges centered on providing high beam power and availability while maintaining low activation levels. This talk summarizes the current status of high power proton accelerators. It discusses recent operational experiences and lessons learned, and identifies the primary hardware and beam dynamics limitations. A brief review of planned next generation facilities and driving technologies is also presented.

Future Circular Colliders
 


 

Y.F. Wang
                       IHEP, Bejing, People's Republic of China

 


 

This talk should review plans for future circular colliders with 50-100 km circumference for an electron-positron Higgs factory and 50-100 TeV hadron collider, and describe progress of R&D and design efforts for such future colliders possibly located in China and/or at CERN.
