The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory has collected extensive data to study the ionization cooling of muons. Several million individual particle tracks have been recorded passing through a series of focusing magnets in a number of different configurations and a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride absorber. Measurement of the tracks upstream and downstream of the absorber has shown the expected effects of the 4D emittance reduction. Further studies are providing more and deeper insight.

Laser-driven plasma wakefield acceleration (LWFA) is considered as a potential technology for future colliders and light sources. To make the best use of a laser’s power, the laser is expected to maintain a stable propagation. A transverse instability is observed in our previous simulations when a long, intense CO2 laser propagates inside a plasma*. This unstable motion is accompanied by strong transverse diffraction of the laser power and results in the disruption of the ion channel typically used for radiation generation**. We investigated the hosing-like instability using the Particle-in-Cell code OSIRIS*** by modeling the laser portion where this instability is seeded and then evolves. In this proceeding, a criteria will be described that allows for the characterization of the temporal and spatial evolution of this instability.

Collinear beam-driven wakefield acceleration (WFA) relies on shaped driver beam to provide higher accelerating gradient at a smaller cost and physical footprint. This acceleration scheme is currently envisioned to accelerate electron beams capable of driving free-electron laser *. Start-to-end simulation of drive-bunch beam dynamics is crucial for the evaluation of the design of accelerators built upon WFA. We report the start-to-end longitudinal beam dynamics simulations of an accelerator beamline capable of producing high charge drive beam. The generated wakefield when it passes through a corrugated waveguide results in a transformer ratio of 5. This paper especially discusses the challenges and criteria associated with the generation of temporally-shaped driver beam, including the beam formation in the photoinjector, and the influence of energy chirp control on beam transport stability.

We present the results of the studies of the physics of high intensity proton seams at the 8 GeV Fermilab Booster RCS carried out in Spring 2019. The Booster studies span a variety of beam physics topics ’ The discovery of a new convective beam instability, an investigation of power-supply ripple in the Booster gradient dipoles, a characterization of space-charge induced emittance growth, optimization of adiabatic capture, a study of periodicity in the Booster, nonlinear chromaticity measurements, and transverse impedance measurements. The results will help prepare the Booster for the upcoming PIP-II intensity upgrades and inform next-generation RCS design.

Funding: This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation under grant 19-42-04133 in the part of CST simulations for THz structures.
Recently, gradients on the order of 1 GV/m level have been obtained in a form of single cycle (~1 ps) THz pulses produced by conversion of a high peak power laser radiation in nonlinear crystals (~1 mJ, 1 ps, up to 3% conversion efficiency). These pulses however are broadband (0.1-5 THz) and therefore a new accelerating structure type is required. For electron beam acceleration with such pulses we propose arrays of parabolic focusing micro-mirrors with common central. These novel structures could be produced by a femtosecond laser ablation system developed at Euclid Techlabs. This technology had already been tested for production of several millimeters long, multi-cell structure which has been testing with electron beam. We also propose using of structures where necessary GV/m E-fields are excited by a drive bunch travelling in the corrugated waveguide. The radiated by drive bunch sequence of short range delayed wakes are guided in this case by metallic disks and reflected back being focused exactly at time when the witness bunch arrives.

We present an alternative Mu2e-II production scheme for the Fermilab PIP-II era based on production schemes we devised for muon-collider and neutrino-factory front ends. Bright muon beams generated from sources designed for muon collider and neutrino factory facilities have been shown to generate two orders of magnitude more muons per proton than the current Mu2e production target and solenoid. In contrast to the current Mu2e, the muon collider design has forward-production of muons from the target. Forward production from 8 GeV protons would include high energy antiprotons, pions and muons, which would provide too much background for the Mu2e system. In contrast, the 800 MeV PIP-II beam does not have sufficient energy to produce antiprotons, and other secondaries will be at a low enough energy that they can be ranged out with an affordable shield of ~ 2 meters of concrete.

To mitigate 8 GeV beam losses at extraction in the Fermilab Booster synchrotron, a LASER notcher system for multi-turn injection that produces notches at 720 keV is used. These notches synchronize with the revolution period of the beam [ref. HB2018, page 416] at injection in the Booster. Recently, a dedicated notching pattern that keeps a single 201 MHz LINAC bunch untouched in the middle of a notch is developed to measure the beam energy spread by studying the time evolution of this bunch in the Booster. A complementary to this method, recently, it has been realized that one can also measure energy spread of the LINAC beam by injecting <2 Booster turn beam and studying the time evolution of the multiple 201 MHz LINAC bunches. In this paper we present the general principle of the method and results from our measurements.

Temporally shaped laser pulses are desirable in various applications including emittance reduction and beam-driven acceleration. Pulse shaping techniques enable flexible controls over the longitudinal distribution of electron bunches emitted from the photocathode. While direct manipulation and measurement of an ultrashort pulse can be challenging in the time domain, both actions can be performed in the frequency domain. In this paper, we report the study and development of laser shaper and diagnostics at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA). Simulations of the shaping process for several sought-after shapes are presented along with the temporal diagnosis. Status of the experiment at the AWA facility is also discussed.

The study of intense laser-plasma interactions is a growing field of both theoretical and applied research. This research focuses on simulating the cross/self-interactions between high-intense short laser pulses and an initial target for preliminary ionization. Unlike our previous studies of laser-matter interaction over preformed plasma, we will explore the injection of laser pulses to induce background plasma driven by the self-guided laser wakefield mechanism, which is used to perturb the plasma for induced dipole oscillations followed by radiation. Inducing a cylindrical spatial plasma column within the laser beam radius regime, it is expected that a stable spatially localized plasma channel will result and the emitted radiation from the plasma dipole oscillation (PDO) will not be affected by surrounding absorption, resulting in effective radiation. We will depict the injection of laser pulses accounting for parameters such as field intensity, profile and phase difference defining the coordinated pulses to assess the potential of enhancing the efficiency and spectral properties of the transverse emitted radiation due to the counter-propagating pulses interaction in plasma.

Systematic differences between the linear and nonlinear regimes of plasma wakefield acceleration from electron beams are manifested in the plasma response. Typically, the ratio of peak beam density to nominal plasma density determines operation in the linear or nonlinear regime. Previous reports have shown that a the cross-over into the nonlinear regime is associated with an increase in the wakefield amplitude, as well as sawtooth-like shape. In this paper, we present preliminary measurements of quasi-nonlinear wakefields driven by a linearly ramped beam, with a maximum charge close to the unperturbed plasma density. We also demonstrate nonlinear wakefield behavior in a probe bunch using a single shot, multi-period wakefield measurement and its dependency on plasma density.

This poster will report on the status of the new high gradient C-band accelerator project at LANL. Modern applications such as X-ray sources require accelerators with optimized cost of construction and operation, naturally calling for high-gradient acceleration. Our goal is to use a multi-disciplinary approach that includes accelerator design, molecular dynamics simulations, and advanced manufacturing to develop high gradient, high efficiency RF structures for both compact and facility-size accelerator systems. We considered common operation frequencies for accelerators and identified C-band as the optimal frequency band for high gradient operations based on achievable gradients and means to control wakefields. We are putting together a high gradient C-band test facility that includes a 50 MW Toshiba klystron and cryo-coolers for operating copper NCRF accelerator cavities at long pulse duration. We plan to conduct high gradient testing of the optimized RF structures made of copper and novel copper alloys. LANL modeling capabilities will be used to systematically study the formation of breakdown precursors at high fields to develop basic theoretical understanding of the breakdown.

Magnetized bunched-beam electron cooling is a critical part of the Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC). Strong cooling of ion beams will be accomplished inside a cooling solenoid where the ions co-propagate with an electron beam generated from a source immersed in magnetic field. This contribution describes the production and characterization of magnetized electron beam using a compact 300 kV DC high voltage photogun and bialkali-antimonide photocathodes. Beam magnetization was studied using a diagnostic beamline that includes viewer screens for measuring the shearing angle of the electron beamlet passing through a narrow upstream slit. Correlated beam emittance with magnetic field at the photocathode was measured for various laser spot sizes. Measurements of photocathode lifetime were carried out at different magnetized electron beam currents up to 28 mA and high bunch charge up to 0.7 nano-Coulomb was demonstrated.
