In February 2016, DOE organize a closed workshop to discuss possible roadmaps toward future high-energy linear colliders. Three accelerations techniques were discussed. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the outcome of this workshop.

Funding: We acknowledge the stimulating atmosphere and support of US Particle Accelerator School, class of June 2016, where this design study was performed.
We report here the results of a one week long investigation into the conceptual design of an X-ray source based on a compact ring with on-orbit and on-energy laser-plasma accelerator (mini-project 10.4 from [1]). We performed these studies during the June 2016 USPAS class "Physics of Accelerators, Lasers, and Plasma…" applying the art of inventiveness TRIZ. We describe three versions of the light source with the constraints of the electron beam with energy 1 GeV or 3 GeV and a magnetic lattice design being normal conducting (only for the 1 GeV beam) or superconducting (for either beam). The electron beam recirculates in the ring, to increase the effective photon flux. We describe the design choices, present relevant parameters, and describe insights into such machines.

Funding: Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Young Investigator Program, under contract no. FA9550-15-C-0031. Distribution Statement A. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.
We present the effects of beam loading and plasma kinetics on the length of the wake in a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator in the blowout regime. This allows us to estimate the limits to the average beam power available to a plasma wakefield accelerator.
