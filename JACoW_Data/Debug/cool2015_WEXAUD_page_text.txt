We review computational work on single-pass dynamics for relativistic hadrons in electron cooling systems relevant to high-luminosity electron-hadron colliders *. We identify parameter regimes where binary collisions must be correctly treated and where they can be neglected. The mathematically correct derivation of non-magnetized dynamical friction is presented, showing how the modified Pareto distribution of impact parameters can lead to incorrect interpretation of numerical results. We discuss important aspects of dynamical friction in magnetized electron cooling that require additional study.

The Low Energy electron Cooling (LEReC) project at Brookhaven employs an energy recovery linac to supply electrons in the 1.6 to 5 MeV range. Along with cooling the stored ion beam these bunches create a coherent space charge field which can cause emittance growth. This process is investigated both analytically and via simulation.

Circulator cooler ring (CCR) was proposed * as a scheme to alleviate the high demand for the average current of the cooling beam from the electron source. However, transporting the high-brightness cooling beam through CCR for multiple turns, while preserving the phase space quality of the beam, presents significant challenges for the CCR design **. In this presentation, we describe our studies on the microbunching instability (uBI) induced by the CSR and longitudinal space charge interactions, and present results of microwave physics for a non-magnetized beam circulating in an early design of CCR *** of MEIC. It is envisioned that CCR designed for a magnetized beam will have much reduced microbunching effects. A future plan for such study will be discussed.

Electron Cooling at GSI and FAIR – Status and  Latest Activities

The status, function and operation parameters of the existing and future electron coolers at GSI and FAIR are presented. We report on the progress of the ongoing recommissioning of the former CRYRING storage ring with its electron cooler at GSI. First systematic results on the cooling of a 400 MeV proton beam during the last ESR beamtime are discussed. Motivated by the demands of the experiments on high stability, precise monitoring and even absolute determination of the velocity of the electrons i.e. the velocity of the electron- cooled ion beams, high precision measurements on the electron cooler voltage at the ESR were carried out towards the refurbishment of the main high-voltage supply of the cooler. Similar concepts are underway for the CRYRING cooler high-voltage system.
