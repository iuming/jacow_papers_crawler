Linac4 is a normal conducting, 160 MeV H− ion accelerator that is being constructed within the scope of the LHC injectors upgrade project. Linac4 will be connected to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) during the next long LHC shut-down and it will replace the current 50 MeV hadron linac, Linac2. Linac4 is presently being commissioned, with the aim of achieving the final energy at the end of the year. A test of the injection chicane and a reliability run will follow. The beam commissioning, in steps of increasing energy, has been prepared by an extended series of studies and interlaced with phases of installation. In this paper we will detail the beam dynamics challenges and we will report on the commissioning results.

The European Spallation Source, ESS, is a facility for research using neutron beams that is being built in Lund. It will be the world’s most powerful such facility when it comes into full operation in the next decade. Neutrons will be released from a rotating tungsten target when it is hit by 2 GeV protons provided by a superconducting linac at an unprecedented 5 MW of average beam power, serving 22 neutron instruments covering a wide range of fundamental and applied sciences. An overview of the project will be given, with emphasis on technology. Current status, plans and challenges will be reviewed.

MOAM4P40
A Fifteen Year Perspective on the Design and Performance of the SNS Accelerator

Commissioning of the Spallation Neutron Source accelerator began approximately fifteen years ago. Since this time, the accelerator has broken new technological ground with the operation of the world’s first superconducting H− linac, the first liquid mercury target, and 1.4 MW of beam power. This talk will reflect on the issues and concerns that drove key decisions during the design phase, and will consider those decisions in the context of the actual performance of the accelerator. Noteworthy successes will be highlighted and lessons-learned will be discussed. Finally, a look forward toward the challenges associated with a higher power future at SNS will be presented.
