Coherent radiation is a powerful scheme for storage-ring-based synchrotron radiation sources as its intensity increases with the square of the number of radiating electrons. Formation of bunches or sub-bunches shorter than the radiation wavelength, i.e., microbunching, is necessary for the radiation from different electrons to add in phase and therefore cohere. Recently at the MLS it has been shown that in dedicated isochronous optics an electron beam energy modulation induced by an externally applied 1064-nm-wavelength laser in an undulator leads to the formation of sub-um microbunches one turn later*, providing the basis for the implementation of steady-state microbunching in electron storage rings to generate high-repetition, high-power coherent radiation. Here we report on the recent progress and continuing development of this experiment.

The IOTA ring at Fermilab is a unique machine exclusively dedicated to accelerator beam physics R&D. The research conducted at IOTA includes topics such as nonlinear integrable optics, suppression of coherent beam instabilities, optical stochastic cooling and quantum science experiments. In this talk we report on the first results of experiments with implementations of nonlinear integrable beam optics. The first of its kind practical realization of a two-dimensional integrable system in a strongly-focusing storage ring was demonstrated allowing among other things for stable beam circulation near or at the integer resonance. Also presented will be the highlights of the world’s first demonstration of optical stochastic beam cooling and other selected results of IOTA’s broad experimental program.

We will present an overview of recent advances in high gradient copper structures operating at room temperature and at cryogenic temperature. We will include the advances that enabled us to understand better the underlying fundamental physics that govern the breakdown phenomena in high field vacuum structures. We will then present the recent advances in linac topologies that take advantage of this basic understanding of the breakdown phenomena. We will also showcase how these advances are being utilized for many different medical, industrial, and discovery machines. Our presentation will not be limited to electron accelerators but will also include advances for high gradient hadron linacs.
