The High Energy Storage Ring (HESR), within the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), will provide proton and anti-proton beams for PANDA (Proton Antiproton Annihilation at Darmstadt) and heavy ion beams for SPARC (Stored Particles Atomic Physics Research Collaboration). With the beam instrumentation devices envisaged in larger quantities, e.g. BPM and BLM being in production, other BI instruments like Viewer, Scraper, or Ionization Beam Profile Monitor are in the mechanical design phase. An overview of the status is presented.

The SuperKEKB damping ring (DR) commissioning started in February 2018, before main ring (MR) Phase-II operation. We constructed the DR in order to deliver a low-emittance positron beam. The design luminosity of SuperKEKB is 40 times that of KEKB with high current and low emittance. A turn-by- turn beam position monitor (BPM), transverse feedback system, synchrotron radiation monitor (SRM), DCCT, loss monitor using ion chambers, bunch current monitor and tune meter were installed for beam diagnostics at the DR. An overview of the instrumentation and status will be presented.

SEE testing of candidate electronic components for space applications is essential part of a spacecraft radiation hardness assurance process in terms of its operability in the harsh space radiation environment. The unique in Russia SEE test facilities have been created to provide SEE testing. The existing ion beam monitoring system has been presented at IBIC 2017, however, it has a number of shortcomings related to the lack of reliable online ion fluence measurement on the DUT, and inability to measure energies of the high-energy (15-60 MeV/nucleon) long-range (10-2000 µm) ions on the DUT. The paper presents the latest developments and their test results of the ISDE and JINR collaboration in the field of flux online monitoring (including, on the DUT) during tests using scintillation detectors based on flexible optical fibers, and measuring ion energies by the method of total absorption in the volume of scintillation or semiconductor detector. The modernization of the standard beam monitoring procedure during tests is proposed.

The Coherent Electron Cooling (CeC) Proof-of-Principle experiment [1], installed in the RHIC tunnel at BNL, has completed its second run. In this experiment, an FEL is used to amplify patterns imprinted on the cooling electron beam by the RHIC ion bunches and then the imprinted pattern is fed back to the ions to achieve cooling of the ion beam. Diagnostics for the CeC experiment have been fully commissioned during this year’s run. An overview of the beam instrumentation is presented, this includes devices for measurements of beam current, position, profile, bunch charge, emittance, as well as gun photocathode imaging and FEL infra-red light emission diagnostics. Design details are discussed and beam measurement results are presented.

In the end of linac temporary line in csns, we need a faraday cage to absorb the beam. in the beam experiment it will be mounted and used twice. according to the beam energy and current of csns, we choose water-cooled pipe structure with tilted panel after simulation. the main principle of the faraday cage design is to simplify the structure and reduce the radiation activation of it, to do this, we also do the simulation of radiation. to make sure the faraday cage is safe in beam experiment, we alos plug in a pt100 Platinum resistance to monitor the temperature. after faraday cage is built and mounted on the line, it works well and sustain the beam bombardment.

LumiBelle2 is a fast luminosity monitoring system prepared for SuperKEKB. It uses sCVD diamond detectors placed in both the electron and positron rings to measure the Bhabha scattering process at vanishing scattering angle. Two types of online luminosity signals are provided, a Train-Integrated-Luminosity at 1 kHz as input to the dithering feedback system used to maintain optimum overlap between the colliding beams in horizontal plane, and Bunch-Integrated-Luminosities at about 1 Hz to check for variations along the bunch trains. Individual beam sizes and offsets can also be determined from collision scanning. This paper will describe the design of LumiBelle2 and report on its performance during the Phase-2 commissioning of SuperKEKB.

The Laser-driven Compton light source is under development in ILP SB RAS in collaboration with BINP SB RAS. Electron spectrometer for measurement of LWFA electron beam with energy in the range 10-150 MeV and bunch charge 1-10 pC is presented. Spectrometer based on permanent magnet and luminous screen with CCD registrar and this geometry was optimized for best measurements resolution in compromise with size limitations. Preliminary collimation of electron beam allows achieving energy resolution up to 5-10 % of top limit. System has been tested at the VEPP-5 linear electron accelerator and obtained results correspond to design objectives. Sensitivity of beam transverse charge density was experimentally fixed at 0.03 pC/mm2, it is practically sufficient for our LWFA experiments.

Laser wakefield acceleration experiments make extensive use of small permanent magnets or magnet assemblies for analyzing and focusing electron beams produced in plasma accelerators. This choice is motivated by the ease of operation inside vacuum chambers, absence of power-supplies and feedthroughs, and potentially lower cost. Indeed, in these experiments space is at premium, and compactness is frequently required. At the same time, these magnets have to have a large angular acceptance for the divergent laser and electron beams which imposes constraint of the gap size. We will present the optimized design and characterization of a 100 mm long, 2.1 Tesla permanent magnet dipole. Furthermore, we will present the implementation of this magnet in a spectrometer that will measure the energy spectrum of electrons of [60-2000] MeV with a few percent resolution in the CILEX/APOLLON 10PW laser facility in France.

The momentum compaction factor of a storage ring can be obtained by measuring how the beam energy changes with the RF frequency. Direct measurement of the beam energy can be difficult, long or even not possible with acceptable accuracy and precision in some machines such as ESRF. Since the energy spectrum of the Synchrotron Radiation (SR) depends on the beam energy, it is indeed possible to relate the variation of the beam energy with a variation of the produced SR flux. In this proceeding, we will present how we obtain a measurement of the momentum compaction using this dependence.
