The mega-science facilities based on large scale accelerators are a distinctive feature of modernity. Today Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is a flagman Russian mega-science project under implementation. As well several other projects of scientific facilities such as Dubna Electron-Radioactive Ion Collider fAcility (DERICA), 4th generation Dubna neutron source "Neptun" and Based on ECR and Linear Accelerator multidisciplinary facility (BELA) are under discussion. The ion linear accelerators required for these projects have different parameters - some of them are operated in cw mode another in pulses one, some has intensity of microamperes another tens of milliamperes, some of them accelerates proton beam only meanwhile another one accelerates ions up to uranium. Anyway the general structure of them (ion source, RFQ, normal conducting DTL and superconducting cavities) and approaches of the ion accelerator development are similar. The current status and main problems of the ion accelerator development for the projects are presented and discussed.

In the frame of the NICA ion collider upgrade a new light ion frontend linac (LILac) for protons and ions with a mass to charge ration of up to 3 will be built. LILac will consist out of 3 parts: 1. a normal conducting Linac up to 7 AMeV, 2. a normal conducting proton energy upgrade up to 13 AMeV, 3. a superconducting section. The normal conducting Linac up to 7 AMeV will be built in collaboration between JINR and Bevatech GmbH. The technical design of LILac up to 7 AMeV is discussed in this paper.

At present, several accelerator projects are being developed in Russia, including ion linacs, such as NICA, DERICA, NEPTUN, BELA, etc. It is assumed that linacs will consist of two parts: normal conducting (NC) and superconducting (SC) linacs. The NC linacs are discussed in this article. Such linacs can differ each other significantly by mode of operation (pulsed or continuous), mass to charge ratio (1 - A/Z - 6.5), current magnitude (from 0.1 mA to 50 mA), etc. Anyway the layouts of these linacs have much in common. Different layouts of NC linacs are considered and the dynamics of particles in them for various projects is described. The requirements for the construction of NC linacs are substantiated, as well as the choice of the main parameters of the accelerating sections: operating frequency, maximum field strength, channel acceptance, focusing period structure, transition energy between accelerating sections, synchronous phase values, etc. The main design parameters of accelerating structures and their electrodynamic characteristics are given. The problems of technical realization for such linacs are discussed.

The paper presents the status CW resonance electron accelerator development at RFNC-VNIIEF. The output electron energy range is from 1.5 MeV to 7.5 MeV. The electron beam average power is up to 300 kW. Acceleration process is based on electron beam recirculation in single accelerating cavity. The accelerator is designed to operate in continuous and pulse-periodic modes. The paper presents technical characteristics of basic accelerator assemblies: RF power supply system (540 kW), RF electron injector (100 keV, 40 mA), accelerating structure (half-wave coaxial cavity), focusing magnetic system. Testing results of each accelerator component are given. Electron acceleration scheme is displayed. Pilot beam experiments were fulfilled at low RF power level (up to 180 kW). As the result of experiments electron beam with the energy of 1.5 MeV and 3 MeV and average current up to 100 mkA was obtained. The output beam characteristics prove physical principles of designed accelerator operation.

A resonance electron accelerator was designed at RFNC-VNIIEF to generate electron beam with energy range from 1.5 MeV to 7.5 MeV and average beam power up to 300 kW. The accelerating structure is a half-wave coaxial cavity (operating mode - T1, frequency 100 MHz). The paper presents the calculation results of RF system electrodynamic characteristics for considered accelerator. Selection of the accelerating cavity optimal geometry is based on theoretical justifications which is given in this paper. Operating parameters of the RF power supply system and its constructions principles are presented. The method of electron beam dynamics calculation is described. Ability of producing electron beam with required energy was successfully confirmed. Registration of electron beam make it possible to compare experimental and calculated electron beam parameters. The conclusions are made basing on the results of comparison between the obtained calculated and experimental parameters of the generated electron beam.

The new accelerator complex Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is under development and construction at JINR, Dubna now. This complex is assumed to operate using two injectors: the Alvarez type linac LU-20 as injector of light ions, polarized protons and deuterons and a new linac HILAc - injector of heavy ions beams. The modernization of Alvarez-type linac began in 2016 by commissioning of new RFQ foreinjector, and in 2017 the new buncher in front of linac has been installed. The first Nuclotron run with new buncher was performed in January 2018 with beams of Xe+, Ar+ and Kr+. The beam produced by KRION-6T ion source were successfully injected and accelerated in the Nuclotron ring during the last run #55. Main results of the last Nuclotron run and plans for future development of NICA injection complex are presented in this paper.
