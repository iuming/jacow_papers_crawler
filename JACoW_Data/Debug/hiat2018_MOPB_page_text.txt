The Facility of Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) superconducting magnets are used to focus and steer the heavy ion beams of the FRIB driver linac. All the magnets are designed as a solenoid with bucking coils to suppress the stray field and have superconducting dipole correctors to steer both horizontal and vertical field. Two types of magnets are manufactured in China and some of them have been tested at Institute of Modern Physic(IMP). This paper describes the measurement facilities and magnetic axis measurement method. We also present a summary of the measurement process and test results of the magnetic performance for the magnets.

IMP is presently developing a 10MeV Superconducting Cyclotron for the nuclear pore membrane production and research purpose. The RF system comprises two separated resonators driven by independent amplifiers to allow for the phase and amplitude modulation technique to be applied for beam intensity modulation. The cyclotron works on 4th harmonic with Dee’s voltage 80kV frequency 37MHz. According to the physical requirements of the superconducting cyclotron, the cavity is designed to be vertical 1/2 wavelength line structure, the geometry structure of DEE is optimized repeatedly for the ideal voltage distribution .In order to compensation frequency drift caused by the thermal and mechanical deformation, the fine-tuning loop has been designed to meet the dynamically tuned requirements

【Abstract】-Kicker power Supply is one of the key components in the injection and extraction system of HIAF (High Intensity Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility, the 12th five-year national big science project). The PFN-Marx generator technology based on solid-state switch IGBT will be applied to HIAF-Kicker power supply. Hundreds of fast pulse signals are required for these IGBTs’ control. The PFN-Marx generator has many requirements for their control signals, such as adjustable pulse-widths and time-delay. The maximum value of adjustment accuracy of the pulse-widths and delay among multiple control signals need to be 10ns. In this paper, a fast pulse generator circuit with adjustable pulse-widths and time-delay is designed for HIAF-Kicker power supply. This design is based on an emerging ARM-embedded FPGA. And the test results shown that the design can meet the required performance.

A Low Energy intense-highly-charged ion Accelerator Facility (LEAF), which is mainly consist of an 45 GHz superconducting ECR ion source, LEBT and an 81.25 MHz 4-vane RFQ, was designed to produce and accelerate heavy ions, from helium to uranium with A/Q between 2 and 7, to the energy of 0.5 MeV/u. The typical beam intensity is designed up to 2 emA CW for the uranium beam. The project was launched in 2015 and has been successfully commissioned with He+ (A/Q=4), N2+ (A/Q=7) beam and accelerated the beams in the CW regime to the designed energy of 0.5 MeV/u. Beam commissioning results of He+ beam have been reported previously. This paper presents the details of N2+ commissioning and beam studies.

A prototype 81.25 MHz dual-beam drift tube linac (DB-DTL) is being designed to proof the feasibility of multi-beam type linac. The beam dynamics design and electromagnetic calculation have been completed [1]. The following step is the multi-physics analysis of the DB-DTL. The three-dimensional multi-physics analysis is very important for the design of the DB-DTL. The RF dissipated power will make the cavity temperature rise and cause cavity resonance frequency shifting due to the deformation of cavity structure. The distributions of cavity deformation and stress are calculated according to the cavity temperature distribution. All the simulation results, including cavity temperature rise, deformation and stress and the frequency shifting resulted in cavity deformation, should be within an acceptable range. The designing goal is to design the DB-DTL operated in pulse model with 1/1000 duty factor. The detailed three-dimensional multi-physics analysis of the prototype DB-TL will be presented in this paper.

An all permanent magnet Electron Cyclotron Reso-nance ion source-LAPECR1U (Lanzhou All Permanent magnet ECR ion source no.1 Upgraded), has been built at IMP in 2017 to satisfy the requirements of LEAF (Low Energy intense-highly-charged ion Accelerator Facility) for first two years commissioning. LAPECR1U was designed to be operated at 14.5 GHz to produce intense low and medium charge state ion beams. LAPECR1U features a compact structure, small size, and low cost. A cone-shape iron yoke in injection side and an iron plasma electrode in extraction side were used to enhance the axial magnetic field strength. The typical parameters and the preliminary beam results of the source are given in this paper.

The ion beams extracted from an Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source always exist strong transverse coupling effect that is caused by the field of the axis mirror magnets and the extraction solenoid. A Pepper Pot probe was developed and used to obtain the full four-dimensional phase space distribution of the low energy beam extracted from the ECR ion source at IMP. This paper describes the design of the Pepper Pot, the setup configuration, the detailed image processing procedure, especially the analysis results verification compared to another type emittance meter. The first four-dimensional emittance is also determined through the Pepper Pot probe. The transverse phase space distribution measurement data of oxygen beams from the LECR4 experimental platform are presented and discussed.

As the Booster Ring of the High Intensity Heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF), BRing is a synchrotron which can be able to accumulate and accelerate full ion species provided by iLinac to required energy with RF acceleration system. When accelerating uranium beam(e.g. 238U35+), the variation range of the kinetic energy is 17MeV/u-830 MeV/u, and the corresponding revolution frequency range is 0.099MHz-0.447MHz. Because of the low frequency limit value of 0.099MHz, the RF frequency of RF cavity should be h(harmonic number) times of ,thus, there will have h(is equal to harmonic number) bunches after acceleration. To satisfy the extraction requirement, the accelerated multiple bunches should be recollected in one bunch by means of longitudinal manipulation. The different single bunch generation method of debunching and bunch merging are investigated separately, and the beam parameters in different cases are obtained, meanwhile, the optimized RF program during the debunching and bunch merging are presented.
