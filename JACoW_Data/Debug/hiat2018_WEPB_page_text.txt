The new injector SSC-LINAC is under design and con-struction to improve the efficiency and intensity of beams for the Separated-Sector Cyclotron (SSC). This will be accomplished with a normal conducting radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator. To match with the SSC, the RFQ must be operated on Continuous Wave (CW) mode with a frequency of 53.667 MHz. A four-rod structure was adopted for small dimensions of the cavity. While, it was a huge challenge on CW mode. A multi-physics theoretical analysis, including RF, thermal, struc-tural and frequency shift coupling analysis, have been completed in response to the security and stable opera-tion of the RFQ. The experimental measurement of fre-quency shift was also completed, which is consistent with the simulation. In this paper, the results of theoretical analysis and experiment are reported in detail.

A compact proton linac injector is being studied, HSC (Hybrid single cavity), for cancer therapy. The HSC consists of RFQ section and DTL section. Both sections are interdigital-H (IH) mode linac. The HSC with an operation frequency of 100 MHz accelerate C6+ beams from 20keV/u up to 4 MeV/u. The total length of HSC is less than 4 meters. For this purpose, we use the RFGen to design RFQ section, and PIMLOC is provided for DTL section and whole HSC.

CIADS is considering to use quarter wave resonators (QWRs), made by niobium thin film sputtered on copper bases, at its low energy section. Comparing with bulk niobium cavities, the Nb/Cu cavities feature a much better thermal and mechanical stability at 4.5 K. A 325 MHz QWR cavity has been fabricated at IMP, to demostrate the niobium coated copper cavity technique can meet the requirements of CIADS. The cavity is coated with biased DC diode sputtering technique. This paper covers resulting film characters, vertical tests with the evolution of the sputtering process, and improvements to mitigate issues we meet.

An accelerator complex for Space Environment Simu-lation and Research Infrastructure (SESRI) has been designed by Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) and will be constructed in Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). This accelerator consists of an ECR ion source, a linac injector, a synchrotron and 3 research terminals. As an important part of the complex, the linac injector should provide both proton and different kinds of heavy ions, from helium to bismuth, with energy of 5 MeV and 1 MeV/u respectively for the synchrotron. In order to provide beams with the mass to charge ratio (A/Q) range from 1 ’ 6.5(for proton to 209Bi32+) by only one linac injector, a special solution of the main acceleration section DTL is carried out. The relevant dynamics calculations, such as beam matching, stripping process of the hydrogen molecule ion and beam energy spread reducing, are performed by Particle in Cell (PIC) method.

A 162.5 MHz, 7.2 MeV 4-rod radio frequency quadru-ples (RFQ) dynamics design has been finished for injec-tor of a carbon ion cancer therapy facility which is pro-moted by the Institution of Modern Physics (IMP) of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). A detailed error analysis was performed after the optimization process. Field flatness error is analysed for determining a RF optimization target. The RF structure is designed based on a new type dynamics design. Electric field of the RF structure is optimized in order to supporting the dynam-ics design. The error analysis and detailed field flatness optimization of this compact RFQ have been presented and discussed in this paper.

A new cavity structure of RFQ accelerator with bent vanes is proposed to meet the miniaturization requirement of low frequency accelerators. The new structure has a downsized cross section by bending vanes while keeping a certain vane lengths. It also possesses the advantages of simple cooling structure in low frequency field. The new structure has obvious advantages in reducing manufacturing difficulty of cavity, cutting down project cost, enhancing facility reliability and stability.

Heavy Ion Medical Machine in Wuwei (HIMM-ww) is the first Chinese heavy ion accelerator facility de-veloped for cancer therapy. After commissioning, the particle number after acceleration reached 1.5·109 ppp (particles per pulse), while injection exceeded 3·109 ppp. The slow extraction efficiency reached nearly 90% for all energies from 120 to 400 MeV/u. The spill duty factor exceeded 90% at a sample rate of 10 kHz. This paper reports the results of the synchrotron commis-sioning.
