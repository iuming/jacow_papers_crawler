We present an update on the lattice design and beam dynamics study of the ion collider ring of JLEIC (Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider). The collider ring consists of two 261.7 degree arcs connected by two straight sections crossing each other. One of the straights houses an interaction region (IR) and is shaped to make a 50 mrad crossing angle with the electron beam at the interaction point (IP) to meet physics requirements. The forward acceptance requirements downstream of the IP in the ion direction lead to an asymmetric IR lattice design. The detector solenoid effects and the multipole fields of the IR magnets further complicate this picture. In this paper, compensation of the detector solenoid effects is considered together with orbit correction and multipole effects. We also study local compensation of the magnet multipoles using dedicated multipole correctors. And an optimization of the betatron tunes is also presented.

JLEIC is the future electron ion collider under design at Jefferson Lab, which will provide a luminosity up to 1034 cm-2s-1. Electron cooling is essential for JLEIC to overcome the intrabeam scattering effect, reduce the ion beam emittance and thus achieve the high luminosity. The cooling time is approximately in proportion to the square of the energy and the 6D emittance. To avoid the difficulty of cooling the ion beam with large emittance at high energy, a multi-stage cooing scheme was designed for JLEIC. The ion beam was cooled at the low energy to reduce the emittance. Then it was ramped up to the collision energy. During the collision, electron cooling is implemented to maintain the emittance and the luminosity. Simulations for proton beam and lead ion beam at various stages are presented in this paper.

The spin response function is determined by a collid-er's magnetic lattice and allows one to account for con-tributions of perturbing fields to spin resonance strengths. The depolarizing effect of an incoming beam depends significantly on the response function value at the interaction point (IP). We present an analytic calcula-tion of the response function for protons and deuterons at the IP of Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC) over its whole momentum range. We find a good agreement of the analytic calculation with our numerical modeling results obtained using a spin tracking code, Zgoubi.

We present results of dynamic aperture study for the updated electron ring lattice of the Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC). The lattice design features low emittance arcs with local compensation of sextupole non-linear effects, and low emittance non-linear chromaticity correction sections. Dynamic aperture tracking simulations are performed to evaluate the effects of non-linear field errors, the sensitivity to betatron tune, and the impact of momentum error. Dynamic aperture is also evaluated with the measured PEP-II field errors. Preliminary tolerances to the non-linear field errors in the Final Focus quadrupoles are estimated.

The LHC machine is envisioned to operate eventually at an ultimate beam energy of 7.5 TeV at the end of LHC Run 4, i.e. after commissioning of the HL-LHC systems, a stage falling into the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era. In this paper we review the latest baseline parameters and performance, and study the potential reach of the HL-LHC with pushed optics at the ultimate beam energy. Results in terms of integrated luminosity and effective pile-up density of both the nominal (5.0×1034 cm-2 s−1) and ultimate (7.5×1034 cm-2 s−1) levelling operations are discussed

The beam delivery system (BDS) for the 3 TeV version of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) has two main design types. One type is referred to as the local scheme, as it is approximately one kilometer shorter and corrects the chromaticity in both planes. The other type is referred to as the traditional scheme, and separates the chromaticity correction of each plane into different areas. The expectation early in the studies was that the traditional scheme would be easier to tune. This work will address the problems experienced in tuning simulations for the traditional BDS and describe the current state of these simulations.

The irradiation effects of cluster ion beams are characterized by the high-density collision of molecules that comprise the clusters against a target. According to molecular dynamics calculations, the local temperature of the colliding cluster and the surface of the target are expected to increase to several thousand K. The enhancement of the chemical interactions between the molecules in the colliding clusters and the atoms on the target surface is expected, if polyatomic molecules, such as ethanol and acetone, are used for the source material of the cluster. So, the irradiation effects of the polyatomic liquid cluster ion beams on transition metal films have been studied to examine the possibility of utilizing the liquid cluster ion beam technique for the processing of transition metal films. The transition metal films were formed by magnetron sputtering. The liquid clusters were produced by the adiabatic expansion method and ionized by electron ionization. The sputtering yields of transition metal films induced by liquid cluster ions are discussed.

Special LHC high-beta optics is required for the forward physics program of TOTEM and ATLAS-ALFA. In this configuration, the beam is de-squeezed (the \beta-function at the collision point is increased) in order to minimize the divergence for measurements at very small scattering angles. In these low beam intensity runs, it is important to place the Roman Pots (RPs) as close as possible to the beam, which demands special collimator settings. During Run I, a significant amount of background was observed in the forward detectors due to particles outscattered from the primary collimator. During Run II, a different collimation configuration was used where a tungsten collimator was used as primary collimator instead of the usual one made of carbon. Using this configuration, a significant reduction of the background at the RPs was observed. In this paper we present a description of the new collimator configuration and the results obtained during the high-beta run carried out in 2016.

As the most successful tau-charm factory of the world, BEPC II will celebrate its 10th birthday this year and will finish its historical mission in the next decade. Because of its very important role in high energy phys-ics study, BEPC II will certainly need a successor, a new tau-charm collider. This paper discusses the feasi-bility of a greenfield next generation tau-charm collid-er named HIEPA. The luminosity of this successor is about 5×1034 cm−2s−1 pilot and 1×1035cm-2s−1 nominal, with the electron beam longitudinally polarized at the IP. The general scheme of the accelerators and the beam parameters are shown. Several key technologies such as beam polarization and beam emittance diag-nostics are also discussed.

The company A.D.A.M. (Application of Detectors and Accelerators to Medicine), a CERN spin-off, is working on the construction and testing of its first linear accelerator for medical application: LIGHT (Linac for Image-Guided Hadron Therapy). LIGHT is an innovative high frequency proton linac designed to accelerate proton beams up to 230 MeV for protontherapy applications. The LIGHT accelerator consists of three different linac sections: a 750 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) accelerating the beam up to 5 MeV; a 3 GHz Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac (SCDTL) up to 37.5 MeV; and a 3 GHz Cell Coupled Linac (CCL) section up to 230 MeV. The compact and modular design is based on cutting edge technologies developed for particle colliders and adapted to the needs of hadron therapy beams. A prototype of LIGHT is presently under commissioning at CERN. This paper describes the design aspects and the different stages of installation and commissioning of the LIGHT prototype with emphasis on beam tests results obtained during the past year at different energies.

A 230 MeV proton LINAC system for medical applications is being developed and commissioned for the LIGHT (Linac Image Guided Hadron Therapy) project by AVO-ADAM. The LINAC system consists of a 750 MHz RFQ (Radio frequency quadrupole) for the low energy proton acceleration, 2998 MHz SCDTL (Side Coupled Drift Tube Linacs) for the medium energy and 2998 MHz CCL (Coupled Cavity Linacs) for the high energy. In particular, the CCL accelerating modules are used in the energy range from 37.5 - 230 MeV. In this paper we discuss the 3D EM (electro-magnetic) simulation results and measurements of the CCL modules.

The MYRRHA project aims at coupling a cw 600 MeV, 4 mA proton linac with a sub-critical reactor as the very first prototype nuclear reactor to be driven by a particle accelerator (ADS). Among several applications, MYRRHA main objective is to demonstrate the principle of partitioning and transmutation (P&T) as a viable solution to drastically reduce the radiotoxicity of long-life nuclear waste. For this purpose, the linac needs an unprecedented level of reliability in terms of allowable beam trips. The normal conducting injector delivers 16.6 MeV protons to the superconducting main linac. The first section of the injector (up to 5.9 MeV) consists of an ECR source, a 4-Rod-RFQ and a rebunching line followed by 7 individual CH-type cavities. This entire section will be set up and operated by SCK·CEN in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, for ample performance and reliability testing. The first CH cavity has been sent for power tests to IAP Frankfurt, Germany. The most recent status of all cavities, couplers and the beam diagnostics of the MYRRHA injector is presented in this paper.

The performance of the energy degrader in terms of beam properties directly impacts the design and cost of cyclotron-based proton therapy centers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performances of different existing and novel degrader materials. The quantitative estimate is based on detailed Geant4 simulations that analyze the beam-matter interaction and provide a determination of the beam emittance increase and transmission. Comparisons between existing (aluminium, graphite, beryllium) and novel (boron carbide and diamond) degrader materials are provided and evaluated against semi-analytical models of multiple Coulomb scattering. The results showing a potential in emittance reduction for novel materials are presented and discussed in detail.

The CNAO (National Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy) main accelerator is a synchrotron capable to accelerate carbon ions up to 400 MeV/u and protons up to 250 MeV. Three treatment rooms are available and are equipped with horizontal beam lines; one of the treatment rooms also features a vertical treatment line to allow additional treatment ports. All of the beamlines are equipped with an active beam scanning system for dose delivery. With such a dose distribution technique, particles are sent to different depths by changing the energy from the synchrotron and are moved transversally by means of two scanning magnets. The number of particles to be deposited in each position varies strongly within the same iso-energetic layer. Part of the dose needed in a given position is in fact delivered by particles directed to deeper layers. In order to maintain the required precision on the number of particles delivered to each spot, the intensity is reduced when spots that require low number of particles are present in a layer. A method to shorten the irradiation time based on variable intensity within the same layer is presented that works also with a betatron based extraction scheme.

Here we investigate how inserts of various densities (0.001-2.2 g/cm3) affect the dose distribution properties of VHEE beams at ~150 MeV. A range variation comparison was also made with clinical proton beams using TOPAS/GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we assess the viability of scattering foils for optimizing the size of VHEE beams for radiotherapy purposes. The experiments were conducted at CERN's CLEAR user facility.

To fully exploit the advantageous dose distribution profiles of ion radiotherapy, an exact knowledge of the beam properties through online beam monitoring is essential, ensuring thus an effective dose delivery to the patient. One potential candidate for an online beam monitor is the LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO). This detector, originally developed for the LHCb experiment, has been adapted to the specific conditions of the clinical environment in a proton therapy centre. The semicircular design and position of its sensitive silicon detector offers a non-invasive way to measure the beam intensity without interfering with the beam core. In this contribution, modifications for VELO are described. The detector is synchronized with the readout of a locally-constructed Faraday Cup and the 25.7 MHz RF frequency of the cyclotron at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre (CCC). Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations investigate the integration of the detector in the treatment line and behaviour of the beam during delivery. The capability of VELO as a beam monitor will be assessed by measuring the beam current and by monitoring the beam profile along the beamline this summer.

MedAustron is a synchrotron-based ion therapy center allowing tumour treatment with protons and other light ion species, in particular C6+. Commissioning of all fixed lines, two horizontal and one vertical, has been completed for protons and in parallel to the commissioning of a gantry and C6+, a facility upgrade study is progressing. The upgrade study encompasses the optimization of the slow extraction mechanism by employing the RF empty bucket channeling and RF Knock Out techniques. The former is a front end acceleration technique that suppress spill ripples, fundamental to safely operate the machine at the highest intensities. The latter is an alternative extraction technique which opens up interesting possibilities for fast beam energy and intensity modulations. In this work, we quantify spill smoothening effect achieved with the first and report the results of a feasibility study of the second using a Schottky monitor as a transverse kicker.

The MedAustron therapy accelerator is intended to treat cancer patients with proton and carbon beams of 62-252 MeV and 120-400 MeV respectively. The accelerator features three Supernanogan ECR ion sources, a 400 keV/u RFQ and a 7 MeV/u interdigital H-mode Linac. A middle energy beam transfer line also serves as injector into a 77m synchrotron from which the beam may be transferred to 4 different irradiation rooms, 3 of which are dedicated to medical treatment. The therapy accelerator is in clinical operation since end 2016 and is currently solely configured for the use of protons. The next clinical objective is to enable treatments using C6+ ions which triggered the carbon commissioning of the accelerator in 2017. This paper will discuss the latest results from carbon commissioning in the different sections of the accelerator, achieved efficiencies and outlook on future carbon activities.

In the ENEA Frascati research center the APAM (Particle Accelerators and Medical Application) laboratory is devoted to the development of particle accelerators for medical applications. Two main facilities are operational. The TOP-IMPLART proton accelerator is a pulsed fully linear machine aimed at active intensity modulated proton therapy with a final energy of 150 MeV. The machine offers two beam extraction points: one at 3-7 MeV, on a vertical line, and the other one at 35 MeV, the maximum energy currently available, with a pulse current up to 35 μA, on the horizontal line. The REX (Removable target Electron X-ray) source consists of an electron standing wave LINAC generating a beam in the energy range of 3 to 5 MeV with a pulsed current of 0.2 A. This source can generate Bremsstrahlung X-ray beams using suitable converters (Pb, W, Ta). This paper describes the experimental results of satellite activities performed in these facilities in the fields of biology, dosimetry, electronics, PIXE spectroscopy and preservation of cultural heritage manufacts.

The portable low energy accelerator based X-ray sources have attractive applications in the non-destructive examination as a replacement of radiological gamma isotope sources. We are developing an inexpensive ultra-compact dielectric accelerator technology for low energy electron beams. The portability in the realm of this proposal is unprecedented ~ 1 ft3 volume with ~ 50 lbs of weight. The use of ceramics makes the transverse size of the accelerating waveguide comparable to that of a pencil. Because of this size reduction, additional weight reduction of shielding becomes possible. The article will report on the progress of this project.

For the last several decades, time-resolved transmission electron microscopes (TEM) exploring the sub-microsecond timescale have relied on the photoemission technology to generate the single or train of electron bunches. However, the complexity of additional laser system and the availability of high repitition rate laser limit applications of the laser-driven approach. Lately we have made substantial progress towards pioneering a new kind of time-resolved TEM, complementary to the existing laser-based techniques. Using a tunable RF beam-chopper, we are able to retrofit an exsiting TEM providing a pulsed electron beam at a continuously tunable reptition rate up to 12GHz and a tunable bunch length. In the article we will briefly discuss the working principle and experimental progress to date.

This paper investigates the feasibility of re-purposing the MuCool Test Area beamline and experimental hall to support a Muon Spin Resonance Facility which would make it the only such facility in the US. This report reviews the basic muon production concepts as studied and operationally implemented at TRIUMF, PSI, and RAL and their application in the context of the MTA facility. Two scenarios were determined feasible. One, an initial minimal-shielding and capital-cost investment stage with a single secondary muon beamline that utilizes an existing primary beam absorber and, another, an upgraded stage, that implements an optimized production target, a proximate high-intensity absorber, and optimized secondary muon lines. A unique approach is proposed which chops or strips a macropulse of H− beam into a micropulse substructure - a muon creation timing scheme - which allows Muon Spin Resonance experiments in a linac environment. With this timing scheme, and attention to target design and secondary beam collection, the MTA can host enabling and competitive Muon Spin Resonance experiments.

HIT is the first dedicated proton and carbon cancer therapy facility in Europe. It uses the full 3D intensity controlled raster scanning dose delivery method of pencil beams with ion beams of 48 - 430 MeV/u provided by a linac-synchrotron-system. Ion beams in this wide range of energies, different beam sizes, and intensities have to be provided by the control system to all treatment rooms at any time with high accuracy, stability, and reproducibility. This paper briefly reflects some aspects of the data supply, i. e. the settings of accelerator devices at a medical accelerator. This includes the generation of control data, storage, and data recovery routines, which have been developed at HIT in the recent years. That is in particular the management of verified therapy data and settings, which are stored in a non-volatile memory of the device controllers, and – as a backup – in a database and which are protected against unintended changes for safety reasons.

Now we are developing a new type of transmission electron microscope (TEM) employing the accelerator technologies. In place of a DC thermal gun generally used in conventional TEMs, we apply a photocathode gun and a special-shaped superconducting cavity, named two-mode cavity. The two-mode cavity has two resonant modes of TM010 (1.3 GHz) and TM020 (2.6 GHz). To superimpose these, we can suppress the increase of the energy spread, which is needed for the high-spatial-resolution TEMs. We have already developed some prototypes of the photocathode gun and two-mode cavity, and now in the middle of the performance tests. In this presentation, we will show the latest status of the development.

It is important that downsizing of an accelerator for spreading proton beam therapy. The synchrotron is the solution of accelerator of proton beam therapy system which can vary energy of extracted beam in the range of from 70 MeV to 235 MeV with a merit of requiring no energy selection system. In order to downsize accelerator with above merit, we suggested smaller variable energy accelerator which have cotangential trajectories. This new type accelerator is expected to realize variability of beam energy with static main magnetic field. One of technological problems of this new type accelerator is stability of betatron oscillation. We plan to utilize week focusing field as main magnetic field, which is decreasing on the radial direction outward and uniform in longitudinal direction, of this new type accelerator. We found the main magnetic field which realizes stable betaron oscillations in the range of from 70 MeV to 235 MeV as the result of estimating the betaron oscillations in this main field by numerical calculation. We report new type accelerator concept and results of analysis of betatron oscillation in cotangential trajectories.

A proton therapy project HUST-PTF (HUST Proton Therapy Facility) based on a 250MeV isochronous superconducting cyclotron is under development in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Based on the optics design of the gantry, the steering magnets need to be placed in a compact structure, as well as meet the magnetic field requirement with a maximum deflection angle of ±5mrad@250MeV. In the paper, two types of steerers (O-shape and H-shape) were introduced and discussed in detail. The magnetic fringe field interference effects between quadrupoles and steerers were studied by using OPERA/TOSCA code. The result based on the contrastive analysis will give us a valuable reference to choose suitable steerers for proton therapy beamline.

The high-gradient performance of an accelerating structure prototype for a medical proton linac is presented. The structure was designed and built using technology developed by the CLIC collaboration and the target application is the TULIP (Turning Linac for Proton therapy) proposal developed by the TERA foundation. The special feature of this design is to produce gradient of more than 50 MV /m in low-β accelerating structures (v/c=0.38). The structure was tested in an S-band test stand at CERN. During the tests, the structure reached over above 60 MV/m at 1.2 μs pulse length and breakdown rate of about 5x10-6 bpp. The results presented include ultimate performance, long term behaviour and measurements that can guide future optimization.

The PRAE project (Platform for Research and Applications with Electrons) aims at creating a multidisciplinary R&D facility in the Orsay campus gathering various scientific communities involved in radiobiology, subatomic physics, instrumentation and particle accelerators around an electron accelerator delivering a high-performance beam with energy up to 70 MeV and later 140 MeV, in order to perform a series of unique measurements and future challenging R&D. In this paper we report the first start-to-end simulations from the RF gun, going through the linac and finally to the different experimental platforms. The beam dynamics simulations have been performed using a concatenation of codes. In particular for the linac the RF-Track code recently developed at CERN will be used and benchmarked. The different working points have been analysed in order to minimise the transverse emittance and the beam energy spread including space charge effects at low electron energies.

As the increase of beam power of hadron accelerators, the damage to target material is essential. For estimation of damage such as target material used at the facility, displacement per atom (DPA), calculated by the particle flux multiplied displacement cross-section with cascade mode, is widely employed as an index of the damage. Although the DPA is employed as the standard, the experimental data of displacement cross-section are scarce for a proton in the energy region above 20 MeV. A recent study reports that the displacement cross section of tungsten has 8 times difference among the calculation models. Therefore, experimental data of the displacement cross-section is crucial. The displacement cross-section can be obtained by observing the change of resistivity of the sample cooled by GM cooler to sustain the damage. The sample is placed in the vacuum chamber placed at upstream of the beam dump for 3 GeV and 30 GeV synchrotrons in J-PARC, where the sample will be irradiated by the proton in the energy range between 0.4 and 30 GeV. In the vast energy range, the displacement cross-section can be obtained for the proton, which will help to improve the damage estimation of the target material.

ILC will be a very powerful accelerator complex. It has not only the high power energetic electron beam but also positron and photon beams. In addition to these beams, large cryogenic plants are equipped together with various utility facilities. Some suggestions on the assumption of availability of ILC are offered from various fields. These discussions will be reported.

Delbrück scattering is the elastic scattering of photons by the electromagnetic field of an atomic nucleus, as a consequence of vacuum polarization. The isolated measurement of Delbrück scattering has not been performed because of interference with other elastic scattering processes. It was recently discovered that, using linearly polarized photons, Delbrück scattering can be measured nearly independently of the other scattering processes*. In order to perform a proof of principle experiment, a quasi-monochromatic gamma-ray beam with a maximum photon energy of 1 MeV has been generated at the UVSOR facility by colliding a CO2 laser with a 750-MeV electron beam. A preliminary experiment has been performed with 0.5-W laser power and 1-mA electron beam current. As a result, the measured gamma-ray flux was evaluated as 0.0006 photon/eV/mA/W/s around the peak energy of 1 MeV. If we accept 20 percent energy spread, in case of a 100-W CO2 laser colliding with a 300 mA electron beam, approximately 4 x 106-photons/s gamma-rays could be obtained. This flux is sufficiently high for the proof of principle experiment.

The TIARA (Test Infrastructure and Accelerator Research Area) project funded by the European Union 7th framework programme made a survey of provision of education and training in accelerator science in Europe highlighted the need for more training opportunities targeting undergraduate-level students. This need is now being addressed by the European Union H2020 project ARIES (Accelerator Research and Innovation for European Science and Society) via the preparation of a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on particle accelerator science and engineering. We present here the current status of this project, the main elements of the syllabus, how it will be delivered, and the schedule for providing the course.

In this paper we will report the first optics design and performance evaluations of such a multidisciplinary machine, focusing on Very High Energy Electrons (VHEE) innovative Radiation Therapy (RT) applications in particular by allowing Grid and FLASH methodologies, which are likely to represent a major breakthrough in RT. Functional specifications include beam intensities to produce dose rates from 2 Gy/min to 100Gy/sec, beam sizes with diameters from 0.5 mm to 10 cm or more of homogeneous beams and monitoring devices with accuracy in the order of 1-2% for single or multiple beams and single or multiple fractions in biological and ppreclinical applications. High energies (>140 MeV) would be also needed for GRID therapy.

Small, lightweight, few-MeV electron accelerators that can operate with low-voltage power sources, e.g., solid-state transistors running on 50 VDC, instead of high-voltage klystrons, will provide a new tool to enhance existing applications of accelerators as well as to initiate new ones. Recent advances in gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor technologies * have resulted in a new class of high-power RF solid-state devices called high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). These HEMTs are capable of generating a few hundred watts at S-, C- and X-bands at 10% duty factor. We have characterized a number of GaN HEMTs and verified they have suitable RF characteristics to power accelerator cavities **. We have measured energy gain as a function of RF power in a single low-beta C-band cavity. The HEMT powered RF accelerators will be compact and efficient, and they can operate off the low-voltage DC power buses or batteries. These all-solid-state accelerators are also more robust, less likely to fail, and are easier to maintain and operate. In this poster, we present the design of a low-beta, 5.1-GHz cavity and beam dynamics simulations showing continuous energy gain in a ten-cavity C-band prototype.

This project will use modeling and simulation tools to optimize many aspects of the Mu*STAR design and begin to explore accident scenarios. At present we have a conceptual design of the accelerator, the reactor, the spallation target, and the fractional distillation to separate volatile fission products. Our GAIN project with ORNL is preparing a design of the Fuel Processing Plant that will convert spent nuclear fuel into the molten-salt fuel for Mu*STAR. This includes all of the nuclear components, but not such things as the turbine and generator, physical plant, control and monitoring systems, etc. We currently have basic simulations of the reactor neutronics, and a start at calculating the fuel evolution. These have used MCNP and ORIGEN, and initial results have been reported1. This project will support the use of additional neutronics and multi-physics codes, enabling a much more thorough analysis of the system.

We propose an example facility based on GEM*STAR, an accelerator-driven molten-salt-fueled graphite-moderated thermal-spectrum reactor that can operate with different fissile fuels and uses a LiF-BeF2 molten eutectic carrier salt. In the first example, they propose using the 6Li in the LiF carrier to produce more than 2 kg/y of tritium (decaying to 3He with 12.3 year half-life) using a 2.5 MWb superconducting proton linac to drive the subcritical 500 MWt reactor burning surplus plutonium. The collection of other valuable fission-product radioisotopes like 133Xe will also benefit from the high temperature and continuous removal and separation afforded by fractional distillation

This paper describes the physics design of a S-band (2856 MHz) linear accelerator (linac) with variable energy tuning. The system consists of a DC gun for generating electron, prebuncher for velocity modulation and two travelling wave (TW) accelerating sections for acceleration. The accelerating structure is a 2'Ð/3 mode constant gradient TW structure, which comprises TW buncher cells, followed by uniform cells. The structure is designed to accelerate 45 keV electron beam from the electron gun to 3.2 MeV, and then 10 MeV. An important feature of the TW linac is that the RF output power of the first linac is as the RF input power of the second linac. Three dimensional transient simulations of the accelerating structure along with the input and output couplers have been performed to explicitly demonstrate this feature. Beam dynamics is performed to calculate the beam parameter.

NASA GRC has investigated electron-screening of deuterated metals using MV electron linear accelerators (LINACs). GRC found that repeatable sub-threshold nuclear reactions may have occurred resulting in nuclear products observed via witness-material neutron activation using high purity germanium (HPGe) gamma spectroscopy and liquid scintillator spectroscopy. The suspected path of creation may be the result of electron-screened Oppenheimer-Phillips reactions or Mirror Oppenheimer-Phillips reactions. Evidence of 162Er(d, n)163Tm or 162Er(p,γ)163Tm has been shown with the appearance of gamma peaks coinciding with 163Tm with a published ' life of 22 minutes from samples containing deuterated erbium exposed to a photon beam. Both of these reactions are a variation of the Oppenheimer-Phillips nuclear reaction. Evidence of the reactions have been detected by an HPGe gamma detection system and witnessed within gamma spectra collected from deuterated materials subjected to a nominally 1.95 MeV photon beam. This paper describes the theory behind the proposed reactions, the experiments conducted at GRC, and the experimental evidence of the suspected creation of the 163Tm isotope.

National Institute of Metrology (NIM) developed the standards of the absorbed dose to water for high-energy photon and electron beams, to support the PSDL and SSDL calibration capability in China. After the measurement of absorbed dose to water for 6, 10, and 25 MV photons of linac, NIM took part the BIPM. RI(I).K6 comparison with the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The tissue phantom ratio (TPR20,10) of 6MV and 10MV photons were measured by IBA CC13 chamber and Keithley 6517B with different output dose of the Linac, and also calculated by the dose ratio (D20⁄D10) with the formula in IAEA TRS-398 report. TPR20,10 measured directly is 0.3% larger than calculated by the dose ratio D20⁄D10 . The absorbed dose to water is measured by water calorimeter with the combined standard uncertainty of 0.35%. The discrepancy of absorbed dose to water measured separately by open and sealed vessel is 0.2% at 10MV. The K6 comparison was done, the results reported as ratios of the NIM and the BIPM evaluations (and with the combined standard uncertainties given in parentheses), are 0.9917(60) at 6 MV, and 0.9941(59) at 10 MV. The quality correction factor KQ of usual used chamber was measure directly, and it is 0.3%~0.7% smaller than the data in the IAEA TRS-398 report. The typical chamber-to-chamber variations of the dose obtained with the IAEA TRS-277, TRS-398 and AAPM TG-51 were between 0.2% and 1.0% for the different photon beams. The variations of the dose obtained with IAEA TRS-398 and chambers calibrated directly by megavoltage photons were between 0.1% to 0.8%. The new standard can achieve the traceability of water absorbed dose for MV photons and will significantly reduce the uncertainty of ion chamber calibrations for Chinese radiotherapy centers.

Gantry 2 at PSI is a Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) cyclotron based proton therapy system. PBS proved to be an effective treatment method for static tumors but for mobile targets (e.g lung) organ motion interferes with beam delivery lowering the treatment quality. A method to mitigate motion effects is to re-scan the treatment volume multiple times. The downside of re-scanning is the increase of treatment time due to high number of energy switches and magnet initializations (ramping) between scans. Our current re-scanning implementation is performed with a decreasing energy sequence and takes about 6s/scan thanks to fast energy switching of 100ms. Ramping adds 8s more leading to a treatment time of >60s. We developed beam line settings for reverse energy sequence and removed the full ramping between scans. This dynamic beam delivery leads to non-negligible beam position errors of >1.5mm which we compensate by field specific corrections. Using a patient file we proved that our novel re-scanning concept doubles the treatment efficiency. Using in-house developed measurement equipment we obtained a precision of <0.5mm in position and <1mm in range which fulfills all clinical requirements.

Thermionic energy converters (TEC) are an attractive technology for modular, efficient transfer of heat to electrical energy. The steady-state dynamics of a TEC are a function of the emission characteristics of the cathode and anode, an array of intra-gap electrodes and dielectric structures, and the self-consistent dynamics of the electrons in the gap. Proper modeling of these devices requires self-consistent simulation of the electron interactions in the gap. We present results from simulations of these devices using the particle-in-cell code Warp, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. We consider the role of individual energy loss mechanisms in reducing device efficiency, including kinetic losses, radiative losses, and dielectric charging. We discuss the implementation of an external circuit model to provide realistic feedback. Lastly, we illustrate the potential to use nonlinear optimization to maximize the efficiency of these devices by examining grid transparency.

Minimising the background radiation dose in hadron therapy from particle losses and secondary emissions is of the highest importance for patient protection. To achieve this, tracking particles from source to the patient delivery region in a single simulation provides a quantitative description that distinguishes the background radiation from the treatment dose arriving at the gantry's isocentre. We demonstrate the ability to simulate beam transport, particle loss studies, and background radiation tracking in an example hadron therapy machine using BDSIM, a Geant4 based Monte Carlo simulation code for tracking high energy particles within a particle accelerator and its surrounding environment. Machine optics verification is also demonstrated through comparison to existing accelerator tracking codes.

A source of epithermal neutrons based on a vacuum-insulated tandem accelerator and a lithium target is developed for the technique of boron neutron capture therapy. A stationary proton beam of 2 MeV with a current of up to 5 mA was obtained in the accelerator. Neutron generation was performed and the flux and neutron spectrum were experimentally measured. A Beam Shaping Assembly was developed and manufactured, which makes it possible to form a therapeutic beam of neutrons to the greatest extent satisfying the requirements of BNCT. It was established that neutron irradiation of tumor cells of human glioma U251 and human glioblastoma T98G, previously incubated in a medium with boron, led to a significant suppression of their viability. Irradiation of mice with grafted human glioblastoma tumor led to their complete cure. In order to increase the beam parameters, the facility was equipped with a wire scanner OWS-30 (D-Pace, Canada; under the license of TRIUMF), a non-contact current sensor NPTC (Bergos, France), a FLIR T650SC infrared camera, an Optris CT Laser 3ML SF pyrometer (Optris, GmbH, Germany), cooled diaphragms with thermistors, telescopic beam receivers with thermoresistors, a new bushing insulator. Two new sources of negative hydrogen ions with a high current are being prepared, one of them is surface-plasma, the other is voluminous. The investigations established the effect of space charge and spherical aberration of lens on the ion beam transport, the dependence of the heating of the diaphragms of the electrodes and the size of the proton beam on the current of the injected beam of negative hydrogen ions and the pressure of the residual gas in the transport channel. The report describes the modernization of the accelerator, discusses the results of research, declares plans.

A vacuum-insulated tandem accelerator was used to observe in situ blistering during 2-MeV proton irradiation of metallic samples to a fluence of up to 6.7 1020 cm2. Samples consisting of copper of different purity, tantalum, and tantalum-copper compounds were placed on the proton beam path and forced to cool. The surface state of the samples was observed using a CCD camera with a remote microscope. Thermistors, a pyrometer, and an infrared camera were applied to measure the temperature of the samples during irradiation. After irradiation, the samples were analyzed on an X-ray diffractometer, laser and electron microscopes. The present study describes the experiment, presents the results obtained and notes their relevance and significance in the development of a lithium target for an accelerator-based neutron source, for use in boron neutron capture therapy of cancer.

Ultrashort mega-electron-volt (MeV) electron beams from radio-frequency (rf) photoinjectors have recently attracted strong interests for application in ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction (UGED). Such high-brightness electron beams are capable of providing 100-fs level temporal resolution and sub-Angstrom level spatial resolution to capture the ultrafast structural dynamics from photoexcited gas molecules. To experimentally demonstrate such an ultrafast electron scattering instrument, a high performance UGED system has been commissioned at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The UGED instrument produces 3.7 MeV electron beams with 2 fC beam charge at 180-Hz repetition rate. The temporal resolution is characterized to be 150 fs full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), while the spatial resolution is measured to be 0.76 Å FWHM. The UGED instrument also demonstrates outstanding performance in vacuum, rf, and electron beam pointing stability. Details of the performance of the SLAC MeV UGED system is reported in this paper.

Recently, demands on low energy electron linear accelerators (linacs) for industrial applications are rapidly growing. Their beam energies are lower than 20 MeV, and they require a compact, cheap, and stable accelerator system. For the Container Inspection System (CIS), KAERI successfully developed a 9/6 MeV American S-band (= 2856 MHz) linac with a 5 MW klystron in 2013. To reduce the cost of the RF source, recently, KAERI and RTX also have been developing another 9/6 MeV European S-band (= 2998 MHz) linac by using a magnetron with a lower RF power of about 3.1 MW. Its accelerating structure is designed to be operated in π/2 mode by coupling 13 accelerating cells together through 12 side-coupling cells. The CST Microwave Studio is used for electromagnetic simulations and optimization of the accelerating structure. After various optimizations, a shunt impedance of 84 MΩ/m is obtained at π/2 mode frequency of 2998.31 MHz. In this paper, we describe design concept, optimization, and RF measurement of the new 9/6 MeV European S-band linac structure. Then, we compare it with our old American S-band linac structure.

Close collaboration between academia, research centres and industry has turned out to be crucial for the advancement of accelerator science and technology. It is also ideal for providing an efficient training of the next generation of particle accelerator experts and for linking the global accelerator community. Five international research and training networks (DITANET, oPAC, LA3NET, OMA and AVA) have been initiated and coordinated by the University of Liverpool/Cockcroft Institute since 2007. These networks have provided training to almost 100 Fellows from all over the world and organised dozens of international schools, topical workshops and international conferences for the accelerator community. The research activities of the networks have led to hundreds of journal publications and conference proceedings. This contribution presents the best practice in establishing such international collaborative projects, how to establish successful links between sectors and countries, and highlights the main research results that resulted from the research programs.

A consortium of universities, research and clinical facilities, as well as partners from industry carry out an interdisciplinary R&D program across three closely interlinked scientific work packages. These address the development of novel beam imaging and diagnostics systems, studies into treatment optimization including innovative schemes for beam delivery and enhanced biological and physical models in Monte Carlo codes, as well as R&D into clinical facility design and optimization to ensure optimum patient treatment along with maximum efficiency. Selected research highlights from across these work packages will be presented and the impact on hadron therapy facilities around the world discussed.

We present an optimal design of an X-ray target for 6 MeV medical linear accelerators using FLUKA simula-tions. The target is composed of high-atomic number tungsten and high-thermal conductivity copper, corre-sponding water-cooling system is showed too. Further-more, we analyse the temperature and thermal stress re-sponses of the target under transient thermal loads using Ansys Code. For 6 MeV electron beam with 100 uA cur-rent, the results show that the target can achieve 1014 cGy/min at 1meter in front of the target. Within 100 ms, the maximum temperature reaches 512 °C under pulsed heating source with 250 Hz frequency and 1' duty cycle and the number of cycles to failure is estimated as 5.8·108.

A Terbium activated Gadolinium Oxysulfide (Gd2O2S:Tb)-filled optical fibre sensor was developed and tested as a proton therapy beam dosimeter on a 74 MeV proton beam. Tests were carried out at the TRIUMF proton therapy centre, where a passively scattered beam is used for treatment. To create a clinically relevant spread-out Bragg peak, a modulator wheel with steps of varying thickness is employed. To determine the sensor's response in a 23 mm spread out Bragg peak, the sensor signal was sampled at depth intervals of 0.79 mm along the beam axis in a water phantom. The resulting data showed a periodic variation in the signal corresponding to the rotation of the modulator wheel and related to the depth in water of the detector. This timing resolution in the sensor response could find application in quality assurance for modulated proton beams.
