The commissioning at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) of a high-brightness high-repetition rate (MHz-class) photo-gun, based on a normal conducting 186 MHz (VHF-band) RF cavity operating in CW mode, is now completed. The gun has been designed to satisfy the requirements for operating high-repetition rate 4th generation light sources. Test of high quantum efficiency photocathodes with bunches of hundreds pC at MHz repetition rate are now underway. They include, Cs2Te cathodes developed in collaboration with INFN-LASA and multialkali antimonides (CsK2Sb), prepared by a collaborating group at LBNL. The present experimental results and the plan for future activities are presented.

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a megawatt­ class hadron accelerator. Beam loss monitoring is essential for machine protection, residual activation control and machine tuning. We discuss all parts of our beam loss monitoring system including its detectors, electronics, machine protection system (MPS) interface and its role in the accelerator tuning process. The system was designed more than 10 years ago, so we are now addressing obsolescence problems by designing a new FPGA based replacement. The plans for this next generation BLM system are presented.
