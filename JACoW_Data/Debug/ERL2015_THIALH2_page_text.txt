For the planed Mainzer Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz a diagnostic test-beam-line has been build up. The beam-line comprises three analyzing stations to investigate space charge caused transverse emittance growth and helicity correlated asymmetries. Furthermore a circular deflecting cavity allows to measure the longitudinal bunch intensity profile. The components and the latest results will be described and an outlook towards further applications will be given.

We have developed a cost-effective, fast rotating wire scanner for use in accelerators where high beam currents would otherwise melt even carbon wires. This new design uses a simple planetary gear setup to rotate a tungsten or carbon wire, fixed at one end, through the beam at speeds in excess of 20 m/s. We present results from bench tests, as well as transverse beam profile measurements taken at Cornell’s high-brightness ERL photoinjector, for beam currents up to 35 mA.

We evaluate the effectiveness of three ion-clearing strategies in the Cornell high intensity photoinjector: DC clearing electrodes, bunch gaps, and beam shaking. We present data from recent experiments where we directly measured the residual trapped ion density while employing these clearing methods. Several theoretical models have been developed to estimate the ion creation and clearing rates. The data is well explained by two independent simulation codes that track the motion of ions trapped in the electric field generated by the beam.

Electron injector brightness is limited by the energy spread in the electrons emitted from a photocathode. Knowledge and understanding of the physical mechanisms underpinning this energy spread is critical in the development of high-performance electron sources, as is the ability to quantify this energy spread. In order to measure longitudinal and transverse photoelectron energy distribution curves, ASTeC, in collaboration with the ISP, have developed a Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS) which permits measurement of photoelectron energy spread for different photocathode types under varying conditions of degradation, temperature and illumination. We describe the operating principle of this equipment. Photocathode performance is strongly affected by surface structure, with stoichiometry and roughness playing key roles in defining electron energy spread. A complete understanding of the nature of the activated GaAs surface has not yet been achieved, but it is known that the nature of the activation layer is dependent on the layer thickness. We present work which shows the transition point between the dipole layer model and the heterojunction layer model in (Cs, O) films.
