Laser-plasma accelerators are prominent candidates for driving next-generation light sources, promising few-fs x-ray pulses perfectly synchronized to an optical laser, thus enabling pump-probe experiments with unprecedented temporal resolution. We report on a recent experiment demonstrating undulator radiation from a laser-plasma accelerator, with photon pulses freely tunable over a range from 100 to 300 eV. Using a set of specifically designed multilayer mirrors, we can selectively choose the central photon pulse energy and bandwidth and focus the x-ray pulses on target. Assuming chirped electron bunches, as expected from laser-plasma accelerators, the pulses can be compressed to the 1 fs level and below.
