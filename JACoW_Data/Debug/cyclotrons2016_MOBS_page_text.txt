Michael K. Craddock, TRIUMF accelerator physicist and UBC professor, died on 11 November, 2015 after a brief illness. Michael left the UK to join the UBC Nuclear Physics group in 1966, just at the time a new accelerator to replace the aging Van de Graaff was under consideration. He was a leading member of the founding team that decided on a 500 MeV HÂ¯ cyclotron and directed the beam dynamics design of the cyclotron to first beam in December 1974. With the cyclotron running at full intensity he moved his interest to higher energies and led the accelerator physics team in the design of the 30 GeV KAON Factory (1982-1994). After retirement from UBC in 2001 he moved his research interest to FFAGs.
