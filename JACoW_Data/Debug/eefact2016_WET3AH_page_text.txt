This talk will overview recent progress in developing of non-evaporable getter (NEG) coatings. NEG coatings are widely used in particle accelerator as a complex solution which addresses a few problems. It is a barrier for gas diffusion from the vacuum chamber material, it reduces photon and electron stimulated desorption by an order of magnitude. It provides a distributed pumping speed, making NEG is the most economical and, in many cases, the only vacuum solution for long and narrow vacuum chambers. Another important property of NEG coating is its low SEY (after NEG activation), so it reduces a risk of e-cloud and beam induced electron mitipacting. The NEG coating surface resistance was recently studied in ASTeC. New experimental data and a model allow calculating NEG coating impedance in wide range of RF frequencies.

Upcoming large scale particle accelerators, such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) are expected to require RF drive on the order of 100 MW. Therefore, efforts to improve the efficiency of the specific RF source is of significant interest to the particle accelerator community. Klystrons are an attractive choice as the RF source, with the current state of the art tubes offering efficiencies up to 70%. The High Efficiency International Klystron Activity (HEIKA) collaboration seeks to improve upon this by considering novel methods of electron bunching. Such methods include the core oscillation method (COM), the bunching-alignment-collection (BAC) method, as well as the use of harmonic cavities. The theory behind these bunching methods will be discussed, along with their suitability for specific particle accelerators. In addition, results from numerical simulations predicting klystrons with efficiencies larger than 80% will be presented. Early experimental testing of tubes employing the BAC method will also be presented, demonstrating the efficiency improvements that the scheme offers.

The conceptual design of an extraction line and beam dump for the future electron positron circular collider is presented. The proposed extraction line, consisting of abort kicker system, spoilers and beam diagnostics apparatus transports the electron and positron beams to the main beam dumps. The beam must be spread over a large surface in order not to damage the beam dump and the window, which separates the ring from the dump. The extraction line redistributes bunches at different locations on the face of beam dump. Monte Carlo simulations using FLUKA have been performed to estimate the distribution of energy deposition on the window and beam dump to find the optimal absorber and its dimensions.
