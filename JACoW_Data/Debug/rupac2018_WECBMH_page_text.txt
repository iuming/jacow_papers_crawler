Superconducting linac is nowadays a standard technology to generate high-energy proton and ion beams especially for CW operation mode. Starting from SNS at ORNL * superconducting radio frequency (SRF) technology and superconducting (SC) linacs are changed from the exotic to classical technology of today. Many ion accelerator complexes developed in USA, EU, Japan, China, Korea and other countries for spallation neutron sources, production of radioactive ion beams and ADS (Accelerator Driven System) drivers use SC cavities. Currently, the mega-science accelerator project NICA ** (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility, JINr) as well as new proposed projects DERICA *** (Dubna Electron-Radioactive Ion Collider fAcility), NEPTUN, BELA ****(Based on ECR and Linear Accelerator multidisciplinary facility), etc. cannot be constructed without SRF technologies development in Russia. New ambitious program of SRF technology has been started few years ago by JINR in collaboration with MEPhI, NRC KI ITEP, BSU, PTI NANB, TRIUMF and GSI. Current progress in general conceptual design of new SC linacs, beam dynamics simulation of SC cavities and related issues will be discussed in this presentation.

Testing of superconducting (SP) magnets for NICA project include warm and cold magnetic measurements for all of them. All of Booster dipoles and 50% of quadrupole doublets successfully tested at the moment. Magnetic measurements of pre-series dipole magnet of NICA collider have been done. Magnetic measurements results of Booster SP-magnets and collider pre-series magnet are presented and discussed in this report.

Novel experiments to study fundamental properties of high-energy-density states in matter generated by intense heavy ion beams will be carried out by the HED@FAIR collaboration at FAIR. For strong transverse focusing a special final focus system consisted of four superconducting large-aperture high-gradient quadrupole magnets will be installed at the end of the HED@FAIR beam line. Design and main characteristics of the quadrupole are discussed. Stress - strain dependence of the quadrupole superconducting cable and electrical strength of the cable insulation are measured. Results of mechanical and thermal calculation of main parts of the quadrupole are presented.

NICA (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fA'ility) is a new accelerator complex designed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR, Dubna, Russia) to study properties of dense baryonic matter. The accelerator complex will consist of three superconducting (SC) rings: the Nuclotron, a booster synchrotron and a two-aperture collider. For the project it is necessary to produce and test at a helium temperature level (4.5 K) and an operating current of 10 kA of 450 SC magnets. All the magnets contain a cold iron yoke and saddle-shaped superconducting windings made of the hollow NbTi composite SC cable refrigerated by two-phase helium flow at 4.5 K. For this purpose, was created a new test bench with a maximum capacity of 12 SC magnets per month. The new test facility consists of eight sections: manufacture of SC cable, manufacture of SC coil, assembling magnets, "warm" magnetic test, vacuum test, assembling magnets of cryostate, cryogenic test and power supply. The cryogenic system of the new facility is based on helium refrigerators with excess return flow. The cryogenic test of SC magnets consists of six main stages: cooling magnet, traning SC coil, "cold" magnetic test, measurements of static heat leak and dynamic hear releases, "cold" helium leak. In the report will show today's progress in the production of magnets for project, as well as unique cryogenic properties of SC magnets and plans for the production of SC magnets for the NICA project.
