This lunch’s purpose is to continue the discussion of how accelerators can be more green as well as how accelerators and peripheral technologies can help with sustainability at all levels as well as with clean energy. After a short opening conversation between the two discussion leaders to provoke ideas, they will guide additional dialogue generated through audience engagement to extend through the duration of the conference and beyond.
