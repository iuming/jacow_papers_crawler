CW SRF Cavities have been used very successfully in the past in synchrotron light sources to provide high power acceleration. Here we present a novel application of higher harmonic systems of two frequencies (1.5 GHz and 1.75 GHz) to generate a beating of accelerating voltage. With such a system it is possible to store "standard" (some 10 ps long) and "short" (ps and sub-ps long) pulses simultaneously in the light source. This opens up brand new possibilities for light source users to perform dynamic and high-resolution experiments at the same facility. The demands on the SRF system and RF control are substantial and a new design, based on waveguide damping, is currently being developed. This system will be used for a major upgrade of the BESSY-II facility to the BESSY Variable Pulse Storage Ring (BESSY-VSR) for a next-generation storage-ring light source. We will discuss the concept, challenges and designs for BESSY-VSR.

Funding: Funding received from Ministry of Higher Education through University Grants Commission of India and from Department of Atomic Energy are gratefully acknowledged.
The talk shall summarize the recent advances in the SRF program in various research centres in India. The SRF related activities at Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC) at Delhi , Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT) at Indore, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) both at Mumbai, and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC) at Kolkata shall be addressed. In particular indigenous niobium resonator fabrication and test facilities of IUAC operational for more than a decade which have been used extensively for development, fabrication and utilization of various types of resonators will be discussed. The results from the commissioning of the full three linac modules having eight niobium quarter wave resonators in each module of the heavy ion linac at IUAC for regular scheduled experiments will be presented. The technology and infrastructure developments at RRCAT, BARC, TIFR and VECC for fabrication, processing and tests of future cavities will be discussed.

Recent Progress of ESS Spoke and Elliptical Cryomodules
474

The ESS accelerator high level requirements are to provide a 2.86 ms long proton pulse at 2 GeV at repetition rate of 14 Hz. This represents 5 MW of average beam power with a 4% duty cycle on target. In a framework of collaboration between IPN Orsay, CEA Saclay and ESS, prototype spoke and medium and high beta elliptical cavities and cryomodules have been studied, constructed and tested. After a description of the ESS project and the accelerator layout, this paper will focus on the recent progress towards realization of the detailed design, the manufacturing of the first components of the prototype cryomodules and the first test results of some of the main critical elements such as SRF cavities and cold tuning systems.
