During successful beam commissioning of the superconducting 15-gap Crossbar H-mode cavity at GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung heavy ions up to the design beam energy have been accelerated. The design acceleration gain of 3.5 MeV inside a length of less than 70 cm has been reached with full transmission for heavy ion beams of up to 1.5 particle mueA. The measured beam parameters confirm sufficient beam quality. The machine beam commissioning is a major milestone of the R&D for the superconducting heavy ion continuous wave linear accelerator HELIAC of Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) and GSI developed in collaboration with IAP Goethe-University Frankfurt. The next step is the procurement and commissioning of so called ’Advanced Demonstrator’ - the first of series cryo module for the entire accelerator HELIAC. Results of further Demonstrator beam tests, as well as the status of the Advanced demonstrator project will be reported.

J-PARC E34 experiment intends to measure the anomalous magnetic moment and electric dipole moment of muon precisely by a different way from the previous experiment. In this experiment, a low-emittance muon beam is provided using the muons with the thermal energy and the four-stage linac. The demonstration of the first muon RF acceleration with an RFQ linac was conducted and the transverse profile of the accelerated muons was measured last year. As one of the remaining issues for the beam-diagnostic system, the longitudinal beam profile after the RFQ should be measured to match the profile to the designed acceptance of the subsequent accelerator. For this purpose, the new longitudinal beam monitor using the micro-channel plate is under development. The time resolution aims to be around 30 to 40 ps corresponding to 1 % of a period of an operation frequency of the accelerator, which is 324 MHz. On November 2018, the bunch structure of accelerated muons of 89 keV with the RFQ was measured using this monitor at the J-PARC MLF. The latest analysis result of this measurement will be reported in this poster.

In the following years, the Fermilab Muon Campus will deliver highly polarized muon beams to the Muon g-2 Experiment. The Muon Campus contains a target section wherein secondaries are produced, the delivery ring which separates the muons from the rest of the beam and a sequence of beamlines that transports them to the Muon g-2 storage ring. Here, we report the first results of beam measurements at the Muon Campus with emphasis on the key achievements that have contributed to the successful beam delivery to the Muon g-2 Experiment. These achievements include the production of an intense secondary beam from the target, it’s transport over 2 km, the successful monitoring of muons from the available diagnostics and the development of techniques for measuring the transverse optics. We also present detailed comparisons between experimental data and simulation and discuss the similarities and differences observed.
