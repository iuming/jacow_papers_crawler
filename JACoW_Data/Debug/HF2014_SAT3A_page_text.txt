SAT3A1
Design Study of the CEPC Booster

Design study of the CEPC booster is reported. The booster provides 120 GeV beams for the collider with top-up injection frequency of 0.1 Hz. To save cost, energy of the linac injector for the booster is chosen as 6GeV, corresponding to the magnetic field of 30 Gs. In this paper, lattice of the booster is described; the low injection energy issues are studied; beam transfer from linac to booster and from booster to collider are discussed.

The paper describes a method of the preservation of the polarization of the electron beam during the acceleration in a synchrotron. It is proposed to install in the ring equally spaced Siberian Snakes. Advantages to use the odd number of snakes are discussed. Preliminary results of the analytical estimations and of numerical spin tracking simulation are shown.
