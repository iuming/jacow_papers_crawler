More Than Particles: How Accelerators Can Speed Up Advanced Manufacturing… and What's Next

Konosuke Matsushita, the founder of Panasonic, once said "We are apt to think that our ideas are the creation of our own wisdom, but the truth is that they are the result of the experience through outside contact". The ever-accelerating pace of progress in digital technologies is leading to a transformation of the manufacturing industry. With initiatives at regional, national (think Industria Conectada 4.0, Industrie du Futur, Industrie 4.0…) and international level, seizing the opportunity created by these technologies has become a priority for most developed economies. In France, CEA is one of the leading actors in this 4th industrial revolution, developing new digital and robotics technologies, and working together with industry to accelerate their deployment. In his talk, Greg Ameyugo will show how progress in Advanced Manufacturing can be and is already being inspired by Accelerator and Large Experimental Physics Control Systems, the current and emerging technology trends in manufacturing, and the changes they can bring about for industry.
