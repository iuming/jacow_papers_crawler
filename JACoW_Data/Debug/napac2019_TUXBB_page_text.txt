Since the inception of particle accelerators about 100 years ago, nearly every field of modern society has benefited from their continued development. Applications include discovery science (identification of basic matter constituents and their interactions), nuclear weapon and energy development, material and biological sciences as well as medical sciences including cancer therapies. Common to all accelerators is the need for accurate and precise measurements of the beam’s properties to optimize accelerator performance. This tutorial will cover select beam instrumentation basics, applications of these for characterizing accelerator performance, then present instrumentation challenges for future particle accelerators.
