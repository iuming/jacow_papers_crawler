An extensive set of beam diagnostics has been one of the factors in the successful commissioning and operation of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) x-ray FEL over the last seven years. The originally developed and installed diagnostics were geared towards measuring the electron beam parameters of the LCLS design specifications. Since then, a number of improved and new diagnostics have been implemented to accommodate a much wider range of beam parameters and to overcome the challenges of diagnostics for a high brightness electron beam. Plans for the diagnostics of the LCLS-II project with its high repetition rate and high beam power and ongoing developments will also be discussed.
