TUIA2
An Exploration of Proton and Electron Accelerator Business Opportunities With Invited Speakers
 


 

R.W. Hamm
                       AccSys, Pleasanton, California, USA

 


 

Robert W. Hamm will chair this discussion by three invited speakers on accelerator business opportunities. These presentations will give an overview of some of the larger existing commercial accelerator applications and the future opportunities in them, as well as present the current and future Discovery Science Projects underway or planned worldwide. A number of the applications of accelerators in the US and in Europe will be described.

TUIA3
Open Source vs Closed Source IP and How the Two Relate to the Business of Particle Accelerators
 


 

G.M. Anelli
                       CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

 


 

This presentation, illustrated with examples related to accelerator technologies, will provide the audience with an overview of a Knowledge Transfer (KT) strategy, with emphasis on the various dissemination channels used in KT, from open to 'closed' or proprietary. CERN's network of Business incubation centers in the member states, as well as other ways in which CERN does KT (through people and through procurement) will serve as a background to this presentation.

A Fireside Talk
 


 

M. Lindroos

Guest: John Womersley, former CEO of the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), and current Director General of ESS. In his role as CEO of the STFC since 2011, Womersley led one of Europe's largest multidisciplinary research organisations. He was directly involved in the UK's decision to join ESS in 2014. He is also a leading figure in European science policy as the former chair of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), the leading forum for prioritizing strategic investment in research infrastructure in Europe. My vision for ESS is that we should look broader than being the world's best neutron scattering facility, said Womersley. We should also aim to be what everyone looks to in terms of Big Science. Later during the session, Mikael Eriksson from MAX IV and Søren Pape Møller from Aarhus University join the discussion.
