Over the years SNS has been optimizing the amount of errant beam pulses in the accelerator. The errant beam pulses can damage the superconducting cavities and thus lower the uptime of the accelerator. This talk will present the effort that has been made to lower the amount of errant beam pulses with new diagnostics, analysis of processes that cause errant beam, and the resulting lessons learned.

A Two-frequency method has been implemented for bunch length measurement at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). It is based on the information from two harmonic frequencies of Flourier Transformation of longitudinal charge distribution. We select 500MHz and 3GHz as working frequency and the system consists of power splitters, band-pass filters and a mixer. Raw data are acquired by a digital oscilloscope and analyzed by MATLAB code. The system has been calibrated by Streak Camera in single-bunch experiment environment with bunch charge from 0.23nC to 6.05nC. The paper also shows bunch length synchronous oscillation phenomenon during injection period.

Triggered by the need for current measurement in the nA range for slow extracted beams and for the beams in the storage rings at FAIR and CERN, the idea of the CCC as a current transformer has been revitalized during the last ten years. Compared to the first prototype, developed at GSI in the 90s, the second generation of CCCs is based on the possibility of detailed simulation of superconducting magnetic shielding properties, new nano-crystalline materials for the magnetic ring-cores, and on superior commercially available SQUID systems. In 2014, nA resolution measurements at 2 kHz bandwidth demonstrated the possibility of spill analysis at slow extracted beams from GSI SIS18. In the following year, the first stand-alone CCC system, including a cryostat with separate He liquefier, started operation in the CERN AD. Although the existing systems show an outstanding current resolution, their cost efficiency and robustness, as well as noise and vibration sensitivity can still be improved, which is subject of ongoing research. In this contribution recent results of our CCC tests are shown and future developments are discussed.
