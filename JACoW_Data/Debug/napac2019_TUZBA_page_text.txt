The brand-new state of the art electron accelerator, LEReC, was built and commissioned at BNL. LEReC accelerator includes a photocathode DC gun, a laser system, a photocathode delivery system, magnets, beam diagnostics, a SRF booster cavity, and a set of Normal Conducting RF cavities to provide sufficient flexibility to tune the beam in the longitudinal phase space. Electron beam quality suitable for cooling in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was achieved [1], which lead to the first demonstration of bunched beam electron cooling of hadron beams [2]. This presentation will discuss commissioning results, achieved beam parameters and performance of the LEReC systems.

This presentation summarizes the physics requirements as they translate into accelerator requirements at the machine-detector interface. Unique aspects of the Interaction Region and detector acceptance – unique to an Electron Ion Collider – are summarized. Designs of both site-specific concepts are outlined.

A recent assessment of the scientific merit for a future Electron Ion Collider (EIC) in the US, by the National Academy of Sciences, found that such a facility would be unique in the world and would answer science questions that are compelling, fundamental, and timely. This assessment confirmed the recommendations of the 2015 Nuclear Science Advisory Committee for an EIC with highly polarized beams of electrons and ions, sufficiently high luminosity and variable center-of-mass (CM) energy. The baseline design of Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) has been updated to 100 GeV CM energy, corresponding to 200 GeV proton energy. We here present a high-energy design for the JLEIC ion complex. It consists of a 135 MeV injector linac, a 6-GeV non figure-8 pre-booster ring and a 40-GeV large ion booster, which could also serve as electron storage ring (e-ring). The energy choice in the accelerator chain is beneficial for a future upgrade to 140 GeV CM energy. The large booster is designed with the same shape and size of the original e-ring allowing for the option of building separate electron and ion rings by stacking them in the same tunnel along with the ion collider ring.

The Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC) is a proposed new machine for nuclear physics research. It uses the existing CEBAF accelerator as a full energy injector to deliver 3 to 12 GeV electrons into a new electron collider ring. An all new ion accelerator and collider complex will deliver up to 200 GeV protons. The machine has luminosity goals of 1034 cm-2 ses−1. The whole detector region including forward detection covers about 80 meters of the JLEIC complex. The interaction region design has recently been optimized to accommodate 200 GeV proton energy using conventional NbTi superconducting magnet technology. This paper will describe the requirements and preliminary designs for both the ion and electron beam magnets in the most complex 32 m long interaction region (IR) around the interaction point (IP). The interaction region has over thirty-seven superconducting magnets operating at 4.5K; these include dipoles, quadrupoles, skew-quadrupoles, solenoids, horizontal and vertical correctors and higher order multipole magnets. The paper will also discuss the electromagnetic interaction between these magnets.

Action and phase jump analysis has been used to estimate corrector strengths in the high luminosity interaction regions of the LHC. It has been proven that these corrections are effective to eliminate the beta-beating that is generated in those important regions and that propagates around the ring. More recently, it was also shown that the beta-beating at the interaction point can also be suppressed by combining k-modulation measurements with action and phase jump analysis. Applying this technique to the re-commissioning of the LHC in 2021 requires a good knowledge of the software developed for action and phase jump analysis over the years. In this paper a detailed description is made of all the modules that are part of this software and the corresponding algorithms.

Relativistic magnetized electron cooling is an essential technique for achieving the ion beam luminosity requirements of proposed electron-ion collider facilities. Because the cooling system will have to operate in previously untested parameter regimes, accurate computation of magnetized dynamic friction is required at the design stage. In particular, one has to include all relevant physics that might increase the cooling time, such as short interaction time in the cooler, space charge forces, field errors and complicated phase space distributions of imperfectly magnetized electron beams. We will present recent work on a new semi-analytic treatment of momentum transfer from an ion to a distribution of magnetized electrons, and discuss its application to calculation of dynamic friction in the parameter regime relevant to the JLEIC and eRHIC cooling system design.
