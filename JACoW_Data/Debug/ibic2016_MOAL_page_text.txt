Accelerator R&D in Spain is a relatively young activity. Nowadays several groups and laboratories are operating or developing projects and have become specialists in different accelerator systems. A network named CONECTA has been recently created with the aim of fostering collaboration and coordination at the national level. A general overview of these activities will be presented, with special emphasis on the ALBA Synchrotron, and with a perspective for the future.

The MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring based on a multibend achromat lattice allowing for horizontal emittances from 330 pm rad down to 180 pm rad, depending on the number of insertion devices. The diagnostics used during commissioning will be described, with emphasis on the emittance diagnostics This will involve two diagnostic beam lines to image the electron beam with infrared and ultraviolet synchrotron radiation from bending dipoles, in order to determine also beam energy spread. The scheme for horizontal emittance measurements looks promising also for an order of magnitude lower emittance. Bunch lengthening with harmonic cavities is essential for the low emittance machine performance. We have used a radiation based sampling technique to verify individual bunch distributions.

The Phase 1 commissioning of SuperKEKB rings with-out superconducting final focus magnets or Belle-II de-tector began in Feb., 2016. A total of 1010 mA (LER) and 870 mA (HER) stored beam has been achieved close to the design emittance and x-y coupling. Most of the beam diagnostics, including new systems such as gated turn-by-turn monitors and X-ray beam size monitors, have been commissioned with beam and proved to be essential to the success of machine commissioning. The results of the beam commissioning, including the evaluation and diffi-culties of the beam diagnostics are shown.
