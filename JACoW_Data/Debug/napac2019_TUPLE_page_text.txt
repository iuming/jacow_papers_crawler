Abstract RF commissioning at FRIB involves QWR cavities (β=0.085 and β=0.041), HWR cavities (β=0.29 and β=0.53) and few room temperature devices. Each RF system has many process variables for LLRF and amplifier control located on different pages of CS-Studio. Efficient handling of all these PVs can be challenging for RF experts. Several scripts using Python have been developed to facilitate this process. User interface application has been developed using Qt Designer and PyQt package of Python, for ease of access of all scripts. These scripts are useful for mass ac-tions (for multiple systems) including turning on/ off LLRF controllers and amplifiers, resetting interlocks/ errors, chang-ing a PV value, etc. Python scripts are also used to quickly prototype the auto-start procedure for QWR cavities, which eventually is implemented on IOC driver. The application sends commands to IOC driver with device name, PV name and value to be changed. Future developments can be con-verting to state-notation language on IOC to add channel access security. This application intends to reduce time and efforts for RF commissioning at FRIB.

Beam halo includes the part of beam that ends up outside of the phase space of the main beam core. It can arise from field emission in the gun and accelerating structures (dark current) and be emitted independently in time and space from the photoelectric emission at the cathode generated by the drive laser. In order to fully understand and characterize the beam halo, Euclid is developing an iris diaphragm detector that allows the beam core to pass without interception, while the halo is collimated. The detector can also work for beam profile measurements. This paper discusses about the recent studies on the iris detector.

Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a next-generation rare-isotope research facility under construction at Michigan State University (MSU). FRIB will produce rare-isotope beams of unprecedented intensities by impinging a 400 kW heavy-ion beam on a production target and by collecting and purifying the rare isotopes of interest with a fragment separator. A thermal imaging system (TIS) has been developed to monitor the beam spot on the production target. The main features and characteristics of optical system is presented. The prototype of optical system has been tested.

Understanding the characteristics of the gas sheet being produced and optimal configuration of the gas injection system is essential to the the performance of a gas sheet beam profile monitor. A gas injection system test stand has been built at Fermilab to test various nozzle and slit configurations. The distance between the nozzle and slit can be changed to find an optimal configuration. Using a moveable cold cathode gauge the gas profile is measured.

One of the challenges of the injector for the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) is the measurement and monitoring of the required high charge electron beam at 6 GeV between the Booster synchrotron and the storage ring in the transport line (BTS. In APS-U charges of up to 17 nC per micropulse are specified with a beam geometrical horizontal emittance of 60 nm rad. Vertical beam sizes at the imaging station of ~80 µm (σ) are expected so system resolutions of <30 µm are warranted. A phased approach to enhance the imaging station performance has been initiated. Recently, the 20-year-old Chromox screen oriented at 45 degrees to the beam was replaced by a 100-micron thick YAG:Ce screen which gave an improved screen resolution of <10 micron(σ. However, the optical magnification of the system still needs to be increased. In addition, the high areal charge densities are expected to exceed the scintillator mechanism’s saturation threshold so an optical transition radiation (OTR) screen will be added to the station for high-charge studies. A final phase would be the use of optical diffraction radiation (ODR) as a non-intercepting, beam-size monitor during top-up injections.

Thin diamond plates are used in monochromator for X-ray Free-Electron Laser self-seeding scheme. To function properly, they must endure high-intensity and high-repetition-rate laser pulses without crossing thresholds set by various adverse effects, such as thermal strain-induced diffraction distortion and graphitization. In this work, a theoretical model is developed, and an analytical solution is derived to elucidate potential thermal runaway under edge cooling condition. It is shown that the crystal edge cooling can effectively mitigate the issue to a certain extent. The analytical solution can be used as an efficient tool for XFEL operation parameter setup.

We are upgrading the BPM processors in the SPEAR3 accelerator complex as several of the existing systems have reached end of life. To reduce the resources required for maintenance we have evaluated and installed several commercial BPM processors from the SPARK series of Libera/Instrumentation Technologies. In SPEAR3 we evaluated the SPARK-ERXR turn-by-turn BPM processor as a replacement to the in-house developed/commercially built Echotek processors that are used for a range of accelerator physics studies. We show measurements of the orbit dynamics with another SPARK-ERXR in the booster synchrotron from beam injection up to ejection. We have further evaluated a Spark-EL in the transport lines to replace the in-house built uTCA-based single-pass BPM processors. In this paper we show measurements and discuss our experience with the Libera SPARK series of BPM processors and comment on the software integration.

Fermilab aims to provide greater beam power for the neutrino physics program. As the beam power increases, the unwanted production of secondary electrons in the beam pipe, known as ‘electron cloud’ or ‘E-cloud’ may become disruptive to high intensity operation. Instrumentation has been deployed in the Fermilab Main Injector (MI) to study E-cloud. One of these is a Retard Field Analyzer (RFA) that can be used to directly measure E-cloud generation at the location of the instrument. Studies of the dependence of E-cloud on beam intensity and bunch length have been carried out. The experimental results are compared to POSINST simulations. These simulations are guided by measurements from a Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) test stand installed in the MI to measure the SEY of materials such as the beam pipe stainless steel. The SEY has a strong influence on the E-cloud density. Results of these comprehensive studies comparing the RFA data with realistic MI simulations will be presented.

Beam loss in accelerators is an unavoidable and often unwanted reality, but it is not without its use. Information from beam loss can be leveraged to optimize the tune and improve beam quality, in addition to monitoring for machine fault and failure conditions. The folded geometry at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) presents a unique challenge in the detection of radiative losses, resulting in the introduction of non-traditional measurement schemes. In addition to neutron detectors and pressurized ionization chambers, FRIB will utilize halo ring monitors, fast thermometry within the cryomodules, and differential beam-current measurements. This paper will present an analysis of beam-loss measurements from commissioning the first segment of the FRIB accelerator, and a discussion of ways to evaluate and monitor the health of the beam loss monitoring system.

Quadrupole and solenoid scans are common techniques where a series of beam profile measurements are taken under varying excitation of the linear focusing elements to unfold second-order phase-space moments of the beam at an upstream location. Accurate knowledge of the moments is crucial to machine tuning and understanding the underlying beam dynamics. The scans have many sources of errors including measurement errors, field errors and misalignments. The impact of these uncertainties on the moment measurement is often not analyzed. This study proposes a scheme motivated by linear algebra error bounds that can efficiently select a set of scan parameters to minimize the errors in measured initial moments. The results are verified via a statistical error analysis. These techniques are being applied at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). We find that errors in initial moments can be large under conventional scans but are greatly reduced using the procedures described.

Traditionally, time-resolved experiments in storage ring synchrotron light sources and free-electron lasers are performed with short x-ray pulses with time duration smaller than the time resolution of the phenomenon under study. Typically, storage-ring synchrotron light sources produce x-ray pulses on the order of tens of picoseconds. Newer diffraction limited storage rings produce even longer pulses. We propose to use a high-gradient RF streak camera for time-resolved experiments in storage-ring synchrotron light sources with potential for sub-100 fs resolution. In this work we present a detailed analysis of the effects of the initial time and energy spread of the photo-emitted electrons on the time resolution, as well as a start-to-end beam dynamics simulation in an S-Band system.
