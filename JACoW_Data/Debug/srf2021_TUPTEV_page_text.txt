At the electron accelerator for beams with high brilliance and low emittance (ELBE), the second version of a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) photoinjector was brought into operation in 2014. After a period of commissioning, a gradual transfer to routine operation took place in 2017 and 2018, so that more than 3000h of user beam have already been generated since 2019. During this time, a total of 20 cathodes (2 Cu, 12 Mg, 6 Cs2Te) were used, but no serious cavity degradation was observed. In this paper, we summarize the operational experience of the last 6 years of SRF gun operation, with special emphasis on the main RF properties of the cavity. This includes the evolution of QvsE, dark current, multipacting, but also mechanical properties such as Lorentz force detuning, helium pressure sensitivity as well as microphonics. The latter is closely connected to an active compensation by a so-called low-level RF feedback loop, which is also briefly presented.

Since its discovery in 2001, Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) has had the potential to become a material for cavity manufacturing. Having a transition temperature (Tc) at ~39 K, there is a potential to operate the cavity at ~20 K with cryocoolers. This will open up a variety of applications that benefit from compact high-efficiency superconducting accelerators. We have found a 2-step deposition technique as a viable technique for cavity coating, i.e., coating of a pure boron layer with chemical vapor deposition using a diborane gas in the first step and react it with Mg vapor in the second step. In this paper, we will show some recent results with up to Tc ~38 K using a small furnace and describe a new coating system under construction with a new 3-zone furnace to coat a 1.3-GHz single-cell cavity.

Jefferson Lab began a plasma processing program starting in the spring of 2019. Plasma processing is a common technique for removing hydrocarbons from surfaces, which increases the work function and reduces the secondary emission coefficient. Unlike helium processing which relies on ion bombardment of the field emitters, plasma processing uses free oxygen produced in the plasma to break down the hydrocarbons on the surface of the cavity. The residuals of the hydrocarbons in the form of water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are removed from the cryomodule as part of the process gas flow. The initial focus of the effort is processing C100 cavities by injecting RF power into the HOM coupler ports. We will then start investigating processing of C50 cavities by introducing RF into the fundamental power coupler. The plan is to start processing cryomodules in the CEBAF tunnel in the mid-term future, with a goal of improving the operational gradients and the energy margin of the linacs. This work will describe the systems and methods used at JLAB for processing cavities using an argon oxygen gas mixture. Before and after plasma processing results will also be presented.

For the superconducting radio frequency (SRF) 1.6-cell gun cavities (CV) developed at DESY, a similar fabrication and treatment process, as for the European XFEL 9-cell cavities is foreseen. The different length and geometry of these cavities lead to a number of adjustments to existing and the development of new tools. This paper covers the new designs and adaptations of a tuning tool, chemistry flanges, a wall thickness measurement device, as well as a new high-pressure rinsing spray head and an optical inspection camera for the 1.6-cell 1.3 GHz DESY SRF gun cavities under the development for the European XFEL.

A necessary condition for high SRF performances in thin film coated cavities is the absence of substrate defects. For instance, in the past, defects originated around electron beam welds in high magnetic field areas have been shown to be the cause of performance limitations in Nb/Cu cavities. Seamless cavities are therefore good candidates to allow an optimization of the coating parameters without the pitfalls of a changing substrate. In this work, we present the first results of two different methods to produce seamless cavities applied to 1.3 GHz copper single cells coated with thin Nb films by means of HIPIMS. A first method consists in electroplating the copper resonator on precisely machined aluminum mandrels, which are then dissolved chemically. As an alternative and a cross check, one cavity was machined directly from the bulk. Both cavities were coated with HIPIMS Nb films using the same coating parameters and the SRF performance was measured down to 1.8 K with a variable coupler to minimize the measurement uncertainty.

Inspection of the RF surface of cavities for the purpose of detecting surface anomalies has been well established, and is typically based on long working distance optical systems using on-axis camera and mirror systems to scan the cavity surface. In order to improve the systematic inspection of the full RF surface of large area cavities, a novel short working distance inspection system is being developed at CERN. This new system is based on a mechatronic robotic system to position that camera at normal incidence close to the cavity surface. To accommodate working distance fluctuations, and to provide increased depth of field resolution, the short working distance camera is coupled with a liquid lens focusing system, providing a programmable focusing function. Details of inspection bench design and first results are reported, as well as details on camera positioning optimisation and the proximity detection surveillance for collision-free scanning of the full-cavity surface.

Eight SRF cavities assembled in an accelerating module represent a building block of the particle linear accelerator based on TESLA SRF technology. DESY has two machines, European XFEL and FLASH. Both use almost same module and cavity types. During the module assembly many factors can deteriorate the cavity performance and cause a need for a repair action. Currently two European XFEL modules and two FLASH ones underwent reassembly procedures. The repair was not immediately successful on every of these modules and re-iterations did follow. The degradation causes were investigated. SRF modules were tested on both test-stands at DESY: AMTF and CMTB. The results of the described actions are presented and discussed.

The European spallation source (ESS), as a world-class high power proton accelerator facility, will be the first one to adopt 26 double spoke resonators (DSR) at its low energy section. As a new superconducting accelerating structure, these DSRs are therefore considered key technology and a challenge for the whole project. They will be the first DSRs in the world to be commissioned for a high power proton accelerator. Since 2019, FREIA Laboratory, Uppsala university, has successfully tested the first DSR prototype cryomodule and is now in charge of the acceptance tests of the ESS series cryomodules prior to installation in the tunnel. The cryomodule test, including cryogenic and RF testing, verifies operation of the cavities, couplers and cold tuning systems. This poster will present the test results for the ESS series spoke cryomodules, including preliminary statistics, experience in general.

Nb3Sn promises better RF performance (Q and Eacc) than niobium at any given temperature because of superior superconducting properties. Nb3Sn-coated SRF cavities are now produced routinely by growing a few microns thick Nb3Sn films inside Nb cavities via the tin vapor diffusion technique. Sn evaporation and consumption during the growth process notably affect the quality of the coating. Aiming at favorable surface characteristics that could enhance the RF performance, many coatings were produced by varying Sn sources and temperature profiles. Coupon samples were examined using different material characterization techniques, and a selected few sets of coating parameters were used to coat 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities for RF testing. The Sn supply’s careful tuning is essential to manage the microstructure, roughness, and overall surface characteristics of the coating. We summarize the material analysis of witness samples and discuss the performance of several Nb3Sn-coated single-cell cavities linked to Sn-source characteristics and observed Sn consumption during the film growth process.

In preparation for the 2023 RHIC sPHENIX experi-mental program the superconducting 56 MHz quarter-wave resonator cryomodule, used operationally for longitudinal bunch compression with up to 1 MV RF voltage, is being refit to accommodate an expected beam current of 418 mA per ring, an increase of ~1.5 relative to previous operation. The upgrades to the system include an improved fundamental mode damp-er, and dual function fundamental power and higher-order mode damper couplers. This paper will describe the preliminary testing, select subsystem changes and plans for testing the cryomodule prior to installation in the RHIC beam line in 2022.

For PIP-II project Fermilab is developing 650 MHz couplers to deliver up to 50 kW CW RF power to the superconducting low-beta (LB650) and high-beta (HB650) cavities. To meet project requirements two different designs of the couplers were proposed, one is conventional design with copper plated stainless steel walls. In second design (EM-shielded) a copper screen is used to shield stainless steel wall from electromagnetic field. For prototyping we built two couplers of each type and tested them at 50kW with full reflection at different reflection phases. In each test the assembly of two couplers were processed with DC bias up to +5 kV, starting with short pulses and ramping power up to 100 kW. Final run for 2 hours in CW mode at 50 kW to reach equilibrium temperature regime and qualify couplers. One pair of couplers was also processed without DC bias. Finally, all four couplers demonstrated full requirements and were qualified. Based on test results the conventional coupler with some modification was chosen as a baseline design. Modified version of coupler is now ordered for prototype of HB650 cryomodule. In paper we will discuss details of coupler processing and results

A heavy-ion accelerator facility is under construction for Rare Isotope Science Project(RISP) in Korea. Four types of super conducting cavities, QWR, HWR, SSR1, and SSR2 are developed to accelerate the ion beams. The QWR cryomodule is already installed in the tunnel. The HWR cryomodule is transport to the tunnel. Here, the status of HWR RF power coupler is presented. After the fabrication, the coupler is test with high power RF. The some of the test results are described.
