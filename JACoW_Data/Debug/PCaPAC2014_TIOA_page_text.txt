In this talk, Pieter Hintjens, founder of the ZeroMQ community, and author of the O'Reilly ZeroMQ book, will explain why we built ZeroMQ, how it works, and how to use it in your projects. Pieter will also touch on the ZeroMQ development process itself, a reusable model for other open source projects.
