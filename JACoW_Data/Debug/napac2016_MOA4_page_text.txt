In March 2014, a Laser Ion Source (LIS) was commissioned which delivers high brightness low charge state heavy ions for the hadron accelerator complex in Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Since then, the LIS has provided many heavy ion species successfully. The induced low charge state (mostly singly charged) beams are injected to the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) where ions are then highly ionized to fit to the following accelerator's Q/M acceptance, like Au32+. Last year, we upgraded the LIS to be able to provide two different beams into EBIS on a pulse-to- pulse basis. Now the LIS is simultaneously providing beams for both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). In the conference we present achieved performance and developed new techniques of the LIS.

We report on the status of the Fermilab accelerator complex. Beam delivery to the neutrino experiments surpassed our goals for the past year. The Proton Improvement Plan is well underway with successful 15 Hz beam operation. Beam power of 700 kW to the NOvA experiment was demonstrated and will be routine in the next year. We are also preparing the Muon Campus to commission beam to the g-2 experiment.

The JLEIC is proposed as a next-generation facility for the study of strong interaction (QCD). Achieving its goal luminosity of up to 1034 cm-2s−1 requires good dynamical properties and a large dynamic aperture (DA) of ~ ±10 σ of the beam size. The limit on the DA comes primarily from non-linear dynamics, element misalignments, magnet multipole components, and detector solenoid effect. This paper presents a complete simulation including all of these effects. We first describe an orbit correction scheme and determine tolerances on element misalignments. And beta beat, betatron tunes, coupling, and linear chromaticity perturbations also be corrected. We next specify the requirements on the multipole components of the interaction region magnets, which dominate the DA in the collision mode. Finally, we take special care of the detector solenoid effects. Some of the complications are an asymmetric design necessary for a full acceptance detector with a crossing angle of 50 mrad. Thus, in addition to coupling, the solenoid causes closed orbit excursion and excites dispersion. It also breaks the figure-8 spin symmetry. We present a scheme with correction of all of these effects.

Argonne National Laboratory is developing an Advanced Compact Carbon Ion Linac (ACCIL) in collaboration with RadiaBeam Technologies. The 45-meter long linac is designed to deliver up to 109 carbon ions per second with variable energy from 45 MeV/u to 450 MeV/u. To optimize the linac design in this energy range both backward traveling wave and coupled cell standing wave S-band structures were analyzed. To achieve the required accelerating gradients our design uses accelerating structures excited with short RF pulses (~500 ns flattop). The front-end accelerating structures such as the RFQ, DTL and Coupled Cell DTL are designed to operate at lower frequencies to maintain high shunt impedance. In parallel with our design effort ANL's RF test facility has been upgraded and used for the testing of an S-band high-gradient structure designed and built by Radiabeam for high pulsed RF power operation. The 5-cell S-band structure demonstrated 52 MV/m acceleration field at 2 μs 30 Hz RF pulses. A detailed physics design, including a comparison of different accelerating structures and end-to-end beam dynamics simulations of the ACCIL will be presented.
