The reactor of China initiative Accelerator Driven Sub-critical (CiADS) system has strict stability requirements to the driving superconducting Linac. From the previous operation experiences of intensity superconducting Linac at institute of modern physics (IMP), more than half of the beam trips were indicated to the SRF cavity phase unlock, which is related to the thin-walled low beta SRF cavity can not tolerate the helium pressure vibration and environment vibration. In recent years, IMP is developing low beta Nb/Cu cavities to provide high stability. The cavity was made from a thin layer of high purity niobium, then the outside of cavity was cast or coat of high purity copper layer. The Nb/Cu cavities have same SRF performance as bulk-Nb cavity and improved mechanical stability. The prototype cavities have been vertical tested couple times. A horizontally testing facility are under assembly for validating the integration performance of cavity, tuner, and coupler. The technical challenges to obtain high thermal conducting copper layer and high SRF performance niobium cavity will be report too.

The development of simpler, compact Superconducting RF (SRF) systems represents a new subject of research in accelerator science. These compact accelerators rely on advancements made to both Nb3Sn SRF cavities and commercial cryocoolers, which together allow for the removal of liquid cryogenics from the system. This approach to SRF cavity operation, based on novel conduction cooling schemes, has the potential to drastically extend the range of application of SRF technology. By offering robust, non-expert, turn-key operation, such systems enable the use of SRF accelerators for industrial, medical, and small-scale science applications. This presentation will provide an overview of the significant progress being made at Cornell, Jefferson Lab, and Fermilab (FNAL), including stable cavity operation at 10 MV/m. It will also introduce the primary challenges of this new field and their potential solutions, along with an overview of the various applications which could benefit the most from this technology.

This talk will discuss Fermilab’s recent progress in the surface engineering of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities geared toward producing simultaneously high quality factors and high accelerating gradients in cryomodules. We investigate possible microscopic mechanisms that drive improved performance by carrying out sequential RF tests on cavities subjected to low temperature baking. We compare performance evolution to observations made with material science techniques and find correlations with material parameters. We also discuss other key advancements that enable high gradient operation in cryomodules.

An innovative superconducting cavity topology has been recently proposed at CERN and at Lancaster University. It integrates longitudinal slots crossing perpendicularly the RF surface. The RF current lines run along the slots, inducing no perturbation of the accelerating mode. Thanks to this approach, the cavity can be built using halves or quadrants, which is well appropriate to precise manufacturing techniques. This configuration allows direct access to the RF surface, thus facilitating the surface preparation and thin film deposition process in the case of cavities based on Nb/Cu technology. The contact faces between the cavity parts are moved to the slots’ ends where the electromagnetic fields are extremely low, thus relaxing the constraints on the quality of the assembly joints. This paper covers the latest development of a 600 MHz slotted elliptical cavity called SWELL, which has been proposed as an alternative option for the FCC-ee RF system as well as a simplified SWELL version of a single cell 1.3 GHz elliptical cavity and a new 6 GHz split resonator made of two halves for superconducting thin film characterization.
