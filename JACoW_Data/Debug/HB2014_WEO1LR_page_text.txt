The coherent stability problem for proton and heavy ion beams is reviewed. For all but the highest energies space charge is the dominant coherent force. While space charge alone appears benign, its interaction with other impedances is less clear. The main assumptions used in calculations and their justifications will be reviewed. Transverse beam transfer function data from RHIC will be used to compare theory and experiment and some pitfalls will be discussed.

Recent experimental studies of the unstable head-tail modes in the ISIS synchrotron (RAL, UK) provided intriguing findings about the intensity thresholds for the instability/stability along the acceleration ramp for different bunch parameters in single-rf and dual-rf operation. We explain the role of space-charge and the related Landau damping using particle tracking simulations and an airbag-bunch theory, and relate the observations to the classical single-rf, no space-charge theories in order to identify the driving impedances.
