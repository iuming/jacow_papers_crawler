Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) is developing the single spoke resonator type-1 (SSR1) and type-2 (SSR2) for making superconducting linear accelerator 2 (SCL2). For optimizing of SSR1 and SSR2, we should research every aspects of superconducting cavity including RF performances and mechanical properties. This paper explains about modal analysis of SSR1 using FEM (finite element method) applying material properties of RRR300 niobium for bare cavity and STS316L for liquid helium jacket. Also, this paper shows the vibration test results with modal analysis.

Institute for Basic Science have been constructing Superconducting LINAC composed of quarter wave resonator (QWR) and half wave resonator (HWR). All QWR cavities have been completely fabricated and successfully tested to be assembled in QWR cryomodules. For now, we have been testing HWR cavities over 50%. For the testing period, the success rate experienced up and downs like we went through during the QWR tests. In many cases, we observed that some cavities did not reach requirement performance 2K although they showed high performance at 4K. We increased the temperature of heat treatment to cure the rapid Q drop at the high gradient and observed most cavities passed the test after heat treatment.

We have been developing a vertical electropolishing (VEP) method for niobium superconducting RF cavities using a novel setup that allows periodic flipping of the cavity to put it upside down in the VEP process. The purpose of using the novel setup named as flipping system is to achieve uniform removal and smooth surface of the cavity. Previously, we have already introduced the VEP system and showed the preliminary results of VEP performed with the flipping system. In this article, we report VEP results obtained with a nine-cell coupon cavity. The results include detail on coupon currents with I-V curves for coupons, and impact of the cavity flipping on removal uniformity and surface morphology of the cavity.

The international effort for the PIP-II project at Fermilab has been joined by INFN with its planned contribution to the PIP-II proton linac in the low-beta section. INFN-LASA is finalizing its commitment to deliver in kind the full set of the LB650 cavities, 36 plus spares resonators with 5-cell cavities at 650 MHz and geometrical beta 0.61. All cavities, designed by INFN-LASA, will be produced and surface treated in industry to reach the unprecedented performances required by PIP-II, qualified through vertical cold test at state-of-the art infrastructures and delivered as ready for the linac at the string assembly site. The status of INFN contribution to PIP-II, the development of infrastructures and prototypes as well as the ongoing activities toward the start of series production are summarized in this paper.

In this contribution we report on two topics regarding recent activities on 9-cell TESLA-type cavities at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). First, we give an overview of the inner surface treatments and vertical test (VT) results of four fine grain 9-cell TESLA-type cavities over the last one and a half years. Secondly, we report on the upgrade of the VT DAQ system at the Superconducting RF Test Facility (STF) at KEK. In this upgrade, most components of the VT system were integrated in an EPICS control system. Based on Control System Studio (CSS) and Python a new user interface was created, improving the workflow during and after VTs at STF.

A thermal mapping system is one of the most useful diagnostic tools to identify the mechanisms responsible of performance degradation in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Unlike most of the thermal mapping systems currently in operation, we want to develop a system for mapping copper coated SRF cavities. This thermal mapping system, based on contact thermometry, will operate in both superfluid and normal liquid helium for the study of thin film cavities on copper built at CERN. This paper describes the R&D studies to design and develop the system. The characterisation of thermometers and the validation of their thermal contact are presented. Thanks to the use of some heaters with the aim of reproducing the presence of heat losses in a SRF cavity, temperature profiles on a copper surface will be shown at different conditions of the helium bath. In addition, preliminary results on magnetic field sensors, based on the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, will be reported in view of their possible implementation in the thermal mapping system.

The Proton Power Upgrade (PPU) Project at Oak Ridge National Lab’s Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is currently under construction. The project will double the beam power from 1.4 to 2.8 MW. This is accomplished by increasing the beam current and adding seven new Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cryomodules. Each new cryomodule will contain four six-cell, beta 0.81, PPU style cavities. A quality assurance plan was developed and implemented for the procurement of 32 PPU cavities. As part of this plan, reference cavities were qualified and sent to Research Instruments Co. for the development and verification of process steps. Here we present the results from this plan to date.

In this report, we study the vertical test gradient performance and the gradient degradation between vertical test and cryomodule test for the 1.3 GHz LCLS-II cavities. We develop a model of peak gradient statistics, and use our understanding of the LCLS-II results and the changes implemented for LCLS-II-HE to estimate the expected gradient statistics for the new machine. Finally, we lay out a plan to ensure that the LCLS-II-HE cryomodule gradient specifications are met while minimizing cavity disqualification by introducing a variable acceptance threshold for the accelerating gradient.

The phase locking of the QWRs by dynamic phase control method in the superconducting linac at IUAC is done in a faster time scale. The slow frequency drifts (few hundreds of ms) are corrected using a niobium bellows tuner attached at the open end of the cavity. Initially, the tuners in the cavities were operated using helium gas. This system had the limitation of non-linearity, hysteresis and slow response due to which the cavities could not be phase locked at higher fields. To address this, piezo based tuning system was implemented in the cavities of the 2nd and 3rd linac modules. But due to space constraints, the same could not be used in the 1st linac module and the buncher modules. For them, the helium gas based system was continued, albeit with suitable modifications. The old flow control valves which operated with DC voltages were replaced with valves operating in pulsed mode and controlled by varying the duty cycle of the input pulses. The above mentioned limitations were overcome by using this PWM based technique and this enabled phase locking at higher gradients. This paper presents our operational experience with all the different tuning systems and their comparison.

INFN Milano - LASA contributes in-kind to the ESS ERIC Superconducting Linac supplying 36 cavities for the Medium Beta section of the proton accelerator. All the cavities have been mechanical fabricated, BCP treated and, for most of them, also qualified with vertical test at cold at DESY. We present the result of the cavities already qualified and delivered to CEA, discussing the lessons learnt so far. For remaining cavities, we discuss the actions taken and the plans foreseen to recover them to full specifications.

INFN-LASA is currently involved in the production of PIP-II low-beta cavity prototypes. The main challenge of this activity is to develop a state-of-the art surface treatment recipe on such cavity geometry, to achieve the high-Q target required for cavity operation in the linac. This paper reports the status of cavity treatments development and the first cold test results of a single-cell cavity. This cavity has undergone a baseline treatment based on Electropolishing as bulk removal step. Being this test successful, a strategy for pushing the cavities towards higher performances is here proposed.
