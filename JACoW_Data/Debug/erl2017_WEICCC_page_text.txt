Beam commissioning of the compact ERL (cERL) has been performed for the next generation ERL light sources such as a laser Compton gamma-ray source and a high power FEL for EUV lithography. The operational high voltage of the cERL DC gun has been limited to 390 kV due to failure of the ten segmented insulators. In November 2015, we installed an additional two segmented insulators on the top of the existing ten segmented insulators. In December 2015, we successfully performed high voltage conditioning up to 500 kV. We also found high voltage threshold for stable operation in a dc electron gun [1]. The cERL operational voltage has been 450 kV in maximum since then. We will present details of the high voltage upgrade and operational status at 450 kV of the cERL gun.

The ALICE (Accelerators and Lasers In Combined Experiments) accelerator was the first ERL to be operated in Europe. ALICE was used to drive the UK's first Free-Electron Laser, generating infra-red light in the 4 - 20 micron range which was used in the development of pioneering cancer diagnostics. This talk will present an overview of the ALICE DC GaAs photocathode gun, and review the measured performance of the gun when it was operated in to a dedicated diagnostics beamline.

CBETA, currently under construction, is a 4-pass, 40mA 150MeV ERL based on the proven Cornell ERL injector chain mated with an FFAG loop. The Cornell ERL injector program, originally intended for a large scale X-Ray light source, has been under development and operated for over 10 years. The status of the Cornell ERL injector is reviewed and its parameters compared with the challenges presented by the requirements for CBETA operation. The injector consists of a high voltage DC photocathode gun, a normal conducting buncher cavity, the superconducting injector cryomodule, followed by a splitter magnet that can transport the beam into either a diagnostics beamline or merge the beam into the CBETA ERL loop. The current status of the Cornell DC gun development program and its history will be reviewed. The performance of the injector cryomodule, capable of accelerating beams to 15MeV, will be discussed with a focus on the lessons learned from its operation. Finally the diagnostics beamline and the merger will be detailed along with the latest results from our low emittance beam studies.

Non-magnetized bunched electron cooling of ion beams during low energy RHIC operation requires electron beam energy in the range of 1.6-2.6 MeV, with an average current up to 45 mA, very small energy spread, and low emittance. A 400 kV DC gun equipped with a photocathode and laser system will provide a source of high-quality electron beams. During DC gun test critical elements of LEReC such as laser beam system, cathode exchange system, cathode QE lifetime, DC gun stability, beam instrumentation, the high-power beam dump system, machine protection system and controls has been tested under near- operational conditions [1]. We present the status, experimental results and experience learned during the LEReC DC gun beam testing.
