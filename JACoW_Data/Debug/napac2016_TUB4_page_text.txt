The Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes (MaRIE) project will provide capability that will address the control of performance and production of materials at the mesoscale. MaRIE will characterize the behavior of interfaces, defects, and microstructure between the spatial scales of atomic structures and those of the engineering continuum where there is a current capability gap. The mission need is well-met with an x-ray source, coherent to optimize disordered imaging capability, brilliant and high-rep-rate to provide time-dependent information, and high enough energy to see into and through the mesoscale of materials of interest. It will be designed for time-dependence from electronic motion (picosecond) through sound waves (nanosecond) through thermal diffusion (millisecond) to manufacturing (seconds and above). The mission need, the requirements, a plausible alternative reference design of a 12-GeV linac-based 42-keV x-ray free-electron laser, and the status of the project will be described.

The construction of the European XFEL is coming to an end. The linac tunnel will be closed and commissioning of the main linac will start. The status of the construction project is reviewed. Commissioning of the injector of the European XFEL was already performed in 2016 while construction of the main linac was continuing. The commissioning goals and achievements for the XFEL injector will be reviewed.
Proposed Speaker: W. Decking, DESY

We investigate a novel scheme for significantly increasing the brightness of x-ray light sources based on inverse Compton scattering (ICS) - scattering laser pulses off relativistic electron beams. The brightness of these sources is limited by the electron beam quality since electrons traveling at different angles, and/or having different energies, produce photons with different energies. Therefore, the spectral brightness of the source is defined by the 6d electron phase space shape and size, as well as laser beam parameters. The peak brightness of the ICS source can be maximized then if the electron phase space is transformed in a way so that all electrons scatter off the x-ray photons of same frequency in the same direction. We describe the x-ray photon beam quality through the Wigner function (6d photon phase space distribution) and derive it for the ICS source when the electron and laser rms matrices are arbitrary. We find the optimal uncorrelated electron beam phase space distribution resulting in the highest brightness of the ICS source for the simple on axis case as an example.

One of the primary goals of the superconducting undulator (SCU) program at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) is to achieve a high quality undulator magnetic field without the need for magnetic shimming to tune the device. Over the course of two years, two SCUs were designed, manufactured, assembled, and tested at the APS. Both SCUs were one meter in length with a period of 1.8 cm. After magnetic measurements of the first undulator were completed, several design changes were made in order to improve the quality of the undulator magnetic field. The design modifications were implemented during construction and assembly of the second SCU. The details of the design modifications along with a comparison of the magnetic measurement results will be described.
