The correction of the lattice nonlinearity of the storage rings is crucial for the enlargement of the dynamic aperture of the storage rings, which in general leads to the higher injection efficiency and the longer lifetime. At the SPring-8 storage ring, it is realized that the higher order coupling resonances are considerably excited. After the usual correction of the nonlinear dynamics in terms of the normal sextupole magnets, we suppress one of the resonances by using the skew sextupole magnets for the purpose of further improving the dynamic aperture. As a result of the correction by the skew sextupoles, the reckoned improvement of the injection efficiency and the lifetime is achieved. Furthermore, at the SPring-8 storage ring, it is observed that the error magnetic field of a particular insertion device (ID) excites the higher nonlinear coupling resonance of the skew octupoles, which remarkably deteriorates the injection efficiency. In order to correct the coupling resonance, we have installed the octupole magnets at the ID, by which we restore the injection efficiency.

As another important milestone towards the final goal to store an average current of 500mA, the average current of 200mA, distributed within ~1000 bunches, was recently achieved in the NSLS-II storage ring after the installation of three Damping Wigglers and four In-Vacuum Undulators. First measurements of the collective effects and instability thresholds, both in single- and multi-bunch mode, are discussed.

In view of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project, an extensive campaign is on-going in the CERN PS Booster (PSB) to study collective effects for the future operation with the 160 MeV injection from Linac4. In operation, the machine is running with uncorrected natural chromaticity. This paper focuses on the study of the effects of chromaticity on losses and beam blow-up.
