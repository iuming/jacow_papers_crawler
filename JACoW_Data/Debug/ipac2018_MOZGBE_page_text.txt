Charge strippers are almost inevitable for accelerations in heavy-ion accelerator complex. The fixed solid strip-pers including carbon-foil strippers are difficult to be used in on-going or upcoming new-generation in-flight RI beam facilities, e.g., RIBF (RIKEN, Japan), FAIR (GSI, Germany), FRIB (NSCL/MSU, US), HIAF (IMP, China) and RAON (RISP, Korea). The He gas stripper developed at RIBF is the first successful stripper significantly be-yond the applicable limit of the fixed carbon-foil strip-pers. We discuss the development of the gas strippers at RIBF and overview the related new-generation strippers being developed in the world.

Next-generation accelerator facilities will require multi-MW targets for producing their required experimental particles and beams. This talk will discuss a variety of critical target technology challenges resulting from these increasing power levels and describe research & development into new approaches to address these challenges.

Beam windows are usually used to isolate vacuum or other special environments, which is a key device for high-power accelerators. Graphene has extremely high thermal conductivity, high strength and high transparency to high energy ions. It is highly suitable for beam windows if the technology is allowable. This paper will discuss the primary tests of graphene films, including vacuum per-formance and thermal conductivity performance, as well as the simulated performance of an assumed graphene window.

Vacuum thin windows have been used in Fermilab's accelerators for decades and typically have been overlooked in terms of their criticality and fragility. Vacuum windows allow beam to pass through while creating a boundary between vacuum and air or high vacuum and low vacuum areas. The design of vacuum windows, including titanium and beryllium windows, will be discussed as well as fabrication, testing, and operational concerns. Failure of windows will be reviewed as well as safety approaches to mitigating failures and extending the lifetimes of vacuum windows. Various methods of calculating the strengths of vacuum windows will be explored, including FEA.

Funding: * The European Circular Energy-Frontier Collider Study (EuroCirCol) project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant No 654305.
In the framework of the EuroCirCol collaboration* (work package 4 "Cryogenic Beam Vacuum System"), the fabrication of 3 FCC-hh beam-screen (BS) prototypes has been carried out with the aim of testing them at room temperature at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) 2.5 GeV electron storage ring KARA (KArlsruhe Research Accelerator). The 3 BS prototypes will be tested on a beamline installed by the collaboration, named as BEam Screen TEstbench EXperiment (BESTEX). KARA has been chosen because its synchrotron radiation (SR) spectrum, photon flux and power, match the one foreseen for the 50+50 TeV FCC-hh proton collider. Each of the 3 BS prototypes, 2 m in length, implement a different design feature: 1) baseline design (BD), with electro-deposited copper and no electron-cloud (EC) mitigation features; 2) BD with set of distributed cold-sprayed anti-EC clearing electrodes; 3) BD with laser-ablated anti-EC surface texturing. We present here the results obtained so far at BESTEX and the comparison with extensive montecarlo simulations of the expected outgassing behavior under synchrotron radiation.
