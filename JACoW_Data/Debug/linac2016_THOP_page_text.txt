Nb3Sn has the potential to achieve superior performance both in terms of operating temperature (4.2 K vs 2 K) and accelerating gradient resulting in significant reduction in both initial and operating costs of SRF linacs. Cavity interior surface coatings are obtained by two-step vapor diffusion: nucleation followed by deposition. To gain more understanding of nucleation and its effect on the subsequent coating, we investigated the effect of varying parameters in a typical tin/tin chloride process. We report findings obtained by SEM/EDS, AFM, SAM and other materials characterization approaches.

The current state of the art processing of niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities with nitrogen diffusion is performed at 800C in a furnace with a partial pressure of approximately ~20 mtorr of nitrogen. Multiple studies have shown the bulk of the nitrogen absorbed by the niobium forms a thick (1-3 microns) non-superconducting nitride layer which must be removed to produce optimal RF results. The depth profiling of interstitial nitrogen and surface nitrides has already been probed using SIMS measurements. These measurements have also been modeled by extrapolating data from nitride growth studies performed at atmospheric pressure and temperatures above 1000 C (**). One open question is whether there is a diffusion zone at lower temperature in which the niobium will absorb nitrogen but not create a non-superconducting nitride layer; or is the absorption of nitrogen only possible by first forming a nitride buffer layer which then frees up nitrogen for absorption. A systematic study of absorption rate vs. temperature and correlated SIMS measurements needs to be performed to answer this question. We report on the absorption rate vs. temperature from 400 C to 900 C of cavity grade niobium with metallurgically flat witness samples. The witness samples surface depth profile of NbN via SIMS's will be presented and correlated to the absorption.**

Bead-pull measurements represent a final step in the fabrication process of an SRF cavity. These tests allow to characterize the flatness of the field profile in order to perform mechanical tuning if needed. These test has been always performed at room temperature, where material properties differ from the superconducting state properties. Still questions like mechanical deformation due to assymetrical thermal shrincage have not yet been answered experimentaly. In this paper, an upgrade of the former Cold-Bead pull system developed by HZB [1] is presented. This test stand is capable of holding a 9-cell Tesla cavity at LHe temperature providing a realistic insight to cavity parameters under realistic conditions. A copper test pill-box is placed in series with the multi-cell cavity in order to perform 1.8K calibration of the bead. Results will be presented on this paper and compared to electromagnetic simulations.

Linear accelerators, in particular those with a recirculating design and superconducting cavities, have to deal with the problem of Beam Break-Up (BBU). This instability can limit the maximum beam current in such accelerators. Knowing the effectiveness of prevention strategies is of great interest especially for future accelerators like energy recovery linacs (ERL) which aim for high beam currents. One option is to optimize the cavities and higher order mode couplers of those machines. In addition one may adapt the beam line lattice for further suppressing BBU. The superconducting recirculating accelerator S-DALINAC at the Technische Universität Darmstadt provides electron beams in c.w. for nuclear physics experiments since 1991. As the SRF components were never optimized for higher order mode suppression the S-DALINAC suffers from BBU at relatively low beam currents of a few μA. While those currents are sufficient for most nuclear physics experiments we can investigate BBU with respect to the beam optics. We will report on first measurements of threshold currents at different beam energies of the S-DALINAC. The results of a first test to increase the BBU limit by using skew quadrupoles will be presented.

The pre-injector of the ALBA Light Source is a Linac that delivers electrons up to a maximum energy of 125 MeV. It consist in a pre-bunching, a bunching and two accelerating sections feed by two 35 MW klystrons. Since July 2014, ALBA is operating in top-up mode, and the Linac is delivering 110 MeV electrons in multibunch mode every 20 minutes. Recently, new injection modes have been implemented and successfully tested. For one side, injection to the ALBA Booster is now also available with only one of the two klystrons in operation, and the Linac delivering a 67 MeV beam. On the other hand, the Linac single bunch mode has been integrated to the top-up operation application. By means of an algorithm, single bunch mode operation provides any kind of filling pattern in the ALBA storage ring, with single bunch shots injected to those buckets with lowest current. The performance of the Linac beam operated in these different modes is reported.

Tuning of the natural resonance frequency of an RF cavity is essential for accelerator structures to achieve efficient beam acceleration and to reduce power requirements. Typically operational cavities are tuned using phase comparison techniques. The phase measurement is subject to temperature drifts and renders this technique labor and time intensive. To eliminate the phase measurement, reduce human oversight and speed up the start-up time for each cavity, this paper presents a control scheme that relies solely on the reflected power measurements. A sliding mode extremum seeking algorithm is used to minimize the reflected power. To avoid tuning motor abrasion, a variable gain minimizes motor movement around the optimum operating point. The system has been tested and is fully commissioned on two drift tube linear accelerator tanks in TRIUMF's ISAC I linear accelerator. Experimental results show that the resonance frequency can be tuned to its optimum operating point while the start-up time of a single cavity and the accompanied human oversight are significantly decreased.

The beam commissioning of the linac for the boron neutron capture therapy of Ibaraki prefecture (i-BNCT) has been started. The accelerator of i-BNCT consists of the 3-MeV RFQ and 8-MeV DTL. The design of RF structure of them is based on the J-PARC linac. After the first demonstration of neutron production on December 2015, significant modifications to the linac were given in order to increase the operation stability and the beam power. The progress of the beam commissioning of the i-BNCT will be presented.

CERN has built a compact 750 MHz RFQ as an injector for a hadron therapy linac. This RFQ was designed to accelerate protons to an energy of 5 MeV within only 2 m length. It is divided into four segments and equipped with 32 tuners in total. The RFQ length corresponds to 5λ which is considered to be close to the limit for simple field adjustment using tuners. Nevertheless the high frequency results in a sensitive structure and requires careful tuning by means of the alignment of the pumping ports and fixed tuners. This paper gives an overview of the tuning procedure and bead pull measurements of the RFQ.

The original Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) of Half-Wave Resonator (HWR) for the Facility of Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) requires multipacting conditioning at operating RF power which is up to 5 kW Continue Wave (CW). Conditioning takes a lot of time and RF power, and its elimination is highly desirable. To significantly shorten the RF conditioning, we developed a multipacting-free coupler design. This paper reports the latest progress in the optimization and prototype tests of multipacting-free coupler. The choke structure is removed and coupler geometry is further modified to protect the coupler RF window from the electron bombardment. The comparison result of multipacting-free coupler with original coupler was performed on automatic conditioning system, which showed significantly time reducing for RF conditioning.

The proton driven plasma wake field acceleration experiment AWAKE at CERN will start at the end of this year. In 2017 an S-band electron injector producing bunches of a few ps length will be added to probe the wake fields stimulated by a driving proton beam. In the future this electron injector will have to be upgraded to obtain electron bunches with a length of 100 - 200 fs in order to demonstrate injection into a single bucket of the plasma wave and therefore sustainable acceleration with low energy spread. Target bunch parameters for the study are a bunch charge of 100 pC, 100 fs bunch length, an emittance smaller than 2 mm mrad and a beam energy of 100 MeV. The status of a study to achieve these parameters using X-band accelerator hardware and velocity bunching will be presented.

The injector Linac for Thomx * consists of an electron gun and S-band accelerating section. The RF gun is a 2.5 cells photo-injector able to provide electron bunches with 5 MeV energy. During the commissioning phase, a standard S-band accelerating section is able to achieve around 50 MeV corresponding to around 45 keV X-rays energy. Since the maximum targeted X-ray energy is 90 keV, the Linac design will provide a beam energy of 70 MeV. The Linac upgrade of the machine covers many different aspects. The purpose is to increase the compactness of the accelerator complex whereas the beam properties for ring injection are kept. A LAL Orsay-PMB ALCEN collaboration has been established. The program foresees the RF design, prototyping and power tests of a high-gradient compact S-band accelerating structure. To fulfill the technical specifications at the interaction point, the Linac must be carefully designed. Beam dynamics simulations have been performed for optimizing the emittance and the energy spread for the ring entrance. The best set of parameters together with the effect of the accelerating section to the beam dynamics at the end of the LINAC will be presented.
