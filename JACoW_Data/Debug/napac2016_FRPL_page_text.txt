We present the first experimental demonstration of a non-destructive technique that reveal the text of a carbonized and thus extremely fragile Herculaneum papyrus. Buried by the famous eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD, the Herculaneum papyri represent a unique treasure for humanity. Overcoming the difficulties of the other techniques we prove that x-ray phase contrast tomography technique can detect the text within scrolls, thanks to the coherence and high energy properties of a synchrotron source. This new imaging technique represents a turning point for the study of literature and ancient philosophy, disclosing texts that were believed to be completely lost. These and related applications require the development and implementation of compact, portable, bright, and coherent light sources. This talk describes a prime example for the need of such a source.
