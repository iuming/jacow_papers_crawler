The tunnel of the synchrotron light source PETRA III is build from separate segments that are joint together every 24 m. The normal conducting magnets heat up the tunnel when operating, which leads to an expansion of the concrete walls and floor introducing movements between the tunnels segments. Especially during warm-up periods after shutdowns, this results in a drift of the accelerator elements that is transferred on the circulating beam over a duration of days, weeks or months according to the length of the cool-down period. This paper shows that not only inside temperature effects but also seasonal temperature changes are relevant.

The current injector complex design of the FCC-e+e− project consists of e+/e− linacs, which accelerate the beams up to 6 GeV, a damping ring at 1.54 GeV, a pre-booster ring, accelerating the beam up to 16 GeV and a booster synchrotron ring integrated in the collider tunnel accelerating the beams up to the collision energies. The purpose of the damping ring is to accept the 1.54 GeV beam coming from the linac-1, damp the positron/electron beams and provide the required beam characteristics for the injection into the linac-2. In this presentation the current damping ring design is introduced and analytical calculations on various collective effect such as space charge, intra-beam scattering, longitudinal micro-wave instability, transverse mode coupling instability, ion effects, electron cloud and coherent synchrotron radiation, are presented.

The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) to be built will collide polarized electrons and ions up to 140 GeV center of mass with a time averaged polarization of 70% and luminosity up to 1034 cm-2 s-1. The EIC’s Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) will accelerate 2 polarized electrons bunches from 400 MeV to energies of 5, 10 and 18 GeV and inject them into the EIC’s Electron Storage Ring. The design of the RCS has progressed to accommodate a larger magnet free section for the detectors and to meet the space requirements of the RHIC tunnel. We present progress on full 6D spin tracking studies of the RCS with the updated lattice using the Zgoubi code to include magnet misalignments, field errors and corrections as well as radiative effects.

Dynamic aperture (DA) studies which are part of the ion Rapid Cycling Medical Synchrotron (iRCMS) lattice design have been undertaken. They are aimed at supporting on-going plans to launch the production of the six magnetic sectors which comprise the iRCMS racetrack arcs. The main bend magnetic gap is tight, so allowing smaller volume magnets and resulting in a compact ring. The DA happens to be commensurate with the mechanical aperture, thus tracking accuracy is in order. In that aim, DA tracking uses the OPERA field maps of the six 60 degree magnetic sectors of the arcs. Simulation outcomes are summarized here.

Work has been underway for some time to design a compact electron beamline utilising X-band linear accelerating structures in the new Melbourne X-band Laboratory for Accelerators and Beams (X-LAB). The original design utilised an S-band RF photogun as an input to a pair of high gradient X-band linear accelerating structures, but we have been motivated to investigate an alternative starting section to allow for initial testing. This will utilise a DC photogun and S-band accelerating structure similar to those used at the Australian Synchrotron. Simulation results incorporating space charge of a beamline composed of a DC photogun, S-band accelerating structures, and two high gradient X-band structures will be presented. These simulation results will be optimised for minimum emittance at the end of the beamline.

The linear accelerator FLUTE (Far Infrared Linac and Test Experiment) at KIT serves as a test facility for accelerator research and for the generation of ultra-intense coherent THz radiation. To achieve stable THz photon energy and optimal beam trajectory, the energy of the electrons emitted from the RF photo-injector must be stable. The accelerating voltage of the RF cavity has been shown to be a significant influencing factor. Here, we report on the development of a slow closed-loop feedback system to stabilize the RF power and thus the accelerating voltage in the RF photo-injector cavity. With this closed-loop feedback system the relative standard deviation of the RF power in the cavity can be improved by 8.5 %.

FLUTE (Ferninfrarot Linac- Und Test-Experiment) is a compact versatile linac-based accelerator test facility at KIT. Its main goal is to serve as a platform for a variety of accelerator studies and to generate strong ultra-short THz pulses for photon science. It will also serve as an injector for a Very Large Acceptance compact Storage Ring (VLA-cSR), which will be realized at KIT in the framework of the compact STorage Ring for Accelerator Research and Technology (cSTART) project. To achieve acceleration of electrons in the RF photoinjector and LINAC (from FLUTE) with high stability, it is necessary to provide stable RF power. For this goal, an upgrade of the existing RF system design has been proposed and is currently being implemented. This contribution will report on the updated RF system design and the commissioning status of the new RF system components.

The European XFEL has planned to perform pump-probe experiments using its X-ray pulses and THz pulses. A promising concept to provide the THz pulses with a pulse repetition rate identical to that of the X-ray pulses is to generate them using an accelerator-based THz source. The THz source requires a bunch compressor in order to manipulate the longitudinal phase space of the electron bunch to match with various options of THz radiation generation. This paper presents and discusses simulation study of the bunch compressor for the THz source.

The DAΦNE LINAC could produce bunches of electrons and positrons for the Beam Test Facility. The BTF is used usually for single particle test of detectors but is able to receive up to 1010 particles per second for irradiation test. The DAΦNE LINAC working point could be deeply changed to obtain low energy beam up to 160 MeV with a primary electron beam with enough pulse charge that fulfills irradiation test requirements. A current monitor was installed in the BTF to provide the particle charge per bunch at the users and a flag with the image acquisition system is in operation too, in order to provide a more precise characterization of the beam delivered for the experiments. In this paper the current status and activities of the BTF facility are described.

KEK electron positron injector linac has established simultaneous top-up injections in 2019 for 5 rings of SuperKEKB DR, LER, HER, PF ring and PF-AR as a base of the both elementary particle physics and photon science experiments even under a quite short beam lifetime. It improved the injection stabilities while the SuperKEKB broke the world record of the collision luminosity of the previous project KEKB. As the collision performance improves, the beam-beam effect makes the dynamic aperture shrink, and the beam lifetime reduces further. Thus, it became inevitable for the injector to be upgraded in order to resolve the contradictory improvements of higher charge and lower emittance of injection beams regarding beam wakefield till 2025. The upgrade plan is described including pulsed magnets, an energy compression system, accelerating structures, girders, positron generator and so on.

KEK electron positron injector linac initiated the injection operation into Photon Factory (PF) light source in 1982. Since then for 39 years, it has served for multiple projects, namely, TRISTAN, PF-AR, KEKB, and SuperKEKB. Its total operation time has accumulated 200 thousand hours on May 7, 2020. We are extremely proud of the achievement following continuous efforts by our seniors. The construction of the injector linac started in 1978, and it was commissioned for PF with 2.5 GeV electron in 1982. In parallel, the positron generator linac was constructed for the TRISTAN collider project. The slow positron facility was also commissioned in 1992. After the KEKB asymmetric-energy collider project was commissioned in 1998 with direct energy injections, the techniques such as two-bunch acceleration and simultaneous injection were developed. As the soft structure design of the linac was too weak against the great east Japan earthquake, it took three years to recover. Then the construction and commissioning for the SuperKEKB project went on, and the simultaneous top-up injection into four storage rings contributes to the both elementary particle physics and photon science.

We have studied the generation of the broadband THz pulse using a compact linear accelerator. The THz pulse is generated by control of an electron beam angle to Cherenkov radiation angle. In addition, we have succeeded in producing a quasi-monochromatic THz pulse by the spatially modulated electron beam by passing through a slit. This work aims to develop a detection system to elucidate the spectrum of the quasi-monochromatic THz pulse. To detect it stably in a noisy radiation environment, the stability of probe laser system for Electro Optic sampling and timing synchronization system are important. In this conference, the generation method of each THz pulses, the results of development of detection system, and future prospect will be reported.

The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is a synchrotron radiation source of ultrahigh brightness and under construction in China. Its accelerator system is comprised of a 6-GeV storage ring, a full energy booster, a 500-MeV Linac and three transfer lines. The Linac is a S-band normal conducting electron linear accelerator with available bunch charge up to 10 nC. The Linac installation has been finished at the end of May this year. The system joint debugging and device conditioning of the accelerating units, the power supplies, et al., are in progress. The beam commissioning will start in September 2022. This paper presents the status of the HEPS Linac and detailed introduction of the beam commissioning simulations and preparations.

A compact 10 MeV irradiation S-band electron linear accelerator has been proposed to carry out the electron radiation effect test of materials and devices. The Linac includes a standing wave pre-buncher, a traveling wave bunching accelerating structure. The traveling wave accelerating structure uses a 5MW klystron as RF source and provides electron beam energy 3.5-10MeV and average current 0.01-1mA. The required irradiation scanning frequency is very high, up to 100Hz and irradiation area is large (200mm×200mm). To meet the requirements, a novel beam scanning system, including one kicker for horizontal scanning and one magnet for vertical scanning, have been proposed. This paper presents the physical design of the 10MeV electron Linac and beam dynamics simulation results.

The CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) has been operating as a general user facility since 2017 providing beams for a wide range of user experiments. However, with its current optical layout, the beams available to users are not able to cover every request. To overcome this, a second experimental beamline has been proposed. In this paper we discuss the potential optics of the new line as well as detailing the hardware required for its construction. Branching from the current beamline, via a dogleg chicane that could be used for bunch compression, the new beamline would provide an additional in-air test stand to be available to users. The beamline before the test stand would utilise large aperture quadrupoles to allow the irradiation of large target areas or strong focussing of beams onto a target. In addition to this there would also be further in-vacuum space to install experiments.

Beams of uniform transverse beam profile are desirable for a variety of applications such as irradiation experiments. The generation of beams with such profiles has previously been investigated as a method of reducing emittance growth. These methods, however, often use complicated optics setups or short, femtosecond laser pulse lengths. In this paper, we demonstrate that if ultra low emittance is not the target of the photoinjector, it is possible to produce transversely uniform beam profiles using a simple Gaussian laser, with a bunch length of a few picoseconds, utilising space-charge effects only.

In this paper, we build on previous work where multi-objective genetic algorithms were used to optimise RF cavities using non-uniform rational basis splines (NURBS) to improve the cavity geometries and reduce peak fields. These optimisations can produce thousands of Pareto optimal solutions, from which a final cavity solution must be selected based on design criteria, such as accelerating gradient and power requirements. As all points are considered equally optimal, this can prove difficult without further analysis. Here we focus on the visualisation of the Pareto optimal points and the final solution selection process. We have found that the use of clustering algorithms and parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) provide the best way to represent the data and perform the necessary trade-offs between the peak fields and shunt impedance required to pick a final design.

The Linear accelerator system for natural rubber vulcanization has been developed at the Plasma and Beam Physics Research Facility, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. The main components of the accelerator system consist of a DC electron gun with a thermionic cathode, an RF linear accelerator, an RF system, a control system, and an irradiation system. The electron beam properties for natural rubber vulcanization are predicted from the beam dynamics simulation starting from a cathode to the titanium exit window. The electron beam generation and the particle in cell simulation inside the DC electron gun are performed using CST Studio Suit software. The electron distribution at the gun exit from the CST output is covered to be an input distribution of the ASTRA beam dynamics simulation program. The electron beam enters linac and is accelerated by RF filed inside the linac. The ASTRA simulation code is used to track electron trajectories including the space-charge interaction and the simulation starts from linac entrance to the exit windows. The electron beam properties for various conditions are evaluated and will be used for further simulations.

The Collimating Shielded Bellow (CsB) is designed to serve both as a flexible beam pipe connection between two adjacent superconducting cavities as foreseen in VSR DEMO and as a synchrotron light collimator to shield the down-stream cavity from synchrotron radiation. A convoluted inner RF shield was applied to prevent fundamental mode heating of the stainless-steel-made bellow in the cryogenic environment, making the such captured inner volume very difficult to access for inspection and cleaning. A first version of the device was successfully tested as part of the beam pipe of the synchrotron light source BESSY II under regular operation for more than a year. It suffered from an unfavorable long outgassing commissioning. Therefore a detachable design, allowing for rigorous inner surface preparation and cleaning, was built and recently installed in BESSY II. CsB version 2 design and experimental outcomes are described in the paper. First results indicated a significantly improved vacuum commissioning performance, which was confirmed later on.

The VSR DEMO module, recently under development at HZB, will house two 4-cell 1.5 GHz superconducting RF cavities with a particularly powerful HOM damping scheme based on five waveguide HOM absorbers per cavity. A magnetic shield made of high-permeable material is needed around the cavities in order to prevent the ambient magnetic field exceeding very few µT thereby causing considerable unwanted RF losses. The shield needs to accommodate the waveguides, the fundamental power coupler, two beam pipes, two He feed / return lines, the tuner and the support structures, whilst being manufacturable and mountable. The paper discusses those difficulties and presents the matured magnetic shield design. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the efficacy of the shield.

Funding: This work is supported by the BMBF project 05H18VKRB1 HIRING (Federal Ministry of Education and Research).
Two sets of thermal transition modules as a key component for the COLDDIAG (cold vacuum chamber for beam heat load diagnostics) refurbishment were manufactured, based on the previous design study. The modules are installed in the existing COLDDIAG cryostat and tested with an operating temperature of approximately 50 K at both a cold bore and a thermal shield. This cool-down experiment is a preliminary investigation aiming at beam heat-load studies at the FCC-hh where the beam screens will be operated at almost the same temperature. In this contribution, we report the fabrication processes of the mechanically robust transition modules and the first thermal measurement results with the refurbished COLDDIAG in a cryogenic environment. The static heat load in the refurbished cryostat remains unchanged, compared to that in the former one (4-K cold bore and 50-K shield with thin transitions), despite the increase in the transition thickness. It originates from the identical temperature at the cold bore and the shield, which can theoretically allow the heat intakes by thermal conduction and radiation between them to vanish.

The Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre HIT consists of a linear accelerator and a synchrotron to provide carbon ions, helium ions and protons for the clinical use as well as oxygen ions for experiments. The RF-KO slow extraction method is used to extract the particles from the synchrotron. To improve the spill quality of the extracted beam a new RF-signal was investigated which increases the R-value from 92.5% to 97,5%. The signal is a multiband RF signal broadened with a random BPSK at 3 frequency bands.

Storage ring has been improved to achieve high brightness of x-ray light source by making beam size and beam emittance smaller and enlarging the beam intensity. To achieve requirements such as a small beam emittance, the magnets need to have a larger magnetic field gradient and complex function with small aperture size. Since the complex structure and small beam size accompany with large errors in beam dynamics by high order field distortion of the magnets, it is important to measure the harmonics of the magnet in order to measure and improve it. Traditional field measurement methods such as hall probe and rotating loop have difficulty in measuring the harmonics of a magnet with a small aperture due to restrictions that physical size of the hall sensor and loop-card respectively. We developed Single Stretched Wire (SSW) method for the magnetic field measurement method on a small aperture magnet, in particular harmonics of the magnet. The system consists of a thin wire, accurate actuator system, and voltmeter. We describe the development of the SSW system and the result of the performance test by using our system in this paper.

IFMIF-DONES plant (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility ’ DEMO Oriented Neutron Source) will be an installation located in the south of Spain at Granada. Its objective is the fusion material testing by the generation of a neutron flux with a broad energy distribution covering the typical neutron spectrum of a (D-T) fusion reactor. This is achieved by the Li(d, xn) nuclear reactions occurring in a liquid lithium target where a 40 MeV at 125 mA deuteron beam with a variable rectangular beam footprint between 100mm x 50mm and 200mm x 50mm collides. The accelerator system is in charge of providing such high energy deuterons in order to produce the required neutron flux. The High Energy Beam Transport line is the last subsystem of the IFMIF-DONES accelerator and its main functions are to guide the deuteron beam towards the liquid lithium target and to shape it with the required rectangular reference beam footprint. The present work details the status of the HEBT engineering design, including beam dynamics, vacuum configuration, radioprotection, beam diagnostics devices and remote handling analyses performed detailing the layout and integration.

The European Spallation Source - ESS, has achieved its major construction in Lund, Sweden and is currently continuing in parallel to commissioning its first systems. ESS is characterized by installing and commissioning the most powerful proton LINear ACcelerator (LINAC) designed for neutron production and a 5MW Target system for the production of pulsed neutrons from spallation. The highly challenging and complex design of the Target and Neutron Scattering System (NSS) requires an in-depth analysis of the impact of the stringent manufacturing requirements and tight design tolerances. A campaign of several MECAmaster simulations was performed by ESS Target Division (TD) and Engineering and Integration Support (EIS) Division, focusing on those components that successively come close to their installation and are known for their criticality in terms of achieving the final installation tolerances. The aim of this current study is to investigate and statistically list the possibilities of eventual criticality on the assembly and installation processes, allowing for potential design optimization, tooling implementation and adjustment of the installation procedures.

The cryomodules for the superconducting Linac of the European Spallation Source ’ ESS are now arriving in a steady stream and the long-distance transport requirements are well understood. For the on-site transportation, handling and storage, several challenges have risen, including the intermediate storage of cryomodules before testing and/or installation. In comparison to the long-distance transports, the cryomodule on-site transports and respective handling until installation take place with specialised and limited transport protection. This requires additional measures and tests of those handling steps with extended diagnostics, to make sure that handling and transport refrains from damages on the last mile. Those handling procedures and executed tests will be described in this contribution.

In order to overcome several machine limitations, the SBDS has been relocated from LSS1 (Long Straight Section 1) to LSS5 during LS2 (Long Shutdown 2) with an important upgrade of the extraction kicker installation. An additional vertical deflection kicker magnet (MKDV) was produced and installed while the high voltage (HV) pulse generators have been upgraded by changing gas-discharge switches (thyratrons and ignitrons) to semiconductor stacks operating in oil. Furthermore the horizontal sweep generators have been upgraded to allow for a lower kick strengths. The controls, previously consolidated during LS1, went through an additional light consolidation phase with among others the upgrade of the trigger & retrigger distribution system and the installation of a new fast-interlocks detection system. This paper describes the commissioning without and with beam and elaborates on the measured improvements and encountered problems with corrective mitigations.

This paper discusses the commissioning of an X-band (9.6 Ghz) linearizer cavity at the UCLA PEGASUS beamline. The photoinjector gun and booster linac operate at S-band (2.856 GHz) and the linearizer cavity can be used to compensate temporally correlated energy spread inherited by the use of relatively long (many ps) laser pulses at the photocathode. The cavity is comprised of 7 cells for a total length of a 9.45 cm, and is installed in the drift section between the gun and the linac. It can be used to remove higher order correlations and minimize the beam energy spread of 13 ps long beams to 10-4.

The Siam Photon Source II storage ring is designed with low emittance. This new machine requires a high performance support system and a precise alignment capability. In order to meet these requirements, we have planned for construction of a half-cell component prototype. In the end of 2021, we completed the first girder prototype. This report will describe construction and manufacturing process.

A promising future for linear accelerators such as compact free electron lasers and electron positron colliders is higher gradient RF cavities enabled by cryogenic temperature operation. Breakdown rates have been shown empirically to be significantly reduced at low temperatures allowing for higher gradient. The surface physics associated with this observation is complicated and there many remain questions as to the exact phenomena responsible. One major figure of merit that can better inform the theory of breakdown is the RF surface resistivity which can be used to compute for example the RF pulse heating during operation. We then use techniques developed for previous Xband and Sband low power surface resistivity measurement by way of temperature dependent quality factor measurements to study Cband cavities. We first present a review of low temperature effects that may be responsible for the change in surface resistivity at low temperature. We then explain some of the initial measurements of these low power RF quality factor tests and compare them to a review some of the physical phenomena that could determine the low temperature surface effects.

Producing higher brightness beams at the cathode is one of the main focuses for future electron beam applications. For photocathodes operating close to their emission threshold, the cathode lattice temperature begins to dominate the minimum achievable intrinsic emittance. At UCLA, we are designing a radiofrequency (RF) test bed for measuring the temperature dependence of the mean transverse energy (MTE) and quantum efficiency for a number of candidate cathode materials. We intend to quantify the attainable brightness improvements at the cathode from cryogenic operation and establish a proof-of-principle cryogenic RF gun for future studies of a 1.6-cell cryogenic photoinjector for the UCLA ultra compact XFEL concept (UC-XFEL). The test bed will use a C-band 0.5-cell RF gun designed to operate down to 45 K, producing an on-axis accelerating field of 120 MV/m. The cryogenic system uses conduction cooling and a load-lock system is being designed for transport and storage of air-sensitive high brightness cathodes.

’In order to protect the future sPHENIX detector from spontaneous and asynchronous firing of one of the five RHIC abort kickers, mechanical relays were added to the triggering channel for each of them. The mechanical relays add several milliseconds to the delay between the detection of a failure or beam loss and the beam being safely disposed of. In order to account for this delay new inputs were included into the RHIC Machine Protection System to ensure detection of abnormal conditions as early as possible. These inputs include system diagnostics and beam measurements such as Beam Position Monitor signals. In this paper we detail the upgrades that will allow reliable operations with high intensity and high energy ion beams and the new detector as well as related operational challenges and how they were addressed.
