Harmonic Lasing & Gain Cascading: More Efficient X-Ray Free Electron Laser Oscillators

In this talk, I will focus on the recent theoretical progresses on X-ray free-electron laser oscillator (XFELO). A simplified one-dimensional theoretical model for fast XFELO optimization, harmonic lasing XFELO scheme which reduces the requiered beam energy for a interested radiation wavelength, and the gain-cascading scheme which may increase the pulse energy and the peak power of XFELO will be presented.

Temporal and Spatial Shaping of X-Ray Free-Electron Lasers

The x-ray free-electron laser is the brightest source of x-rays, with a peak brightness ten orders of magnitude higher than conventional synchrotron radiation sources. Much like conventional lasers, XFELs are extremely flexible machines and the properties of the x-rays can be controlled by accurately manipulating the lasing medium, i.e. the electron beam. In my talk I will discuss past and present research on shaping the temporal properties of the x-rays at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). I will discuss the two-color FEL modes and their applications in user experiments. Finally I will present our results on laser-shaping of x-ray pulses and our plans for attosecond operation in the soft x-ray regime.
