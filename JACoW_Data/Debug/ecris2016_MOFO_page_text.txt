In the framework of the SPIRAL1 upgrade under progress at the GANIL lab, the charge breeder based on a LPSC Phoenix ECRIS, first tested at ISOLDE* has been modified as to benefit of the last enhancements of this device from the 1+ / n+ community**. Prior to its installation in the middle of the low energy beam line of the SPIRAL1 facility, it has been tested at the 1+/n+ LPSC test bench to validate its operation performances. Charge breeding efficiencies as well as charge breeding times have been measured for noble gases and alkali elements. The experimental results demonstrated that the modifications done were on the right track leading the SPIRAL1 charge breeder to the top worldwide in terms of performances. The experimental outcomes have proved the strong interrelationship between the charge breeding efficiency and the charge breeding times which are still under active discussion.

An ECR charge breeder was developed some years ago as part of the Californium Rare Ion Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) program at Argonne National Laboratory. The charge breeding efficiency and high charge state production of the source were at the forefront of ECR charge breeders, but its overall performance as part of the accelerator system was limited by a pervasive stable ion background. Steps were taken to reduce the level of background contamination but met with limited success. As such, the ECR charge breeder was decommissioned in late 2015 and replaced with an EBIS charge breeder. The EBIS has demonstrated good breeding efficiency in an off-line installation, but the critical attribute of stable ion background has only begun to be characterized. We will present a comparison of the background levels from these two devices when coupled to the accelerator complex as well as possible solutions for background reduction in ECR charge breeders.

Since 2012, the INFN ion source group has been undertaking an intense activity on numerical modelling, in the European context of the EMILIE Project until 2014. The work concerns the study of the two main aspects influencing the performances of an ECR-based charge breeder: on one hand, the interaction of the injected 1+ beam with the ECR plasma; on the other hand, the energy coupling to plasma electrons by the microwave field set-up inside the plasma chamber. The first aspect has been addressed by developing a numerical code in a Matlab environment, able to reproduce the capture and thermalization of an ion beam by the ECR plasma. Equations describing the process have been implemented trough the Langevin formalism, including a plasma model of increasing complexity. The second aspect has been studied with the interplay between the 3D solver COMSOL Multiphysics and Matlab, describing the plasma through its fully 3D dielectric permittivity tensor. This paper describes the state-of-the-art of the work on both the fronts: it will show an overview of the beam-plasma interaction, offering some hints for the optimization of already existing devices or for the design of new ones.
