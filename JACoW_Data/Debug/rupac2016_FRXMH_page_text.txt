The present status of the project of NICA project, which is under construction at JINR (Dubna), is given in report. The main goal of the project is to provide ion beams for experimental studies of hot and dense strongly interacting baryonic matter and spin physics. The proposed physics program concentrates on the search for possible manifestations of the phase transitions and critical phenomena in the energy region, where the excited matter is produced with maximal achievable net baryon density, and clarification of the origin of nucleon spin. The NICA collider will provide heavy ion collisions in the energy range of 4 - 11 GeV at average luminosity of 1027 cm(-2)s(-1) for 197Au79+ nuclei and polarized proton collisions in energy range of 12 - 27 GeV at luminosity of > 1032 cm(-2)s(-1). Time-line of the complex construction, details of start-up configuration, challenges of beam parameters and luminosity preservation are presented.
