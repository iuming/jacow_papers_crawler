We have an upgrade plan of the SPring-8 storage ring to provide much more brilliant X-rays with a low-emittance electron beam. Since the upgraded ring requires a low-emittance injection beam, we are planning to timeshare the linac of the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facility, SACLA, as an injector for the upgraded ring. The SACLA linac delivers low-emittance and short-bunch electron beams to two XFEL beamlines with a 60 Hz repetition rate. The beam route is right now equally changed by a kicker magnet at a switchyard. The beam parameter is also optimized for each XFEL beamline by changing RF parameters pulse-by-pulse with simple software at this moment*. Since the number of beam injection shots to the storage ring is much less frequent than XFEL shots, one of the XFEL shots must be overridden by an injection with on-demand basis. In addition, the beam quality, such as 1 mm mrad normalized emittance, 10 fs bunch length and 10 kA peak current, must be maintained not to deteriorate the XFEL performance. Therefore, we have developed an on-demand beam route and RF parameter switching system with sufficient speed, precision and reliability. A beam route data is transmitted to each accelerator unit by a reflective memory network, and special software changes the parameters of each accelerator unit pulse-by-pulse according to the received data. We tested the on-demand switching system at a test bench and the SACLA linac. The beam parameters were appropriately controlled with a negligible failure rate. The user service of the beam injection from SACLA to SPring-8 is scheduled in 2020 and the on-demand switching system is almost ready for the time-sharing operation of multiple XFEL beamlines and a SPring-8 injection.

For more than 20 years Cryogenic Current Comparators (CCC) are used to measure the current of charged particle beams with low intensity (nA-range). The device was first established at GSI in Darmstadt and was improved over the past two decades by the cooperation of institutes in Jena, GSI and CERN. The improved versions differ in material parameters and electronics to increase the resolution and in dimensions in order to meet the requirements of the respective application. The device allows non-destructive measurements of the charged particle beam current. The azimuthal magnetic field which is generated by the beam current is detected by low temperature Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) current sensors. A complex shaped superconductor cooled down to 4.2 K is used as magnetic shielding and a high permeability core serves as flux concentrator. Three versions of the CCC shall be presented in this work: (1) GSI-Pb-CCC which was running at GSI Darmstadt in a transfer line, (2) CERN-Nb-CCC currently installed in the Antiproton Decelerator at CERN and (3) GSI-Nb-CCC-XD which will be operating in the CRYRING at GSI 2019. Noise, signal and drift measurements were performed in the Cryo-Detector Lab at the University of Jena.

A remote-controlled robot-car named ’PhotonBot’ was put into the TPS accelerator tunnel and is equipped with a 360 degrees LiDAR for SLAM and navigation, two cameras for perception and first-person view, and a thermal imaging system. The robot can be remotely controlled and can send data to a remote PC through Wi-Fi. With SLAM, it can go more freely without being restricted to a designated path. In order to ensure it can work continuously, there is a wireless charging station in case of a low battery.
