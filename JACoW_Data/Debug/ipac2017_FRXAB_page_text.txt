The development trend of future next-generation synchrotron light source storage rings is a compact lattice combined with small magnet apertures. This leads to important engineering challenges for the design and performance of a vacuum system because of lack of space, conductance limitation and high precision and stability positioning requirements. The speaker will review some possible solutions including the use of distributed pumping (NEG coating), distributed absorber (good thermal conducting material vacuum chamber wall), and distributed cooling (different water cooling channel design at the location where the synchrotron radiation hits the wall). In situ baking for NEG activation and precise installation will also be covered.
