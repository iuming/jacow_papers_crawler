Accelerator-driven subcritical fission in a molten salt core (ADSMS) can use depleted uranium or thorium as fuel and produce 1 GWe power while destroying the transuranics produced. ADSMS requires multiple proton beams of 800 MeV energy and 10 mA CW current. A strong-focusing cyclotron (SFC) is being developed that uses sector dipoles each configured as a flux-coupled stack, creating independent cyclotrons that can be integrated within a common footprint. This presentation will introduce a 4-stack SFC that can provide the beam power needed in an ADSMS core to destroy transuranics at the rate and proportion made in a commercial GWe power reactor while also producing 300 MWe of power, equivalent to a x5 energy amplifier.
