Recent developments of using lasers interacting with targets for the creation of ion beams offer a possibility to provide beams for radiobiology research. This research aims to precisely study the radiobiological effectiveness of charged particles on various cultures of cells, which is essential to inform next generation hadron therapy treat-ment plans. The Laser hybrid Accelerator for Radiobio-logical Applications (LhARA) has been proposed to use a laser driven beam, which will be captured and focused using Gabor Lenses. The beam will be then energy and momentum selected to create a beam for in-vitro cells studies or sent to a post-accelerator ring to create beam for in-vivo studies. The optical design of LhARA is pre-sented in this paper.

A semi-analytical 1D model is derived for the total energy loss of an electron beam with Gaussian density profile undergoing a passive plasma beam dump. The model is compared to a previous one, obtained for a half-sine longitudinal density profile. It is shown that both models agree if the beam density profiles are properly matched, and if their sizes are small in comparison to the length of wakefield decelerating length. The beam energy obtained from both models is compared to 1D PIC simulation results.

The idea of accelerating a beam in the accelerating structures based on an RF undulator poses great advantages in high current proton and ions accelerators. The accelerating structure based on an RF undulator uses a combinational wave that consists of the zeroth and the first harmonics for acceleration and focusing. This paper presents the development of this accelerating structure for acceleration of a beam. In particular, we show that this structure is an H-type resonator composed from five coupled sections.

520 MeV Cyclotron’s High-Power RF System has been in the state of continuous operation for over 50 years since its commissioning. This paper describes the recent upgrades of the RF System, the main goal of which was to improve reliability. Specially, we discuss the upgrades done to the RF Transmission Line (TL), the RF Power Amplifier (PA) components and their diagnostics tools. We upgraded the structure of Intermediate Power Amplifier (IPA), installed Solid State (SS) driver and are in the process of replacing tubes with a SS option for IPA and PA.

The plasma-wakefield acceleration technique is known to provide a very strong accelerating gradient (GV/m), up to three orders of magnitude higher than the conventional RF acceleration technique. The drawback is a relatively higher energy spread and especially a huge beam divergence at the plasma exit, leading to an irremediable and strong emittance degradation right after its extraction from the plasma for transferring it to an application or another plasma stage. In this article, we determine the criteria to be achieved so as to minimize this emittance growth after pointing out all the parameters involved in its mechanism. Then the plasma down ramp profile is studied in a typical configuration of the EuPRAXIA project at 5 GeV. It turns out that no specific profile is needed. For minimizing emittance growth at beam extraction, it is enough to optimize the ramp length so that the Twiss parameter γ is minimized. Finally the design of an optimal transfer line allows showing that the emittance growth can be contained to less than 10% in realistic conditions when transferring the beam to a free electron laser.

The dedicated accelerator R&D facility SINBAD at DESY hosts the AXSIS accelerator. This project is funded by the European Research Council to develop a compact source for attosecond serial X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy. For that purpose, in one of the arcs of the SINBAD facility and the neighboring laser labs, an accelerator research site is being constructed where a fully THz-driven accelerator (electron gun and linac, < 30MeV) will be installed. The current status of the hardware installation of the electron beam accelerator is presented. Furthermore, the required radio-protection measures and maximum beam parameters are presented. In this contribution the commissioning plans and the staging of the beam operation for the accelerator complex will be shown and discussed in detail.

The design and study of plasma-based accelerators relies typically on costly 3D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations due to the complexity of the laser-plasma and beam-plasma interactions. However, under certain assumptions, more efficient and simple models can be implemented to describe the dynamics of the accelerated beams. Wake-T (Wakefield particle Tracker) is a new code for analytical and numerical particle tracking in plasma-based accelerators which is orders of magnitude faster than conventional PIC codes. This allows for fast parameter scans and is well suited for the initial design and optimization of these novel accelerators.

Laser-driven hollow core photonic bandgap (PBG) fibers were proposed by Lin in 2001 as high-gradient accelerators. The central defect in the transversely periodic lattice supports an accelerating mode for synchronous acceleration in the ultra-relativistic regime. The optical frequencies in such dielectric laser accelerators motivate a sensitivity and tolerance study to overcome manufacturing imperfections. Finally we discuss the propagation characteristics of Lin-fibers and find that small-bandwidth (~ns) pulses would be needed for efficient acceleration over longer distances.

While Laser Plasma Accelerators produce beams with the high output energy required for FELs, up to now the relatively high energy spread has prohibited FEL lasing. Therefore it was proposed to replace the normal FEL undulators by Transverse Gradient Undulators (TGUs). For a first, small scale test of the TGU concept, a 40 period prototype high gradient superconductive TGU was built at KIT and will be tested with beam at the ARES-linac in the new accelerator test facility SINBAD (Short Innovative Bunches and Accelerators at Desy) at DESY. The proposed tests are summarized in this paper.

The Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) carries out studies of beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA). The facility possesses a flexible photocathode laser beam shaping system and a variety of diagnostics including a high-resolution dipole spectrometer and an rf deflector which enables the observation of the longitudinal phase space of electron beams after their passage through a plasma. Two plasma sources are available: a gas discharge plasma cell and a photoionized lithium vapor plasma cell. Studies at PITZ include investigations of the self-modulation instability of long electron beams and the high transformer ratio, i.e., the ratio between the maximum accelerating field behind the drive beam and the decelerating field within the beam. This overview includes the experimental results and plans for future experiments.

The self-modulation instability (SMI) of long (in respect to the plasma wavelength) charged particle beams passing through plasma enables the use of currently existing high energy charged particle beams as drivers for plasma wakefield accelerators. At the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) the SMI of electron beams is studied *, **. An enhanced experimental setup includes a plasma channel of variable length which allows to investigate in details the development stages of the SMI by measuring the instability growth rate and phase velocity as a function of propagation distance in the plasma. In this contribution we present the experimental setup improvements, first measurement results and supporting beam dynamics simulations.

FLASHForward, the exploratory FLASH beamline for Future-ORiented Wakefield Accelerator Research and Development, is a European pilot test bed facility for accelerating electron beams to GeV-levels in a few centimeters of ionized gas. The main focus is on the advancement of plasma-based particle acceleration technology through investigation of injection schemes, novel concepts and diagnostics, as well as benchmarking theoretical studies and simulations. Since the plasma wakefield will be driven by the optimal high-current-density electron beams extracted from the FLASH L-band Superconducting RF accelerator, FLASHForward has been in a unique position for studying and providing insight for the design study of next-generation light source and high energy physics facilities such as EuPRAXIA*. Summary of these findings and their broader impact is discussed here.

Laser plasma accelerators with external injection of an RF-generated electron beam, providing high accelerating field gradients and increased control over the electron beam injection process, are promising candidates for production electron beams matching the requirements of modern user-applications. The experiments are planned at the SINBAD (Short INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility to test this acceleration technique in the context of the ATHENAe (Accelerator Technology HElmholtz iNfrAstructure) project. In this paper we present numerical studies on the effect of the transverse electron beam jitter on the final quality of a sub-femtosecond, 0.75 pC, 100 MeV electron beam accelerated to 1 GeV energy in the plasma wakefield driven by a 196 TW, 5 J laser pulse.

Nowadays the electron beams produced in plasma-based accelerators (PBAs) are of sufficient energy for multi-GeV applications. However, to allow PBAs to be usable for demanding applications such as Free-Electron Lasers, the quality and stability of plasma-accelerated beams have to be improved. We present numerical studies on accelera-tion of an RF-generated electron beam with a charge of 0.8 pC and initial mean energy of 100 MeV to GeV energies by a laser-plasma accelerator. This acceleration scheme is planned to be tested experimentally within the framework of the ATHENAe (Accelerator Technology HElmholtz iNfrAstructure) project at the SINBAD (Short INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility at DESY, Hamburg. Electron beam injection, acceleration and extraction from the plasma are investigated through start-to-end 3D simulations. The effect of the injection phase on the accelerated beam quality is investigated through tolerance studies on the arrival-time jitter between the electron beam and the external laser.

There is a matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe that can not be explained by the Standard Model of particle physics. To resolve that problem additional CP violating phenomena are needed. A candidate for an additional CP violating phenomenon is a non-vanishing Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of subatomic particles. Since permanent EDMs violate parity and time reversal symmetries, they also violate CP if the CPT-theorem holds. The Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigation (JEDI) Collaboration works on a direct measurement of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of protons and deuterons using a storage ring. The JEDI experiment requires a small beam orbit RMS in order to measure the EDM. Therefore an ongoing upgrade of the Cooler Syncrotron (COSY) is done in order to improve the precision of the beam position. One of part of this upgrade is to determine the magnetic center of the quadrupoles with respect to the beam position monitors. This can be done with the so called beam-based alignment method. The first results of the beam-based alignment measurement performed in February 2019 will be presented.

EuPRAXIA (European Plasma Research Accelerator with eXcellence In Applications) is a conceptual design study for a compact European infrastructure with multi-GeV electron beams based on plasma accelerators. The concept foresees two main experimental sites, one at INFN in Frascati and one at DESY in Hamburg. In Frascati, an RF injector based on S-band and X-band technology (electron energy up to 1 GeV) will be constructed and used as a drive beam for beam driven plasma acceleration (PWFA) with final electron beam energies up to 5 GeV. At DESY, the focus will be on laser driven plasma acceleration (LWFA) and an RF injector based on S-band technology (electron energy up to 240 MeV) or alternatively a plasma injector (electron energy up to 150 MeV) can be used before the beam is injected into the plasma accelerator for external LWFA and acceleration up to 5 GeV. A single stage approach based on LWFA with internal injection will also be pursued in a second beamline. User areas at both sites will provide access to FEL pilot experiments, positron generation, compact radiation sources, and test beams for HEP detector development. This contribution discusses facility space considerations for the future plasma accelerator research infrastructure of EuPRAXIA.

The Horizon 2020 Project EuPRAXIA (European Plasma Research Accelerator with eXcellence In Applications) is producing a conceptual design report for a highly compact and cost-effective European facility with multi-GeV electron beams accelerated using plasmas. EuPRAXIA will be set up as a distributed Open Innovation platform with two construction sites, one with a focus on beam-driven plasma acceleration (PWFA) and another site with a focus on laser-driven plasma acceleration (LWFA). User areas at both sites will provide access to FEL pilot experiments, positron generation and acceleration, compact radiation sources, and test beams for HEP detector development. Support centres in four different countries will complement the pan-European implementation of this infrastructure.

A racetrack-shape fixed field induction accelerator (RAFFIA) for high energy giant cluster ion acceleration was proposed in 2015*. The RAFFIA employs 4 bending magnets with gradient in the main pole face and reverse field strip at its front side which generate strong focusing in both planes. Beam dynamics properties of the RAFFIA of 140 MeV for C-60 have been evaluated by linear optics. The result has been confirmed with a help of 3D macro-particle computer simulation**. It is identified that the issue of COD generated from field non-uniformity associated with a finite size of the bending magnet is inherent. The programmed COD correction by steering magnets are discussed as well as the importance of uniformity in the magnet field profile. So far it has been unknown what beam current is acceptable in the RAFFIA. In order to estimate space-charge effects in the RAFFIA under design, the 2D core (σ) evolution equation has been derived from the envelope equation perturbed by space-charge fields. Resonant structures and chaotic motion in the phase space of (σ,σ’) have been clarified as a function of beam current. Those results were justified by macro-particle tracking based on a renormalized transfer matrix approach***. As a result, it turns out that the 8+ C-60 beam of 200 uA is acceptable.

The ADIGE (Acceleratore Di Ioni a Grande carica Esotici) injector of the SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species) project is now in an advanced phase of installation. Its main components have been designed following particular needs of the project: first, an Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR)-based Charge Breeder (SPES-CB), to boost the charge states of the radioactive ions produced at SPES and allow their post-acceleration. Then, a stable 1+ source and a complete electrostatic beam line to characterize the SPES-CB. Finally, a unique Medium Resolution Mass Spectrometer (MRMS, R=1/1000), mounted on a high voltage platform downstream the SPES-CB, to clean the radioactive beam from the contaminants induced by the breeding stage. This contribution describes the status of the injector, in particular the installation of the platform housing the MRMS, the access and safety system adopted and the first beams to be extracted from the stable 1+ source.

The ALPI linac at INFN-LNL was substantially refur-bished in 2018, especially in view of its use as secondary accelerator for exotic species in the framework of the SPES project. In particular: 10 magnetic triplets were replaced with higher gradient ones; two cryomodules with quarter wave resonator were moved from the PIAVE injector to ALPI, so as to make them available both for exotic and stable beams; the cryogenic plant was renovat-ed; the whole linac, its injector and its beam lines were eventually realigned via LASER tracking (LT). The ex-pected outcome of the refurbishment project is a larger beam transmission (crucial for the efficient transport of the unavoidably low current exotic beams) and improved overall reliability so as to further extend the lifetime of an already 25 years old machine. The hardware commission-ing of this new configuration will be reported.

All-dielectric electromagnetic band gap (EBG) waveguides structures promise significant improvement of accelerating gradient of laser-driven acceleration with the potential to miniaturize the accelerator itself. In this work we study photonic crystal structures designed for acceleration of relativistic electrons. We explore the performance of the all-dielectric EBG accelerating waveguide structures thanks to full wave electromagnetic simulations of couplers and accelerating waveguides. The characteristic interaction impedance, accelerating gradient and all the key parameters that are typically used to characterize linear accelerators are evaluated and used to compare the properties of the accelerating mode field distribution in different geometries.

We are going to demonstrate the principle of crab crossing in laser-Compton scattering which creates head-on collision in a pseudo manner to enhance the intensity of laser-Compton X-ray. When the electron beam is tilted by half of the collision angle, the scat-tered X-rays becomes the largest. Calculation shows that more than threefold luminosity will be achieved in our system and could be larger luminosity depending on the beam parameters. The intensity of scattered light can be efficiently enhanced by using a collision laser with high intensity, high quality and ultrashort pulse duration. Thus, we have introduced a regenera-tive amplifier using ceramics thin-disk as a collision laser and developed a dedicated laser system. In this conference, we will report on our laser system and results of crab crossing laser-Compton scattering.

Pulse radiolysis is one of the methods to elucidate radiation chemical reactions. In order to elucidate that, not only high temporal resolution, but also a light source with a broad spectrum band is required. A Xe flash lamp is mentioned as a light source having a broad spectrum band. However, in measurement using a Xe flash lamp, the time resolution is limited to the nanosecond order. In this research, we have developed supercontinuum light as a light source that enables picosecond time resolution and has a broader spectrum band. In this paper, we developed a light source using an Er doped fiber laser for pulse radiolysis measurement, and report the results and future prospects here.

SuperEKKB phase II commissioning has been finished in the summer of 2018. By use of Ytterbium doped fiber and Nd:YAG hybrid laser system, 2.3 nC electron beam with low emittance has been achieved at the end of linac, which is generated by RF gun. The electron beam is injected and stored in High Energy Ring successfully. Basing on these operation experiences, the Nd:YAG laser system will be used for the early stages of SuperKEKB phase III commissioning. After the update of laser system during 2018 summer maintenance, about 5.3 nC electron charge is generated by RF gun. Beside this, the laser spatial and temporal reshaping experiment has been being done in order to realize the electron beam with low emittance and low energy spread. Meanwhile, a perspective towards the next step Yb:YAG laser system is also introduced in this paper.

Efficiently creating beams of spin-polarized positive muons with energies between eV and keV (so-called slow muon beams) is important for further development and application of muon spin rotation, relaxation, and resonance techniques. One existing moderation method involves the use of wide-band-gap materials as moderators such as rare gas solids and solid nitrogen thin films (band-gap energy between 11 eV and 22 eV). Based on this moderation method, we have studied the use of helium gas as a moderator, with the goal of producing the slow muon beam more efficiently. Because of helium’s high (24.6 eV) ionization energy and because the cross section for muonium formation is suppressed in helium gas, we expect the production of slow muons using helium gas to be highly efficient.

The beamline design philosophies and simulation re-sults of the decay muon on Experimental Muon Source (EMuS) are reported in this paper. The beamline is com-posed of solenoids to keep large acceptance, and has been optimized for 45, 150 and 450 MeV/c decay muon re-spectively according to the π spectra optimization results from target station. Decay muons from 45 to 150 MeV/c are designed for μSR applications, and 150 to 450 MeV/c are designed for muon imaging, which is unique on the high momentum perspective. Negative muons from 45 to 150 MeV/c are designed for muonic applications. The momentum range of decay muon is tuneable between 45 and 450 MeV/c.

This paper focuses on the exploration into the potential of heavy ion beams for the production of the charged pions/muons within different energy ranges which is widely needed for fundamental and applied research. The investigation is performed for the different kinds of beams involving 1H , 4He, 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 136Xe with medium energy within the range of 0.5~2.5 AGeV and high energy of 10 AGeV. Three kinds of typical target configurations, thin graphite plate, long tungsten rod and medium thickness nickel block are adopted. For comparison, graphite and nickel are also used for the long rod geometry. Basically, most of the conventional charged pion/muon beams production cases including surface muon, low energy decay muon, medium energy pion/muon for neutrino beam and highly forward energetic muon are involved and the feasibility of heavy ion beam for these cases is analyzed.

Proton beam with energies less than 10 MeV, <1% energy spread, several to tens of pC charge can be stably produced and transported in Compact LAser Plasma Accelerator (CLAPA) at Peking University. The CLAPA beam line is an object-image point analysing system, which ensures the transmission efficiency and energy selection accuracy for proton beams with initial large divergence angle and energy spread. A spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) is produced with high precision beam control, which is essential for cancer therapy. Other primary application experiments based on laser-accelerated proton beam have also been carried out, such as proton radiograph, stress testing for tungsten, irradiation of semi-conductor sensor to simulate the space irradiation environment and so on.

Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) is a powerful tool to investigate the dynamic structure with temporal scale of 100 femtoseconds and spatial scale of atomic length. To achieve high quality diffraction patterns, the transverse emittance and the longitudinal length of electron bunches should be reduced. MeV UED, using photocath-ode RF gun instead of traditional DC gun, is being developed to produce high quality electron bunches with lower emittance and shorter length. We are developing a MeV UED facility based on a 1.4 cell photocathode RF gun that can provide higher acceleration gradient at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the MeV UED is pro-posed with typical parameters of the system, as well as the ASTRA simulation results of optimization.

This paper reports the study and demonstration of a new variable temporal shaping method capable of generating linearly polarized picosecond laser pulses with arbitrary predefined shapes, which are highly desired by various applications including low emittance high brightness electron bunch generation in photocathode guns. It is found that both high transmittance and high stability of the shaped pulses can be achieved simultaneously when crystals are set at specific phase delay through the fine control of the crystal temperature. Such variable temporal shaping technique may lead to new opportunities for many potential applications over a wide range of laser wavelengths, pulse repetition rates, time structures and power levels, etc. In addition, a new double-pass variable shaping method is also proposed and could significantly simplify the shaper structure and reduce the cost.

We demonstrate a simple way to introduce a femtosecond pre-pulse with adjustable intensity and delay without using an additional compressor to enhance laser-driven proton acceleration. Targets with different thicknesses were shoot at normal incidence by varying the pre-pulses. Experimental results show that significant enhancement on the proton energy can be achieved when the intensity of pre-pulse is optimized. Density profile of preplasma was obtained by bydrodynamic simulations. PIC simulations reveal that the preplasma generated by a femtosecond pre-pulse can increase the intensity of main pulse.

The Cyclotron Auto-Resonance Accelerator (CARA) is a novel concept of accelerating continuous-wave (CW) charged-particle beams. This type of accelerator has ap-plications in environment improvement area and genera-tion of high-power microwaves. In CARA, the CW elec-tron beam follows a gyrating trajectory while undergoing the interaction with a rotating TE11-mode RF field and tapered static magnetic field. The cylindrical cavity oper-ating at TE11p-mode is adapted to accelerate electron beam. The cavity size is optimized to obtain a beam with designed energy, then a design method of the TE11p-mode acceleration cavity is described here. Moreover, regard-less of space charge effect, several particle-tracking simu-lations of CARAs are showed.

Plasma based accelerators (PBAs) have a proven capability to generate high energy electron beams with ultrashort duration (~ 10 fs) and high peak current (~ 10 kA), which opens the opportunity for compact free electron lasers. To meet the requirements of such challenging applications, controllable injection is highly needed to produce high-quality and highly stable electron beams. As we know, the beam parameters，including the current profile, strongly depend on the injection process. To explore the underlying physics and optimize beam parameters in PBAs, a temporal characterization is highly required for different injection schemes. Based on coherent transition radiation(CTR) method, the preliminary experiment to measure beam temporal profiles from both self-injection and ionization injection schemes in a single-shot mode has been performed at Tsinghua University. And the simulations using the similar experimental parameters have been performed to interpret the different injection processes, which show some agreement with the experimental results, especially for the features of bunch durations

A Li-8 beam facility has been developed at KOMAC. A target/ion source (TIS) was fabricated, and heating experiment of a target heater and a surface ion source was conducted at off-line test site. Also, beam optics components were developed. They are utilized in Li-8 beam line that electrostatic steerers to adjust misalignment of the beam, Einzel lens to focus beam and Wien filter to separate Li-8. Furthermore, a high-energy beta-ray telescope detector was developed as a dedicated beta-decay spectrometer for diagnostics of the Li-8 beam. The TIS, the beam optics and the beam diagnostics are installed in a target room (TR104) of the 100-MeV proton linac. An experiment of the proton beam transportation into TR104 and the TIS heating experiment were conducted separately. Finally, the on-line test of TIS has been conducted to generate Li-8 beam and examine the beam optics and the diagnostics.

Recent success in beam-driven plasma wakefiled acceleration scheme with two proton bunches propagating through a hollow plasma channel* stimulates the research activity in this area. In this report, we investigate possibilities for additional tuning the structure of the accelerating field by the external magnetic field applied. The structure of surface waves at the channel boundary is of interest, and special attention is paid to the field characteristics that are essential for the wakefield acceleration method (amplitude of the accelerating field, the structure of the deflecting field) and the possibilities of controlling these characteristics by means of the external field.

Radiation detectors based on microchannel plates (MCP) are used for measurements of the SASE process of the European XFEL. Detectors operate in a wide dynamic range from the level of spontaneous emission to the saturation level (between a few nJ and 25 mJ) and in a wide wavelength range from 0.05 nm to 0.4 nm for SASE1 and SASE2 and from 0.4 nm to 4.43 nm for SASE3. Photon pulse energies are measured by the MCPs with an anode and by a photodiode. The MCP imager measures the photon beam image with a phosphor screen. Three MCP detectors are installed, one behind each SASE undulator (SASE1, SASE2, and SASE3). Calibration and first experiments with the MCP detectors are under discussion.

The ISOLDE Facility at CERN * is the world’s leading facility for the production of radioactive ion beams (RIBs) using the ISOL (Isotope Separation On-Line) method, providing RIBs at energies from 30 keV to 10 MeV/u for a wide variety of experiments. To improve on its capacity to deliver RIBs further from stability, the EPIC project takes full advantage of recent investments by CERN to upgrade the LHC injectors **. In particular, the new Linac4 and the PS Booster upgrade allow expanding the scope of ISOLDE by providing higher radioactive ion beam intensities further from stability. Sharing the proton-beam between two target stations that simultaneously feed the low-energy and high-energy beam lines will more than double the annual available beam time for experiments. To take further advantage of enhanced beam time, CERN and the ISOLDE collaboration also aims to studies installing a storage ring behind the HIE-ISOLDE post-accelerator to allow the storage of cooled exotic ion beams and thus opening up new possibilities in the fields of astrophysics, fundamental symmetry studies, atomic physics and nuclear physics.

In the AWAKE experiment, the electron beam is used to probe the proton-driven wakefield acceleration in a 10 m long rubidium vapor source. Electron bunches are produced using an RF-gun equipped with a Cs2Te photocathode illuminated by an ultraviolet (UV) laser pulse. To generate the UV laser beam a fraction of the infrared (IR) laser beam used for ionization of rubidium is extracted from the laser system, time-compressed to a picosecond scale and frequency tripled using nonlinear crystals. The transport line of the laser beam over the 20 m distance was built using rigid supports for mirrors and air-evacuated tube to prevent any possible beam pointing instabilities due to vibrations and air convection. Construction of the UV beam optical system enables appropriate beam shaping and control of its size and position on the cathode, as well as time delay with respect to the IR pulse, i.e. with respect to the plasma wakefield seeder. In this paper, we present the design of the UV beam line and results of its commissioning regarding IR/UV conversion, beam pointing stability, and means of beam control and monitoring.

Pre-alignment is a key challenge of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) study. The requirement for CLIC main beam quadrupole (MBQ) alignment is positioning to within 1 µm from target in 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) with ± 3 mm travel. After motion, the position should be kept passively while the system’s fundamental frequency is above 100 Hz. Cam movers are considered for the task. Traditionally they are used for the alignment of heavier magnets with lower accuracy and stiffness requirement. This paper presents a new CLIC prototype cam mover with design emphasis on the fundamental frequency. A finite element method (FEM) model predicts the mode shapes and eigenfrequencies of the system and can be used for further improving the design. Experimental modal analysis (EMA) of the prototype shows that the prototype’s fundamental frequency is at 44 Hz. It also validates the FEM model.

This study explores the benefits of extending the monitoring and remote alignment concept, proposed in the HL-LHC baseline, to additional components of the matching sections of the HL-LHC. The objective was to evaluate the benefits in terms of equipment performance and new opportunities for system simplification. In collaboration with the HL-LHC Working Group on Alignment, critical input parameters such as ground motion, manufacturing, assembly, and alignment tolerances, have been quantified. Solutions for the selected, manually aligned compo-nents have been investigated with the particular focus on vacuum design, mechanical design and the new alignment concept compatible with reliability and maintainability requirements. In this context, collimators and masks are key elements to be included in the extended alignment system. Their supporting systems will integrate the concept of on-line monitoring sensors and an actuator based, remote alignment platform. The full remote alignment of components will provide a positive impact to the machine operation reducing the need of human intervention in the tunnel and providing enhanced flexibility to perform the required alignment adjustment as part of an operational tool for the HL-LHC.

In the accelerator domain, the safe and easy alignment of components located in radioactive areas, is a main concern. The position of devices, such as magnets and collimators, has to be adjusted in a fast and ergonomic way to decrease the ionizing dose received by the personnel. Each equipment type has its own unique set of requirements such as the weight, or the desired position accuracy. The two opposite approaches are, on one hand, a simple and time-consuming manual adjustment, using regulating screws and shims, and, on the other hand, the use of precise and expensive automatic positioning stages and platforms. In the frame of the High Luminosity LHC project, in order to fulfill the safety and technical requirements of alignment for lightweight components, a standardized system is under development. It will provide easy, low-cost and fast adjustment capability for several types of components that could be embarked on it. This paper describes the design, the study and the test results of such a universal adjustment solution. The engineering approach, the lessons learned, the issues and the mechanical components behavior are presented.

Objective of ESCULAP project is the experimental study of Laser-Plasma Acceleration (LPA) of relativistic electron bunch from photo-injector in 10 cm length plasma cell *. In parallel, numerical tools have been developed in order to optimize the setup configuration and the analysis of the expected results. The most important issue when dealing with numerical simulation over such large interaction distances is to obtain a good accuracy at a limited computing cost in order to be able to perform parametric studies. Reduction of the computational cost can be obtained either by using state-of-the-art numerical technics and/or by introducing adapted approximation in the physical model. Concerning LPA, the relevant Maxwell-Vlasov equations can be numerically solved by Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods without any additional approximation, but can be very computationally expensive. On the other hand, the quasi-static approximation ***, which yields a drastic reduction of the computational cost, appears to be well adapted to the LPA regime. In this paper we present a detailed comparison of the performance, in terms of CPU, of LPA calculations and of the accuracies of their results obtained either with a highly optimized PIC code (FBPIC **) or with the well known quasi-static code WAKE ***. We first show that, when considering a sufficiently low charge bunch for which the beam loading effect can be neglected, the quasi-static approximation is fully validated in the LPA regime. The case of a higher bunch charge, with significant beam loading effects, has also been investigated using an enhanced version of WAKE, named WAKE-EP. Additionally, a cost evaluation, in terms of used energy per calculation, has also been done using the multi-CPU and multi-GPU versions of FBPIC.

The KLEVER experiment is proposed to run in the CERN ECN3 underground cavern from 2026 onward. The goal of the experiment is to measure BR(KL -> pi0 nu nu), which could yield information about potential new physics, by itself and in combination with the measurement of BR(K+ -> pi+ nu nu) of NA62. A full description will be given of the considerations in designing the new K12 beamline for KLEVER, as obtained from a purpose made simulation with FLUKA. The high intensities required by KLEVER, 2·1013 protons on target every 16.8s, with 5·1019 protons accumulated over 5~years, place stringent demands on adequate muon sweeping to minimize backgrounds in the detector. The target and primary dump need to be able to survive these demanding conditions, while respecting strict radiation protection criteria. A series of design choices will be shown to lead to a neutral beamline sufficiently capable of suppressing relevant backgrounds, such as photons generated by pi0 decays in the target, and Lambda -> npi0 decays, which mimic the signal decay.

The East Area is one of the intensely used facilities at CERN, now serving for over 56 years beams to more than 20 user teams and experiments for about 200 days of running each year. Besides primary proton and ion beams for the irradiation facilities IRRAD and CHARM, mixed secondary beams of hadrons, electrons and muons within a range of 0.5 GeV/c to 12 GeV/c are provided. The CERN management approved an upgrade and renovation of the full facility to meet reliably future beam test and physics requirements. We present new, flexible beam optics that will assure better purity of the secondary beams, even with the new possibility of highly pure electron, hadron or muon beams. The upgrade also includes a pulsed powering scheme with energy recovering power supplies and new laminated magnets that will reduce both power and cooling requirements. The renovation phase started already and first beams in the new facility will be delivered from 2021 on.

Physics Beyond Colliders is an exploratory study aimed at exploiting the full scientiﬁc potential of CERN’s accelerator complex up to 2040 and its scientiﬁc infrastructure through projects complementary to the existing and possible future colliders. Within the Conventional Beam Working Group (CBWG), several pro-jects for the M2 beam line in the CERN North Area were proposed, such as a successor for the COMPASS experiment, a muon programme for NA64 dark sector physics, and the MuonE proposal aiming at investigating the hadronic contribution to the vacuum polarisation. We present integration and beam optics studies for 100-160 GeV/c muon beams as well as an outlook for improvements on hadron beams, which include RF-separated options and low-energy antiproton beams and radiation studies for high intensity beams. In addition, necessary beam instrumentation upgrades for beam particle identiﬁcation and momentum measurements are discussed.

For many decades the CERN North Area facility at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) has delivered secondary beams to various fixed target experiments and test beams. In 2018, two new tertiary extensions of the existing beam lines, designated "H2-VLE" and "H4-VLE", have been constructed and successfully commissioned. These beam lines have been designed to provide charged particles of both polarities in the momentum range from 0.3 GeV/c to 12 GeV/c. During the design phase, multiple simulation tools and techniques have been employed to optimize the tertiary beam line layout in terms of particle production, transverse beam dynamics and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. In this paper, a comparison of the simulated performance and the first measurement results obtained during the commissioning phase are presented.

Externally injected electrons are captured and accelerated in the plasma wake of a self-modulated proton beam at the Advanced Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE) at CERN. The energy distribution of the accelerated electron beam is measured using a dipole spectrometer in combination with a scintillator screen, with two upstream quadrupoles providing energy-dependent focusing. Measuring the vertical beam size variation with horizontal position along the scintillator screen, and therefore energy, results in an effective quadrupole scan permitting single shot vertical geometric emittance measurements. Limitations of the method due to effects such as imperfect beam focusing and finite resolution are explored via simulations using the beam tracking code BDSIM.

CERN has a unique set of secondary beam lines, which deliver particle beams extracted from the PS and SPS accelerators after their interaction with a target, reaching energies up to 400 GeV. These beam lines provide a crucial contribution for test beam facilities and host several fixed target experiments. A correct operation of the beam lines requires precise simulations of the beam optics and studies on the beam-matter interaction, radiation protection, beam equipment survival etc. BDSIM combines tracking studies with energy deposition and beam-matter interaction simulations within one software framework. This paper presents studies conducted on secondary beams with BDSIM for the beam lines T9 and T10. We report the tracking analysis and the energy deposition along the beam line. Tracking analysis validation is demonstrated via comparison to existing code.

The Cockcroft Beamline is being designed to transport 1 GeV electrons from a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) to an undulator at the Scottish Centre for the Application of Plasma-based Accelerators (SCAPA) in Glasgow, UK. To demonstrate undulator radiation in the X-ray spectral region and potentially free electron laser (FEL) gain, electrons should be transported between the LWFA and the undulators with high fidelity. In this paper we present the design of an adjustable beam line to transport LWFA electrons to the undulator for a range of energies, from 0.5 GeV to 1 GeV, while preserving the electron beam properties and matching the undulator-beam coupling.

The problem of optimisation of beamline structures is studied, from the point of view of multi-objective genetic algorithms. While this approach has been successfully used in the exploration of potential particle accelerator lattices, it has never been applied to beamline design. In this paper, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NGSA II) is used to optimize a structure where photons are assumed to propagate through the optical elements according to the wavefront model as implemented in SRW. It is shown that appropriate objective functions can help to set up an interesting set of parameters, with competitive computational resources compared to the traditional approach. Examples illustrating this optimization method are shown in the context of DIAMOND.

The AWAKE experiment at CERN recently demonstrated the world’s first acceleration of electrons in a proton-driven plasma wakefield accelerator*. Such accelerators show great promise for a new generation of linear e-p colliders using ~1-10 GV/m accelerating fields. Effectively driving a wakefield requires 100-fold self-modulation of the 12 cm Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) proton beam using a plasma-driven process which must be care-fully controlled to saturation. Previous works have modelled this process assuming azimuthal symmetry of the transverse spatial and momentum profiles **, ***. In this work, 3D particle-in-cell simulations are used to model the self-modulation of such non-round beams. Implications of such effects for efficiently sustaining resonant wakefields are examined.

The generation of high-brightness beams with ultra-low emittance using the plasma photocathode technique has gained significant traction in recent years. The practical execution of a combined plasma wakefield acceleration section and a laser injected typically requires a dual gas medium for precision ionization of low and high ionization thresholds. The concept can be partially simplified in experiment by replacing the plasma wakefield acceleration component with a dielectric wakefield acceleration scheme, sacrificing field gradient but maintaining low emittance beam generation. In this paper, we describe the progress on the design of a hybrid scheme, using laser injection in a gas medium within a dielectric wakefield accelerator structure. The proof-of-concept experiment is planned to take place at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator.

Advanced fabrication and prototyping of metallic RF structures play a fundamental role in advancing accelerator technologies particularly at mm-wave and THz frequencies. With the scaling of the RF structure up to these frequencies, conventional fabrication techniques do not achieve the required accuracy and tolerances. Improved manufacturing techniques including diffusion bonding, brazing or clamping split-block geometries produce high quality structures when successfully implemented. However, in most schemes the resulting gap and irregularities at the iris result in a local field enhancement which is not desirable for high-gradient operation. Development of advanced split-block braze technique for THz accelerators was required for high quality miniature accelerators. A new braze technique was developed for W-band structures to control the flow of braze alloy, enabling fabrication of the first high-gradient brazed structures at mm-wave frequencies. This fabrication process has the potential to overcome consistent fabrication defects around the cell iris. Thin spacers were used to set the final gap between blocks during the braze process; while braze foil thickness is varied with minimal impact on the resulting frequency. To demonstrate the robustness of this technique, testing after the various manufacturing steps was done to monitor and track frequency change throughout the process. This technique is further pushed to produce G-band RF structures, operating at 300 GHz.

Probing structural dynamics at atomic spatial and ultrashort temporal scales reveals unprecedented details of fundamental behavior of nature, allowing for better understanding of intricate energy-matter interaction occurring at such scales. Developing state-of-the-art technology to access these details entails utilizing X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), ultrafast electron diffraction (UED), and advanced electron microscopes. In particular, ultrafast diffraction science received growing attention thanks to innovation in sources, detectors and instrumentation in general. Within this context, interest in laser-generated THz wave-matter interaction has recently emerged as a new regime for controlling electrons with high temporal precision. Previously, the SLAC UED team has demonstrated attosecond electron metrology using laser-generated single-cycle THz radiation, which is intrinsically phase locked to the optical drive pulses, to manipulate multi-MeV relativistic electron beams. Here we demonstrate further steps towards achieving ultrafast timing resolution that utilizes femtosecond electron bunches. The proposed setup allows for compressing electron beam bunches down to a femtosecond using interaction with high field single-cycle THz pulses. We demonstrate a novel design of a dispersion-free parallel-plate tapered waveguide that provides focusing of THz pulses achieving >100 MV/m field strength at the interaction point as measured by electro-optical sampling for ~7 μJ of incoming THz pulse energy. The structure is being designed and built for bunch compression experiments using the SLAC UED facility.

Emerging accelerator technology at mm-wave and THz frequencies has recently shown notable progress. Indeed, metallic and dielectric accelerating structures at THz frequencies are plausible candidates toward miniaturization of accelerators. RF breakdown in such structures is a major factor limiting their performance. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of RF breakdown physics in mm-wave accelerating structures is needed, which includes understanding of dependencies of the breakdown rate on geometric, electromagnetic and material properties. In this work we report on high power tests of a 110 GHz single-cell standing wave accelerating structure powered by a 1 MW gyrotron. The RF power is coupled from the gyrotron into the accelerating structure with a Gaussian to TM01 mode converter through a quasi-optical setup. We demonstrate coupling of 10 ns, 100s of kilowatt pulses into the structure using a fast switch and achieving ~150 MV/m accelerating gradients. Measurements of RF signals and field-emitted currents allow for complete comprehensive of the high-gradient behavior of W-band structures, including breakdown probability.

Corrections of Klystron Output Pulse in SW Accelerator Testing
3772

Accelerator testing requires a good control over the shape of the used pulse. Usually, flat or stepped square pulses are used for testing. Producing a perfectly flat output pulse from the klystron can be challenging especially for testing standing wave (SW) accelerators. SW accelerator structures reflect high power back to the klystron and no isolator can withstand the reflected power level for high gradient operation. This results in a distorted output pulse from the Klystron. We developed a modulation technique that solves this problem using a negative feedback loop. This technique can also overcome a poor modulator performance and other system errors. The pulse correction feedback was successfully implemented for high gradient SW accelerator testing at SLAC and KEK.

Transverse jitter tolerances are considered for beam-driven plasma accelerators. A simple model for jitter transfer from the drive to witness beam is developed and concrete examples are studied for: high-brightness witness bunch injectors; high-energy boosters for FEL’s; and future Linear Colliders. Compared with an existing PWFA driver facility ([*,**]), the calculated tolerances are 18X ’ 170X tighter than achievable, even considering any upgrades with existing technology.

We present initial measurements from a UCLA-Argonne Wakefield Accelerator collaborative plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) experiment aimed at demonstrating the dependence of transformer ratio on longitudinal beam shape. The transformer ratio or the ratio between the maximum acceleration of the witness and the maximum deceleration of the drive beam, is key to a mature, beam-based, plasma wakefield accelerator design. Utilizing the unique capabilities of the emittance exchange (EEX) beamline, we may obtain transformer ratios in excess of six in PWFA. We present the experimental beamline design, relevant beam diagnostics and explore preservation of the longitudinal beam profile.

As a part of the Argonne Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) 85H21, a collaboration between Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), we have designed, constructed, and tested a thin-film-diamond monochromator for the PAL X-ray Free-Electron-Laser (PAL-XFEL) hard x-ray self-seeding project*. The mechanical design of the PAL-XFEL diamond crystal hard x-ray self-seeding monochromator is based on the APS design of a diamond-crystal monochromator for the LCLS hard x-ray self-seeding project** with enhanced diamond crystal holder for two thin-film-diamond crystals with thicknesses of 30 microns and 100 microns***. The customized high quality thin-film-diamonds and special graphite holder were provided by the Technological Institute for Super-hard and Novel Carbon Materials of Russia (TISNCM)****, and tested at the APS***. An in-vacuum multi-axis precision positioning mechanism is designed to manipulate the duo-thin-film diamonds holder with resolutions and stabilities required by the hard x-ray self-seeding physics. Mechanical specifications, designs, and preliminary test results of the diamond monochromator are presented in this paper.

ISOLDE is a facility dedicated to the production of a large variety of Radioactive Ion Beams. The facility is located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). In addition to two target stations followed by low energy separators, the facility includes a post-accelerating linac with both normal conducting (REX) and superconducting (HIE-ISOLDE) sections. The HIE-ISOLDE section consists of four cryomodules with five SRF cavities each that need to be phased individually. In this paper, we will describe the procedure and the software applications developed to phase each of the cavities as well as improvements that will be introduced in the near future to reduce the time it takes to complete the process.

The Isotope mass Separator On-Line DEvice (ISOLDE) based at CERN, is a Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) facility where rare isotopes are produced from 1.4 GeV-proton collisions onto a target then are manipulated and transported to user experimental stations for studies, notably in the domain of nuclear physics. The RIB of interest is delivered to a dedicated experimental station either at low (up to 60 keV) or high energy (MeV/u range) after acceleration through the recently completed REX/HIE-ISOLDE linac upgrade. The first stage of the linac consists of normal-conducting IH and spiral-resonators and is preceded by a Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). A description of the experimental setup and the specifications of the RFQ will serve as an introduction for the presentation of recent results about the transmission efficiency of the RFQ. Furthermore, a newly developed technique will be demonstrated, that allow the capture of ion beam intensities below the femto-Ampere range. In fine, a measurement of the longitudinal acceptance of the RFQ will be included.

Running CERN complex of accelerators and infrastructure requires the seamless collaboration of many people, such as operators, experts and people-on-call to name only a few. Distributed in teams from different groups, it is important to centralise schedule planning and operational information and make this information readily available. In BE/OP these tasks are handled by two applications to manage shift work as well as piquet and expert services. At the beginning of 2018, a project was started to replace the ageing web piquet application. While collecting requirements we realised a more flexible application was needed to suit a broader set of customers, and to offer a more generic, people- oriented tool. The new planning tool consists of two separate applications: The Planning Manager, which is used to organise work schedules of a teams members, and to keep each group’s planning up-to-date, coherently, and visible to all involved. The Planning Dashboard, which allows any user to create a customised view of the available services they use.
