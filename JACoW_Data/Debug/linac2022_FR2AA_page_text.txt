Exponential gain of extreme ultraviolet radiation at 27 nm was observed in a free-electron laser (FEL) driven by the electron beam generated in a laser-driven plasma wake-field accelerator at SIOM (China, Shanghai). This experiment, showing that the quality of the beam generated in the laser plasma accelerator is sufficient to sustain amplification in a FEL, represents a long awaited fundamental milestone. In addition, more recently a first demonstration of FEL exponential gain was also achieved in a beam-driven plasma accelerator at a wavelength of 830 nm at INFN (Frascati, Italy). The performances of these FELs cannot match those available in existing FEL facilities. However, these experiments represent a technological breakthrough and pave the way for FELs driven by extremely compact accelerators.

There have been recent advances in the use of linacs for radiotherapy with the development of protontherapy linacs becoming commercial and the recent development of linacs for Very High Energy Electron (VHEE) therapy. This talk covers the medical advantages of such linacs as well as what the future requirements will be.
