The new 4th generation synchrotron light source USSR (Ultimate Source of Synchrotron Radiation) is under development at National Research Center "Kurchatov Institute" now. The full-scale 6 GeV storage ring is considered as the main part of USSR light source. Beam dynamics simulations shows that this ring, with 7BA magnet lattice, can provide the horizontal beam emittance close to (50-70) pm*rad. Currently, circumference of storage ring is about 1300 m because of considering magnets without combined functions. The general concept of the storage ring, its magnetic lattice and first beam dynamics simulation results will be discussed.

The new project of 4th generation synchrotron light source called Ultimate Source of Synchrotron Radiation (USSR) today is under development at NRC Kurchatov Institute. A number of Russian institutions also take part in this project: NRNU MEPhI, NRC "Kurchatov Institute" - ITEP and others. The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) is the main international collaborator of the project. It is proposed that USSR include both a storage ring and soft FEL, and one linac will be used for injection in the storage ring and as a driver for the FEL. The preliminary design of 6 GeV storage ring with transverse emittance of 50-70 pm*rad is done. The general concept of the top-up linac is proposed and the beam dynamics is simulated. The injection system and the vacuum systems are studied. Current results of the USSR R&D will be presented in this report.

The multipole superconducting wiggler was designed, fabricated and successfully installed and tested on DELTA Synchrotron Radiation Source. The wiggler represents a multipole magnet with alternating high magnetic field of 7 Tesla along movement of particles in storage ring. The magnet is immersed into liquid helium of a special cryostat with working temperature of ~4.2K. The wiggler consists of 22 pairs of poles superconducting magnet with 18 full field poles, 2 with a three-quarter field strength and 2 with one-quarter field poles. The magnet array produces a sin-like magnetic field variation on the magnetic axis of the device with first and second field integrals close to zero. The Dortmund Electron Accelerator (DELTA, Germany) operated at 1.5 GeV synchrotron radiation source requires a superconducting wiggler as an insertion device for three x-ray beamlines with photon energies up to more than 30 keV. The wiggler has a period of 127 mm, magnetic field of 7 Tesla and the length from flange to flange of 2.2 m operated with zero boil-off mode. The conception and main approaches for the design of the magnetic and cryogenic system as well as the main parameters and the test results of new 7 Tesla superconducting wiggler for DELTA synchrotron light source are presented.

VEPP-5 Injection Complex control system software is based on CX framework. In the course of 2015-2016 it was upgraded to version 4. K500 transport channel (delivering e+/e− beams to VEPP-2000 and VEPP-4) has switched to CXv4 in 2017-2018. CXv4 is a redesign from the ground up, built in a modular fashion with maximum flexibility in mind. CXv4 server is easily configurable via plaintext files. Additionally, server configuration can be autogenerated from a database containing high-level information on the facility. CXv4 server supports artificial "mailbox" channels, which are used by high-level facility management software for intercommunication. For client-level access, a high-performance binding for Python exists, and visual programming tools are being developed.

The dispatching system for audio and video exchange between various U-70 technological subsystems has been developed. The system architecture employs the original approach to the online streaming using the method of progressive download over HTTP. The system can be built on the basis of any one-pass decoding media container. Ogg format with Theora/Vorbis codecs has been chosen as an appropriate container. The system is designed as a distributed software complex and consists of several executive components: Retransmitter, a number of Media Stream Coders and a number of clients. All the components can run either on separate computers or on the same computer. Media stream Coders consume streams from media sources, turn it into Ogg stream and send it out to Retransmitter. The possible media sources are: IP-cam, web-cam, computer screen along with microphone. A client is able connect to Retransmitter using any web-browser with Ogg Theora/Vorbis support. The range of values 250-350 ms has been achieved for the latency between real action and client video. The developed software is a framework for diverse media exchange systems that could be built on it's basis. Several possible applications are discussed in the scope of the U-70 Accelerator Complex technological needs. This could play an important role in personnel safety system while perform maintenance tasks in an extreme work environments such as the Beam Channel.

Modern digital synchronization system for big physical facilities is developed at BINP. It allows synchronizing the spatially distributed control devices with an accuracy of ±2 ns and low jitter (< 100 ps). Accurate time distribution and delay compensation is provided, as well as an ability to react to external events with a determined latency. Two modules are used in this subsystem: S-Timer and L-Timer. S-Timer provides a synchronized 250 MHz clock signal with embedded events data through the optical link to nine L-Timers or S-Timers. L-Timer decodes the signal from the optical link and provides synchronization pulses to final control devices.

The control system of a Linear Induction Accelerator (LIA-20) consists of 40 local controllers, distributed along the total length of about 100 meters. These controllers are based on VME-BINP crates. The system should provide high reliability of operation in conditions of strong electromagnetic noise and radiation. The developed monitoring system that allows registering value and deviations on the VME supply rails, measures temperature and other peripheral parameters is discussed in this paper. Monitoring devices are connected by a CAN bus equipped with independent backup power supply. The central program performs periodic polling of the monitored devices to obtain the actual measured values, store it in a database and notify the operator in case of faults.

Light ion injector for future NICA project contain several resonator: buncher, RFQ, Alvarez-type linac LU-20, and possibly debuncher, that all work on same resonant frequency 145.2 MHz. Base frequency for all resonators in injector produced by LU-20 linac, worked in self-excited loop mode. Low-level RF control system of injector should capture RF signal from LU-20 linac within front of signal and generate output RF signals with same frequency on others resonators, with regulated phase difference between channels. Additionally, low-level RF control system should tune resonant frequencies of RFQ, buncher and debancher. Presented LLRF system was successively work within several years. LLRF controllers design, possibilities, and key stabilization techniques are presented.

An Source of Polarized Ions (SPI), developed at JINR, produces pulsed beams of polarized protons and deuterons for NUCLOTRON accelerator. The accelerated polarized ion beams will be injected into future NICA collider. In order to reconcile requirements of a RFQ fore-injector of the Alvarez type linear accelerator LU-20, it is necessary to measure a transverse emittance of the ion beams produced by the SPI. The emittance of beams of polarized deuterons and polarized protons was measured by the pepper-pot method. The results of measurements of the emittance and profile of the polarized ion beams are presented.

An interaction of particles with each other and electromagnetic fields produced by an external source and the bunch in the vacuum chamber defines the electron bunch sizes in the storage ring. To research the influence of the bunch-chamber interaction on the longitudinal motion of electrons and to estimate the relative contribution of the observed effects, the measurements of bunch sizes and a bunch current spectrum were carried out in the storage ring SIBERIA-2. Results of measurements and analytical estimations are presented at this article.

Modifications (varieties) of absolute monitors providing the measurement of the total number of protons in the energy range of 50 - 1000 MeV, in the flux range of 106 - 1011 s−1, with the beam size ranging from 0.6 to 20 cm were developed and subjected to thorough examination for the purposes of radiation testing of electronic products on the PNPI synchrocyclotron. A two-section air-filled ionization chamber operating at normal pressure is used as a detector. It consists of two ionization chambers with different interelectrode distances combined into one module. In different structural versions of the module, the direction of the proton beam can be either perpendicular or parallel to the electrodes of the chamber. The number of protons passing through the detector is calculated using the developed algorithm in real time. Experimental data on the total number of protons and the average value of the proton flux is recorded by the electronic measuring stand.

Injection Complex VEPP-5 feeds two BINP's colliders - VEPP-4M and VEPP-2000 with the electron and positron beams. 700 MHz 64-harmony damping ring resonator was replaced with 10.94 MHz first harmonic one in 2017. The key parameters for IC damping ring are particles storage rate and extraction beam parameters. In order to figure out how collective beam effects influence them with the new resonator we explore longitudinal beam distribution during the injection and storage. The results of research will be presented at this paper.

The device which includes the "pepper-pot" mask, the quartz screen, and the CCD camera was used for measure the transverse emittances of beam at the exit of H-minus ion source for 7-15 keV beam energy. Emittance measuring at such low ions energy required low-level signals from quartz screen to be recorded and processed, while the intense glow of the gas discharge plasma created a spurious illumination of the quartz screen. The issues of obtaining sufficient signal level at such low ions energy, methods of subtracting the signal of non-ion-beam illumination of quartz screen from the full amplitude of the signal as well as issues of data processing and presentation of phase portraits are discussed.

The longitudinal beam profile measurement system based on optical dissector was upgraded at booster synchrotron BEP during VEPP-2000 collider complex 2017/2018 data taking run. New RF-cavity of 13-th harmonic was installed during the booster upgrade in 2013-2015 to increase top energy to 1 GeV. The complex work on synchrotron radiation output modernization was performed, and measurement system was commissioned. The system was tested and calibrated, the resolution was studied. The bunch length dependence was measured for different RF cavity voltages while beam current changes and compared with the potential well distortion model. Good agreement with theory proved system operability. In addition the results of bunch length current dependence obtained by dissector at VEPP-2000 collider were compared with streak-camera measurements being in a good agreement. The synchrotron tune dependence on RF-cavity voltage was measured both at BEP and VEPP.

Updated beam monitor system executes continuous monitoring surveillance beam losses around the IHEP UÂ­70 accelerator. The system consists of 120 detectors. One is located upstream of each bending magnet in the median plane outside of the beam-pipe at 60 cm apart. The detectors are cheap ion chambers filled with air under barometric pressure and 1.8 liter volume. Chamber signals processing is based on digital integration and done in the framework of the UÂ­70 Control System. Acquired data are used to facilitate tuning of the accelerator, minimize beam losses at any point of the machine circumference and consequently decrease damage for accelerator equipment. This report gives a brief description of the system and the result of run experience as an example.

The unique feature of the VEPP-4M electron-positron collider is wide energy range (1 - 4.75 GeV) available for experiments in high-energy physics. Energy spread value of the beam is an important parameter in a choice of energy step during measurement of e+e− -> hadrons cross sections as well as it has a strong influence on the statistic collection time required for the scanning of narrow resonances like planned for the nearest future scan of Upsilon(2s) meson. Thus, it is important to control energy spread of the beam and measure it operatively and reliably. The paper presents measurements of the beam energy spread at the VEPP-4M electron-positron collider in its complete energy range. Energy spread was calculated from bunch length measured by "PS-1/S1" streak camera with picosecond temporal resolution. In order to exclude the influence of collective effects on bunch length, we measured length of low-intensity bunch. Values of energy spread calculated from bunch length were checked by the measurements of energy spread based on registration of beam decoherence. The impact of the Touschek effect in the beam energy spread at low energy range (1.0 - 1.5 GeV) is discussed.

In 2006 team at IHEP designed and built a special ultrahigh-vacuum stand for production of the beam loss monitors with a successful collaboration between CERN and the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino. The first detectors were ionization and secondary emission monitors for the Large Hadron Collider. During the last 10 years the detectors protects the LHC machine without detector parameters degradation and LHC damage. Later the other types of detectors had been developed and produced in IHEP: little Ionization chambers and flat ionization monitors. Flat ionization chamber had been developed special for CERN Booster. In 2018 the line of detectors replenished with a new type of monitor, proportional chamber with higher sensitivity. For this development the vacuum stand had been modified. In 12 years stand is supporting in working condition with regular testing and controlling of vacuum parameters. The stand parameters, the possibility of production of different types and forms, the detectors characteristics had been shown.

Irradiation of medical products on radiation installations based on electron beam is a responsible task. To increase the quality of irradiation, continuous monitoring of the installation operation is necessary. The design of the system for monitoring and recording parameters of a radiation-technological installation based on the UELV-10-10-C-70 accelerator at IPCE RAS is presented. The monitoring system collects data in real time with number of sensors and performs its analysis and registration, informs about errors and stops the irradiation process in emergency situations. A simple solution for transferring data from sensors to a computer, which traditionally remains a bottleneck in technology, is proposed. An important task of the control system is to determine the parameters of the accelerator beam, such as pulse current and energy spectrum. Various methods, based on simple equipment, for determining the energy spectrum of accelerator beam, which can be used for continuous monitoring without interrupting the production process, are proposed. A computational model is developed for processing the results of measurements in these methods, using the computer code "Beam Scanning". In current version of the system the data about the conveyor movement, scanning system deflecting magnet current and accelerator state is collected. The beam spectrum sensor based on the Faraday cylinder is in the process of development.

Bunch Shape Monitor with three changeable deflectors was designed and manufactured for UNILAC, CW LINAC and proton linac of GSI-FAIR project. The length of BSM RF-deflector for UNILAC was large, that increased the influence of external mechanical vibrations on the BSM operation. The model for mechanical and electrical analysis of BSM RF-deflector and design solutions for vibration damping are presented.

Unknown energy of electron beam of linear accelerator was estimated by photo activation of only one activation detector - foil of natural indium. Three different photonuclear reactions were considered: 115In(gamma, gamma')115mIn, 115In(gamma, n)114mIn and 115In(gamma, 2n)113mIn. Ratio of saturation activities R(113mIn)/R(115mIn) and R(114mIn)/R(115mIn) were determined by standard gamma spectroscopy in electron energy region of interest (10 MeV - 23 MeV) using indium foils exposed in the FLNR microton MT25 bremsstrahlung beam. The choice of cyclic accelerator MT25, as a reference machine, was made due to the fact, that the energy of its electrons is known with accuracy not worse than 1%. Same ratios of saturation activities were determined after exposition of In activation detectors in photon beam of linear accelerator. The fact that both irradiations, by microton MT25 and accelerator, were performed in identical geometry using same target (3 mm of Tungsten) allowed us to estimate electron energy of accelerator by comparison of ratios of saturation activities obtained by both machines. Small variation in accelerator electron current was taken in consideration.

A distributed optical fiber based beam loss monitor has been implemented for the Budker INP Injection Complex designed to accelerate and store electron and positron beams up to 500 MeV. The principle of the device operation consists in detecting the Cherenkov radiation generated in an optical fiber by relativistic charged particles produced in an electromagnetic shower when beam hits the accelerator vacuum chamber wall. Single optical fiber section can cover the entire accelerator instead of using a large number of local beam loss monitors. Timing of optical signal gives the location of the beam losses along the beamline. In this paper summary of the monitor application at the BINP Injection Complex is given. Methods to improve monitor spatial resolution are discussed.

The challenge of reliable measurement and diagnostics of extremely short electron bunches is of crucial importance for commissioning and operation of the accelerators like a FELs and colliders. A method widely applied for bunch length diagnostics is Coherent Radiation Diagnostics (CRD)*. Radiation is emitted coherently if the wavelength is in the order of the bunch length, i.e. information about bunch length and shape is encoded in the emission spectrum which is exploited in CRD. For bunch lengths in the order of hundreds of femtoseconds, the Far-Infrared wavelength region is of interest. It is propose to extend the range of CRD up to attoseconds by using radiation in X-ray region, but for this our will need to register of high intensity X-ray pulses. The goal of this work is developed of technic and setup for bunch length measuring based on registration of high intensity X-ray pulses by sampling calorimeter. A numerical experiment was carried out in Geant 4. 30 KeV rays fall on the detector, which is assembled of the 20 layers interleaved scintillator BC-418 and A1. Thick of each layer is 1 mm and transverse size is 3X3 mm.

The report examines the influence of the distribution and intensity of a magnetic field in the ion source with the Penning discharge of a gas-filled neutron tube on the ion current pulse. The study was carried out by means of numerical modeling using the KARAT code*. The ion source has a length of 1.1 cm, the length of the anode is 0.6 cm with its diameter of 1.1 cm. Atomic deuterium is used at a pressure of 1 mTorr as the residual gas. A ring-shaped hot cathode with an electron current of 10 mA is considered as the discharge trigger. The anode voltage pulse has an amplitude of 2.5 kV and a front of 0.5 mks. The magnetic field is created by a 1.1 cm long solenoid with a diameter of 2.3 cm. The base case with respect to which the magnetic field ranged has an ion current pulse amplitude of 0.7 mA at a rise time of 2.5 mks. The displacement of the solenoid towards the cathode entails an increase in the ion current pulse amplitude up to 1 mA but at the same time it leads to its spreading. The transfer of the solenoid toward the anticathode shortens the front of the ion current pulse, but leads to a decrease in its amplitude to 0.4 mA. At the low magnetic field intensity the current pulse front becomes steeper, but the pulse itself has a more sinusoidal shape with an amplitude of 0.6 mA. An increase in the magnetic field intensity entails an increase in the duration of the pulse front and an increase in its amplitude up to 0.5 mA while retaining a pulse shape close to rectangular.

Investigations of small-sized vacuum laser-plasma diodes have shown the possibility of effective acceleration of deuterons for the nuclear reaction D(d, n)3He in a diode with a laser deuterium-containing target at the anode and magnetic isolation of the electronic current component. Generalized results of investigations of the system of coaxial geometry of electrodes with an internal anode enclosed by a hollow cylindrical cathode are reported at various parameters: the radiation energy of a pulsed yttrium-aluminum garnet laser from 0.1 J to 1 J with a pulse duration of 10 ns and a wavelength of 1.06 mkm, accelerating voltage of a high voltage pulse source according to Arkadiev-Marx scheme from 300 kV to 450 kV. In addition, two methods for suppressing electronic conduction, a constant magnetic field with azimuthal symmetry, and a pulsed magnetic field of a spiral line adjacent to the cathode are considered. It has been experimentally established that the suppression of the electronic conductivity by the field of permanent magnets has a number of significant drawbacks. At a radiation energy of 0.85 J for a laser target, a current of the order of 1 kA with an accelerating voltage of the order of 400 kV was detected in a diode with magnetic insulation. An increase in the laser radiation energy from 0.1 to 0.85 J leads to an increase in the total number of deuterons produced in a laser plasma to about 1015.

The experimental results of deuteron acceleration based on the expansion of a quasineutral laser plasma in a strong nonstationary magnetic field for the generation of neutrons are discussed, which became a logical continuation of a series of previous works. To obtain a laser plasma, an Nd: YAG laser (wavelength 1.06 nm) was used with the impulse power of 0.85 J and duration of 10 nsec. During its radiation focusing at a dielectric target made of deuterated polyethylene (CD2)n in a vacuum of ~ 10-4 torr, the power density of about 5×1015 W×m-2 was reached. A rapidly growing magnetic field was created when the voltage generator was discharged, based on the pulse charging of the storage capacitance from the high-voltage pulse transformer. When the voltage 100 kV is reached, a breakdown of the spark gap and a discharge of the capacitance onto the induction coil generating a magnetic field (maximum current of the order of 10 kA) occurs. The ion speed was determined as per the time-of-flight method with the registration of ion current at a collector made as a Faraday cylinder, which is installed at a distance of 0.5 m from the laser target. The rapidly increasing magnetic field reached 108 T/s, the maximum ion flow rate was 3×108 cm/s. When a beam of accelerated deuterons was directed to a closely spaced deuterium-containing target, an output of 104 neutrons/pulse was reached.

Collective acceleration of deuterons from laser plasma by negative potential of electron beam, moving through plasma to vacuum drift tube, is investigated. Electrons produced by short high-voltage electric pulse on cathode, compose a virtual cathode with negative potential well in drift tube, which is used for deuterons acceleration. Electrons accelerated in diode, move through a cloud of deuterium laser plasma, created by plasma-generating target that represents a titanium tablet saturated with deuterium. Experimental results on deuterons acceleration and neutrons generation in D(d, n)3He, 9Be(d, n)10B, 12C(d, n)13N nuclear reactions are presented. Experimental spectrums of accelerated deuterons were obtained. Computer simulation results of deuterons acceleration in field of electrons are in a good agreement with experiment.

The design of laser-plasma heavy ion source is described. This ions source is supposed to operate at I-3 and I-4 accelerators at ITEP. Characteristics of ion component of plasma produced by pulses of the CO2 laser were studied, when irradiating a solid carbon target at power density of 1011-1012 W/cm2. Time-of-flight technique using a high-resolution electrostatic energy analyzer was applied to explore charge state and energy distribution as well as partial currents of carbon and tungsten ions. Some results of investigation of influence of cavern formation on charge state of generated ions are presented. This work is of considerable interest in a wide area of applications of accelerated particle beams, including fundamental studies of state of matter in particle colliders (NICA project at JINR), radiation damage simulation and hadron therapy for cancer treatment. The goal of this work is to investigate characteristics of ions in expanding laser plasma and find optimal conditions of target illumination and ion beam extraction.

The paper is devoted to the description of research conducted in 2017-2018 at the accelerator complex DC-60 of the Astana branch of INP, on production and acceleration of intense ion beams of solids. The main purpose of this work was to develop techniques for obtaining accelerated ions using the evaporation and volatile compounds (MIVOC) methods for solid materials feed to the ECR source. The development of these techniques will significantly expand the range of accelerated ions, which gives particular relevance to the purpose of the study. The extension of accelerated ions range gives the possibilities of posing, searching for and solving new problems and experiments in the field of experimental nuclear physics, solid-state radiation physics, and various applied problems.

New WinSAM program for simulation of electron-optical systems and electron guns was created in BINP. This program is the further development of SAM code. The main advantage of WinSAM program is the new interface that greatly simplifies the usage of the program. The other main targets are enlargement of the scope of solved tasks, introduction different analytical fields, development of enhanced emission model, and speed up calculations. New 120 kV multi-electrode electron gun for electron-beam welding is developed with help of WinSAM program. The required beam current in welding mode is up to 30 mA, in diagnostic mode is 1 mA. Beam radius at welding point should be less than 0.3 mm. Proper electron-optical system of this gun was obtained during numerical simulations. The calculations take into account transversal beam temperature and space charge compensation in region after small aperture anode. Production of this electron gun is started.

The radiation methods are widely used to solve applied physics problems in the field of solid state physics, the processing of various raw materials, materials and products for medical purposes and so on, with electron accelerators of small, below 10 MeV, energies. In particular, similar activity has been developed at Institute for nuclear research of RAS, Moscow, on the electron accelerator LUE-8-5RV elaborated in St Petersburg, Russia. Recently, the interest in fundamental research of the atomic nucleus physics has been renewed in this energy area. This interest is associated with new research directions, such as nuclear photonics, the study of collective modes of motion in nuclei at low excitation energies (below thresholds of partial reactions), for example, pigmy resonances. However, the problem here is that among the accelerators of this class there are practically no ones which has necessary energy resolution for such studies (of the order or better than 1%). This paper describes the results of the work that made it possible to obtain on the LUE-8-5RV accelerator an electron beam with the following characteristics: pulse rate repetition 300 per sec, pulse duration 3 μs, beam energy in the range of 4-10 MeV, energy resolution from 1% at average beam current up to 6 microamps and 10% at maximum current values (up to 300 microamps).

About a Possibility of Acceleration of Ferromagnetic Objects by the Electromagnetic Fields

As the accelerated objects in work the possibility of use of separate domains of a ferromagnetic is considered. Also perhaps an existence of solid-state communication of domains is possible. Acceleration is carried out at the expense of a gradient of the base magnetic field. The magnetic field of ferromagnetics creates a longitudinal potential well in the base magnetic field. The gradient of the base magnetic field does not exceed a gradient of this potential well and does not allow the accelerated objects to go beyond its limits. Depth of a potential well can be increased at the expense of the electron stream which is in this potential well. He does not leave area of a well too, being reflected from its walls. There is some semblance of the moving adgezator used at coherent acceleration of protons by electronic rings. A certain similarity of repetition of the idea of acceleration of protons electronic rings due to acceleration of electronic rings external fields is possible. It can be as magnetic fields with the corresponding gradient of a longitudinal field, and electric fields also. Some kind of combination of coherent acceleration of neutral domains of a ferromagnetic by the magnetic and electric field turns out. Estimates show that at number of atoms about 10 in 14 degrees their acceleration to 1 MEV apart approximately in 1 meter is possible. The sizes of domains are about 10 in minus fifth degree of meter. Longitudinal magnetic fields are in range of 1 Tesla.

Nowadays diffraction radiation (DR) has several applications in the diagnostics of accelerators such as bunch length, transversal sizes and emittance diagnostics. This radiation occurs when charged particles move close to a target. There are also several DR calculation methods which were developed in the past. However, until now there are no codes for DR simulation from different type of targets. All researches have to develop their own numerical codes or have to use the analytical formulas which are obtained only for the small number of targets with approximations of infinity dimensions and far field zone. In this report we present the code for calculation of DR characteristics from metal targets with finite dimensions and finite distance to detector. The calculation approach in this code is based on the generalized surface current method. Above method is suitable for the targets with the ideal conductivity (metal target case) and applicable for diffraction and transition radiation (TR), for charged particles with arbitrary energies and incidence angles to the target, for wavelengths from optics to mm range. Finally, code can be used to calculate DR and TR characteristics for new beam diagnostics methods and radiation sources development.
