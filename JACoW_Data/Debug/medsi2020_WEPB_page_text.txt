The Canadian Light Source Inc. (CLSI), opened in 2004 and located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, is a third-generation synchrotron light source facility with a 2.9 GeV storage ring. CLSI was built based on the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory (SAL) with its LINAC. The SAL LINAC was built in 1960s and refurbished to operate at 250 MeV in 2002. It was also de-signed at an average beam power up to 46KW. To be used by CLS, the LINAC was modified for operation at pulse power levels of 25 MW with the current 100 mA. The modified LINAC consists of an electron gun and section 0 to 6, Energy Compression System (ECS) and Section 7. The LINAC has kept a steady performance throughout the years, along with many repairs and replacements ’ most of which are preventative. The original Varian type accelerating Sections are planned to be replaced gradual-ly by SLAC type Sections. Section 3 and 4 are two of the original 3 Varian type sections left in CLS - with over 55 years of service, they were accumulating vacuum leak problems from time to time. The replacement of Section 3 and 4 was completed in 2020. The mechanical consideration of the Section 3 and 4 replacement mainly includes upgrading supporting structures, designing Wave-guides, modifying LCW systems, getting solution to move the sections around in the LINAC tunnel, etc.

The Advanced Photon Source-Upgrade (APS-U) project* is under construction and will incorporate a new Multi-Bend Achromat (MBA) lattice. With this design, the new storage ring will require over 1320 new magnets that are being produced under build-to-print contracts to several vendors across the globe. Magnetic measurements are needed to characterize and fiducialize all these magnets to ensure field quality and alignment requirements are met. Seven specialized test benches were designed and built to meet the measurement requirements. These measurement benches may be classified into two groups. The first group is the field quality measurement that includes the strength of the main field and higher harmonics. The multipole magnets are measured using four rotating coil benches, whereas the longitudinal gradient dipoles are mapped using a Hall probe system. The second group is fiducialization that locates the magnetic center of the magnet using a rotating wire and relates it to magnet fiducials and reference surfaces using a laser tracker. This information accompanies each magnet through the module assembly and final installation in the ring to ensure that the magnet is aligned within the allowable tolerance. To date, about 65% of all magnets needed for the storage ring have been measured and fiducialized. Mechanical design of the measurement benches will be presented.

An effort to build Argonne’s Sub-THz AcceleRator (A-STAR) for a future multiuser x-ray free-electron laser facility proposed in [1] is underway at Argonne National Laboratory. The A-STAR machine will utilize a compact collinear wakefield accelerator (CWA) assembled in modules. To extract the wakefield and monitor beam position downstream of each module, a 45-mm-long transition section (TS) has been proposed and designed. This paper will discuss the design and fabrication chal-lenges for production of the TS.

Argonne National Laboratory is developing a Sub-THz AcceleRator (A-STAR) for a future multiuser x-ray free electron laser facility. The A-STAR machine will utilize a compact collinear wakefield accelerator (CWA) based on a miniature copper (Cu) corrugated waveguide as proposed*. The accelerator is designed to operate at a 20-kHz bunch repetition rate and will utilize the 180-GHz wakefield of a 10-nC electron drive bunch with a field gradient of 100 MVm’1 to accelerate a 0.3-nC electron witness bunch to 5 GeV. In this paper, we discuss specific challenges in the mechanical design of the CWA vacuum chamber module. The module consists of series of small quadrupole magnets with a high magnetic field gradient that houses a 2-mm diameter and 0.5-m-long corrugated tubing with brazed water-cooling channels and a transition section. The 45-mm-long transition section is used to extract the wakefield and to house a beam position monitor, a bellows assembly and a port to connect a vacuum pump. The CWA vacuum chamber module requires four to five brazing steps with filler metals of successively lower temperatures to maintain the integrity of previously brazed joints.

APS Upgrade selected the horizontal injection scheme which requires exchanging the x and y emittances in the BTS transport line through a series of six skew quadrupoles, as well as matching the beam parameters to the APS Upgrade storage ring through two dipoles and a conventional pulsed septum. This paper presents the layout of this BTS line section in the storage ring tunnel and key components in this section including the mechanical design of dipole magnet, quadrupole and skew quad magnets, the vacuum system, the diagnostics system, and the supports. Finally, detailed mechanical design of this BTS line section in modules and some consideration for fabrication and installation are addressed.

With APSU well into the procurement phase of the project, the APSU assembly team has completed a "DLMA Practice Assembly", comprising of the support system, and all magnets required to complete a module. The purpose of this test was to verify assembly and documentation procedures, ensure proper fit between mating components, and verify that alignment specifications can be met. The results of this exercise are presented. Though this test was completed on the Argonne site, work continues on building 981, the APSU offsite warehouse, where our first production plinths and girders have been shipped, and where production modules will be assembled. This space has been outfitted by Argonne contractors and APSU Assembly technicians with 1) 5 parallel DLM/FODO module assembly stations, each complete with a 3 tn. overhead crane, retractable cleanroom, staging tables, and tools, and 2) 2 QMQ module assembly stations each complete with a 5 tn. gantry crane, assembly support stands, staging tables, and tools. An overview of this production assembly space is also presented.

Tighter specifications in synchrotron instrumentation development force the design engineers more and more often to choose a mechatronics design approach. This includes actively controlled systems that need to be properly designed. The new Nano Active Stabilization System (NASS) for the ESRF beamline ID31 was designed with such an approach. We chose a multi-body design modelling approach for the development of the NASS end-station. Significance of such models depend strongly on its input and consideration of the right stiffness of the system’s components and subsystems. For that matter, we considered sub-components in the multi-body model as reduced order flexible bodies representing the component’s modal behaviour with reduced mass and stiffness matrices obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) models. These matrices were created from FEA models via modal reduction techniques, more specifically the component mode synthesis (CMS). This makes this design approach a combined multibody-FEA technique. We validated the technique with a test bench that confirmed the good modelling capabilities using reduced order flexible body models obtained from FEA for an amplified piezoelectric actuator (APA).

As for all Synchrotron Radiation based installations, floor vibrations lead to unreliable results if transmitted to sensible equipment like sample environment and detection systems. It is important to design the optical and experimental equipment of a beamline in a way to minimize the effect of the vibrations. This project investigates the design of the detector stage in SESAME’s tomography beamline BEATS by using random vibration analysis to determine the rigidity of the structure. The design analysis of the detector stage takes the approach of using an existing installation at beamline ID28 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility by measuring the power spectrum density of the floor on which the structure is mounted on as well as the response of the structure stage as it is subjected to an excitation from ambient floor noise. A finite element analysis numerical model was established and validated against the experimental data. Once the model is validated within acceptable range, the technique will be applied to the BEATS detector stage design by applying the floor power spectrum density of the SESAME synchrotron and calculating the response of the structure. It is assumed that the random vibration process in this case follows a Gaussian normal distribution. The response power spectrum density Root Mean Square value at the location of interest should be at least 6 times less than the pixel size of the camera that will be used in detector. For the ID28 case, the model was validated by comparing the natural frequency measured and the experimental output RMS value against the model output RMS value. The model natural frequencies deviated from the experimental results by 4.53% and the model RMS values deviated from the experimental results by 1.91%.

Since the mid-2000s, the engineers and researchers of CEA and SOLEIL synchrotron facility have worked together to design a world unique beamline for the study of radioactive matter: MARS (Multi Analyses on Radioactive Samples Beamline)*. The facility works in the hard X-ray domain (between 3.0 and 35 keV) combining both X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction/scattering techniques on two end-stations: CX2 and CX3. MARS beamline is authorized by the ASN (French Nuclear Safety Authority) to analyze samples with radioactivities up to 18.5 GBq per sample for alpha and beta emitters and up to 2 GBq for gamma and neutron emitters. One of its main objectives is to be able to analyze these highly irradiating samples, such as spent nuclear reactor fuel or irradiated nuclear material (solid, liquid), to study their structural and chemical evolutions after irradiation. This article describes the components designed and realized with the major contribution of CEA to analyze such kind of samples: #1 air-tight sample holders; #2 positioning mechanical systems on the X-ray beam; #3 local analyzer devices; #4 two shieldings to safeguard users; #5 a mobile-shielded cask to transport samples.

The MARS beamline*, operating at SOLEIL since 2010, has been developed to provide researchers with advanced X-ray techniques to characterize nuclear materials. The diversity in users’ demands has driven the development of the most suitable detector support to accommodate novel experiments that have not been specified at the time of design. The choice complied with constraints related to the installation in a narrow experimental hutch along with easy transport and maintenance. The system consists of a long-range linear table (Ts) mounted on a wide angular (-1° ; +65°) Rx rotation; Rx can be moved off the beam axis (Tx) to align the detector with the transmitted/reflected beam. It accommodates for any detector by only changing the kinematic interface with Ts. It is worth remarking on the wide angular range with a potential concentration of mass at the end of the arm (payload : 55 kg). FEA was done to study its structural behavior. Performing movements with low SOC values not only puts constraints on the mechanics, but also on control system. As such, Delta Tau Powerbrick controller has been implemented. The design project is complete and built with commissioning work to be done.

Funding: The construction of the ForMAX beamline is funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.
ForMAX is a new beamline at the MAX IV Laboratory for multi-scale structural characterization of hierarchical materials from nm to mm length scales with high temporal resolution. This is achieved by combining full-field microtomography with small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) in a novel manner. The principal components of the endstation consist of two units of beam conditioning elements, a sample table, an evacuated flight tube and a detector gantry. The beam conditioning units include a diamond vacuum window, an attenuator system, a fast shutter, a slit collimation system, two sets of compound refractive lenses, three X-ray beam intensity monitors, a beam viewer and a telescopic vacuum tube. The sample table has been optimized with respect to flexibility and load capacity, while retaining sub-micron resolution of motion and high stability performance. The nine metre long and one metre diameter evacuated flight tube contains a motorised detector trolley, enabling the sample-detector position for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to be easily adjusted under vacuum conditions. Finally, a two metre high and two metre wide granite gantry permits independent and easy movement of the tomography microscope and wide-angle X-ray (WAXS) detector in and out of the X-ray beam. To facilitate propagation-based phase-contrast imaging and mounting of bulky sample environments, the gantry is mounted on motorized floor rails. All these characteristics will allow to combine multiple complementary techniques sequentially in the same experiment with fast efficient switching between setups. The ForMAX endstation is presently in the design and construction phase, with commissioning expected to commence early 2022.

TARUMÃ is the sub-microprobe station of the CARNAÚBA (Coherent X-Ray Nanoprobe Beamline) beamline at Sirius Light Source at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). It has been designed to allow for simultaneous multi-analytical X-ray techniques, including diffraction, spectroscopy, fluorescence and luminescence and imaging, both in 2D and 3D. Covering the energy range from 2.05 to 15 keV, the fully-coherent monochromatic beam size varies from 550 to 120 nm after the achromatic KB (Kirkpatrick-Baez) focusing optics, granting a flux of up to 1e11ph/s/100mA at the probe for high-throughput experiments with flyscans. In addition to the multiple techniques available at TARUMÃ, the large working distance of 440 mm after the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) KB system allows for another key aspect of this station, namely, a broad range of decoupled and independent sample environments. Indeed, exchangeable modular setups outside vacuum allow for in situ, in operando, cryogenic and/or in vivo experiments, covering research areas in biology, chemistry, physics, geophysics, agriculture, environment and energy, to name a few. An extensive systemic approach, heavily based on precision engineering concepts and predictive design, has been adopted for first-time-right development, effectively achieving altogether: the alignment and stability requirements of the large KB mirrors with respect to the beam and to the sample*; and the nanometer-level positioning, flyscan, tomographic and setup modularity requirements of the samples. This work presents the overall station architecture, the key aspects of its main components, and the first commissioning results.

An enhancement design of an existing 26-ID nanoprobe [1] instrument (NPI) at APS is being completed as part of work for the APS-Upgrade (APS-U) project. As part of this enhancement design, a new vacuum chamber geometry configuration has been implemented that balances the desired simultaneous x-ray measurement methods with accessibility and serviceability of the nanoprobe. The main enabling feature on the vacuum chamber is a slanted mid-level vacuum sealing plane. The new chamber design geometrically optimizes the ability to perform simultaneous diffraction, fluorescence and optical or laser pump probe measurements on the sample. A large diffraction door geometry is strategically placed near the sample for ease of access. The newly designed chamber can be readily serviced by removal of the upper chamber section, on which most larger instrument assemblies or beamline attachments are not interfaced. The mechanical design intent and geometry of this chamber concept is described in this paper.

Currently, the ALBA refrigeration system pumps present cavitation when operating at their nominal regime. To alleviate this phenomenon temporarily until a definitive solution was found, the water flow was reduced to 67% of its nominal value. As this flow exchanges heat with the cooling water produced in an external cogeneration plant, modifying the working point of the pumps resulted in a reduction of the Accelerator cooling capacity. However, even at such low flow conditions, the flow has an anomalous oscillatory behaviour in the distributor of the aspiration zone, implying that the cause may be in a bad dimensioning of the manifold. This paper presents a study of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applied to the aspiration zones of the pumps, to investigate the effects of fluid dynamics on cavitation problems and understand what may be happening in the system. The need for such research arises from the urge to recover the accelerator cooling capacity and the constant pursuit for the improvement of the system. The geometries for this study include the general manifold in the aspiration zone and a simplified model of the pump impeller. The simulations have been carried out with the ANSYS-FLUENT software. Studies performed include considering the total water flow in nominal and under current operating conditions. In addition, the cases in which the flow is distributed through the manifold tubes in uniform and non-uniform ways have been treated separately. Pressure and velocity fields are analysed for various turbulence models. Finally, conclusions and recommendations to the problem are presented.

The analysis of thermal stress of beamline components requires a comprehensive determination of the absorbed power profile. Consequently, accurate calculations of beam power density and its dependency on the photon energy are required. There exist precise tools to perform these calculations for undulator sources, like several methods available in the OASYS toolbox* considering, for example, the contribution of the different harmonics of the undulator radiation or using ray-tracing algorithms**. This is not the case for wiggler sources, in particular for short insertion devices that are used as source for the bending magnet beamlines in some upgraded storage rings like the ESRF-EBS. Wiggler radiation is incoherent and although it is possible the use of undulator methods for calculating it, this is very inefficient. In this work, we describe a tool that performs fast calculations of spectral power density from a wiggler source. The emission is calculated starting from a tabulated magnetic field and computes the power spatial and spectral density. It uses concepts inspired from Tanaka’s work***. It is implemented in a user-friendly widget in OASYS and can be connected to widgets to calculate absorbed and transmitted power density along the beamline components. The accuracy of the method is verified by calculating three examples and comparing the results with ray-tracing. The three insertion devices simulated are: the EBS-ESRF-3PW, the ESRF W150 (a high power wiggler) and the 3PW for the BEATS project at the SESAME synchrotron source.
