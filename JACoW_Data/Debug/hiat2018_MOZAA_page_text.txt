A window-type RFQ is designed and fabricated by Peking University for the key technique research of Beijing Isotope-Separation-On-Line neutron-rich beam facility(BISOL) . It is planed to accelerate 50mA deuteron CW beam to 1MeV. The 60kV intervene voltage is designed to decrease the risk of high voltage discharge since the RFQ works in CW mode. High power test shows that the intervane voltage is over 60kV when the cavity power consumption is 48kW. The beam experiment was done and 1.8mA CW beam was obtained at the exit of RFQ with over 90% transmission efficiency. It is the first time that window-type RFQ is used to accelerate light ion with high frequency(>100MHz). The experiment result shows that the window-type structure have great advantages in CW working mode.
