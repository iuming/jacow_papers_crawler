Since the start of SuperKEKB operation in 2016, the stored beam currents have gradually increased in the main ring. In the commissioning of 2022 spring, the maximum beam currents were ~1460 mA in the low energy ring for positron (LER) and ~1145 mA in the high energy ring for electron (HER). The beam doses up to now have been ~ 7312 Ah in LER and ~6199 Ah in HER, and the vacuum scrubbing of the beam pipes is proceeding well. On the other hand, during these operations, problems such as abnormal pressure rises, vacuum leaks, collimator damages and so on have occurred. Here, we mainly report on the experiences and status in the vacuum system after the commissioning in the spring of 2019 named Phase-3, especially.

The analysis and design of the vacuum system for the FCC-ee e- and e+ rings is outlined. The main vacuum-relevant parameters are recalled, with particular emphasis on the copious emission of synchrotron radiation (SR) along the rings, and its direct and indirect effects on vac-uum, namely surface heating, SR-induced molecular desorption, generation of photoelectrons. A status report of the present design, analysis, and prototyping phase of several key vacuum components is also given.
