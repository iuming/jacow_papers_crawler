This paper covers recent progress in the design of optics solutions to minimize collective effects such as beam instabilities, intra-beam scattering or space charge in hadron and lepton rings. The necessary steps are reviewed for designing the optics of high-intensity and high-brightness synchrotrons but also ultra-low emittance lepton storage rings, whose performance is strongly dominated by collective effects. Particular emphasis is given to proposed and existing designs illustrated by simulations and beam measurements.
