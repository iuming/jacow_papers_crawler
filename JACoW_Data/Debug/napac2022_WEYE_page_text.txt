Next-Generation Accelerator Facilities at Fermilab: Megawatt Upgrade of the NuMI Neutrino Beam

Fermilab is actively designing its next generation of proton accelerators (presently titled PIU - Proton Intensity Upgrade) to produce 2.4 MW of 120 GeV beam to the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF), and deliver Megawatt scale beams to a suite of other particle physics experiments researching neutrinos, muons, dark matter, and other particle physics phenomena. These new accelerators will employ state-of-the-art superconducting RF, and rings that will accumulate, compress, and possibly accelerate beam to experiments with a rapid cycling synchrotron. The new accelerators at Fermilab will build off the under construction PIP-II Project - a unique CW superconducting H− Linac. The approach will utilize much of the the existing accelerator complex (Recycler, Delivery Ring, and Main Injector) at higher intensity, and retire the original linac and Booster synchrotron. The PIU will use the major next experiments now under construction (LBNF and Mu2e). Novel beam formatting and delivery techniques may be developed for the next round of experiments. Additionally, R&D presently underway in beam dynamics, RF, and targetry may contribute to the capability of new accelerator facilities.

The reaccelerator facility at FRIB was upgraded to provide new science opportunities. The upgrade included a new ion source to produce stable and long livied rare isotopes in a batch mode, a new room-temperature rebuncher, a new β = 0.085 quarter-wave-resonator cryomodule to increase the beam energy from 3 MeV/u to 6 MeV/u for ions with a charge-to-mass ratio of 1/4, and a new experimental vault with beamlines.

The Main Injector is used to deliver a 120 GeV high power proton beam for Neutrino experiments. The design power of 700 kW was reached in early 2017 but further improvements have seen a new sustained peak power of 893 kW. Two of the main improvements include the shortening of the Main Injector ramp length as well optimizing the slip-stacking procedure performed in the Recycler to reduce the amount of uncaptured beam making its way into the Main Injector. These improvements will be discussed in this paper as well future upgrades to reach higher beam powers.

Electron Cloud Simulations in the Fermilab Recycler

We present a simulation study to characterize the stability region of the Fermilab Recycler Ring in the context of secondary emission yield (SEY). Interactions between electrons and beam pipe material can produce electron clouds that jeopardize beam stability in certain focusing configurations. Such an instability was documented in the Recycler, and the work presented here reflects improvements to better understand that finding. We incorporated the Furman-Pivi Model into a PyECLOUD analysis, and we determined the instability threshold given various bunch lengths, beam intensities, SEY magnitudes, and model parameters.

The research program at the SNS Beam Test Facility is focused on resolving observed model/measurement discrepancies that preclude accurate loss prediction in high-power linacs. The current program of study is focused on deploying direct 6D measurements to reconstruct a realistic model of the initial beam distribution at the RFQ output. This detailed characterization also provides an opportunity for benchmark of RFQ simulations. Here we compare PARMTEQ predictions against 5D-resolved (x, x’, y, y’, dE) phase space measurements of the BTF H− bunch, focusing on the transverse distribution. This work is an extension of [1], which focused on the longitudinal phase space.

We are planning a new electron cooling experiment at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at Fermilab for cooling ~2.5 MeV protons in the presence of intense space-charge. Here we present the simulations and design of a thermionic electron source for cooling at IOTA. We particularly discuss parameters of the thermionic source electrodes, as well as the simulation results. We also present a new electron source test-stand at the University of Chicago, which will be used to test the new thermionic electron source, as well as other electron sources. In addition, we discuss results from analyzing the test stand operations with a currently existing electron source. Furthermore, we present future steps for the test stand as well as production and commissioning of the thermionic source at IOTA.
