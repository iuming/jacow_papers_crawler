A 2.45 GHz ' 0.1 T microwave discharge Proton Source has been designed and assembled at INFN-LNS for the European Spallation Source (PS-ESS) in order to produce pulsed beams of protons up to 74 mA nominal current, at 75 keV of energy, with a transverse emittance containing 99 % of the nominal proton current below 2.25 π mm mrad and a beam stability of ± 2 %. The challenging performances of the machine have triggered specific studies on the maximization of the proton fraction inside the plasma and of the overall plasma density, including dedicated modelling of the wave-to-plasma interaction and ionization processes. The plasma conditioning phase started in July and excellent RF to plasma coupling, more than 99.5% is evident since the beginning. Reflected power fluctuation less than 0.05 % was measured providing a great starting point to reach the beam stability requested by the ESS accelerator.

Since 2009, the ECR ion source for material researcher was developed at Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). From our efforts during 7 years, The service of 28 GHz ECR ion source of KBSI was succeeded in this year. Our new project is started based on developed skills for 28GHz ECR ion source. In this year, we are started proton ECR ion source with high current for medical application that is Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), Proton Therapy. The first step is development of proton ECR ion source with beam current of 23mA. In this paper, we will suggest design results and manufacturing status of proton ECR ion source for BNCT. Also, we will introduce the future plan about development of compact proton therapy and will report plans for feasibility study.

A 100-MeV proton linac at Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex (KOMAC) is under operation and has provided high-intensity proton beam to users since 2013. The injector part of the linac consists of a microwave ion source with 50 keV extraction energy, two solenoids for beam matching to the 3-MeV RFQ and a vacuum box including beam diagnostics and vacuum pump. The design current of the injector is 20 mA with 0.2 pi.mmmrad transverse normalized rms emittance. The injector was characterized through emittance measurement and solenoids operating parameter sweep. The details of the injector characteristics will be presented in this paper.

SECRAL II ion source has been successfully designed and developed at IMP. This ion source is a 3rd generation ECR machine optimized for the operation at 28 GHz. As a second superconducting ECR ion source developed at IMP with the identical coldmass design as SECRAL ion source, which has the sextupole coils external to the axial solenoids, the magnet performance is more robust according the training test. After a short time beam test at 18 GHz, SECRAL II has been commissioned at 28 GHz, and some preliminary results have been achieved with high charge state ion beam production. This paper will present the magnet design and test results. The first beam at 28 GHz will also be given.

PHOENIX V3 is an upgrade of the PHOENIX V2 ECR ion source granted by the European CRISP project. This new ECRIS features a larger plasma chamber and a re-duced vacuum pressure under operation. The V3 source will replace the V2 one on the SPIRAL2 accelerator in 2018. The first plasma of PHOENIX V3 was achieved on May 9th 2016. The early commissioning of the V3 source at low 18 GHz power demonstrates as expected an en-hancement of the high charge state production and Ar14+ intensity already exceeds the V2 one. Further enhance-ments are expected the outgassing will be achieved and the full RF power will be injected in the source.
