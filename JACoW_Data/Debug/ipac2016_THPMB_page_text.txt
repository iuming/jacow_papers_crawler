Funding: This project is now supported by the COST Action CA15139 "Combining forces for a novel European facility for neutrino-antineutrino symmetry-violation discovery" (EuroNuNet).
ESSnuSB plans to produce very intense neutrino beams using the protons from the ESS linac (5 MW, 2 GeV) and a 4-targets horn system. In the ESSnuSB proposed facility a copious number of muons will also be produced. These muons could be used by a future Neutrino Factory to study CP violation in the leptonic sector but also to study neutrino cross-sections. They could also be used to feed a future muon collider. The feasibility and the issues of extracting the intense muon beam produced together with neutrinos are discussed.

The Collector Ring (CR) has been designed for fast cooling of hot antiproton or ion beams at FAIR. Its ion-optical layout and system design has been recently finalized after careful optimizations aiming at improvement of the beam parameters and machine performance. In this paper we present the simulations of the transverse beam dynamics for the different ion-optical modes of the CR. Particle tracking calculations have been performed to evaluate an influence of the magnet imperfections on the dynamic aperture. The analysis and correction of the closed orbit distortions due to the magnet misalignments is also discussed.

The Orbit Response Matrix (ORM) analysis is a method which allows to find the sources of discrepancies between design and real optics of an accelerator machine. In particular, with this technique one retrieves information about gradient errors, dipole corrector gain errors etc. Orbit response matrix is computed by measuring orbit deviations caused by single kicks of corrector magnets. With fitting the matrix one obtains the ion optics which best describes the real accelerator. The ORM analysis, presented in the paper, is employed to find error sources in the FAIR storage rings CR and HESR during and after the beam commissioning. The algorithm itself was implemented in Python programming language with a help of linear algebra libraries. The ORM analysis accuracy as well as its limitations are addressed in the paper.

A non-isochronous recirculation scheme which helps cancelling out errors coming from the RF-jitters in a recirculating linac will be presented. Non-isochronous recirculation is the common operation mode for synchrotrons or microtrons. In such a scheme the recirculation arcs provide a non-zero longitudinal dispersion, while the particle bunches are accelerated at a certain phase off-crest with respect to the maximum of the accelerating field. In few-turn linacs and microtrons such beam dynamics can be used to reduce the energy spread. To do so the longitudinal phase advance needs to be set to a half-integer number of oscillations in phase space. Then errors from linac RF-systems cancel out and the energy spread remains closely to the value at injection. In addition to the improved energy spread the beam stability of few-turn recirculators can be increased as well using such a system. We will present operational experience with the non-isochronous recirculation system of the twice recirculating superconducting accelerator S-DALINAC operated at TU Darmstadt including beam-dynamics calculations and measurements of the energy spread.

Unclosed Lattice Dispersions as a Tool for Partial Removal of Transverse to Longitudinal Beam Correlations

                       DESY, Hamburg, Germany

 


 

We show how to choose unclosed lattice dispersions in order to zero either linear beam dispersions (linear correlations between energy of particles and their transverse positions and momenta) or linear beam tilts (linear correlations between longitudinal positions of particles and their transverse coordinates). Besides that, we prove that while removal of beam dispersions always leads to reduction of transverse projected emittances, zeroing of beam tilts cannot guarantee it.

Numerical Computation of Transport Matrices of Axisymmetric RF Cavities for Online Beam Dynamics Applications

The RF focusing effect plays a considerable role at low particle energies and cannot be neglected in many online beam dynamics applications. Unfortunately, known analytical expressions for the transfer matrix of a cavity typically are applicable only to ultra-relativistic beams and demonstrate notable differences with accurate numerical simulations at low energies. So, in this paper, we present practical numerical algorithm for calculation of the linear transfer matrices of axisymmetric RF cavities which we developed for online modeling of the beam dynamics in the European XFEL linac.

Compensation of Steerer Crosstalk between FLASH1 and FLASH2
3237

The free-electron laser in Hamburg (FLASH) is a user facility delivering soft X-ray radiation. Starting from 2014, a second beam line for user operation, FLASH2, has been commissioned. It uses the same accelerating modules as the initial FLASH beam line (FLASH1) and the beam is deflected into a separate beam line downstream the linac. In the region, where the FLASH2 beam is extracted, both beam lines are close, the angle in between is 6.5 degrees. It has been observed, that steering dipoles in the extraction area, have an influence on both beam lines. Thus steering the orbit in one beam line, perturbs the orbit in the other beam line. This perturbation can significantly degrade the SASE energy in the other beam line. We have found a solution to this problem based the combination of local orbit bumps. The crosstalk from one steerer is corrected using additional steerers in the other beam line. This concept has already been tested at FLASH and has proven to work sufficiently well.

The COoler SYnchrotron in Jülich accelerates and stores unpolarized and polarized proton or deuteron beams in the momentum range between 0.3 GeV/c and 3.65 GeV/c [*,**]. This, in combination with its diverse capabilities of phase space cooling and the flexibility of the lattice with respect to ion-optical settings makes COSY an ideal test facility for accelerator technology development. High demands on beam control and beam based measurements have to be fulfilled for future experiments such as the proposed precursor experiment for a direct measurement of the electric dipole moment of the deuteron (see [***] and references within). The analysis of measured orbit response matrices (ORM), which com- prise the focussing structure of the ring, allows for a better understand- ing of machine imperfections such as gradient errors and misalignments of quadrupole magnets. This contribution presents the development of a MAD-X based LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits) algorithm [****] in a C++ program aiming to calibrate and correct linear optics as well as improving beam control at COSY.

The SINBAD facility (Short and INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) is foreseen to provide sub-fs to tens of fs electron bunches for the R&D of novel acceleration concepts and applications, e.g. Laser Wake-Field Acceleration (LWFA), Dielectric Laser Acceleration (DLA) and medical imaging. We present the design study of the dogleg at the SINBAD linac, which is capable of delivering ultra-short bunches to the second beamline. The longitudinal dispersion of the dogleg can be finely tuned so that it can either transport the ultra-short bunch produced upstream by velocity bunching, or compress the incoming long bunch. The achievable beam parameters are investigated by start-to-end simulations.

Solenoids are often used as lens-like beam focusing elements in electron linacs, especially in the low energy beam lines aside the Gun solenoid for emittance compensation, a common element of high brightness photo-injectors. There are also many electron linacs worldwide which use the Velocity Bunching beam compression technique, which needs solenoids wrapping the first acceleration cavity. A misalignment between the beam trajectory and the magnetic center of the solenoids produces a decrease in the beam quality and makes it necessary to find a complex steering setting to force the beam on a good orbit. In this proceeding we present a study of two beam based alignment techniques, which are correlated: the first shows a method to find the correct electromagnetic axis of an acceleration cavity, the second shows how to align the solenoids (wrapping the cavity) on this axis. Therefore the study permits to find the best steering setting and the solenoids positions corrections which have to be done. The work is based on real data acquired on the SPARC linac and on a virtual experiment.

For the design study of the HMBA (hybrid multi bend achromat) type most advanced light source, the new storage ring was designed from the lattice of the phase II upgrade project of the ESRF (ESRF II). Although the original 3 GeV test lattice from Dr. Pantaleo Raimondi of ESRF has no problem about the optical and magnetic parameters including the dynamic aperture, we reduce the cell numbers and inserted the short straight sections for the in-vacuum short-gap undulators. After the optimization of the linear and non-linear optics as the original design principle of ESRF II, the altered lattice has the circumference of about 440 m with 16 HMBA cells, the emittance about 440 pm rad with the intra-beam scattering effect at the beam current of 500 mA, and the large dynamic aperture of about 2 cm at the injection point even with the usual magnetic errors.

We proposed 6 GeV Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) as an intense gamma-ray source for the polarized positron source of International Linear Collider (ILC)*. In this scheme, Coherent Synchrotron Radiation from quasi-CW 6 GeV electron beam is stacked in optical cavity at middle infrared region, and it is used for inverse Compton scattering to generate 10 MeV polarized gamma-ray. The same 6 GeV superconducting linac accelerates both the electron and positron beams up to 5 GeV for injection to the dumping ring. Furthermore, it is available for X-ray light source by adding another recirculation loop. It can be expected as a diffraction limit light source at 10 keV, and the target of the brilliance is 1022-23 ph/s/mm2/mrad2/b.w.0.1%.

A charge separation system comprised by dipoles and solenoids is described which aims to separate positive particles and negative particles apart in secondary beam with a large emittance and huge momentum spread, particularly for mixed-charge muon beams. Nonlinear effect and fringe field effect due to large aperture and large moment range are crucial under this circumstance, which make the charge separation extremely complicated. The design schemes by dipoles and bent solenoids and also simulation results are showed in the paper.

The next synchrotron light source High Energy Photon Source is currently studied at Beijing. A nominal design for the HEPS, in a hybrid 7BA lattice and with an emittance of 60 pm.rad in a circumference of 1.3 kilometers, is completed for further study. In this paper, we present some work on error effect based on the nominal lattice design. Topics covered include dynamic aperture and beam parameters affected by magnetic field error, systematic and random multipole errors and misalignment effect.

The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), with trans-verse emittances of a few tens of pm.rad, is to be built in the suburbs of Beijing, China. The HEPS booster is a 2 Hz electron synchrotron. It accelerates electron bunches from a 300 MeV linac to a final energy of 6 GeV, and then extracts and injects them into the stor-age ring. We have made a candidate booster design, with a circumference of about 432 m and a natural emittance of about 4 nm.rad at 6GeV, which will be located in a separate tunnel. This lattice has a four-fold symmetry. Each super-period is composed of 13 iden-tical cells and two matching cells. The lattice design and optimization and other considerations are present-ed in a detail.

The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), a kilometre- scale diffraction-limited storage ring light source, with a beam energy of 5 to 6 GeV and emittances of a few tens of pm.rad, is to be built in Beijing. A preliminary design with a hybrid 7BA lattice, an emittance of 60 pm.rad and a circumference of about 1.3 kilometers, has been made. Based on this design, we optimized the linear and nonlinear performance of the ring with the MOGA and MOPSO algorithms. From comparison of the performance of these two algorithms, it was found that MOPSO promises higher diversity than MOGA, while MOGA can reach better convergence than MOPSO. To reach a true Pareto front, a successive and iterative implementation of the PSO and MOGA, rather than using either of these two algorithms, is suggested.

This paper describes the magnetic design of the magnets of the far-infrared free electron laser at NSRL, including dipole magnets and quadrupole magnets with limited installing space. The dipoles are of three different effective lengths and strengths. All the magnets are designed and optimized by using POSSION and OPERA-3D. The end shimming and chamfer are modeled and fully determined by 3D simulation to meet the field uniformity requirement. The design consideration and simulation results are presented in detail.

Betatron functions are a set of commonly used merits to characterize the lattice performance of a circular accelerator. The betatron functions in many accelerators can be computed using a lattice model trained or calibrated using a set of closed orbit responses, which is exemplified by the widely used LOCO technique. However, for some accelerators, like Duke storage ring with quad-sextupole combined function magnets, LOCO cannot be employed in any straight forward manner. In this case, direct measurements for betatron function are required. One way to determine betatron functions at the location of quadrupoles for a circular accelerator is to use the relationship between the quadrupole strength variations and the corresponding betatron tune change. In this paper, we present a set of carefully developed techniques to accurately measure the betatron functions at the location of quadrupoles, which allow us to achieve extremely high accuracy. Measurement errors will be discussed, and the detailed measurement technique will be present. Finally, we'll report preliminary experimental results of beta function measurements in the Duke storage ring with statistical error on the order of 1%.

The upgrade project of Hefei Light Source (HLSII) has successfully reduced the natural emittance of the electron beam to lower than 40 nm·rad at 800 MeV with five insertion devices installed. To provide enough straight sections for these insertion devices, the lattice structure has been changed to four double bend achromatic (DBA) with two super-periods from the former four triple bend achromatic (TBA). These different types of the insertion devices can greatly improve the performance of the light source, but simultaneously they can also influence the dynamics of the electron beam in the storage ring. Especially they can bring the distortion of the linear beam optics seriously. In order to make sure the stability and the quality of the beam meeting the design goal, the effect of these insertion devices must be compensated. In this paper, a direct compensation method is applied for the wiggler in the HLSII storage ring with the particle swarm optimization.

FELiChEM is a new experimental facility under construction at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).The facility consists of the middle-infrared (MID-FEL) beam line for 2.5-50 um and the Far-infrared (FAR-FEL) beam line for 40-200um. To achieve the design FEL performance of IR-FEL, the beam with 30 mm-mrad emittance, 5 ps rms length and 1nC bunch charge is required. We conduct error analysis in order to evaluate the tolerances of machine parameters and alignments. In this paper, we simulate the orbit corrections and emittance growth under exist of misalignments and strength errors of magnets. The simulation results show that the trajectory errors can be corrected to mm levels in the whole lattice and the emittance increase is acceptable. At the entrance of undulator, the position and angular errors can be corrected very well. So the trajectory can be controlled in the undulator to meet the requirement of FEL.

A secondary electron emission measurement system has been designed and used to study the secondary electron emission (SEE) of different materials with an independently adjustable energy of 50 eV to 5 keV at National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Here, we obtained the characteristics of the SEE yield from Pd film coatings, under the condition of magnetic field and without magnetic field. Then it was analysed that the effect of magnetic field on the secondary electron yield in the ultra-high vacuum environment. The results show that magnetic field shielding is critical to avoid the influence of magnetic field during secondary electron yield (SEY) measurements.

For future accelerators, such as SPPC (SEYmax <1.2), the build-up of electron cloud generated in the beam pipes considerably affect the stability of particle beams. Therefore, it is critical to look for steady and low secondary electron yield (SEY) material for future high intensity accelerators.

Free electron lasers (FELs) based on Laser Plasma Accelerators (LPAs) present a main research direction for achieving next generation compact advanced light sources. There are several major challenges of the LPA beam to generate high-brilliance FEL radiation including the large initial angular divergence and the large energy spread. Based on the LPA facility in SIOM that has successfully obtained quasi-monochromatic beam with the central energy of hundreds of MeV, a specific design of a beam transport line is proposed to realize FEL gain using Transverse Gradient Undulator to compensate the relatively large beam energy spread. This beamline uses a single dipole, several strong focusing quadrupoles and correcting sextupoles to match proper beta functions and linear dispersion from the LPA beam to FEL radiation. The corresponding experimental facility of LPA-FEL in SIOM has been set up and will perform first tests to generate FEL radiation.

The linac of RISP (Rare Isotope Science Project) includes a charge stripper to obtain better acceleration efficiency. It is located after the lower energy part of the superconducting linac which accelerates 2 charge states, 33 and 34 of uranium beams to about 18 MeV/u. After the charge stripper, 5 charge states around 79 are selected and transported into the higher energy part of the linac through a 180-degree bending section. This work focused on the charge stripper effects on the beam optics in the bending section.

The Rare Isotope Science Project, RISP, is the research complex by using heavy ion accelerator, which RISP research complex consists of front-end system, super conducting linear accelerator(SCL), ISOL system, In-fight system. The original purpose of post linear accelerator was for the alternative acceleration of stable driver beam from ECR ion source and unstable rare isotope beam from ISOL system. The new concept of acceleration method by using post accelerator lattice was studied to get more benefits. The idea was the simultaneous acceleration of stable driver beam and RI beam by using the average A/q value of post accelerator lattice. For the simultaneous two beam acceleration study, we used two ion beams the first one was 58Ni+8 and the other one was 132Sn+20. The beam dynamics simulation was performed by TRACK and TraceWin codes. In this poster, we will describe the results of beam dynamics study for the simultaneous two beam acceleration of the post linear accelerator of RISP.

After upgrade of the pohang light source (PLS-II), several problems reduced the quality of the top-up operation. Unbalance of the injection kicker system and it's lack of control had limited the efficiency of the injection from the linac to the storage ring. We tuned the storage ring to improve the injection efficiency and to stabilize the orbit during the injection.

The Korea Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator (KHIMA) launched the synchrotron based hadron beam therapy facility for combined medical cancer treatment and cancer related research. The Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences (KIRAMS) synchrotron system has been designed to accelerate the particle beams having the kinetic energy interval of 60-230 MeV proton and 110-430 MeV/u carbon ions respectively. An accelerated beam from the synchrotron is transported to the patient position through the High Energy Beam Transport (HEBT) lines. In the HEBT lines, the lattice was designed with beam optics codes. In order to check and confirm the beam loss at the HEBT lines, the tracking code, TRACK, has been used with encoded field map and also with simulated field map by Opera3D code. The performances are described and also compared with two methods for manufacturing the components in the HEBT lines.

Decrease of the electron bunch length gives rise to coherent synchrotron radiation in the THz spectral region. Also, the short photons pulse could provide an option for time-resolved processes studies. Currently the possibility to operate with short electron bunch of the synchrotron radiation source Siberia-2 is under consideration for this purpose. In the report the techniques of electron bunch shortening are described as well as the requirements are given for the parameters of the electron bunch and lattice. The authors present a modified lattice for the synchrotron radiation source Siberia-2 with low momentum compaction factor and the results of the beam dynamics studies.

A low-energy (<50 MeV) compact storage ring is a basic component of an X-ray source with high average flux based on Thomson scattering. Such ring provides electron bunches with ~1 nC charge and repetition rate up to 100 MHz for interaction with intense laser pulses. Such ring should provide a small (tens of microns rms) beam radius at interaction point, must have large dynamic aperture, sufficient space for allocation of different elements, such as laser resonator, RF cavity, fast beam injection/extraction systems, beam pick-ups and correctors. In this report, we present the results of comparative study of four versions of storage ring with different structure of lattices.

Obtaining accurate linear and nonlinear accelerator models is critical for routine accelerator operation. Here we consider a method based on BPM data and generating functions that provides fitted accelerator model. Using measurements from at least three BPMs and generating functions between them allows obtaining momenta at BPMs as the functions of model parameters and comparing them. Thus, lattice parameters can be fitted. Theoretical results are presented and the method is applied to the model examples.

The ESS Linac Simulator (ELS) is the model that will be used at the European Spallation Source ERIC in Lund, Sweden, to simulate the transport of the beam envelope during operations. On August 12th 2015, we had the opportunity to use two hours of beam time in the linac of the Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge to benchmark ELS. In this paper we present the results of the transverse dynamics measurements. Such measurements are obtained upon kicking the beam in the medium-energy beam transport (MEBT) and measuring the effect of the oscillation of the beam centroid in 58 beam position monitors (BPMs). The ELS model and these measurements are in agreement with an average discrepancy of 4% in the superconducting section of the accelerator.

The ESS Linac Simulator (ELS) is the model that will be used at the European Spallation Source ERIC in Lund, Sweden, to simulate the transport of the beam envelope for the operations. During the machine restart in August 2015 at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge, USA, we were able to perform the first benchmarking studies of the ELS. In this paper, we present the results of the phase-scans performed in four RF cavities of the coupled-cavity linac at SNS compared with the same scans simulated in the ELS. The phase of the cavity was modified while the phase of the beam was recorded in two BPMs downstream from the cavity. This measurement was repeated for four independent cavities and the results are compared here with the model, which favourably reproduces the BPM response to the cavity scans.

During the fabrication of an RFQ, deviation from the perfect geometry will occur during assembling, brazing and machining the different parts. These geometrical defects will impact the theoretical inter-vane voltage, given by the beam dynamics, by altering the quadrupolar component as well as adding dipolar terms in the voltage function. Tuners can correct partially the effect of the manufacturing. The study summarizes the effects of the voltage errors on the beam quality in the case of the ESS RFQ with a harmonic analysis of the voltage function. We discuss the acceptable level of voltage errors and associated mechanical tolerances.

We derive a correspondence between the parameters used in Gaussian light beam propagation with wavelength, beam size, and wave front curvature to the description in terms of emittance and Twiss parameters commonly used in charged particle optics. Furthermore, we discuss the analogy of transporting beams to the propagation of measurement uncertainties.

The LHC beta functions (β) can be measured using the phase or the amplitude of betatron oscillations obtained with beam position monitors (BPMs). Using the amplitude information results in a β measurement affected by BPM calibration. This work aims at calibrating BPMs using optics measurements. For this, βs from amplitude and phase and normalized dispersion obtained from many different measurements in 2015 with different optics and corrections are analyzed. Simulations are also performed to support the analyses.

The FCC-hh (Future Hadron-Hadron Circular Collider) is one of the three options considered for the next genera-tion accelerator in high-energy physics as recommended by the European Strategy Group [*]. Preliminary studies have started to estimate the design parameters of FCC-hh. One of these studies is the calculation of the residual orbit in the arcs of the collider. This is very important for the evaluation of the alignment tolerances of the quadru-poles used in the arcs, the dimensioning of the correctors and of the beam screen. Moreover it has an impact on the dynamic aperture of the ring and the field tolerances of the arc multipoles. To perform the simulations, the beam transport code MADX has been used. Systematic studies of the residual orbit and of the correctors' strength de-pendence on the magnets misalignment or field errors are presented and discussed.

A nanometer beam size in the interaction point (IP) is required in case of future linear colliders for achieving the desired rate of particle collisions. KEK Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2), a scaled down implementation of the beam delivery system (BDS), serves for investigating the limits of electron beam focusing at the interaction point. The goal of the ultra-low beta∗ study is to lower the IP vertical beam size by lowering the betay∗ value while keeping the betax∗ value unchanged. Good control over the beam optics is therefore required. The first experience with low beta∗ optics revealed a mismatch between the optics designed in the model with respect to the beam parameters observed in the experiment. Additionally, existing methods of beam parameters characterization at the IP were biased with high uncertainties making it difficult to set the desired optics. In this paper we report on the new method introduced in ATF2 for IP beam parameters characterization which gives a good control over the applied optics and makes the ultra-low beta∗ study possible to conduct. It can be also used for verifying the performance of some of the existing beam instrumentation devices.

In preparation of the optics commissioning at an energy of 6.5 TeV, many improvements have been done to cope with the expected reduced signal to noise ratio due to lowered bunch intensities imposed by machine protection considerations. This included, among others, an increase of the flat top duration of the AC dipole excitations, which allowed to use more turn-by-turn data for the analysis. The longer data acquisition revealed slow drifts of the optics, which limited the increased measurement precision. Furthermore, we will present how orbit drifts influenced dispersion measurements and, as a consequence, posed another limitation for the optics correction. In this paper we will discuss the implications of these observations for the measurement and correction of the optics.

The N-BPM and the Amplitude methods, which are used in the LHC for beam optics measurement, were applied to the ESRF storage ring. We compare the results to the Orbit Response Matrix (ORM) method that is routinely used in the ESRF. These techniques are conceptually different since the ORM is based on the orbit response upon strength variation of steering magnets while the LHC techniques rely on the harmonic analysis of turn-by-turn position excited by a kicker or an AC dipole. Finally, we compare these methods and show the differences in their performance in the ESRF environment.

The CLIC Test Facility CTF3 was build, commissioned and operated at CERN by an international collaboration, with the aim of validating the CLIC two beam acceleration scheme, in which the RF power used to accelerate e+/e− beams is extracted from a high intensity electron beam. In the past years the main issues of such a scheme were assessed, demonstrating its feasibility. The CTF3 experimental programme is complementing these results by addressing cost and performance subjects, mainly using the CALIFES test beam injector and a full scale two-beam module. In this paper we document the present status and give an outlook to next year run, when the experimental programme should be completed.

The ELENA (Extra Low ENergy Antiproton) ring at CERN will further decelerate antiprotons produced at the AD (Antiproton Decelerator) facility from a kinetic energy of 5.3 MeV to 100 keV. The antiprotons will be distributed through a network of electrostatic transfer lines to several experiments, which will replace the existing magnetic transfer lines. The existing experiments and limited space in the AD hall forces the new transfer lines into close proximity to the high-field solenoids used by some experiments to trap the antiprotons. The stray fields from the experimental magnets are known to perturb beam delivery and are a concern for operation at the decreased beam rigidity provided by ELENA. A study was carried out to investigate the influence of stray magnetic fields on the beam, including different ramping periods and operational scenarios. The analytical model of the fields used for simulation will be discussed. Furthermore, trajectory correction algorithms using MADX optic model of the lines have been investigated. The results of these studies as well as specifications of acceptable stray field limits and field attenuation requirements will be presented.

Phase space compression of the antiproton beam in ELENA will be performed by a new electron cooler. The performance of the cooler is greatly influenced by the properties of the electron beam. Careful design of the electron gun electrodes, the quality of the guiding magnetic field and the efficient recuperation of the electrons in the collector ensure that the cooler performance is optimal. We have used COMSOL Multiphysics to design and optimise the complete electron cooler with particular attention to the gun and collector. This software suite uses physics interfaces for modelling common applications and then allows the user to combine the different interfaces in one multi-physics simulation.

The Taiwan Photon Source is a 3-GeV low emittance synchrotron light machine with circumference of 518.4m. The lattice is with 24-cell DBA structure and emittance is 1.6 nm-rad. During the commissioning in the past year, we employed MATLAB-based high level applications to calibrate the optical functions in three different operation lattice modes. In particular, we used LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbit) to restore the machine optical functions and reduce emittance coupling ratio. The beam-based alignment (BBA) measurements as well as BPM and corrector errors were identified.

The Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) is a low-emittance 3-GeV light source at Natioal Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, next to the Taiwan Light source (1.5 GeV). On March 26, 2015, the TPS storage ring with two 5-cell PETRA cavities has successfully operated in 100 mA in top-up mode without the installation of insertion devices (IDs). To reach the design goal of 500 mA, the machine was shut down for 5 months to replace PETRA cavitites with superconducting RF (SRF) cavities and to install 10 IDs: 7 in-vacuum undulators (IU) and 3 elliptically polarized undulators (EPU). The commissioning of TPS storage ring with SRF cavities and IDs began in Sep. 2015. In this paper, we present our results and proceedures of ID commissioning.

The traditional alarm systems usually set up/low limit for various signals. When the acquired values exceed the limits, the alarm system would be activated. The proposed system in this article can focus on various possible events with many kinds of signals for response judgments. During alarm calling period, data can also be announced and recorded. The system can also monitor various events according to different time shifts. Integrating LabVIEW, mobile phone, AT-command and Bluetooth communication, the system can handle factory broadcast, sending E-mail and SMS message. The above sound and words messages can be set directly at the home-made software interface. The new intelligent alarm system can eliminate the procedure made by man with the added event recording, system stability improvement and debugging function in wider application fields.

At the Plasma and Beam Physics Research Facility, Chiang Mai University, a thermionic cathode RF electron gun and alpha magnet are used together as an injector system for a linac-based THz source. Investigate the optimal performance of the injector system, beam dynamic simulations are performed by computer codes PARMELA, ASTRA and ELEGANT. The input 3D field distributions of the RF-gun for PARMELA and ASTRA simulations are obtained from the RF modeling program CST Microwave Studio. The beam transport calculation using the program ELEGANT is performed to study behavior of electrons from the gun exit through the alpha magnet, a travelling wave linac, magnet elements, drift tubes, and related beam diagnostic components. Energy slits inside the alpha magnet vacuum chamber is used to select electrons with desired kinetic energies. The alpha magnet compresses electron bunches with certain bunch length before the beam entering the linac to obtain minimum energy spread and shortest bunch length at the experimental station. Results of electron beam optimization with appropriated conditions for generation of intense coherent THz radiation will be reported and discussed in this contribution.

The neutrino beam produced from muons decaying in a storage ring would be an ideal tool for precise neutrino cross section measurements and search for sterile neutrinos due to its precisely known flavour content and spectrum. In the proposed nuSTORM facility pions would be directly injected into a racetrack storage ring, where circulating muon beam would be captured. The storage ring has two options: a FODO solution with large aperture quadrupoles and a racetrack FFAG (Fixed Field Alternating Gradient) using the recent developments in FFAGs. Machine parameters, linear optics design and beam dynamics are discussed in this paper.

The Long Baseline Neutrino Facilities (LBNF) program aims to deliver a neutrino beam for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The current baseline for LBNF is a conventional magnetic horn and decay pipe system. Neutrinos from PIon beam Line (nuPIL) is a part of the optimization effort to optimize the LBNF. It consists of a pion beam line after the horn to clean the beam of high energy protons and wrong-sign pions before transporting them into a decay beam line, where instrumentation could be implemented. This paper focuses on the FFAG solution for this pion beam line. The resulting neutrino flux is also presented.

The Fermilab Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) was proposed to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and demonstrate leptonic CP violation. The current design of the facility that produces the neutrino beam (LBNF) uses magnetic horns to collect pions and a decay pipe to allow them to decay. In this paper, a design of a possible alternative for the conventional neutrino beam in LBNF is presented. In this design, a FODO magnet beam line is used to collect the pions from the downstream face of a horn, bend them by  ∼ 5.8 degrees and then transport them in a straight beam line where they decay to produce neutrinos. The idea of using neutrinos from the PIon beam Line (nuPIL) provides flavor-pure neutrino beams that can be well understood by implementing standard beam measurement technology. The neutrino flux and the resulting δCP sensitivity from the FODO nuPIL are also presented in the paper.

AWAKE is a unique experiment that aims to demonstrate the proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration. In this experiment, proton bunches from the SPS accelerator will be injected into a 10m long pre-formed plasma section to form wakefields of hundreds MV/m to several GV/m. A second beam, e.g., the witness beam, will be injected after the protons in an appropriate phase to gain energy from the wakefields. A photo-injector will be utilised to deliver this second beam. It consists of an S-band RF gun followed by a meter long accelerating travelling wave structure (ATS). The RF gun was recuperated from existing PHIN photo-injector. A 3D RF design of the ATS was done by using the CST code and the field maps produced were used to characterise the electron beam dynamics under space charge effect by using the PARMELA code. The impact of the mechanical errors on the beam dynamics were investigated.
