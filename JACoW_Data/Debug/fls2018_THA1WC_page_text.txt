Many research and applications areas require photon sources capable of producing extreme ultra-violet (EUV) to gamma-ray beams with reasonably high fluxes and compact footprints. We explore the feasibility of a compact energy-recovery linac EUV free electron laser (FEL)*, and of a multi-MeV gamma-rays source based on inverse Compton scattering from a high intensity UV FEL emitted by the electron beam itself. In the latter scenario, the same electron beam is used to produce gamma-rays in the 10-20 MeV range and UV radiation in the 1015 eV range, in a ~4x22 m2 footprint system.**

Compact monochromatic X-ray sources based on very high field acceleration and very short period undulators may revolutionize diverse advanced X-ray applications ranging from novel X-ray therapy techniques to active interrogation of materials, by making them accessible in cost and size. Such compactness may be obtained by an all-optical approach, which employs a laser-driven high gradient accelerator based on inverse free electron laser (IFEL), followed by an inverse Compton scattering (ICS) IP, a scheme where a laser is used as an undulator. We discuss experimental progress in understanding high-intensity effects in ICS, as well as the development of an efficient IFEL. We then describe the proof-of-principle of an all-optical IFEL-based system , where a TW-class CO2 laser pulse is split in two, with half used to accelerate a high quality electron beam up to 84 MeV through the IFEL interaction, and the other half acts as an electromagnetic undulator to generate up to 13 keV X-rays via ICS. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this scheme, which can be joined with other techniques such as laser recirculation to yield very compact, high brilliance, keV to MeV photon sources.

Energy-recover linacs (ERLs) have been developed mainly for high-power free electron lasers and future synchrotron light sources but have advantages in Compton sources as well, because the electron beam of high-average current and small emittance in ERLs contribute directly to generation of high-flux and narrow-bandwidth photons via Compton scattering. For demonstrating feasibility of ERL-based Compton sources, we conducted an experiment at the Compact ERL (cERL), where 7-keV X-ray photons with narrow bandwidth, 0.4% (rms) with an opening angle of 0.14 mrad, were generated by colliding an electron beam of 20 MeV with a laser of 1064 nm wavelength. In this talk, we overview the status of ERL-based Compton sources including relevant accelerator and laser components and discuss future perspectives of ERL-based Compton sources for keV and MeV photons.
