The test facility and synchrotron light source ANKA at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) operates in the energy range from 0.5 to 2.5 GeV and can generate brilliant coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the THz range employing a dedicated bunch length-reducing optic at 1.3 GeV beam energy. The high degree of spatial compression leads to complex longitudinal dynamics and to time evolving sub-structures in the longitudinal phase space of the electron bunches. The results of the micro-bunching instability are time-dependent fluctuations and strong bursts in the radiated THz power. To study these fluctuations in the emitted THz radiation simultaneously for each individual bunch in a multi-bunch environment, fast THz detectors are combined with KAPTURE, the dedicated KArlsruhe Pulse Taking and Ultrafast Readout Electronics system, developed at KIT. In this contribution we present measurements conducted to study possible multi-bunch effects on the characteristic bursting behavior of the micro-bunch instability.

Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is an essential issue in modern accelerators. We propose a new method to examine CSR in the time domain using an unstructured Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The method uses a 2D spatial discretization in the longitudinal and transverse coordinates (Z,X) with a Fourier series decomposition in the transverse coordinate Y and computes the fields modally. Additionally, by alignment of mesh element interfaces along a source reference orbit, DG methods can naturally handle discontinuous or thin sources in the transverse X direction. We present an overview of the method, illustrate it by calculating wake potentials in a model problem, and in a bunch compressor.

FACET-II will be a new test facility, starting construction in 2018 within the main SLAC Linac. Its purpose is to build on the decades-long experience developed conducting accelerator R&D at SLAC in the areas of advanced acceleration and coherent radiation techniques with high-energy electron and positron beams. The positron system design utilizes an existing W-Re target in Linac Sector 19, driven by 4 nC electrons bunches at 10 GeV. We present the design of a 335 MeV, 21.4 m circumference damping ring required to damp emittance from a modified positron return beamline by a factor of 500. The transverse emittance is calculated to be 6 um-rad, fully coupled, with a bunch length of 4 mm and energy spread 0.06 %, at a bunch charge of 1 nC. The arc magnets need to be especially compact due to tight space constraints (installation will be in the existing SLAC Linac tunnel, Sector 10, with 3 m width available) and were a key design challenge. We present a solution with combined function bend/quadrupole/sextupole magnets which have been modelled in 3D using Opera.
