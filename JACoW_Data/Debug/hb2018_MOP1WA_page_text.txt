J-PARC RCS: Effects of Emittance Exchange on Injection Painting
20

The J-PARC RCS is a high-power rapid cycling synchrotron aiming for a 1-MW output beam power. This talk reports the recent progress of the J-PARC RCS beam commissioning and operation especially focusing on our efforts for beam dynamics issues that we faced during the process of the beam power ramp-up.

High Intensity Issues in Storage Rings

Storage Rings have peculiar issues for operation with high beam intensity. They can be caused by the application of beam cooling which results in highest beam quality. The heating by intrabeam scattering limits the achievable phase space density, but also space charge can be an issue when the ring is operated with low energy beams with high charge. The limits are even more severe when the beam is bunched for accumulation in longitudinal phase space or due to experiments which require a bunched stored beam.
