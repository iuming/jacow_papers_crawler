In ITEP the project of multidiscipline facility Based on ECR ion source and Linear Accelerator (BELA) is started. The injector part of facility is based on combinaions of ECR ion source and dc H and He source will provide the multy beams irradiation of the reactor materials for modeling experiments. The cw RFQ and following DTL will enable the set of experimental activity both for fundamental physics and for parctical applications.
