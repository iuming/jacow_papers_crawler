For Shanghai HIgh repetition rate XFEL aNd Extreme light facility(SHINE), EPICS is adopted as standard to build the complex control system which involves hundreds of IOCs and millions of records. Most of IOCs run in industrial control computers as soft IOC. However, with the large amount of PVs, the need has emerged to develop remote tools to monitor all the channels and IOCs. One application backed by MySQL is designed, running periodically to interact with EPICS system where to take data from run-time databases via Channel Access and pvAccess. We embed scripting codes into the IOC startup script to realize that as soon as the IOC starts up, the information of the server’s address, the IOC installation path, and all the records maintained by the IOC will be automatically pushed to the application and then stored in the database. With this necessary information, we could access all the active IOCs and PVs. Another web application is designed to render servers, IOCs and PVs data in MySQL on the web to give us an overall running status of the control system. We also fully consider the modularity and portability for the applications to apply and extend in none-SHINE environments.

The LoKI Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) instrument will be one of the first instruments to be commissioned at the European Spallation Source (ESS), and will contribute to the early science programme. The detector for the instrument was tested at the ISIS neutron source facility in March of 2022, and this paper outlines the data acquisition software pipeline. It consists of a readout master, an Event Formation Unit (EFU), an instance of Kafka, a NeXus file writer, and, the data reduction software, Scipp. The readout master is responsible for synchronising detector readout timestamps with an external reference, and aggregating those readouts into UDP packets sent to the EFU. The EFU processes the readout data to produce event messages containing a location and time of arrival for each neutron event detected, and acts as a Kafka producer sending event messages to Kafka. The NeXus file writer consists of a Kafka consumer that compiles event messages and other experiment data from a given time interval into a single NeXus file for further analysis. Finally, Scipp is a data reduction python library used to visualise and analyse the experiment data after an experiment is completed.

Experimental data collection is the essential process of acquiring experimental raw data along with its associated metadata from SESAME beamlines. For data collection and processing; scanning modes, data and metadata formats, and data visualisation are only a few aspects in which individual beamlines differ from each other. In addition, the volume of experimental datasets every experimental day might range from a few gigabytes to many terabytes. Herein, the effectiveness of the experiments being conducted at SESAME depends heavily on the efficiency and reliability with which experimental data are collected. Each beamline at SESAME has its own Data Acquisition (DAQ) that ensures that experimental raw data and metadata are not randomly generated and are stored together in a stander and well-defined file formats in compliance with SESAME Experimental Data Management Policy. In this paper, we present the standards and features employed in SESAME’s DAQ systems, as well as the experimental data creation, curation, storage, and accessibility pipeline currently being built for SESAME beamlines.
