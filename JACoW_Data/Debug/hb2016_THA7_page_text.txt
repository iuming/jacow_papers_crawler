For the future operation of the SIS18 as a booster synchrotron for the FAIR SIS100, space charge and beam lifetime are expected to be the main intensity limitations. Intensity is limited in part by the space-charge-induced incoherent tune shift in bunched beams. A co-propagating, low energy electron lens can compensate for this tune shift by applying opposing space-charge fields in the ion beam. In this paper, we study the effect of using the existing electron cooler at the SIS18 as a space charge compensation device. We anticipate beta beating may arise due to the singular localized focusing error, and explore the possibility of adding additional lenses to reduce this error. We also study the effect of electron lenses on the coherent (collective) and incoherent (single-particle) stopbands. Furthermore, we estimate the lifetime of partially stripped heavy-ions due to charge exchange process in the lens.

Understanding space charge effects in FFAG is crucial in order to assess their potential for high power applications. This paper shows that, to carry out parametric studies of these effects in FFAG, the average field index of the focusing and defocusing magnets are the natural parametrization. Using several classes of particle distribution functions, we investigate the effects of space charge forces on the non-linear beam dynamics of FFAG and provide stability diagrams for an FFAG-like lattice. The method developed in this study is mainly applicable to systems with slowly varying parameters, i.e slow acceleration.

The beams required for the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN call for efficient mechanisms to suppress transverse collective instabilities. In addition to octupole magnets installed for the purpose of Landau damping, we propose to use radio frequency (rf) quadrupole structures to considerably enhance the aforementioned stabilising effect. By means of the PyHEADTAIL macroparticle tracking code, the stabilising mechanism introduced by an rf quadrupole is studied and discussed. As a specific example, the performance of an rf quadrupole system in presence of magnetic octupoles is demonstrated for HL-LHC. Furthermore, potential performance limitations such as the excitation of synchro-betatron resonances are pointed out. Finally, efforts towards possible measurements with the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) are discussed aiming at studying the underlying stabilising mechanisms experimentally.

Nonlinear quasi-integrable optics is a promising development on the horizon of high-intensity ring design. Large amplitude-dependent tune spreads, driven by strong nonlinear magnet inserts, lead to decoherence from incoherent tune resonances. This reduces intensity-driven beam loss while quasi-integrability ensures contained orbits. The experimental program at the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) will explore the performance of a strong octupole lattice at a range of operating points. Early measurements use a distributed octupole lattice, consisting of several small octupole inserts. We vary lattice tune to change the quasi-integrable condition as well as probe behavior near different resonant conditions. Simulation results show there should be invariant conservation under carefully chosen conditions. We discuss the effect of steering errors on the lattice performance and on-going efforts to reduce these errors. We also discuss plans for a single-channel insert.

The CERN PS Booster (PSB) is presently running with a space-charge tune spread larger than 0.5 at injection. Since the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will require beams with twice the intensity and brightness of today, the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) Project is putting in place an upgrade program for all the injector chain and, in particular, it relies on the important assumption that the PS Booster can successfully produce these beams after the implementation of the 160 MeV H− injection from Linac4. This contribution describes the studies (measurements and simulations) that have been carried out to confirm that the PSB can indeed perform as needed in terms of beam brightness for the future HL-LHC runs. The importance of the mitigation measures already in place, such as the correction of the half-integer line, and the effects of non-linear resonances on the beam are also discussed.

In J-PARC Main Ring, transverse intra-bunch oscillations have been observed during the injection and at the onset of acceleration. Up to now, the beam instability is suppressed by the intra-bunch feedback system, where the stripline beam position monitors operate at 108.8 MHz. However, there is a concern that electron cloud instabilities may appear and limit the beam current at future higher power operations. For the case, we have developed a wider-band (several GHz) beam position monitor by deforming the electrode shapes. The modification of the electrode can be done not to enhance the beam coupling impedance. For the typical electrode shapes, we show the coupling impedances as well as the frequency responses of the electrodes.
