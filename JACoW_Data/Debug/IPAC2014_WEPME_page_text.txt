In a SRF photoinjector the close relationship between the laser pulse and the generated electron bunch parameters requires continuous monitoring of some of the laser pulse parameters. A laser diagnostic system, called virtual cathode, is a key part of a system that controls the stability of the laser. One of the main challenges for the virtual cathode is to cover the large dynamic range of the photocathode laser between commissioning at 120 Hz and operation at 1.3 GHz repetition rate with constant laser pulse parameters. The design of the virtual cathode as well as first measurements with a photocathode drive laser for the SRF injector test facility GunLab of BERLinPro will be presented.

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator complex utilizes charge-exchange injection to stack a high-intensity proton beam in the accumulator ring for short-pulse neutron production. A foil-less charge exchange injection method was researched at SNS by using a laser assisted H− beam stripping scheme. Following a proof-of-principle experiment using a Q-switched laser, a new experiment is being prepared to demonstrate laser stripping over a 10-us macropulse. In this talk, we will report the design and measurement results of the laser system for the next stage laser stripping experiment. The laser system adopts a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) configuration and contains an actively mode-locked fiber seeder, macropulse generator, multiple-stage Nd:YAG amplifiers, harmonic converters, and control electronics. The laser system generates 50 ps/402.5 MHz pulses (at a macropulse mode) with multiple megawatt peak power at a wavelength of 355 nm. The measurement results of laser pulse width, spectrum, spatial/temporal beam quality and their parameter dependence will be described.

Enhanced field emission (EFE) limits the performance of both superconducting and normal conducting high-gradient accelerating structures. Systematic field emission scanning microscopy and correlated SEM/EDX measurements of relevant Nb and Cu samples have revealed particulates and surface irregularities with field enhancement factors b = 10 - 90 as origin of EFE. Based on sufficient emitter statistics, an exponential increase of the emitter number density N with increasing surface field (E) was found. This allows a prediction of the EFE loading of future ILC and CLIC accelerating structures by scaling of N to relevant E and using a weighted integration over the high-field cavity surface. Accordingly, an electropolished (Ra < 300 nm) and dry-ice cleaned (DIC) TESLA-shape 9-cell 1.3 GHz Nb cavity * will still suffer from EFE at Eacc = 35 MV/m (N = 0.3 /cm² at Epeak = 70 MV/m). Moreover, a diamond-turned, chemically etched and DIC 11.2 GHz Cu structure ** will breakdown at Eacc = 100 MV/m (N = 20 /cm² at Epeak = 243 MV/m). Possible improvements, i.e. by emitter processing will be discussed.

Enhanced field emission (EFE), resulting in dark currents and electric breakdowns, is one of the main gradient limitations for the CLIC accelerating structures (actual design Eacc = 100 MV/m, Epeak = 240 MV/m *). Measurements on diamond-turned, flat (Ra = 158 nm) Cu samples showed first EFE at surface fields Es = 130 MV/m. In order to reduce EFE, we have installed a commercial dry ice cleaning (DIC) system in a clean room environment (class iso 5). Accordingly, the number density of emitters (N) was significantly decreased by DIC from N = 52 /cm² to N = 12 /cm² at Es = 190 MV/m. Furthermore we have tested two diamond-turned and chemically etched (SLAC treatment, Ra = 150 nm) Cu samples after DIC resulting in EFE onset at 230 MV/m. Locally measured I(V) curves of the strongest emitters yielded field enhancement factors b = 10 – 90 (10 – 85) on the diamond-turned (chemically etched), respectively. SEM and EDX investigations of the located emission sites revealed surface defects and few particulates (Al, Ca, Si) as origin of the EFE. Moreover, strong emitter activation effects were observed. A possible breakdown mechanism based on this EFE activation will be discussed.

Solid state RF power amplifiers have been considered as an attractive candidate for providing the high power RF power required in increasing number of accelerator applications in recent years. Due to the advantages of these amplifiers and based on the successful experience done in other light sources; ILSF RF group has started R&D in design and fabrication of solid state amplifiers. Two modules based on two different LDMOS transistors have been developed successfully at 500MHz. The measured characteristics are presented and compared in this paper. Combining of 8 such modules is under test to achieve 4kW output power as the first stage of the conceptually designed combining network. This paper outlines the design concept of the different parts of the amplifiers and presents the experimental results obtained so far.

The concept of the six bunch generator cell for the washers and diaphragm loaded structure (Moscow Meson Factory) power supply is proposed. The required power is 0.8 MW on the 991 MHz frequency. The high-voltage electron gun produces electron bunches and puts them into the cylindrical resonator tuned to TE02 mode and operating frequency. Bunches produces RF field that takes energy from the following bunches and then energy transfer to the accelerating structure throw the tuned coupling system.

ALBA is a third generation synchrotron light source whose injector consists of a 100 MeV Linac and a Booster that accelerates the beam up to the full energy, 3 GeV. Two pulsed klystrons are used to feed the Linac cavities. Klystron 1 feeds the bunching section and also the first accelerating structure. Klystron 2 feeds exclusively the second accelerating structure. Recently, a S-band switching system installed in the waveguide system allows us to use also Klystron 2 to power the low-energy section and operate the Linac at lower energy, around 65 MeV. So that injection into the Booster is still possible while, in the meantime, Klystron 1 can be connected to a dummy load for reparation. Therefore, the time response after a klystron failure is improved. Details of the waveguide upgrade and the results of the ALBA Linac operated with only one klystron are presented.

Design and development of a 30 kW, 352 MHz pulsed RF solid-state power amplifier to be utilized for feeding re-bunching cavities in proton linac, is in progress at ESS-Bilbao. This modular transmitter is based on in-phase combination of compact, water-cooled 2 kW RF power modules, each one consists of two combined LDMOS transistors in balanced configuration. The modules include individual bias control, measurement and supply circuits. Gate modulation is foreseen to increase efficiency in pulsed regime that is up to 3ms RF pulse width and 10% duty cycle. The 2 kW RF power module has been developed and the test results are discussed.

The FREIA laboratory is a Facility for REsearch Instrumentation and Accelerator development at Uppsala University, Sweden, constructed recently to test and develop superconducting accelerating cavities and their high power RF sources. FREIA's activity target initially the European Spallation Source (ESS) requirements for testing spoke cavities and RF power stations, typically 400 kW per cavity. Different power stations will be installed at the FREIA laboratory. The first one is based on vacuum tubes and the second on a combination of solid state modules. In this context, we investigate different related aspects, such as power generation and power combination. For the characterization of solid-state amplifier modules in pulsed mode, at ESS specifications, we implemented a Hot S-parameters measurement set-up, allowing in addition the measurement of different parameters, such as gain and efficiency. We developed also a new solid-state amplifier module at 352 MHz, using commercially available LDMOS transistors. Preliminary results show a drain efficiency of 71% at 1300 W pulsed output power.

The CLIC study has progressively tested prototype accelerating structures which incorporate an ever increasing number of features which are needed for a final version installed in a linear collider. The most recent high power test made in the CERN X-band test stand, Xbox-1, is a of a CERN-built prototype which includes damping features but also compact input and output power couplers, which maximize the overall length to active gradient ratio of the structure. The structure’s high-gradient performance, 100 MV/m and low breakdown rate, matches previously tested structures validating both CERN fabrication and the compact coupler design.

During the long shutdown 1 (LS1), several maintenance, consolidation and upgrade activities have been carried out in LHC’s injector chain. Each machine has specific vacuum requirements and different history, which determine the present status of the vacuum components, their maintenance and consolidation needs. The present work presents the priorities agreed at the beginning of the LS1 period and their implementation. Of particular relevance are the interventions in radioactive controlled areas where several leaks due to stress corrosions stopped the operations in the past years. The strategy to reduce the collective dose is presented, in particular the use of remote controlled robots. An important part of the work performed during this period involves supporting other teams (acceptance tests, new equipment installation, etc.). Finally, as a result of the LS1 experience, a medium to long term strategy is depicted, focusing on the preparation of the next shutdown (LS2) and the integration of LINAC4 in the injector chain during the same period.

Solid-state transmitter for booster and storage ring in synchrotron would be composed of hundreds of amplifier modules. The amplifier module is biased at class AB and constructed in push-pull operation. Recent trend of amplifier module design features higher power up to 800 Watts and equipped planar balun (balance-unbalance converter) for push-pull operation. In NSRRC, the exclusive round planar design has encounter high temperature situation at kW range. Therefore, further study on this thermal condition is carried out in this study. Four types of planar balun design and two laminate materials are used for heat analysis. The typical coaxial balun is also applied on actual amplifier design. The results bring the better design with proper laminate choice and leads to acceptable thermal distribution with 1kW output power at 500MHz. Besides, for a more compact module with higher output power, the combination of two chips on the same circuit reaching 1.8kW is also presented.

Diversified Technologies, Inc. (DTI) is currently building and will deliver in early 2014 two solid-state pulsed klystron transmitters. Though not identical, the units are similar in design, and will be delivered to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and Daresbury Laboratory in England. DTI’s goal across these two projects is to develop a complete package which can subsequently be marketed in the high peak power laboratory transmitter market. The modulator is a pulse transformer-coupled hybrid system, including ancillary klystron components (i.e., focus coil, socket) but not the actual klystron tube. Both systems employ a relatively simple modulator, consisting of an energy storage capacitor, a high voltage series switch, a step-up pulse transformer, and a passive pulse-flattening circuit. This arrangement gives an extremely flat pulse and allows the use of a moderate value of storage capacitor. The DTI switch can open or close as commanded, so the pulse width is adjusted by the gate pulse to the system.

The VSL3616 GaN SSPA is a 1.3 GHz, 700 watt CW, liquid-cooled solid state power amplifier (SSPA). It has exceptional amplitude and phase stability and is being used to drive the VKL9130A1 IOT in CPI’s VIL410 30 kW CW IOT transmitter. The VSL3616 SSPA is configured in a 19 inch rack mount enclosure. Higher power levels can be obtained by power combining multiple VSL3616 SSPAs. The VSL3616 SSPA has been designed for very tight amplitude and phase control. The amplitude ripple and phase ripple are specified to be better than 0.05% rms and better than 0.2 degrees rms, respectively. The stability of the output power is specified to be better than 0.1% over any 20 second period of time. This paper will describe the design and operation of the VSL3616 SSPA. Results from a 1000 hour life test will be presented.

The VIL10 Heatwave™ Inductive Output Tube (IOT) amplifier system has been developed to meet the requirements of superconducting RF accelerators. Two VIL410 systems were completed and delivered in April 2014. The VKL9130A1 IOT in the VIL410 provides up to 30 kW RF output power over a 5 MHz bandwidth centered at 1.30 GHz. It operates both CW and pulsed. The VIL410 amplifier has been designed to achieve very tight amplitude and phase control. The amplitude and phase ripple are specified to be better than 0.1% rms and better than 0.2 degrees rms, respectively. The stability of the output power is specified to be better than 0.2% over a 20 second period. In normal operation, smooth control of the output is accomplished via RF input from the low level system. The VIL410 uses CPI’s VSL3616 solid state power amplifier (SSPA) to drive the IOT. The VSL3616 is a 700 watt CW SSPA which operates at 250 watts CW in the VIL410. The VIL410 has an embedded processor that controls all internal functions of the amplifier system and interfaces directly to EPICS. The VIL410 can be operated locally using a LabView PC Host program or remotely by EPICS.

CPI has been designing and manufacturing fundamental power couplers for superconducting accelerators for over a dozen years. We have manufactured approximately 200 power couplers of 16 different designs. Power coupler frequencies have ranged from 175 MHz to 3.9 GHz and power levels have ranged from 5 kW to 500 kW average power. We have developed and qualified several key manufacturing processes including a high-RRR copper plating process and a titanium nitride coating process. In addition, we have established uniform quality control and inspection processes which ensure that the power couplers will meet the requirements for the intended use in superconducting accelerators. These processes have been developed, improved and/or qualified in collaboration with colleagues at superconducting accelerator facilities throughout the world. This paper will provide an overview of these critical manufacturing and quality control processes.

The proposed 7-bend achromat lattice for the new 6 GeV electron storage ring of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility imposes a change of the entire vacuum system. Small bore magnets will require low conductance vacuum chambers. Conventional vacuum pumps will have to be assisted by distributed pumping provided by Non-Evaporable Getter (NEG) coating. The time constraints for design, prototyping, pre-assembly, installation and commissioning of the new systems require simple solutions and the use of existing expertise where possible. In this paper the draft layout of the vacuum system will be explained, information about the expected dynamic pressure distribution and conditioning will be given. Some technical solutions to resolve specific issues arising from the small vacuum chamber dimensions and the dense arrangement of components are described.

The quality of the beam vacuum is crucial for the stable operation of synchrotrons with high intensity heavy ions. Cryogenic surfaces are capable of pumping residual gases by cryocondensation until the saturated vapor pressure (SVP) is reached. Even at LHe temperatures the SVP of hydrogen is too high. If the surface coverage is sufficiently low, residual gas can also be bound by cryosorption, yielding in acceptable low pressures. These pumping capabilities can be described by two parameters, both dependent on surface temperature and coverage: The sticking probability (SP), that is the chance of an impinging gas particle to be bound, and the mean sojourn time (MST) of a particle on the surface. To acquire these parameters, an experimental setup is currently built at GSI. It consists of a cryogenic chamber, cooled by a cold head and a warm part with vacuum diagnostics and gas inlet. It allows monitoring the pumping speed and also the equilibrium pressure of the cryogenic part from which the SP and the MST can be deducted. The results will be used to further improve the accuracy of the dynamic vacuum simulations in cryogenic areas of particle accelerators.

This paper presents an investigation of a CNT emitter-based extractor gauge which is designed for pressure reading in cryogenic ultra-high vacuum systems. The results show that the modified gauge works well in both room temperature and cryogenic vacuum environments. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the modified gauge responds much more sensitive to small pressure fluctuations in cryogenic environments than the same gauge type having a hot-filament cathode.

Design and construction process of special kind of sputter ion pump is described briefly in this paper. In order to investigate the optimization of effective parameters in choosing and designing ILSF ion pumps, this pump has been designed and manufactured. By optimizing some parameters such as dimension and shape of penning cells, anode voltage, magnetic field and internal structure of pump, it is possible to significantly decrease the cost of construction and operation of synchrotron vacuum system. One of the most important advantages of this design, is that the initial parameters and finally internal structure of the prototype pump are changeable easily. The effect of parameters like anode voltage, magnetic field etc. on pumping speed and final pressure are described. With the existing optimization it is expected that an ultimate pressure of 1x10-11 Torr could be achieved.

Iranian light source facility (ILSF) is a 3GeV, 400 mA, 3rd generation light source under design and construction. This paper describes the details of the preliminary magnetic design of the first prototype PPM undulator for the ILSF. In the preliminary design, the undulator period and some other parameters have been determined to reach desired x-ray spectrum to be used for soft x-ray application. A PPM layout and a model undulator with 16 poles is used to calculate the properties of the designs.

The detailed study of the Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) of technical Cu for very low electron landing energies (from 0 to 30 eV) is very important for electron cloud build up in high intensity accelerators and in many other fields of research. However, this question has been rarely addressed due to the intrinsic experimental complexity to control very low energy electrons. Furthermore, several results published in the past have been recently questioned for allegedly suffering from experimental systematics. In this paper, we critically review the experimental method used to study low energy SEY and define more precise energy regions, in which the experimental data can be considered valid. The new SEY curves are then fed into e-cloud simulation codes to address their impact for electron cloud predictions in the LHC.

Electron cloud is an ubiquitous effect in positively charged particle accelerators and has been observed to induce unwanted detrimental impacts on beam quality, stability, vacuum etc. A great effort has been recently devoted to the search of new material morphology and/or coatings which can intrinsically mitigate beam instabilities deriving from electron cloud effects. In this context, we present some characterization of Cu foams, available from the market, and their qualification in terms of their vacuum behavior, impedance, secondary electron yield, gas desorption etc. More experimental effort is required to finally qualify foams as a mature technology to be integrated in accelerator environments. But, our preliminary results suggests that, when compatible with geometrical constrains, Cu foams can be utilized when low desorption yields are required and as e-cloud moderator in future particles accelerators.

High luminosity particle accelerators can suffer from serious performance drop or limitations due to interaction of the synchrotron radiation produced by the accelerator itself with the accelerator walls. Such interaction may produce a number of photoelectrons, that can either seed electron cloud related instabilities and/or interact anyway with the beam itself, potentially causing its deterioration. To correctly take these effects into account simulation codes depends on the realistic knowledge of Reflectivity and Photoelectron Yield of technical material. In this work we present relevant experimental data for some of the mostly used technical surfaces in accelerators.

In high power beam accelerators, pressure of the beam line directly affects the amount of the beam loss. For example, in the early 1970’s in CERN’s Intersecting Storage Ring (ISR), the ion-induced pressure bump produced the fall-off of the beam current. 3GeV synchrotron (RCS) in J-PARC is no exception. RCS is one of the most high power beam accelerators in the world. It aims the 1 MW beam power, which corresponds to the average and peak beam current of 333 uA and about 10 A, respectively. In the present stage, the injection line called L3BT line (Linac to 3GeV Beam Transport line), is the section, where the pressure notably produces the beam loss. In this line, H− beam from Linac was converted to H0 by charge stripping due to the interaction between H− beam and the residual gas molecules. Such H0 was not bended by the injection septum magnets and directly hit the vacuum wall. We decided to add the vacuum pumps in this line to reduce the residual gas molecules. We will present the effectivity of the additional pumps on the basis of the measured results of the pressure improvement and the beam loss suppression.

In the process of magnetron sputtering deposition, electromagnetic fields have an important influence on the trajectory of particle movement and the properties of the TiN thin film in many cases. Even for simple geometries, the analytical prediction for charged particles trajectories is extremely cumbersome, so numerical simulations are essential to obtain a better understanding of the possible effects and helpful to optimize the design of experimental facility and experimental process. A software of CST PARTICLE STUDIOTM has been used to simulate the effect of magnetic and electric fields on electrons trajectories in the process of film coating. According to the simulation results, the improvement measures of the system design and experimental process have been achieved. The author put forward the improvement measures on film coating process according to the simulation results. The result shows that it is feasible and convenient to use three dimensional tool in the simulation of trajectory of electrons in a magnetron sputtering system.

In the MAX IV light-source in Lund, Sweden, the intense synchrotron radiation (SR) distributed along the ring generates important thermal and vacuum effects. By means of a Monte Carlo simulation package, which is currently developed at CERN, both thermal and vacuum effects are quantitatively analysed, in particular near the crotch absorbers and the surrounding NEG-coated vacuum chambers. Using SynRad+, the beam trajectory of the upstream bending magnet is calculated; SR photons are generated and traced through the geometry until their absorption. This allows an analysis of the incident power density on the absorber, and to calculate the photon induced outgassing. The results are imported to Molflow+, a Monte Carlo vacuum simulator that works in the molecular flow regime, and the pressure in the vacuum system and the saturation length of the NEG coating are determined using iterations.

The Test-Particle Monte Carlo code Molflow+ is getting more and more attention from the scientific community needing detailed 3D calculations of vacuum in the molecular flow regime mainly, but not limited to, the particle accelerator field. Substantial changes, bug fixes, geometry-editing and modelling features, and computational speed improvements have been made to the code in the last couple of years. This paper will outline many of these new features, and show examples of applications to the design and analysis of vacuum systems at CERN and elsewhere.

In order to cope with space limitations of existing infrastructure, the cryomodules of the HIE-Isolde superconducting linac feature a common insulation and beam vacuum, imposing the severe cleanliness standard of RF cavities to the whole cryostat. Protection of the linac vacuum against air-inrush from the three experimental stations through the HEBT lines relies on fast valves, triggered by fast cold cathode gauges. To evaluate the leak propagation velocity as a function of leak size and geometry of the lines, a computational and experimental investigation is being carried out at CERN. A 28 m long tube is equipped with strain gauges installed on thin-walled flanges, as well as fast reacting glow discharge and cold-cathode gauges. A leak is opened by the effect of a cutting pendulum, equipped with an accelerometer for data acquisition triggering, on a thin aluminium window followed by a calibrated orifice. The air inrush dynamics is simulated by Test-Particle Monte Carlo in the molecular regime and by Finite Elements fluid dynamics in the viscous regime.

Beam losses may cause activation of vacuum chamber walls, in particular those of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. For the High Luminosity LHC, the activation of such vacuum chambers will increase. It is therefore necessary to use a vacuum chamber material which interacts less with the circulating beam. While beryllium is reserved for the collision point, a good compromise between cost, availability and transparency is obtained with aluminium alloys; such materials are a preferred choice with respect to austenitic stainless steel. Manufacturing a thin-wall aluminium vacuum chamber presents several challenges as the material grade needs to be machinable, weldable, leak-tight for small thicknesses, and able to withstand heating to 250°C for extended periods of time. This paper presents some of the technical challenges during the manufacture of these vacuum chambers and the methods for overcoming production difficulties, including surface treatments and NEG thin-film coating.

During the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) first long shut down (LS1), a large number of vacuum tests are carried out on consolidated or newly fabricated pieces of equipment. In such a way, the vacuum compatibility is assessed before installation in the UHV system of the LHC. According to the equipment’s nature, the vacuum acceptance tests consist in functional checks, leak tests, outgassing rate measurements, evaluation of contaminants by Residual Gas Analysis (RGA), pumping speed measurements, and qualification of the sticking probability of Non-Evaporable-Getter coating. In this paper, the methods used for the tests and the acceptance criteria are described. A summary of the measured vacuum characteristics for the tested components is also given.

The operation of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at nominal beam parameters is expected for the next years (2015). Increased synchrotron-radiation stimulated-desorption and electron-cloud build-up are expected. A deep understanding of the interactions between the proton beams and the beampipe wall is mandatory to control the anticipated beam-induced pressure rise. A Vacuum Pilot Sector (VPS) has been designed to monitor the performance of the vacuum system with time. The VPS is installed along a double LHC room temperature vacuum sector (18 m long, 80 mm inner diameter beam pipes) and includes 8 standard modules, 1.4 m long each. Such modules are equipped with residual gas analysers, Bayard-Alpert gauges, photon and electron flux monitors, etc. The chosen modular approach opens the possibility of studying different configurations and implementing future modifications. This contribution will describe the apparatus, the control system designed to drive measurements and possible applications during the next LHC operational phase.

Beryllium beam vacuum chambers pass through the aperture of the large dipole magnet and particle acceptance region of the LHCb experiment, coaxial to the LHC beam. At the interior of the magnet, a system of rods and cables supports the chambers, holding them rigidly in place, in opposition to the vacuum forces caused by their conical geometry. In the scope of the current upgrade program, the steel and aluminium structural components are replaced by a newly designed system, making use of Beryllium, in addition to a number of organic materials, and are optimized for overall transparency to incident particles. Presented in this paper are the design criteria, along with the unique design developments carried out at CERN, and furthermore, a description of the technologies procured from industrial partners, specifically in obtaining the best solution for the cable components.

The LHC experimental beam pipes are being improved during the ongoing long shutdown 1 (LS1). Several vacuum chambers have been tested and validated before their installation inside the detectors. The validation tests include: leak tightness, ultimate vacuum pressure, material outgassing rate, and residual gas composition. NEG coatings are assessed by hydrogen sticking probability measurement with the help of Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper the motivation for the beam pipe upgrade, the validation tests of the components and the results are presented and discussed.

Integration of new equipment in the long straight sections (LSS) of the LHC must be compatible with the TiZrV non-evaporable getter thin film that coats most of the 6-km-long room-temperature beam pipes. This paper focus on two innovative accelerator devices to be installed in the LSS during the long shutdown 1 (LS1): the beam gas vertex (BGV) and a beam bending experiment using crystal collimator (LUA9). The BGV necessitates a dedicated pressure bump, generated by local gas injection, in order to create the required rate of inelastic beam-gas interactions. The LAU9 experiments aims at improving beam cleaning efficiency with the use of a crystal collimator. New materials like fibre optics, piezoelectric components, and glues are proposed in the original design of the two devices. The integration feasibility of these set-ups in the LSS is presented. In particular outgassing tests of special components, X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy, analysis of NEG coating behaviour in presence of glues during bake-out, and pressure profile simulations will be presented.

The High Intensity and Energy Isolde (HIE-Isolde) project aims at increasing the energy and intensity of the radioactive ion beams (RIB) delivered by the present Rex-Isolde facility. Energy up to 10MeV/amu will be reached by a new post-accelerating, superconducting (SC) linac. Beam will be delivered via a HEBT to three experimental stations for nuclear physics. To keep the SC linac compact and avoid cold-warm transitions, the cryomodules feature a common beam and insulation vacuum. Radioactive ion beams require a hermetically sealed vacuum, with transfer of the effluents to the nuclear ventilation chimney. Hermetically sealed, dry, gas transfer vacuum pumps are preferred to gas binding pumps, for an optimized management of radioactive contamination risk during maintenance and intervention. The vacuum system of the SC-linac is isolated by two fast valves, triggered by fast reacting cold cathode gauges installed on the warm linac, the HEBT and the experimental stations. Rough pumping is distributed, while the HEBT turbomolecular pumps also share a common backing line. Slow pumpdown and ventilation of the cryomodules are studied to avoid particulate movement in the viscous regime.

After the Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) and the consolidation of the magnet bus bars, the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will operate with nominal beam parameters. Larger beam energy, beam intensities and luminosity are expected. Despite the very good performance of the beam vacuum system during the 2010-12 physics run (Run 1), some particular areas require attention for repair, consolidation and upgrade. Among the main activities, a large campaign aiming at the repair of the RF bridges of some vacuum modules is conducted. Moreover, consolidation of the cryogenic beam vacuum systems with burst disk for safety reasons is implemented. In addition, NEG cartridges, NEG coated inserts and new instruments for the vacuum system upgrade are installed. Besides these activities, repair, consolidation and upgrades of other beam equipment such as collimators, kickers and beam instrumentations are carried out. In this paper, the motivation and the description for such activities, together with the expected beam vacuum performance after LS1, are described in detail.

Preliminary Design of the HiLumi-LHC Triplet Area Beam Screen

The so-called beam screen (BS) is a proven solution for intercepting the thermal loads caused by the circulating beams in the cryogenically-cooled sections of the LHC and minimizing dynamic vacuum effects. The new triplet area foreseen for the HiLumi-LHC machine upgrade has the additional feature of needing internal tungsten shields to reduce the amount of collision debris which is deflected by the high-gradient triplet magnets towards the superconducting magnets' cold masses and coils. The very aggressive optics design, based on large beam separations, calls for a maximum of physical space to remain available to the counter rotating beams in the common BS. This places severe constraints to the fabrication and installation tolerances of the BS itself, in addition to affecting the design and routing of the cryogenic lines in the area. The latest version of the BS design will be shown and discussed, together with future plans for testing materials, fabrication procedures, and installation.

One important feature of the upgrade is the installation of very high-gradient triplet magnets for focusing the beams at the collision points of the two high-luminosity detectors ATLAS and CMS. Other important topics are new superconducting D1 magnets, installation of crab cavities, and re-shuffling of the dispersion suppression area. Based on the current magnetic lattice set-up and beam orbits, a detailed study of the emission of synchrotron radiation (SR) and related photon-induced desorption (PID) has been carried out. A significant amount of SR photons are generated by the two off-axis beams in the common vacuum chamber of the triplet area, about 57 m in length. Ray-tracing Montecarlo codes SYNRAD+ and Molflow+ have been employed in this study. The related PID pressure profiles will be shown, together with simulations using the code VASCO for the analysis of beam losses and background in the detectors, including electron cloud effects.

Coating materials will be used in the CLIC damping rings (DR) to suppress two-stream effects. In particular, NEG coating is necessary to suppress fast beam ion instabilities in the electron damping ring (EDR). The electromagnetic (EM) characterization of the material properties up to high frequencies is required for the impedance modeling of the CLIC DR components. The EM properties for frequencies of few GHz are determined with the waveguide method, based on a combination of experimental measurements of the complex transmission coefficient S21 and CST 3D EM simulations. The results obtained from a NEG coated copper (Cu) waveguide are presented in this paper.

The vacuum interlock and monitor systems of Taiwan Photon Source are designed to maintain the ultra-high vacuum condition and to protect the vacuum devices. The pressure readings of ionization gauges are taken as the judgment logic to control the opening and closing of sector gate valves so as to protect the ultra-high vacuum condition. Monitors of the water-cooling system and the chamber temperature serve to protect vacuum devices from radiation hazards. The preparation, installation and status of the interlock and monitor systems are presented in this paper.

A ceramic chamber of novel type has been designed and fabricated. The uniformity of its inner thin film of deposited metal is improved to have a thickness error about 1 %. The average straightness error of the chamber (length 550 mm) is developed to be less than 55 μm. To fabricate the ceramic chamber of novel type, we first cleaned and joined the two halves; the metal films were deposited by sputtering. These two halves were next sealed with a glass powder colloid to become a ceramic tube. The rate of outgassing of this colloid is 3.57×10-12 Torr L s−1 cm-2 after baking. The ceramic tube was connected to a stainless-steel flange with the aid of a glass powder colloid and TIG welding. This ceramic test chamber will be installed in the experimental system to analyze the residual gas.

In the Taiwan Photon Source project, the storage ring includes 24 sectors (each of length 14 m) of an aluminium vacuum chamber system. The design, manufacture, cleaning, welding and assembly of the vacuum components were undertaken by the NSRRC vacuum group. The ultimate objective is to attain a leak-tight, ultra-high vacuum and a vacuum system with a small rate of outgassing. In this work, we used a residual-gas analyzer (RGA) to analyze the variation of residual gas during proceeding toward ultra-high vacuum. This process, which led the pressure down to ~10-11 torr, includes baking, operation of ion pumps, degassing of hot cathode gauges and activation of NEG pumps. When a sufficiently small low pressure is attained, the ion pumps are turned off to test the building up of pressure. The outgassing property and the variation of the residual gas of the aluminium chamber and the ion pumps can be measured.

The non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating, invented at CERN in 90s, is used nowadays in many accelerators around the world. The main advantages of using NEG coatings are evenly distributed pumping speed, low thermal outgassing rates and low photon and electron stimulated gas desorption. The only downside of the NEG is its selective pumping: it pumps H2, CO, CO2 and some other gas species, but does not pump noble gases and hydrocarbons. However, in the accelerators where NEG coating could be beneficial, there is synchrotron radiation and photoelectrons that bombard vacuum chamber walls, it was found in our study that hydrocarbons can be pumped by NEG coating under electron and, most likely, photon bombardment. The detail and the results of this study are reported in this paper.

Non-evaporable getter thin films, which are currently being used in the ultra-high vacuum system of the Large Hadron Collider, normally consist of Ti, Zr and V, deposited by physical vapour deposition. In this study, the secondary electron yield (SEY) of bulk Ti, Zr, V and Hf have been investigated as a function of electron conditioning. The maximum SEYs of as-received Ti, Zr, V and Hf, are respectively 1.96, 2.34, 1.72 and 2.32, these reduce to 1.14, 1.13, 1.44 and 1.18 after electron conditioning. Surface chemical composition was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy which revealed that surface conditioning by electron bombardment promotes the growth of a thin carbon layer on the surface and consequently reduces the SEY of the surface as a function of electron dose. Heating a vanadium sample to 250°C resulted in diffusion of oxygen into the bulk and induced formation of metal carbide at the surface. However, the SEY stays the same even after heat-induced surface chemistry modification. Prolonged electron conditioning increases the surface oxygen but the surface is still predominantly covered with a thin graphitic layer and hence the SEY stays approximately constant.

Superconducting coatings for superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities is an intensively developing field that should ultimately lead to acceleration gradients better than those obtained by bulk Nb RF cavities. ASTeC has built and developed experimental systems for superconducting thin-film deposition, surface analysis and measurement of Residual Resistivity Ratio (RRR). Nb thin-films were deposited by magnetron sputtering in DC or pulsed DC mode (100 to 350 kHz with 50% duty cycle) with powers ranging from 100 to 600 W at various temperatures ranging from room temperature to 800 °C on Si (100) substrates. The first results gave RRR in the range from 2 to 22 with a critical temperature Tc=~9.5 K. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) and DC SQUID magnetometry revealed significant correlations between the film structure, morphology and superconducting properties.

A conceptual design is presented for a storage ring vacuum system at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) which is compatible with a multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice under development for the APS Upgrade (APS-U) project [1]. Together, the interface with the magnets, required quantity and stability of beam position monitors, synchrotron radiation loading, and beam physics requirements place a demanding set of constraints on the vacuum system design. However, the requirements can be satisfied with a hybrid system which combines conventional extruded aluminum chambers incorporating “antechambers” with a variety of simpler tubular chambers made variously of copper-plated stainless steel, NEG-coated copper, and bare aluminum. This hybrid system has advantages over an all NEG-coated copper system with regard to overall project risk, required installation time, and maintainability.

For SuperKEKB project, the electron beams with a charge of 5 nC and a normalized emittance of 10 μm are expected to be generated in the photocathode RF gun at the injector linac. An ytterbium (Yb)-doped laser system with a center wavelength of 259 nm and a pulse width of 30 ps is employed to obtain high peak energy pulses. Although, the pulse repetition of 25 Hz with double-bunch is required, more than 5 nC electron with single-bunch has so far been generated in the 2 Hz.

At the Electron Stretcher Facility ELSA of Bonn University, an upgrade of the maximum stored beam current from 20 mA to 200 mA is planned. The storage ring operates applying a fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s from 1.2 GeV to 3.5 GeV and a slow extraction afterwards over a few seconds to the hadron physics experiments. The intended upgrade is mainly limited by the coupled-bunch instabilities and the ability of bunch-by-bunch feedback systems to suppress such instabilities. In order to achieve optimum bunch-by-bunch feedback performance, the beam phase with respect to the master oscillator and the synchrotron frequency have to stay constant. This paper reports on a new high performance low level RF (LLRF) system. The system stabilizes the cavity field and is capable of executing fast voltage and phase ramps. The LLRF uses FPGA-based digital signal processing and includes cavity tuner control as well as fast interlocks and extensive diagnostics.

At the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany a high intensity antiproton beam will be produced. To provide the necessary 70 mA proton beam a dedicated proton linac (p-Linac) is under construction. The main acceleration will be provided by 9 novel CH-type cavities, of which 6 will be coupled in pairs to share the same klystron. To test the rf properties of these novel cavities, a test stand is under construction. An rf control system for the pulsed operation of these cavities has been developed at TU Darmstadt. It is based upon the digital cw rf control that is successfully in operation as part of the S-DALINAC at IKP Darmstadt. The latest developments will be presented.

This paper deals with the analytical modeling of lossy coaxial transmission lines in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 50 MHz with focus on corrugated coaxial lines with polyethylene foam as dielectric. The considered transmission lines are used in low-level radio frequency (LLRF) systems (< 5 MHz) at GSI. These applications require a high precision in amplitude and phase for the transmitted signals where a detailed knowledge of the line properties is of significant interest. As the corresponding data sheets do not provide appropriate data, the necessary data have been computed. The obtained results from the purely analytical model were then compared with previous measurements for validation purposes.

The European x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) is based on a 17.5 GeV super conducting pulsed linac and is scheduled to deliver its first beam in 2016. The first component of its accelerator chain, the RF gun, was installed in fall of 2013 and its commissioning is underway. This contribution gives an update on the low level radio frequency (LLRF) system development and installation for the XFEL. In particular, the installation, performance and conditioning results of the RF gun are presented. The subsequent steps toward LLRF components mass-production, testing and installation for the XFEL linac are also explained.

The Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) is the first linac which is equipped with a MTCA.4 based low level RF control system. Precise regulation of RF fields is essential for stable and and reproducible photon generation. Flash benefits from the performance increase using the new developments like, accurate and precise field detection devices. Further enourmous increase of processing capabilities allow for more sophisticated controller applications which better the overall performance of the regulation.

In order to increase system compactness, mitigate cabling problems, increase rack space, minimize points of failure in the system and reduce digital distortion leakage into the sensitive analog signals, the concept of the RF backplane located in the rear section of the MTCA.4 crate has been introduced. Besides signal distribution, the concept includes a signal generation module and backplane management module. The generation and splitting of the analog signals is taking place in slots 15 and 14 on the rear side in theμLO generation module (uLOG). This module generates the local oscillator signal, the clocks and feeds through the master reference signal over the RF backplane to the slots. In this paper we present the recent results of such system.

FERMI is a single-pass linac-based FEL user-facility covering the wavelength range from 100 nm (12 eV) to 4 nm (310 eV) and is located next to the third generation synchrotron radiation facility Elettra in Trieste, Italy. The 1.5 GeV S-band linac is composed of fifteen 3 GHz 45 MW peak RF power plants powering the gun, sixteen accelerating sections and the RF deflectors. The requirements on beam quality impose tight specifications on the stability of the electromagnetic fields that can be achieved only installing high reliable and high performance state of the art LLRF systems. While these requirements are presently met by the system installed, the on-going upgrade of the processing board with the final one will allow to add new functionalities of the system. One of the possible developments is the implementation of an intra-pulse feedback that will allow to apply the corrections inside the RF pulse. This paper provides an overview of the additional benefits that could be achieved and discusses the requirements and the constraints for the implementation in the machine.

Beam commissioning of the SuperKEKB will be started in 2015. A new LLRF control system, which is an FPGA-based digital RF feedback control system on the MicroTCA platform, has been developed to satisfy the requirement for high current beam operation of the SuperKEKB. Then final refinements were applied, and now the quantity production is in progress. As a new function, klystron phase lock loop was additionally implemented within the cavity feedback control loop in the FPGA, and it was successfully worked in the low-level operation test. For the SuperKEKB, damping ring (DR) is required for the positron injection. Therefore another new LLRF control system is under development for the DR-RF system. It is operated at the same RF-frequency as the main ring, and vector sum control of three cavities is needed in the DR-LLRF control. In this report, the development status and progress from the previous report will be presented including the RF reference distribution system.

A digital low-level radio frequency (LLRF) system has been developed and evaluated at compact Energy Recovery Linac (cERL) in High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Japan. A total of three two-cell cavities were installed for the injector, and two nine-cell cavities were installed for the main linac. The required RF stabilities for these cavities are 0.1% rms in amplitude and 0.1° rms in phase. To satisfy these requirements, we survey feedback parameters such as the proportional and integral (PI) gains. Furthermore, we evaluated the beam energy fluctuation due to the vector-sum controlling error between the cavities injectors 2 and 3. Finally, we present the performance of the LLRF system that was realized in the beam commissioning. This paper describes the current status of the LLRF system.

The second generation controller has been fabricated in house and used with 240mA beam current at beginning of this year. The stability of amplitude and phase reaches 0.089% (RMS) and 0.093 degree (RMS) respectively. The recent progress on digital LLRF for FEL will be also reported such as the development activities and test results on the local oscillation generation board and down converter board.

Performance of accelerators based on the superconductive cavities including FLASH and XFEL facilities at DESY is affected by cavity parameters variation over time. High gradient electromagnetic field inside cavities causes detuning due to the Lorentz force. In addition the quality factor of cavities can change during the RF field pulse. Currently used method for estimation of those parameters is based on the post-processing of the data recorded during operation of the RF. External servers calculate cavity parameters using cavity equation, forward power and probe signals collected during previous pulse. A novel approach* based on the component implemented in FPGA is presented. In the new method loaded quality factor and detuning are estimated in real-time during the RF pulse for increased reliability and better exception handling. Modified firmware of the LLRF control system based on the Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (MTCA) platform has been used for the method verification.

The Radiation Instrumentation Research Division of Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute is developing a 2856 MHz dual energy [9, 6 MeV] s-band RF electron linear accelerator for security inspection. The s-band dual energy electron accelerator generates dual x-ray energy by irradiating a bunched electron beam from the cavity to a tungsten target. By detecting an x-ray, the cargo security inspection system can distinguish between organic and inorganic materials. Synchronization of the resonant frequency between the cavity and RF driver is an important factor for the stable operation of an accelerator. With a low RF driver power using the AFC, stable accelerator operations and a uniform output beam power can be obtained. This indicates that an accurate cargo inspection is possible. We used phase a frequency detector that can detect a wide frequency band and synchronize the resonance frequency between the RF driver and cavity. In this paper, we introduce a more advanced AFC system than a conventional AFC system.

Two prototype LLRF systems were developed in collaboration with Pohang Accelerator Laboratory(PAL) and domestic companies. They are focused on the control of single klystron system to obtain mainly analogue performance. The low power test of the developed LLRF showed good performance previously. We experimentally tested LLRF in the klystron systems to see performance in the high power situation. They showed performance around the prototype specification for short time and relatively long time. During test some bugs are discovered and fixed.

The accelerator is pulsed at 14 Hz with a pulse length of 2.86 ms, and consists of both normal conduction and superconducting accelerating structures. The long pulse and the high goals of energy efficiency and availability create special challenges for the LLRF system.

Recent calculations concerning the shape of the quadrupole used as a focusing lens revealed a potential progress margin especially for short devices*. The main issues of the paper are related with the improvement of the performances of some standard quadrupolar focusing equipments considered here with an electrostatic technology i.e. the influence on the beam transmission, aberrations limitation, and reduction of beam losses. The joint research and development programme between a laboratory and the industry are expected to enable technology transfer, design optimization and cost reduction.

The Versatile Electron Linear Accelerator (VELA) facility will provide enabling infrastructures targeted at the development and testing of novel and compact accelerator technologies, specifically through partnership with industry and aimed at addressing applications in medicine, health, security, energy and industrial processing. The facility has now been commissioned at Daresbury Laboratory and the facility is now being actively utilised by industrial groups who are able to take advantage of the variable electron beam parameters available on VELA to either demonstrate new techniques and/or processes or otherwise develop new technologies for future commercial realisation. Examples of which to be presented include; demonstration of a new cargo scanning process, characterisation of novel, high performance beam position monitors, as well as other technology development applications.
