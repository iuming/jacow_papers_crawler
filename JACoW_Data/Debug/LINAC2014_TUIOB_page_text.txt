C-ADS linac is under key technology development stage. At present it focuses on the construction of two injectors with proton energy 10 MeV. One injector goes to 325 MHz RFQ and Spoke cavity technology being developed by IHEP in Beijing. The other injector consists of 162.5 MHz  RFQ and HWR cavity being developed by IMP in Lanzhou.  The construction of the high current ECR proton source, the CW RFQ accelerator, superconducting HWR and spoke cavities have made a great progress. It is expected to start 5 MeV CW proton beam commissioning by the end of 2014 for the both injectors in terms of  current status. This paper presents the status of the R & D activities for the C-ADS linac.

The operation of the 100MeV proton linear accelerator for multipurpose application started in July, 2013 at KOMAC (Korea Multipurpose Accelerator Complex), KAERI (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute). Also, the operation of the two beam lines, one is for 20MeV beam and the other for 100MeV beam, started in order to supply proton beams to users. The accumulated operation time was 2,290 hours and the proton beam was supplied to 937 samples in 2013. In addition to the beam service, the effort to increase the beam power is continuing in 2014. Beam commissioning and operation status of the linac will be presented in this talk.

To realize a full potential of J-PARC facility (1MW at 3 GeV), the J-PARC linac is upgraded from 181 MeV to 400 MeV by using an annular-ring coupled structure linac (ACS). The ACS modules and peripheral system were installed and commissioned in summer to autumn of 2013. Beam commissioning is about to start and results will be expected.

Linac of Chinese Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) project is under construction. The ion source is tested and good performance of beam current is obtained. The low level RF tuning is underway of the RFQ and assembling of DTL will start soon. Not only the construction of hardware, but some commissioning software packages have been developed and tested.
