It is well-known that electron cyclotron resonance ion sources exhibit instabilities when these sources’ minimum magnetic fields are approximately 80% of the resonant field or greater, but the reasons for this instability have yet to be satisfactorily explained. We show that raising the minimum field makes much faster heating modes accessible at lower energies that invite the onset of kinetic instabilities.

This work presents the first experimental characterization of cavity modes trapped within a plasma column in an axis-symmetric magnetic trap. Trapped wave has been characterized by means of a movable antenna as a function of the Bmin/BECR ratio and plasma parameters. The study demonstrates that E.M waves can be enclosed two R-cutoff layers, close to the B minimum position. Results suggest that the trapped waves consist of waves propagating across the magnetic field and storing large part of the E.M. power. If R-cut-off is removed by increasing the density, trapped waves are not detected longer. A typical Electron Energy Distribution Function composed by two different electron populations is measured in the layer where trapped waves are revealed, suggesting that additional heating is occurring.

A low temperature oven has been developed to produce calcium beam with Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source. The atom flux from the oven has been studied experimentally as a function of the temperature and the angle of emission by means of a quartz microbalance. The absolute flux measurement permitted to derive Antoine’s coefficient for the calcium sample used : A=8.98± 0.07 and B=7787± 110 in standard unit. The angular FWHM of the atom flux distribution is found to be 53.7±7.3 °at 848K. The atom flux hysteresis observed experimentally in several laboratories is explained as follows: at first calcium heating, the evaporation comes from the sample only resulting in a small evaporation rate. once a full calcium layer has formed on the crucible refractory wall, the caclcium evaporation surface includes the crucible’s enhancing dramatically the evaporation rate for a givent temperature. A Monte-Carlo code, developed to reproduce and investigate the oven behaviour as a function of temperature is presented. A discussion on the gas regime in the oven is proposed as a function of its temperature. A fair agreement between experiment and simulation is found.
