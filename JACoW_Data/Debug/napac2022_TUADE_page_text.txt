Many know the story of the Manhattan Project, and the crucial role played by Oppenheimer’s Laboratory at Los Alamos in the design, construction and deployment of the world’s first nuclear weapons. But what happened to the Laboratory after the war? Why did it remain in existence, and how did it evolve over the years? Alan Carr will discuss how Los Alamos National Laboratory has changed through the decades, and conclude by giving a quick survey of the modern institution on the eve of its 80th anniversary.
