In 2007, we installed a rotating disk stripper device at the final charge stripping section for the uranium (U) beam acceleration at RIKEN RI Beam Factory. The first rotating carbon disk (C-disk) stripper was useless because of its poor surface flatness and unexpected low density. In 2012, we started the stable U beam operation using beryllium (Be) as the disk material. We successfully improved the flatness of the Be-disk by special polishing technique in 2014, and the transmission efficiency was greatly improved as well. However, it seemed to be impossible that the Be-disk withstood the heat load of the expected intensity in future, considering its deformation. Then, the polishing technique for the Be-disk improvement was applied to the Glassy carbon (GC) disk. The GC-disk flatness was improved maintaining high density. In addition, a tested high-density highly oriented graphite sheet, which is fabricated from a high polymer film in high temperature and high pressure conditions, can be applied as the charge stripping disk since the better stripping efficiency and transmission value than those of Be and the C-disk were realized.

The GANIL facility (Grand Accélérateur National d'Ions Lourds) at Caen produces and accelerates stable ion beams since 1982 for nuclear physics, atomic physics, radiobiology and material irradiation. The range of stable beam intensity available at GANIL extends from very low intensity (< 109 pps) to high beam intensity (~2.1013 pps). The review of the operation from 2001 to 2015 is presented. One of the methods to produce exotic beam at GANIL, is the Isotope Separation On-Line method with SPIRAL1 facility. It is running since 2001, producing and post-accelerating radioactive ion beams mainly from gaseous elements. Due to the physicists demands for new radioactive nuclei, the facility is being improved in the framework of the project "Upgrade SPIRAL1". The goal of the project is to extend the mass range of post-accelerated as well as low energy exotic beams using devoted 1+ Target Ion Source System associated with a charge breeder. The latest results of the charge breeder tests and the status of the upgrade will be presented.

The LNS Superconducting Cyclotron is an isochronous 3-sector compact machine with a wide mass-energy range of heavy ions: beams from protons to lead from 10 to 80 AMeV have been accelerated for the past 20 years. The extraction efficiency is low since a big percentage of the accelerated beam is lost on the electrostatic deflector. Recently, the demand of intense light ion beams, A<20, arose to study rare processes such as the nuclear matrix element in the double charge exchange reactions. Extraction by stripping has been envisaged to increase the maximum intensity by a factor 10-100, so to reach beam power values of few kWatt. Here the feasibility study of the new extraction for this range of ions is presented. The new beam dynamics features have been evaluated and, as a consequence, mechanical constraints have been considered too. It emerges that a new wide extraction channel fulfils the beam requirements. Therefore, a new cryostat has to replace the present one. A first feasibility study of the new cryostat has already accomplished by the PSFC of MIT. A more complete technical design report is under preparation to have the necessary elements to estimate costs and time schedule.
