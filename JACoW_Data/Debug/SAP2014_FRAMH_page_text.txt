Funding: Supported by the ADS project in China (XDA03020000).
The ADS project in China is to build a proton Accelerator Driven sub-critical System around 2032. By using superconducting (SC) accelerating structures except the normal conducting (NC) RFQ, the driver accelerator runs in CW mode and accelerates the 10 mA proton beam from 35 keV at the ECR ion source exit to 1.5 GeV at the main linac exit to bombard the target to produce neutrons. To satisfy the restrict requirement on the stability, availability and reliability, two identical injectors will operate in parallel as hot spare for each other at the low energy stage, while local compensation method will be used to accomplish beam dynamics rematch at the high energy stage when certain device failure happens. Currently, there are two injector testing facility are being built at IHEP and IMP, respectively. The task of IHEP is to build a 10 MeV/325 MHz Injector I testing facility and accomplish the main linac design. Here, the progress on the beam dynamics studies for the ADS injector I and the main linac are presented.
