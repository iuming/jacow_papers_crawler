The results of systematic studies with electron-cooled bunched beams of highly charged ions at the Experimental Storage Ring ESR at GSI Helmholtzzentrum GmbH, Darmstadt are presented. The series of experiments were conducted during the beamtime block in 2016 for different ion species as well as ion beam energies. In these measurements, we recorded all three beam phase space planes simultaneously with high resolution, using a recently installed fast current transformer (to measure the bunch length, hence deduce the momentum spread) and ionization profile monitors (to measure horizontal and vertical emittances). A comparison of the results with those obtained with coasting beams is given as well.

The AD delivers antiprotons at 5.3 MeV. This is too high energy for the experiments, so >99.7% of antiprotons are lost. The solution: ELENA (Extra Low Energy Antiprotons) ' a new ring to decelerate the antiprotons further down to 100 keV. ELENA's circumference is 30.4 m (1/6 the size of the AD), it fits in available space in AD hall and allows installing all equipment without particular efforts. Lowest average field (beam rigidity over average radius) B'/R = 94 G (smaller than for AD 115 G). The talk will give an overview of ELENA and the layout with selected features and challenges, the status and an outlook of the next steps.

CRYRING@ESR is the early installation of the low-energy storage ring LSR, a Swedish in kind contribution to FAIR, which was proposed as the central decelerator ring for antiprotons at the FLAIR facility. An early installation opens the opportunity to explore part of the low energy atomic physics with heavy, highly charged ions as proposed by the SPARC collaboration but also experiments of nuclear physics background much sooner than foreseen in the FAIR general schedule. Furthermore, the ring follows in large parts FAIR standards, and is used to test the FAIR control system. CRYRING@ESR has been installed behind the existing experimental storage ring ESR starting in 2013. It has a local injector that is used for commissioning. In November 2016 the commissioning of the storage ring started and a first turn was achieved. After a complete bake out cycle and substantial developments of control system, diagnosis and others, commissioning was continued in late summer 2017. Stored as well as accelerated beam has been achieved by now. The remaining step is to take the electron cooler into operation, which is planned for November this year.

Overview of US Electron-ion Collider Project and its Beam Cooling Programs

Electron-Ion collider (EIC) utilizes deep-inelastic scatterings to probe structures of nucleus. HERA, the only e-p collider ever built and operated, ended its science program in 2007. Over the past 15 years, 7 next generation EICs were envisioned worldwide for high energy and nuclear physics. In the US, two electron-ion colliders, eRHIC and JLEIC, have been proposed in BNL and JLab respectively. The US EIC designs were guided by the science program (EIC White Paper). The US NSAC Long Range Plan (2015) recommended EIC as the next major facility in US for QCD frontier. If approved by DOE, construction will likely be completed around 2025. Cooling of proton/ion beams is essential for eRHIC and JLEIC to reach luminosity above 1034/cm2/s. It enables emittance reduction up to an order of magnitude in all dimensions. eRHIC adopts the novel Coherent-electron-Cooling (CeC) concept. JLEIC has chosen magnetized electron cooling for the baseline, utilizing a multi-stage cooling scheme. Both CeC and high energy magnetized EC are under active development: BNL plans to conduct a proof-of-principle test of CeC at RHIC next year; JLab focuses on a technical design and technology development for a high energy bunched beam electron cooler based on ERL and circulator ring.
