As part of the LEAPS*-INNOV** pilot project, Task 5.2 is dedicated to interferometers based online metrology developments applied to photon science instrumentation. One of the main objectives of Task 5.2 is to explore and develop the possibilities offered by interferometers (in particular fiber connected systems) to measure the sample position and its motions during typical synchrotron experiments. This four year program started in April 2021, with the participation to Task 5.2 of ALBA-CELLS, ESRF, HZB, PTB and SOLEIL. The objective of the poster is diffuse information on Task 5.2 current plans and to gather information on existing / on-going works and possible collaborations in the field of interferometers based metrology. *LEAPS: The League of European Accelerator-Based Photon Sources **LEAPS-INNOV is a pilot project submitted in reply to the INFRAINNOV-04-2020 European Union call for the implementation of open innovation and new strategies and tools for partnership with industry within the photon science community. It involves in particular the European synchrotron radiation light sources and free electron laser large-scale research infrastructures.

One of the most challenging problems for experimental setups at third-generation and especially fourth-generation synchrotrons are vibrations. In order to keep vibrations on a as low as possible level one must not only take extremely care in the design of all components but also have a profound knowledge of the sources of vibrations. We started a project to map the vibrations at PETRA III both locally and timely in order to get a better understanding of the influencing factors and possible consequences for the ongoing PETRA IV project. In this contribution we will report on our first results of this project.

The work here describes how vibration and the acoustics it produces have been embraced to achieve precision in the macro, micro, nano and pico regime. On the macro scale it has been harnessed to develop smart structures that use resonance and its subsequently high Q to accurately determine positioning and preloads on assemblies. These structures can be machined into support assemblies to ensure consistency in the results they produce as they are integral and never removed. This ensures the data they give is directly comparable pre and post service. The high Q they offer promises new levels of accuracy in assembly and a potential for an audit trail. The other application this work describes is the use of vibration to generate acoustic levitation for room temperature and time resolved sample delivery encompassing the micro, nano and pico regimes. Our methodology moves away from traditional Langevin horn cavities used by previous workers for levitation experiments to low power tractor beam ones specifically designed for light source applications. This has been complimented with the exciting technology of Poly Pico who can use acoustics to eject sample droplets in the order of 10 picolitres and at a rate of 50 kHz and on demand. These two technologies compliment each other beautifully for mixing experiments facilitating ’watching’ reactions taking place within a protein. Finally work describing how TEM grids can be filled for CryoEM using the Polypico technology and electro-steering to remove the need for any moving parts delivering discrete sample aliquots and at kHz time scales with micron accuracy.

This paper presents an investigation into the thermal instability problems that currently affect the ALBA Cooling System. During these periods of instabilities, which occur for a few hours every week of operation, there are deviations up to +1.5 °C, concerning the nominal temperature of 23 ± 0.2 °C in the four rings of ALBA: Service Area, Booster, Storage and Experimental Hall. This problem has a direct impact on the quality of the beam of the Accelerator. Previous studies have preliminarily concluded that the causes of this problem are due to (1) thermohydraulic anomalies in the operation of the external cogeneration plant, which supplies cold water to ALBA, and (2) cavitation problems in the pumping system (the water mass flow has been reduced to 67% of its nominal value to temporarily mitigate the cavitation). In order to confirm these hypotheses and propose solutions to the problem, an investigation has been developed making use of one-dimensional thermohydraulic simulations, performing Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) studies, statistical evaluations of data taken from our control system, and systematic flow measurements in critical areas, with ultrasonic flowmeters. As a result of this research, a set of solutions and recommendations are finally proposed to solve this problem.

This paper outlines the design of a diamond vacuum window and a millimeter wavelength (mmWave) waveguide assembly that will hold vacuum but still allow the mmWaves to propagate out of the structure for diagnosis and thermal management purposes. Currently under development at Argonne is a corrugated wakefield accelerator (CWA) that will operate at mmWave frequencies, with its fundamental mode of operation at 180 GHz, and relatively high power levels, up to 600 W. The fundamental mode needs to be extracted from the accelerator at approximately every 0.5 m to prevent the unwanted heating of the accelerator structure. Therefore, the structure is intentionally designed so this fundamental mode does not propagate further, instead it is transmitted through the waveguide assembly under vacuum and out via the vacuum window. As a result of the relatively high mmWave power densities, CVD diamond was chosen as the vacuum window material, due to its low electromagnetic losses, mechanical strength, and for its superior thermo-physical properties. Mechanically it is necessary to be able to hold the tight tolerances necessary for windows performance at millimeter wavelengths. Other mechanical difficulties involve assembly of the window due to CVD diamond material and preservation of ultra high vacuum even if the integrity of the CVD diamond window is somehow compromised.

The vacuum level in a 2 mm diameter, 0.5 m-long copper corrugated waveguide tube proposed* for a compact high repetition rate wakefield accelerator has been investigated. The analytical calculations have been found to be in good agreement with a result of computer modeling using a finite element method. A representative experiment has been conducted using a smooth copper tube with the same diameter as the corrugated tube and a 1/3 length of the corrugated tube. The vacuum level calculated for this experiment agrees well with the measurement.

A new research product aiming to work in a 3th generation synchrotron facility (PAL/PLS II) has been developed. Based on increased energy X-ray synchrotron radiation tool and well-known Kappa geometry device principle, the product is expected that will investigate atomic and molecular structures of materials at nanoscale level using several X-ray diffraction techniques. The Kappa diffractometer (K-Dm) machine is maintaining the common structural principle of its family, but working with an extreme precision and load, which is far of the competition. The main body is consisting from customized Kappa goniometer (KGm) device with vertical axis of rotation for high-precision sample (cryostat) manipulation, versatile detector arm (Da) for manipulating in horizontal plan different detectors (optics, slits, etc.) after X-ray beam is scattered and stable alignment base (Ab) for roughly adjusting the product around the X-ray beam. In addition, a XYZ cryo-carrier inside of the KGm is included for fine (submicron) sample adjustments. The kinematic, design and precision concepts applied, together with the obtained test results are all in detail presented.*

A large number of soft X-ray monochromators for high-resolution synchrotron radiation experiments are in operation worldwide. Many of them being plane-grating monochromators with HEIDENHAIN UHV RON905 angle encoders, thirty-six of those encoders are in use at BESSY II. Since decades, those angle encoders are successfully in operation. As of today, this type of encoders became a legacy product and repairing is getting expensive. Therefore, we have developed a new angle encoder, a mechanically compatible "drop-in" replacement of the RON905. A correspondingly manufactured prototype, based on RENISHAW absolute encoders, was investigated on a high precision angle drive test bench. Fourier analysis of the encoder data allowed to determine the accuracy for different angle ranges and shows a better accuracy for the case of the new angle encoder. Furthermore, we will introduce two different methods to increase the system accuracy by plane grating monochromators in collimated light employing the newly developed encoder. The first one is an on-line, in-situ method based on electron/absorption spectroscopy whereas the second, off-line method utilizes an electronic autocollimator.

During the past years multiple experiments were designed and built at facilities world wide to do 3D tomography scans on the low nanometer scale. At this resolution effects like vibrations, thermal drifts and manufacturing tolerances become more and more critical even when state of the art components are used. In preparation of the PETRA IV upgrade at DESY, a test device will be designed and used both in the lab as well as at the beamlines to develop and test alignment routines for nano-optics and the sample environment. To keep track on positions and vibration levels during experiments, metrology like interferometers are foreseen within the device.

At the integrated facility for structural biology of the EMBL at PETRA III on the DESY campus in Hamburg, several devices need cryogenic cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2): cryo-coolers for the DCMs, cold gas stream units for cryo-crystallography (cryo-stream) at the beamlines and for an automatic crystal harvesting system, robotic sample mounting systems at the beamlines (MARVINs) and an additional one for sample transfer from the automatic crystal harvesting system. The cryo-coolers and phase separator are connected to the central LN2 supply operated by DESY. A local LN2 phase separator installed above one the beamlines is supplying the cryo-streams, the MARVIN systems and LN2 emergency reservoir. For the cryogenic devices local servers and clients exist that monitor and operate the corresponding sensors, actuators and provide the safety logic. In addition, the local cryo-clients are integrated in a cryogenics supervision client. The supervision client allows password protected access at a monitoring level, an operator and an expert level. At the monitoring level, it offers a fast overview of the status of all sub-systems at one glance. At the higher access levels, also the control of the cryogenic sub-systems is accessible. The application can be used from remote via a VPN connection, TeamViewer software or a web client (in preparation). Because of the heterogeneity of the cryogenic devices different protocols such as TINE, EtherCAT, ADS-OCX (BECKHOFF Automation) and EPICS for interfacing had to be applied.

This paper presents the most recent results on the corrosion of copper components in ALBA water cooling system. The studies have been carried out using a variety of techniques: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Representative samples of the Accelerator Facility were examined: Storage Ring Absorbers, Front End Masks, Radio Frequency Cavity Pipes, Experimental Line Mask, Radio Frequency Plant Pipes at Service Area and Booster Quadrupole. The studies show the presence of intergranular, pitting and generalized corrosion. The presence of copper oxide is confirmed, as well as other elements such as Aluminum, Carbon, Sulfur, Silver, Calcium, Silicon, Titanium and Iron in some regions of the samples. Likewise, other elements from circulating water such as Potassium and Chlorine have also been detected. The depth of pitting corrosion is less than 119.4 um for the samples studied, after 10 years of operation. To minimize the corrosion problem, an upgrade of the ALBA cooling system is under study. The objective is to reduce the current corrosion rate by a conservative factor of 5. This change is possible by modifying the characteristics of the cooling water, reducing the dissolved oxygen content to values below 10 ppb and increasing the pH above 7.5. Technical aspects of this upgrade are discussed in this paper.

The need for individual power levels and control interfaces results in unique power amplifier systems used to accelerate particles via microwaves. Solid-state power amplifiers (SSPA) offer the advantage of a good modularity and scalability to address these needs. However, the design, development, and production of such a complex SSPA system with sufficient reliability is challenging and expensive, due to the customized requirements. We are addressing this issue by offering a high flexibility with our modular design in combination with our in-house developed control software. Based on our experience we are eliminating potential downsides by industrialization and still offering a high grade of flexibility to meet the individual needs. At the best practice example of our circulator tracking, developed for low frequencies around 80MHz, we will demonstrate how customization and industrialization can come along together.

A cylindrical, corrugated wakefield accelerating (CWA) structure is being designed to facilitate sub-terahertz Cerenkov radiation produced by an electron bunch propagating in a waveguided structure comprising accelerating sections and transition sections*. The accelerating structure consists of several copper-based 50-cm long sections of internally corrugated tubes with 2-mm inner-diameter. These sections are coupled together using transition sections, which are also copper-based. The transition section has a main body diameter ranging from 2mm to 3.2mm and its length is about 14mm. Two sets of four orthogonal waveguides radiate from the central body. Beside their mechanical coupling function, these transition sections provide for periodic monitoring of the centering of the electron bunch, and for removal of unwanted higher-order EM modes. The fabrication of these transition sections is presented. The fabrication process is based on the use of a sacrificial fused silica glass mandrel, whose body corresponds to the inner volume of the copper element. This fused silica mandrel is subsequently electroplated. The micro-fabrication of a prototype of the transition section is underway. Modelling of various fabrication errors was undertaken to understand their effect and to determine tolerances. Source of machining imperfections are reviewed and their impact compared to the modelling results.
