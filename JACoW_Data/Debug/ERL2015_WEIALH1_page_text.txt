Energy recovery linac (ERL), capable of providing electron bunches with both high repetition and high quality, is a perfect candidate for driving modern Free electron lasers (FELs). In this presentation, the authors will cover several on-going/proposed ERL projects to drive FELs and discuss the important beam dynamics - space charge effect, coherent synchrotron radiation effect and the beam break-up effect - and their potential influence on the FEL performances.

CERN is presently studying the concept of an ERL facility. The primary goal of such a facility would be the study of superconducting RF modules with substantial beam current and energy. The facility is laid out in a 3-pass racetrack configuration as is envisaged for the high energy ERL of the LHeC. Construction is planned in stages, which would also allow the study of the beam dynamics and the operational aspects of an ERL at different levels of energy gain and energy recovery. The facility is conceived to allow at a later stage to become a scientific instrument for other applications. These applications include: 1) a beam facility for detector R&D, 2) the study of controlled beam induced quenches in superconducting magnets and wires 3) the use as CW free-electron lasers by adding a wiggler in a straight section 4) the use as Compton γ-ray source by adding a laser.

An Lepton Energy-recovery-linac Scalable to TeV
 


 

V. Litvinenko

I present a conceptual design of Linear Energy Recovery Linac operating electron or positrons beams with energies scalable to TeV. Normally energy recovery is associated with bending the lepton beam, which results in prohibitively large energy loss for synchrotron radiation. In my scheme these losses are circumvented.
