After one year of the Solaris storage ring commission-ing excellent performance has been achieved. The optics was corrected close to the design values. However, some minor adjustments are still needed. The commissioning of the Solaris 1.5 GeV storage ring required a big effort in machine parameters optimization. Performance of posi-tion monitoring devices has proven essential for the suc-cessful optimization of beam parameters such as: closed orbit, tune, chromaticity, and dispersion. Now, the effort is focused on fine-tuning the machine by implementing the linear optics from orbit correction (LOCO) and reduc-ing the disparity between model and measured results revealed by the phase advance analysis and dispersion measurement. Moreover, during daily operation the main task is to maintain long-term stability of the circulating electron beam allowing for beamlines commissioning. Within this presentation the current status of the Solaris facility and the commissioning results will be reported.

The TPS commissioning period is from August 2014 to March 2016. The experience of phase I [1] (bare lattice 2014.8~2015.3) and phase II [2,3] (SRF and insertion devices 2015.9~2016.3) commissioning is overviewed. Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) started user operation in March 2016. The delivery user time reached 3211 hours. The continuous improvements of integrated accelerator performance are described and future developments are discussed.

Superconducting planar undulator (SCU) technology has been developed and is currently in use at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The experience of building and operating the first short-length, 16-mm period superconducting undulator, SCU0, paved the way for two 1-m long, 18-mm period devices, SCU18-1 and SCU18-2. The first of those undulators has been in operation since May 2015, while the second one replaced SCU0 in September 2016. The possibility of building planar SCUs with a high quality field has been demonstrated at the APS. The measured phase errors of SCU18-2 at the design operational current are only 2 degrees rms, for example. An FEL SCU prototype - a 1.5-m long, 21-mm period undulator - was also built and tested as part of an LCLS SCU R&D program. This undulator successfully achieved all LCLS-II undulator requirements including a phase error of 5 degrees rms. The superconducting undulator technology also allows the fabrication of circular polarizing devices. Currently, a new helical SCU is under construction at the APS. In addition, the concept of a novel Superconducting Arbitrarily Polarizing Emitter, or SCAPE, has been suggested and is now under development.
