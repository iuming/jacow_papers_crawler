In the last decade a continuous effort has been spent to improve the capability of existing free-electron lasers (FELs) operating in the X-ray and VUV regimes. Together with the possibility to provide sub-ps and fs photon pulses with an intensity ten order of magnitude larger than the past generation light sources, new modes of operation have been conceived. In this framework, generation of two-color (or multi-colour) FEL pulses, temporally separated, had an unprecedented impact on the scientic community, pave the way for new pump-and-probe experiments. A number of two-color two-pulse schemes have been already implemented in several labs but with a limited time-separation from 0 to few hundreds of fs. We present a new design tested at the FERMI FEL machine, able to produce two independent electron bunches temporally separated from hundreds of ps to few ns. Measurements and characterisation of this two-bunch mode operation are presented, including trajectory control, impact of longitudinal and transverse wakefields, manipulation of the longitudinal phase space and finally a demonstration of suitability of the scheme to provide extreme ultra-violet light by using both bunches.

As a rule, FELs have been single user machines. To distribute the electron beam with a fast kicker system between different undulators enables delivering beam to several users simultaneously. If it is done from RF pulse to RF pulse, it would decrease the number of bunches for each user. Therefore, it is planned at the European XFEL and already practice for several years at FLASH, to kick entire bunch trains within an RF pulse, thus delivering to both users the 10 Hz trains. It will be shown how the system has allowed long pulse trains for two users simultaneously and what has been done to keep the full flexibility within a bunch train not only in terms of wavelength, number of bunches and bunch separation, but also in bunch length needed to allow different users different FEL-pulse duration.
