Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) in the Institute of Basic Science (IBS), South Korea, is now operating SRF test facility in Sindong, Daejeon. Sindong SRF test facility has three vertical test pits and three horizontal test bunkers, 900 W cryogenic system, RF power system, and radiation protection system. This paper explains about detail procedures of constructing cryostats and top flanges for the vertical test of RISP, Installed cryostats and top flanges have insulation vacuum layer, magnetic and thermal shield, 4K/2K reservoir, heat exchanger, cryogenic valves for supplying liquid helium, vacuum lines, and electrical instrumentations for the superconducting cavity tests.

The superconducting driver linac for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) will accelerate heavy ions to 200 MeV per nucleon. The linac includes 46 SRF cryomodules, with a total of 69 solenoid packages for beam focusing and steering. For efficient beam commissioning and future operation, all of the solenoids must be turned on and reach a stable operating condition in a short time. Additionally, when a warm-up of the cryomodules is needed, degaussing of the solenoid packages is needed to minimize the residual magnetic field in the SRF cavities. An automatic turn-on and degaussing program had been implemented for FRIB cryomodules to meet these requirements. This paper will describe the design, development, and implementation of the automated solenoid control program.

Cold powered testing of all LCLS-II production cryomodules at Fermilab is complete as of February 2021. A total of twenty-five tests on both 1.3 GHz and 3.9 GHz cryomodules were conducted over a nearly five year time span beginning in the summer of 2016. During the course of this campaign cutting-edge results for cavity Q0 and gradient in continuous wave operation were achieved. A summary of all test results will be presented, with a comparison to established acceptance criteria, as well as overall test stand statistics and lessons learned.

The LHC RF cryomodule "Asia" suffered an accidental influx of about 0.5 l of tunnel air during the leak checks of the pumping manifolds. The resulting risk of particle contamination was difficult to assess, and could not be excluded with certainty. If one or more cavities were contaminated, a severe impact on beam operations in the LHC machine was to be expected. In order to minimize the risks, the Asia cryomodule has been replaced with a spare unit. Subsequently, the cryomodule was tested in the SM18 test facility without intermediate venting, and showed high levels of radiation due to field emission above 1.8 MV in one of the cavities. The other cavities were less strongly affected, but clear signs of contamination were observed. The helium processing technique was used to improve the performance of the SRF cavity with respect to field emission. This paper will discuss the results of the above-mentioned test.
