The technologically advanced instruments and devices available to synchrotron scientists in the last 15 years or so are making for both better and faster experiments. With that comes more data that is also markedly more complex than that of the single point detector used at the first x-ray synchrotrons in the 1980s. At the start of NSLS-II, there was a realization that a new generation data system is necessary to meet the imminent needs of a 21st century facility. I will discuss the journey of the implementation and evolution of the NSLS-II data system and how it enhances commissioning activities and enables powerful data collection and analysis to advance user science.
