Instruments for bunch shape and beam cross-section diagnostics at ion linacs are as important as complicated devices. Widespread Bunch Shape Monitors developed in INR RAS are used during a linac commissioning and optimization of beam dynamics. Beam Cross-Section Monitors implemented at INR RAS linac provide efficient non-destructive beam tuning and control. Features of both monitors investigated in simulations and beam tests are described. A variety of experimental results are presented.

The control system of a linear induction accelerator LIA-20 for radiography is presented in this paper. The accelerator is designed to provide a series of three consecutive electron pulses with energy up to 20 MeV, current 2 kA and lateral size less than 1 mm. To allow reliable operation of the whole complex, coordinated functioning of more than 700 devices must be guaranteed in time frames from milliseconds to several nanoseconds. Total number of control channels exceeds 6000. The control system structure is described and the hardware in VME and CAN standards is presented.

Engineers, scientists, and physicists around the world are working on high-energy physics with particle accelerators. It's common for these domain experts to need hardware and software that meets their measurement, diagnostic, control, interlock, and safety system requirements. From programming multicore embedded real-time systems that contain FPGAs to working with high-speed data acquisition systems that require timing and synchronization, National Instruments offers commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware to help meet these needs.

Earth surface movements, like earthquakes or industrial noise, can induce a degradation of particle accelerator instantaneous luminosity or even sudden beam losses. This report introduces the HL-LHC project and discusses the importance of monitoring the effects of earthquakes on the present LHC beam orbit and luminosity using a novel instrument, the Precision Laser Inclinometer (PLI). After a brief description of the instrument principles, a comparison of data from the PLI and from the LHC beam instrumentation in the event of earthquakes is given. The aim is to characterize the response of the accelerator to remote or nearby Earth surface movements. The first results from simulation in comparison with data are presented. The impact of vibrations on high luminosity small-sized beam colliders, as in High Luminosity LHC among many other future projects, the possible applications of the PLI instrument and ideas about possible feedback systems conclude the contribution.
