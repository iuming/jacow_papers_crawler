1 MV electrostatic accelerator is being developed to satisfy the needs from the users, especially for the applications with a MeV range ion beam implantation at KOrea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex (KOMAC). Typically, the accelerator consists of ion source, beam transport system and target chamber. For the accelerating voltage of a MeV range, ELV type high voltage power supply has been selected. And then, ion source has been selected as the newly developed RF ion source which can be installed inside the pressure vessel of high voltage power supply due to its limited space and electrical power. In this paper, preliminary test of 1 MV electrostatic accelerator including test results in test stand is presented.

A source of epithermal neutrons based on a tandem accelerator with vacuum insulation for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy of malignant tumors was proposed and constructed. Stationary proton beam with 2 MeV energy, 1.6 mA current, 0.1% energy monochromaticity and 0.5% current stability was obtained*. The flow of charged particles accompanying the accelerated ion beam was detected and measured**. To suppress this concomitant flow cooled diaphragm, cryopump and the electrostatic ring were installed in the input of accelerator. The surface of the vacuum vessel was covered with netting to suppress secondary electron emission. These steps have reduced the flow of charged particles 25 % of the ion beam to 0.5 % and to increase the current proton beam 3 times - up to 4.5 mA. The paper presents the results of research and declares plans to use the accelerator for the BNCT.

In BINP neutron source for boron neutron capture therapy of cancer based on the vacuum insulation tandem accelerator and lithium target for neutron generation was constructed. After optimization of the injection of negative hydrogen ions and modernization of the stripping target 1.6 mA 2 MeV proton beam was obtained. Improvements of the accelerator to suppress accompanying electron current were introduced, and after making changes to protection system of high voltage power supply a stable proton beam with a current of 4.5 mA was obtained. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the beam is accelerated without losses. Obtaining of proton beam with the current of more than 3 mA offers the prospects of using of accelerators for BNCT in cancer clinics.

Both the NuMI (Neutrinos and the Main Injector) beam line, that has been providing intense neutrino beams for several Fermilab experiments (MINOS, MINERVA, NOVA), and the newly proposed LBNF (Long Baseline Neutrino Facility) beam line which plans to produce the highest power neutrino beam in the world for DUNE (the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) need pulsed magnetic horns to focus the mesons which decay to produce the neutrinos. The high-current horn and stripline design has been evolving as NuMI reconfigures for higher beam power and to meet the needs of the LBNF design. The CSU particle accelerator group has aided the neutrino physics experiments at Fermilab by producing EM simulations of magnetic horns and the required high-current striplines. In this paper, we present calculations, using the Poisson and ANSYS Maxwell 3D codes, of the EM interaction of the stripline plates of the NuMI horns at critical stress points. In addition, we give the electrical simulation results using the ANSYS Electric code. These results are being used to support the development of evolving horn stripline designs to handle increased electrical current and higher beam power for NuMI upgrades and for LBNF

One of the challenges in a relativistic electron cooler is the generation of high voltage exceeding 2 MV and the powering of HV-solenoids, which need a floating power supply. As replacement of the well established, but limited, methods we propose streaming gas for the power transfer. The conversion of the energy by a turbo generator enables using scalable power supply / HV-generator combinations. BINP SB RAS has proposed two possibilities to build the power supply in a modular way. In the first proposal, two cascade transformers per module should be used; the first one powers 22 small HV-solenoids, the second one generates the voltage. In order to reach the final voltage, the modules are cascaded. The cascade transformers are fed by a turbo generator, which is driven by pressurised gas. The second possibility is to use two big HV-solenoids, which are powered directly by a turbo generator. The voltage could be generated for example with a Cockcroft Walton generator. A potential candidate is the Green Energy Turbine (GET) from the company DEPRAG, Germany. At the Helmholtz-Institut Mainz, two GET were tested. In this report, we present our experience and show first results.

The ELENA (Extra Low ENergy Antiproton) ring will deliver antiprotons at an energy of just 100 keV to experiments aiming to precisely measure the properties of anti-hydrogen atoms. A crucial component of this decelerator ring is the electron cooler which will be used to counter the beam blow-up as the antiproton energy is reduced from 5.3 MeV to 100 keV. The electron cooler will operate at energies below 350 eV in a longitudinal guiding field of 100 G such that the perturbations to the ring can be easily corrected. We will present the design considerations as well as the production status of the cooler.

Providing Au-Au collisions in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at energies equal or lower than 10 GeV/nucleon is of particular interest to study the location of a critical point in the QCD phase diagram. To mitigate luminosity limitations arising from intra-beam scattering at such low energies, an electron cooling system is being developed. To achieve cooling, the relative velocities of the electrons and protons need to be small with maximized transverse overlap. Recombination rates of ions with electrons in the electron cooler can provide signals that can be used to tune the energies and transverse overlap to the required conditions. In this paper we take a close look at various detection methods for recombination processes that may be used to approach cooling.

The proof of coherent electron cooling (CeC) principle experiment is currently under commissioning and it is essential to have the tools to predict the influences of cooling electrons on a circulating ion bunch. Recently, we have developed a simulation code to track the evolution of an ion bunch under the influences of both CeC and Intra-beam scattering (IBS). In this paper, we will first show the results of benchmarking the code with numerical solutions of Fokker-Planck equation and then present the simulation results for the proof of CeC principle experiment.

In the presence of coherent electron cooling (CeC), the evolution of the longitudinal profile of a circulating ion bunch can be described by the 1-D Fokker-Planck equation. We show that, in the absence of diffusion, the 1-D equation can be solved analytically for certain dependence of cooling force on the synchrotron amplitude. For more general cases, we solved the 1-D Fokker-Planck equation numerically and the numerical solutions have been used to benchmark our simulation code as well as providing fast estimations of the cooling effects.

Cyclotron cavity modelled by an artificial neural net-work, which is trained by our optimized algorithm. The training samples are obtained from simulation results, which are done by MWS CST software for some defined situation and parameters, and also with the conventional BP algorithm. It is shown that the optimized FFN can estimate the cyclotron model parameters with acceptable outputs. Hence, the neural network trained by this algorithm represents the proper estimation and acceptable ability to our structure modelling. The cyclotron cavity parameter modelling illustrate that the neural network trained by this algorithm could be the acceptable method to design parameters.

Recently, studies on the central region of 10 MeV AVF Cyclotron have been done at AmirKabir University of Technology. In this study, the aim of the cyclotron design is to accelerate the ions up to 10MeV energy. The cyclotron, consist of four sector magnets and 2 RF cavities which will be operated at 71 MHz. The internal PIG ion source is used in this cyclotron. The purpose of this work is to investigate the behavior of trajectories of ions in the magnetic and electric fields at the center of the cyclotron. The electric and magnetic field distribution was designed by OPERA-3DTOSCA. In order to solve the equation of motion, numerical code was written in C++ program that used the conventional Rung-Kutta method. The obtained results of simulation were the horizontal and vertical motion of an ion in the center of cyclotron, and motion of the center of the orbits.

A PIG Ion source provides H-ions for the 10 MeV cyclotron, which is designed and being manufactured by Amirkabir university of technology. Plasma created in the anode contains the desired ions. Discharge for producing plasma consists of the both ion current from plasma towards the cathode and the secondary electron current from the cathode to the plasma. Secondary electron emission is the result of ion collision on the surface of the cathode. Heat generated by these collisions is considerably high, so a cooling system for ion source is crucial. In this paper heat transfer study of the ion source, temperature distribution and deformation of different parts simulated using ANSYS CFX. Also the thermionic emission of the electrons from cathode in the calculated temperatures by ANSYS simulated Using CST STUDIO. Results showed the maximum temperature of the cathodes is 1992 K, which is far away from the cathode melting point. The thermionic current in 1992 K of cathode simulated and the results showed an electron current of 0.00706 A at 500 V which is negligible in comparison to the discharge current of 1 A. Maximum deformation were about 0.2 mm in cathode edges.

Heat transfer study for designing RF transmission line in cyclotrons is crucial. Because of enormous amount of surface current on RF transmission line, despite high conductivity of copper, significant amount of heat is being generated, which is enough for altering characteristic impedance and other desirable parameters for transmission line. So, effective cooling system which is nourished by central chiller system is essential. For design of cooling system in RF transmission line suitable mass flow, appropriate geometry and confined temperatures are prominent in order to avoid eroding and impedance changing. In this paper an attempt has been done for accurate analyzing and simulating of heat transfer phenomenon for the 10MeV cyclotron (IRANCYC-10 ) which is under construction at AmirKabir University of Technology. By using Ansys CFX simulation software, the optimum cooling line geometry and mass flow rate of 90 gr/s for cooling water, has been resulted.

According to the agreement between the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Hefei (China) and Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, (Russia), the development of a superconducting isochronous cyclotron for proton therapy SC200 is started. The cyclotron will provide acceleration of protons up to 200 MeV with maximum beam current of 1 μA. We plan to manufacture in China two cyclotrons: one will operate in Hefei cyclotron medical center the other will replace Phasotron in Medico-technical Center JINR Dubna and will be used for further research and development of cancer therapy by protons. Now we present main parameters of cyclotron and simulation results of magnetic, accelerating and extraction systems.

The superconducting cyclotron SC200 for proton therapy is designing by ASIPP (Hefei, China) and JINR (Dubna, Russia) will be able to accelerate protons to the energy 200 MeV with the maximum beam current of 1 mkA. By computer simulation with 3D codes the cyclotron magnet principal parameters were estimated (pole radius 0.62 m, outer diameter 2.2 m, valley depth 0.3 m, height 1.22 m, weight ~30 t). The required isochronous magnetic field is shaped with accuracy some mT. Four fold symmetry and spiralized sectors with minimal gap 4 mm at extraction provide the stable beam acceleration till 10 mm from the pole edge.

The SC200 superconducting cyclotron for hadron therapy is under development by collaboration of ASIPP (Hefei, China) and JINR (Dubna, Russia). The accelerator will provide 200 MeV proton beam with maximum current of 1μA in 2017-2018. The cyclotron is very compact and light, the estimate total weight is about 30 tons and extraction radius is 60 cm. We have performed simulations of all systems of the SC200 cyclotron and specified the main parameters of the accelerator. Average magnetic field of the cyclotron is up to 3.5 T and the particle revolution frequency is about 45 MHz, these parameters increases the requirements for accuracy of the beam dynamics studies. We have designed and performed beam tracking starting from the ion source. Codes and methods used for the beam tracking are presented.

The cyclotron-based proton accelerator facility (HIPA) at PSI is presently operated at 1.3-1.4 MW beam power at a kinetic energy of 590 MeV/u to drive the neutron spallation source SINQ and for production of pion and muon beams. Over the years HIPA facility has developed towards increase of the delivered beam current and beam power (0.1 mA in 1974 till 2.2 mA in 2010). During the last few years several upgrades of the Ring cyclotron field correction and beam phase monitoring systems were made. RF voltage was also increased. In order to test the performance of the upgraded system the phase response measurements were carried out.

The European Spallation Source front end will deliver a 62.5 mA beam current of 2.8 ms duration at 352 MHz to the downstream linac, which in turn will produce a 5 MW proton beam onto the target. Such unprecedented beam power requires a high quality beam with accurate and stable beam parameters in order to assure low beam losses and safe transport through the linac. In this paper we present advanced tuning methods for the low energy beam transport and the radio frequency quadrupole.

At KEK, circular induction accelerators employing an induction acceleration system, which is characterized by a simple fact of functional separation of acceleration and beam confinement, have been developed since 2000. The slow cycling induction synchrotron (IS) was demonstrated using the KEK 12 GeV PS in 2006, where superbunch formation and focusing-free transition energy crossing were realized*. The fast cycling IS called the KEK digital accelerator is under operation since 2012**, where bunch squeezing and splitting/merging never realized in RF synchrotrons have been demonstrated, as well as acceleration in a wide range of ion mass to charge ratio. Based on the experiences, a racetrack-shape fixed field induction accelerator (induction microtron)*** that can accelerate giant cluster ions such as C-60 or Si-100, to high energy beyond that of electrostatic accelerators has been designed. Its full story and status of R&D work will be presented at the conference.

Recent efforts concerning the accelerators of the RIKEN RI Beam Factory (RIBF) have been directed towards achieving higher heavy-ion beam intensities. As shown at the IPAC2014 conference, the intensities of these ion beams have improved significantly following the construction of the new injector, RILAC2, which is equipped with a 28-GHz superconducting ECR ion source, development of the helium gas stripper, and upgrading of the bending power of the fRC. In this respect, this paper presents the subsequent upgrade programs conducted in the past two years, such as the development of a new charge stripper for uranium beam and a new acceleration scheme of krypton beam. The current performance level of the RIBF accelerator complex, as well as a future plan to further increase the beam intensities, are also presented.

The High Intensity and Energy ISOLDE project (HIE-ISOLDE)* is a major upgrade of the ISOLDE facility at CERN. The energy range of the post-accelerator will be extended from 2.85 MeV/u to 9.3 MeV/u for beams with A/q = 4.5 (and to 14.3 MeV/u for A/q = 2.5) once all the cryomodules of the superconducting accelerator are in place. The project has been divided into different phases, the first of which (phase 1a) finished in October 2015 after the hardware and beam commissioning were completed**. The physics campaign followed with the delivery of both radioactive and stable beams to two different experimental stations. The characteristics of the beams (energies, intensities, time structure and beam contaminants) and the plans for the next experimental campaign will be discussed in this paper.

The ReAccelerator ReA3 is a worldwide unique, state-of-the-art reaccelerator for rare isotope beams. Beams of rare isotopes are produced and separated in-flight at the NSCL Coupled Cyclotron Facility and subsequently stopped in a gas cell. The rare isotopes are then continuously extracted as 1+ (or 2+) ions and transported into a beam cooler and buncher, followed by a charge breeder based on an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT). In the charge breeder, the ions are ionized to a charge state suitable for acceleration in the superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) linac, extracted in a pulsed mode and mass analyzed. The extracted beam is bunched to 80.5 MHz and then accelerated to energies ranging from 300 keV/u up to 6 MeV/u, depending on their charge-to-mass ratio. Alternatively, stable isotope ions can be accelerated injecting stable gas in the EBIT. ReA3 was commissioned recently with stable 40Ar and 39K as well as with the rare isotope beams of 46Ar and 46K. This contribution will focus on the properties and techniques used to accelerate and transport rare isotope beams and will show results obtained during the preparation of the two first experiments using the ReA facility.

The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) will utilize a beamline located at Fermilab to provide and aim a neutrino beam of sufficient intensity and appropriate energy range toward DUNE detectors, placed deep underground at the SURF Facility in South Dakota. The primary proton beam (60 - 120 GeV) will be extracted from the MI-10 section of Fermilab's Main Injector. Neutrinos are produced after the protons hit a solid target and produce mesons which are subsequently focused by magnetic horns into a 194 m long decay pipe where they decay into muons and neutrinos. The parameters of the facility were determined taking into account the physics goals, spacial and radiological constraints and the experience gained by operating the NuMI facility at Fermilab. The Beamline facility is designed for initial operation at a proton-beam power of 1.2 MW, with the capability to support an upgrade to 2.4 MW. LBNF/DUNE obtained CD-1 approval in November 2015. We discuss here the design status and the associated challenges as well as the R&D and plans for improvements before baselining the facility.

COSY is a cooler synchrotron designed for internal target hadron physics experiments, equipped with both electron cooling system and stochastic cooling system. During the past couple of years, COSY has been evolved into an ideal test facility for accelerator technology development as well as detector development for the Facility of Anti-proton and Ion Research at Darmstadt (FAIR). In addition, COSY has been the test ground for exploring the feasibility of a storage ring based Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) measurement. The proposed precursor experiment of a direct measurement of the EDM of the deuteron at COSY using an RF wien filter by the Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigation (JEDI) requests significant improvement of beam based measurements as well as beam control. In this paper, first results of measured linear optics based on AT-LOCO are reported. Simulation studies are also discussed.

The renewed availability of heavy ions at CERN for the needs of the LHC programme has triggered the interest of the fixed-target community. The project, which involves sending several species of primary ions at various energies to the North Area of the Super Proton Synchrotron, has now entered its operational phase. The first argon run, with momenta ranging from 13 AGeV/c to 150 AGeV/c, took place from February 2015 to April 2015. This paper presents the status of the project, the performance achieved thus far and an outlook on future plans.

The muon g-2 experiment executed at Brookhaven concluded in 2001 and measured a discrepancy of more than three standard deviations compared to the Standard Model (SM) calculation. A new initiative at Fermilab is under construction to improve the experimental accuracy four-fold. Achieving this goal, however, requires the delivery of highly polarized 3.094 GeV/c muons with a narrow ±0.5% Δp/p acceptance to the g-2 storage ring. In this study, we examine systematic errors that can arise from correlations between muon spin and transverse coordinates for the new g-2 experiment. To achieve this goal we perform end-to-end spin tracking simulations from the production target up to the ring injection point and compare our findings against the results from the Brookhaven experiment. We detail similarities and differences.

Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) is under development in Korea to provide wide variety of intense rare isotope beams for nuclear physics experiments and applied science using both Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) and In-Flight Fragmentation (IF) techniques. Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) charge breeder is a key element to efficiently accelerate rare isotope ion beams produced by ISOL method. These beams will be charge-bred by an EBIS charge breeder to a charge-to-mass ratio (q/A) ≥ - and accelerated by linac post-accelerator to energies of 18.5 MeV/u. Utilization of 3 A electron beam and 6 T superconducting solenoid with wide (8) warm bore diameter will allow high efficient and fast charge breeding of rare isotope beams with exceptional degree of purity. The main features of RISP EBIS charge breeder design and current status of the project will be presented and discussed.

The 81.25MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole(RFQ), which was designed to accelerate various ion beams from the energy of 10 keV/u to 500 keV/u, is under development for the Rare Isotope Science Project(RISP). The 5 meter long RFQ consists of 9 sections and the total weight is roughly 16 tons. Each sections of RFQ aligned and installed by using a laser tracker on a supporter system. In this paper, the fabrication status of the RISP RFQ and the scheme of installation were described in detail.
This work was supported by the RISP of IBS funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(MSIP) and the National Research Foundation(NRF) of Korea(2013M7A1A1075764).

Electron beam ion source (EBIS) has been one of widely used table-top devices for the production of highly charged ions by electron impact ionization. An EBIS employs a magnetically compressed, high energy and density electron beam to sequentially ionize atoms or ions with a low charge state*. At KOMAC, we have a compact room-temperature operated EBIS. It is additionally constructed with a magnetic mass spectrometer and a Faraday Cup to measure charge spectra. Using this measurement setup, preliminary tests are performed to find suitable operational potentials in the EBIS for a stable production of highly charge ions. In future, we aim to build an EBIS based pre-injector with a radio frequency quadrupole. It has advantages of having a simple operation and a large number of ion species**. For this, we intend to improve and modify the current EBIS design to incorporate with existing setups at KOMAC.

A new high duty factor, scaled Penning surface plasma source is being developed at RAL. This paper provides initial commissioning results. A stable high-current (up to 100 A) pulsed discharge is obtained, but the anode overheats, caused by poor thermal contact at elevated temperatures. The overheating anode yields a noisy discharge, with low output current, and makes high duty factor operation impossible. The performance of a thermal interface material for aperture plate (plasma electrode) cooling is detailed. An update on the cathode heaters is provided. The anode to source-body fit is analysed at different temperatures for different combinations of mechanical tolerances. This offers insights when compared to ISIS operational sources. A new anode with modified tolerance dimensions for improved fit is being manufactured and will be tested in June 2016.

In a Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT), the emittance growth due to the beam's own space charge is typically suppressed by way of neutralization from either electrons or ions, which originate from ionization of the background gas. In cases where the beam is chopped, the neutralization pattern changes throughout the beginning of the pulse, causing the Twiss parameters to differ significantly from their steady state values, which, in turn, may result in beam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance, there is an alternative solution, in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT that contains the chopper. The emittance can be nearly preserved if the transition to the un-neutralized section occurs where the beam exhibits low transverse tails. This report discusses the experimental realization of such a scheme at Fermilab's PXIE, where low beam emittance dilution was demonstrated

The Beam Test Facility (BTF) has been constructed to validate the performance of the new RFQ, to study ion source improvements, and to support neutron moderator development and six-dimensional phase space measure-ments for SNS. The BTF includes an H− ion source, Ra-dio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), and Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) beam diagnostics systems. A spare RFQ was built and fully RF tested in the BTF and will be installed in the SNS linac in the future. The test stand is ready to run with the H− ion beam through the new RFQ to fully validate the RFQ performance. The RFQ was designed to have the beam characteristics iden-tical to the existing RFQ with improved operational relia-bility and stability. The H− RF plasma ion source system includes new high power RF components for improved front-end system performance.

MedAustron has completed its proton commissioning activities for clinical treatment in the horizontal Irradiation Room 3 (IR3). Work involved the preparation of 255 energies in clinical range (60 - 250 MeV) for one spill length, one spot size and 4 intensity levels. After resonant slow extraction, the beam crosses four different functional areas in the High Energy Beam Transfer Line (HEBT): the dispersion suppressor (DS), the phase shifter stepper (PSS), two straight extension modules and a deflection module to IR3. Quadrupole-variation methods were applied to center the beam in the beamline. The DS section was commissioned to provide high intensity beams with closed dispersion. The PSS section was commissioned to provide symmetric and minimal spot sizes at the iso-center in the room (after scattering in the nozzle and air). The definition of the 255 clinical energies was given by the Medical Physics team after measuring the beam ranges at the iso-center.

MedAustron is a synchrotron based ion beam therapy center for proton (62-250 MeV) and carbon ion (120-400 MeV/n) treatments. The MedAustron synchrotron uses a betatron core driven slow extraction scheme based on a third order resonance. The commissioning of the extraction from the synchrotron involved the setup of the correct orbit and optics at flattop. In order to maximize the momentum spread before extraction and optimize spill structure the RF system enforces a so called RF-phase jump to the unstable phase. Different scenarios were simulated using MADX-PTC [1] in combination with Python to overcome the static nature of PTC. Simulations have shown that the initial phase of the beam and a finite time to jump to the unstable fix point have a strong impact on the performance. Using a high frequency intensity monitor in the extraction channel (QIM), the spill structure was analysed and used for optimization. Simulation and measurements of the procedure are presented.

The Italian Centre for Hadrontherapy (CNAO) and the MedAustron Hadrontherapy Center in Austria are synchrotron-based medical therapy centers. The CNAO machine has five years of experience in patient treatments, whereas MedAustron will soon start patient treatments with protons. Their accelerator systems have common characteristics, in particular in regards to the extraction system: at acceleration flattop, particles are slowly driven through the third integer resonance longitudinally by a betatron core. This setup enables smooth extracted beam intensities. The rationale behind the use of a betatron core, its impact on the extracted beam quality and the performance from operation and commissioning of the two centers will be here presented.

The CNAO center has been conceived since the beginning with three treatment rooms and an 'experimental room' where research can be carried out without hindering the clinical activity. The room itself was built since the beginning, but the beam line was planned at a second moment in time to give priority to the treatments. The experimental room beam line has now been designed to be 'general purpose', to be used for research in different fields. Possible activities could be, as an example, irradiation of cells, test of beam monitors, development of in-beam monitoring devices or radiation hardness studies. In a second stage a third source will be added to the present two in order to carry on experiments with additional ion species besides the two used presently for treatments, protons and carbon ions. In this paper a description of the design and of the construction status is given.

We are improving the Main Ring (MR) for beam power of 750 kw which is the first goal of J-PARC. The repetition period of the fast extraction must be short to 1.3 second from the current period of 2.48 second for the improvement of the beam power. It is necessary to exchange a high field injection septum magnet which will be installed at the injection line from RCS to MR and its power supply, because the current injection septum system can not be operated with 1.3 second repetition. Since confirmed the large leakage field around current circling beam line of the injection magnet, we must improve the shielding structure which make low leakage field. We started the development of the new injection septum magnet and its power supply in 2013. It can operate with 1 Hz repetition and the low leakage field which its order is 10-4 of the gap field. The new Injection septum magnet and the new power supply were constructed in Winter of 2014. We had many improvement of the magnet and power supply. We will install the new injection septum magnet system in this summer. In this presentation, we will report the detail of the results of its performance.

The J-PARC Main Ring (MR) is being upgraded to improve its beam power to the design goal of 750 kW. One important way is to reduce the repetition period from 2.48 s to 1.3 s so that the beam power can be nearly doubled. We need to improve the septum magnets for fast extraction. We are improving the magnets and their power supplies. The present magnets which is conventional type have problem in durability of septum coil by its vibration, and large leakage field. The new magnets are eddy current type. The eddy current type does not have septum coil, but has a thin plate. We expect that there is no problem in durability, we can construct the thin septum plate, the leakage field can be reduced. The output of the present power supply are pattern current which of flat top is 10 ms width, the new one is short pulse which of one is 10 us. The short pulse consists of 1st and 3rd higher harmonic. We can expect that the flatness and reproducibility of flat top current can be improved. The calorific power can be also reduced. This paper will report the field measurement results with the eddy septum magnet systems.

Xi‘an Proton Application Facility (XiPAF) is a new proton project which is being constructed for single-event-effect experiments. It can provide proton beam with the maximum energy of 200 MeV. The accelerator facility of XiPAF mainly contains a 7 MeV H− linac injector and a proton synchrotron accelerator. The 7 MeV H− linac injector is composed of an ECR ion source, a Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT), a Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator (RFQ) and a Drift Tube Linac (DTL). The 50 keV 10 mA H− beam (pulse width 1ms) extracted from the ion source is expected to be symmetric with the Twiss parameters alpha=0 and β=0.065 mm/mrad. The RMS normalized emittance is required to be less than 0.2 π mm·mrad. With an adjustable collimator and an electric chopper in the 1.7 m-long LEBT, the beam pulse width of 10~40μs and peak current of 6 mA can be obtained. The H− beam is matched into the downstream RFQ accelerator with alpha=1.051 and β=0.0494 mm/mrad. This paper shows the detailed design process of the LEBT and simulation result with the TRACEWIN code.

For the Xi'an 200 MeV Proton Application Facility (XiPAF), one important thing is to produce more homog-enous beam profile at the target to fulfill the requirements of the beam application. Here the beam line is designed to meet the requirement of beam expansion and homogenization, and the step-like field magnets are employed for the beam spot homogenization. The simulations results including space charge effects and errors show that the beam line can meet the requirements well at the different energies (from 10 MeV to 230 MeV) and different beam spot size (from 20mm to 200mm).

A high power proton linac is under operation at Korea multi-purpose accelerator complex (KOMAC). Currently, two beamlines are available and used to provide 20-MeV beam and 100-MeV beam to users from various fields. An additional 100-MeV beamline has been constructed mainly for production of radio-isotopes such as Sr-82 and Cu-67. Proton beam with the beam energy of 100 MeV and the average current of 0.6 mA is directed to the production target, which is located in a water-filled target chamber, through a beam window made of AlBeMet. The beam size at the target is designed to be about 100 mm in diameter. Installation of the beamline components including 1.5 T bending magnet and the beam diagnostic devices such as BPM and BCM is finished and beam commissioning is planned to start in early 2016. The details of newly-constructed beamline and the initial beam test results will be given in this paper.

The CERN PS Booster (PSB) has four vertically stacked rings. After extraction from each ring, the bunches are recombined in two stages, comprising septum and kicker systems, such that the accumulated bunch train is injected through a single line into the PS. Bunches from the four rings go through a different number of vertical bends, which leads to differences in the betatron and dispersion functions due to edge focussing. The fast pulsed systems at PSB extraction, recombination and PS injection lead to systematic errors of delivery precision at the injection point. These error sources are quantified in terms of emittance growth and particle loss. Mitigations to reduce the overall emittance growth at the PSB to PS transfer within the LHC injectors upgrade are presented.

Safely extracting and absorbing the 50 TeV proton beams of the FCC-hh collider will be a major challenge. Two extended straight sections (ESS) are dedicated to beam dumping system and collimation. The beam dumping system will fast-extract the beam and transport it to an external absorber, while the collimation system will protect the superconducting accelerator components installed further downstream. The high stored beam energy of about 8.5 GJ per beam means that machine protection considerations will severely constrain the functional design of the ESS and the beam dump line geometry, in addition to dominating the performance specifications of the main sub-systems like kickers and absorber blocks. The general features, including concept choice, optics in the ESS and beam dump line, passive protection devices, layout and integration are described and discussed.

As part of the LHC Injectors Upgrade project for LHC heavy ions, the SPS injection kicker system rise time needs reduction below its present 225 ns. One technically challenging option under consideration is the addition of fast Pulse Forming Lines in parallel to the existing Pulse Forming Networks for the 12 kicker magnets MKP-S, targeting a system field rise time of 100 ns. An alternative option is to optimise the system to approach the existing individual magnet field rise time (2-98%) of 150 ns. This would still significantly increase the number of colliding bunches in LHC while minimising the cost and effort of the system upgrade. The observed characteristics of the present system are described, compared to the expected system rise time, together with results of simulations and measurements with 175 and 150 ns injection batch spacing. The expected beam quality at injection into LHC is quantified, with the emittance growth and simulated tail population taking into account expected jitter and synchronisation errors, damper performance and SPS non-linear optics behavior. The outlook for deployment is discussed, with the implications for LHC operation and HL-LHC performance.

Under the scope of the LIU project the CERN PS Booster to PS beam transfer will be modified to match the requirements for the future 2 GeV beams. This paper describes the evaluation of the proposed upgrade of the PS injection kicker. Different schemes of an injection for LIU beams into the PS have been outlined in the past already under the aspect of individual transfer kicker rise and fall time performances. Homogeneous rise and fall time requirements in the whole PSB to PS transfer chain have been established which allowed to consider an upgrade option of the present injection kicker system operated in short circuit mode. The challenging pulse quality constraints require an improvement of the flat top and post pulse ripples. Both operation modes, terminated and short circuit mode are analysed and analogue circuit simulations for the present and upgraded system are outlined. Recent measurements on the installed kickers are presented and analysed together with the simulation data. First measurements verifying the performance of upgrade options have been taken during the last end of the year stop. The paper concludes with an upgrade plan and a brief overview of implementation risks.

Each of the 3 km long transfer lines between the SPS and the LHC is equipped with two beam stoppers (TEDs), one at the beginning of the line and one close to the LHC injection point, which need to absorb the full transferred beam. The beam stoppers are used for setting up the SPS extractions and transfer lines with beam without having to inject into the LHC. Energy deposition and thermo-mechanical simulations have, however, shown that the TEDs will not be robust enough to safely absorb the high intensity beams foreseen for the high-luminosity LHC era. This paper will summarize the simulation results and limitations for upgrading the beam stoppers. An outline of the hardware upgrade strategy for the TEDs together with modifications to the SPS extraction interlock system to enforce intensity limitations for beam on the beam stoppers will be given.

New Spill Control for the Slow Extraction in the Multi-Cycling SPS
1371

The flux of particles slow extracted with the 1/3 integer resonance from the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN was previously controlled with a servo-spill feedback system which acted on the horizontal tune such as to keep the spill rate as constant as possible during the whole extraction time. The current in two servo-quadrupoles was modulated as a function of the difference between the measured and the desired spill rate. With servo quadrupoles at a single location in the SPS ring and the SPS in multi-cycling mode, the trajectory of the slow extracted beam was seen to change from cycle to cycle depending on the current applied by the servo feedback. Hence this system was replaced by a feed-forward tune correction using the main SPS quadrupoles. In this way the spill control can now be guaranteed without changing the trajectory of the extracted beam. This paper presents the algorithm and implementation in the control system and summarizes the advantages of the new approach. The obtained spill characteristics will be discussed. The technique implemented for the additional reduction of the 50 Hz noise on the spill structure will also be briefly outlined.

The AWAKE experiment at CERN will use a proton bunch with an momentum of 400 GeV/c from the SPS to drive large amplitude wakefields in a plasma. This will require a ~830 m long transfer line from the SPS to the experiment. The prepa- rations for the beam commissioning of the AWAKE proton transfer line are presented in this paper. They include the detailed planning of the commissioning steps, controls and beam instrumentation specifications as well as operational tools, which are developed for the steering and monitoring of the beam line. The installation of the transfer line has been finished and first beam is planned in summer 2016.

The ISIS Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is a spallation neutron and muon source based upon a 50 Hz rapid cycling synchrotron accelerating ~3×1013 protons per pulse from 70 to 800 MeV to deliver a mean beam power of 0.2 MW to two target stations. Throughout its 30 years of operation ISIS has developed aluminium oxide foils in-house for H− charge exchange injection. The manufacturing and installation processes for these foils are time consuming, radiologically dose intensive and require a high degree of skill. Commercially available carbon based foils commonly used at other facilities, have the potential to greatly simplify foil preparation and installation in addition to improving beam quality. Similar foils would also be necessary for facility upgrades which increase injection energy to withstand the higher operating temperatures. This paper describes the initial experience of carbon foils in the ISIS synchrotron including issues relating to handling and mounting foils, their performance under beam operation and plans for further development.

The proposed CERN FCC-hh proton-proton collider will operate at unprecedented per-particle (50 TeV) and total stored beam energies (8.4 GJ). These high energies create the requirement for an efficient collimation system in order to protect the accelerator components and experiments. In order to verify the performance of proposed collimation system designs, loss map simulations have been performed using the code Merlin. Results for the current baseline layout are presented for both betatron and off-momentum loss maps.

The construction of the isotope production facility was recently completed on the 100 MeV proton linac at the KOMAC (Korea multi-purpose accelerator complex). To produce the Sr-82 and Cu-67, we have prepared the solid targetry which consist of target transportation system , target cooling system and a hot-cell for remote handling. The Isotope production targets are made of RbCl pellet and stainless steel cladding. For the proton beam irradiation, the targets are transported by target drive system which consist of drive chain and guide rail by remotely. In this paper, we will report the detailed design, fabrication and operation status of the solid targetry at the KOMAC isotope production facility.

The planed Facility for Ion Research (FAIR) is a new international accelerator laboratory at the GSI in Darm-stadt, Germany. The main topic at this facility is aimed to heavy ion research. The FAIR project in comparison to the existing facility GSI extends the research area by raising the energy of ion beams. After creation of the ion beam at the ion source the state charge is low. Therefor the demand for acceleration of the beam to the highest possible energy is a highly ionized charge state of the beam. For beam stripping to get higher charge state, the traditional tools are gas stripper and foil stripper [1, 2]. Hence Plasma is suggested to be a stripper medium. In Frankfurt are different kinds of Pinch Plasmas under investigation for Stripper. The constricting effect on the plasma or conductor is produced by the magnetic field pressure resulting from the current or by the Lorentz force produced by the current flowing in its own magnetic field. In addition to separate the high pressure discharge cham-ber of the accelerator a plasma window will be used [3]. This contribution gives an overview of the plasma proper-ties and shows first results of different beam times at the GSI.

The experimental program of the future facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) project requires a high number of cooled anti-protons per hour. The FAIR proton injector linac has to deliver a 70 MeV, 35 mA pulsed proton beam at a repetition rate of 4 Hz. During recent machine investigations at the GSI a high current proton beam was achieved in the Universal Lineral Accelerator (UNILAC). In preparation for this the ion source was equipped with a newly developed 7-hole extraction system and optimized for single charged hydrocarbon beam (isobutane gas) operation. This beam was accelerated to 1.4 MeV/u and cracked in a new pulsed gas stripper into protons and charged carbon. The new stripper setup injects high density gas pulses synchronous with the transit of the beam pulse close to the beam trajectory. With this setup a proton (up to 4.3 mA) as well a carbon beam (up to 9.5 mA) intensity record at beam energy of 1.4 MeV was achieved. The proton beam was accelerated up to 3.6 MeV/u inside the first Alvarez-section with full transmission. The paper will present beam measurement in comparison to the former beam investigations using a 2 mA proton beam in the entire UNILAC.

The GSI UNILAC will serve as part of an injector system for the future FAIR facility, currently under construction in Darmstadt, Germany. For this, it has to deliver short-pulsed, high-current, heavy-ion beams with highest beam quality. An upgrade for the 1.4 MeV/u gas stripper is ongoing to increase the yield of uranium ions in the desired charge state. The new setup features a pulsed gas injection synchronized with the beam pulse transit to increase the effective density of the stripper target while keeping the gas load for the differential pumping system low. Systematic measurements of charge state distributions and energy-loss were conducted with 238U-ion beams and different stripper gases, including H2 and He. By using H2 as a stripper gas, the yield into the most populated charge state was increased by over 50%, compared to the current stripper. Furthermore, the high gas density, enabled by the pulsed injection, results in increased mean charge states.

According to increasing need to cyclotrons in the world, designing and manufacturing of these machines are considered. Therefore designing of 18 MeV cyclotron magnet has begun at Amirkabir University Of Technology. Magnet is one of the most important parts of the cyclotron, so in designing of magnet, all other components of cyclotron which influence on magnet, should be considered. Since the achievable energy for particle is determined 18MeV, designed magnet has AVF structure. TOSCA (Opera-3D) code was selected for simulation and analysis. First of all, theoretical calculations and estimations were done and magnetic field data according to radius were achieved, after that, simulation with initial estimations and a simple model of magnet was begun and optimization process continued until magnetic field results from the simulation coincided with the theoretical one. Different shimmings were used for better coincidence. Some results contains magnetic field on middle plane and betatron oscillations were checked. Also working points of the cyclotron with resonance regions were checked. According to use reliable mesh, the accuracy of simulation results is sufficient high.
