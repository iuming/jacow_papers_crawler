The PAL-XFEL hard X-ray linac has a 716 m long gallery and tunnel for 10 GeV. Forty nine modulators are necessary in the hard X-ray gallery for an X-band linearizer, an S-band RF gun, two S-band deflectors and 45 S-band klystrons for accelerating structures. They have been installed completely from March 15, 2015 to December 30, 2015 after completing the building construction. There are 51 modulators, 178 accelerators structures, 42 SLEDs in the hard X-ray linac and the soft X-ray linac. The RF conditioning of the klystrons, SLEDs and accelerating structures were stated from November 24, 2015. We describe the PAL-XFEL system and the current status of the linac RF system.

Impurity doping of bulk-niobium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities is a relatively new field of study and the underlying physics is not yet fully understood. Previous studies have shown an increase in the intrinsic quality factor and the corresponding decrease of the temperature-dependent component of the surface resistance of nitrogen-doped cavities with increasing accelerating field.* Here we investigate the effects of alternative inert dopants on the surface resistance and thus the intrinsic quality factor of SRF cavities in pursuit of the optimal dopant and doping level.

It has been suspected that appearance of new field emitters can occur in SRF cavities after their placement in accelerator tunnel for long term beam operation. This apparently has been the case for CEBAF. However, no physical evidence has been shown in the past. In this contribution, we will report on the recent results concerning the root cause of field emitters in SRF cavities placed in CEBAF tunnel. We will discuss these results in the context of high-reliability and low-cryogenic-loss operation of CEBAF.
