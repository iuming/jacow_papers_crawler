We report the first evidence of substantial gain in a soft-X ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) based on Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG). The experiment was focused on harmonics 36 (~7.3nm) and 45 (5.8 nm) and clearly demonstrated the expected EEHG capability of generating powerful and coherent FEL pulses, with strongly reduced sensitivity to electron-beam fluctuations. The experiment was carried out at FERMI, the seeded FEL user facility at Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste.

The realization of fully coherent X-ray radiation pulse has been a long-standing challenge for free-electron lasers. A promising way for producing stable transform-limited pulses is based on the harmonic up-conversion techniques with a conventional laser as the seed. However, it is found that the insignificant phase error in the seed laser will be eventually multiplied by the harmonic number, leading to a degradation of the output temporal coherence at short wavelength. Here, we report the demonstration of a slippage boosted spectral cleaning technique to mitigate the impact of seed laser induced phase errors and to improve the temporal coherence of a seeded FEL. Experimental results show that fully coherent radiation pulses can be generated in a seeded FEL with the help of the proposed technique.

We will a give broad description of recent results from Cornell University on improving the state of the art in the production of high brightness photoemitted electron beams for future light sources and ultrafast electron scattering. We will also discuss recent results on improving the lifetime of photocathode for spin polarized electron beam and on the production of large area photocathodes for single photon detection applications
