The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is an ambitious global radio astronomy project to build the biggest and most sensitive radio telescope to date, for addressing a wide variety of cutting edge science goals. Construction of SKA phase I is planned to start from 2018, with early science operations expected from 2021. Almost all major radio astronomy nations are participating in this mega-project that will revolutionise radio astronomy, while driving the growth of many new technologies. Participation from industry on a large scale is an important ingredient in the final design and construction of the SKA. We will present an overview of the project, the main science goals, give an update on the current status of the design work and describe plans for the future. The road to the realisation of the SKA faces a host of challenges. Of specific interest for us is the Telescope Manager, the monitor and control system for the entire observatory that will oversee its functioning, from the preparation and submission of proposals by scientists, to the scheduling of observations and the overall coordination of observations We describe the main design concepts and highlight the challenges ahead
