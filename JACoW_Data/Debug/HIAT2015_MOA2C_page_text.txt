We propose a separated sector cyclotron (SSC) using high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet for a next generation cyclotron. From its stability and low operating cost, HTS cyclotrons are expected to apply for accelerator-driven subcritical reactors or beam cancer treatment systems. On the other hand, we still have a variety of issues and challenges to implement them. As a first step, we are planning to develop an HTS cyclotron as an injector for K400 ring cyclotron at RCNP. It will be the first attempt in the world. This plan will improve beam intensity in our facility and also contribute to component developments for the next generation cyclotron. The most serious issues are development of large-size HTS magnets that can be used in SSC. One-meter-size HTS dipole magnet is made for testing. Now we are going to exam the magnet and evaluate the characteristics of large HTS magnets. The result of the test will be incorporated with the sector magnet design. Moreover, we have been working on conceptual design of the new injector, developed magnetic field and orbit analysis programs. In this session, the current status of designing HTS injector cyclotron at RCNP will be discussed.

At the present time the activities on creation of the new heavy-ion isochronous cyclotron DC280 are carried out at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The isochronous cyclotron DC-280 will produce accelerated beam of ions with A/Z= 4-7 to energy W= 4-8 MeV/n and intensity up to 10 pμA (for 48Ca). The goal for DC-280 accelerator complex is more then 40 % beam transfer efficiency. To achieve high-intensity ion beam, the cyclotron is equipped with high-voltage, up to 80 kV, injection line and independent Flat-Top RF system. To decrease the aperture losses at centre region the electrostatic quadruple lens will be installed between inflector and first accelerating gap. The paper presents the results of simulation of beam injection and acceleration.

Operated since 1996, the ACCULINNA RIB fragment separator has provided scientific results recognized by the nuclear physics community. In 2008 it was decided to build a new separator, ACCULINNA-2 which should deliver RIBs produced with 35-60 A MeV primary heavy-ion beams with 3 ≤ Z ≤ 36. It is optimized for large RIB intensities and high precision studies of direct reactions populating nuclear systems near and beyond the drip lines through sophisticated correlation experiments*. Late 2011, SIGMAPHI got a global contract for optics check, design, fabrication, installation and alignment of the complete ACCULINNA-2. It includes magnets, vacuum and PS for about 40 magnets, from small correctors to 1-6 tons quads, 14 tons dipoles and 6- and 8-poles. We describe the evolution of the project, from functional needs to working system. Thanks to the early involvement of the industrial partner, the collaborative spirit and the freedom of tradeoff between magnet, PS and vacuum chamber, the final product meets all and even exceeds most requirements while meeting industrial needs for standardization. The next step of the upgrade, a zero-angle spectrometer is also reported.
