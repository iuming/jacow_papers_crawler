New e+e− accelerator designs aim for factory-like performance with high-current beams and high luminosities. These new machines will push interaction region designs to new levels and require a careful evaluation of all previous background sources as well as introduce possibly new background sources. I present here a summary of standard background sources and also suggest a new possible background source for Synchrotron Radiation (SR) namely, specular reflection. In addition, one will have to pay closer attention to the beam tail particle distribution as this may become a significant source of SR background from the high-current and high-energy beams of these new designs.

The international Future Circular Collider (FCC) study~[fccweb] aims at a design of p-p, \rm e+e-, e-p colliders to be built in a new 100~km tunnel in the Geneva region. The \rm e+e- collider (FCC-ee) has a centre of mass energy range between 90 (Z-pole) and 375~GeV (t\bar{t}). To reach such unprecedented energies and luminosities, the design of the interaction region is crucial. The crab-waist collision scheme~[ref:cw] has been chosen for the design and it will be compatible with all beam energies. In this paper we will describe the machine detector interface layout including the solenoid compensation scheme. We will describe how this layout fulfills all the requirements set by the parameters table and by the physical constraints. We will summarize the studies of the impact of the synchrotron radiation, the analysis of trapped modes and of the backgrounds induced by single beam and luminosity effects giving an estimate of the losses in the interaction region and in the detector.

A significant blowup of the vertical emittance is observed in particle tracking in lattices with random skew quadrupoles, even without beam-beam effects with the FCC-ee lattice at ttbar. A Vlasov model well explains the blowup, and agrees with the tracking. This effect will set an additional limit on the goal of tuning of the vertical emittance of the lattice of colliders, well below the value at the collision.

SuperKEKB is an electron-positron double ring collider at KEK which aims at a peak luminosity of 8 x 1035 cm-2s-1 by using what is known as the ’nano-beam’ scheme. A luminosity dither system is employed for collision orbit feedback in the horizontal plane. This paper reports a system layout of the dither system and algorithm tests during the SuperKEKB Phase 2 commissioning.

The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a proposed Higgs factory with center of mass energy of 240 GeV to measure the properties of Higgs boson and test the standard model accurately. Machine Detector Interface (MDI) is the key research area in electron-positron colliders, especially in CEPC, it is one of the criteria to measure the accelerator and detector design performance. In this paper, we will introduce the CEPC superconducting magnets design, solenoid compensation, synchrotron radiation and mask design, detector background, collimator, mechanics assembly etc on, which are the most critical physics problem.

Beam Background at SuperKEKB During Phase 2 Operation

The SuperKEKB accelerator, the upgrade of the KEKB machine, will operate at an unprecedented instantaneous luminosity of 8x1035/cm2/s1, providing the Belle II experiment an expected integrated luminosity of about 50 inverse ab in ten years of operation. With the increased luminosity, the beam background is expected to grow significantly with respect to KEKB, leading, among other effects, to possible damage of detector components and suppression of signal events. We present studies done during the Phase 2 operation of SuperKEKB to evaluate the contribution of each background source, such as Touschek effect, beam-gas scattering, synchrotron radiation, and injection background. We also present studies performed on collimators and other solutions adopted to mitigate beam backgrounds in the interaction region.
