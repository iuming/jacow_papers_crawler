BNL R&D ERL beam commissioning started in June 2014 [*]. The key components of R&D ERL are the highly damped 5-cell 704 MHz superconducting RF cavity and the high-current superconducting RF gun. The gun is equipped with a multi-alkaline photocathode insertion system. The first photocurrent from ERL SRF gun has been observed in November 2014. In June 2015 a high charge 0.5nC and 20 uA average current were demonstrated. In July 2015 gun to dump beam test started. The beam was successfully transported from the SRF gun through the injection system, then through the linac to the beam dump. All ERL components have been installed. In October 2015, SRF gun cavity has been found contaminated during severe cathode stalk RF conditioning. This cavity has been sent for repair and modification for later use in low-energy RHIC electron cooler (LEReC)[**]. LEReC scheduled to start commissioning in early of 2018. We present our results of BNL ERL beam commissioning, the measured beam properties, the operational status, and future prospects.

The high gain free electron lasers (FEL) based on electron linacs can offer unprecedented performances for many science fields. There are several FEL facilities in China that have been built at different wavelength regimes. This talk will describe the latest development of three major FEL facilities in China including Shanghai Deep UV FEL at SINAP, DCLS VUV FEL at DICP and Shanghai X-ray FEL at SINAP.

The MAX IV linac is used both for injection into a 3 GeV storage ring, and as a high brightness driver for a Short Pulse Facility (SPF). The linac has also been deigned to handle the high demands of an FEL injector. The first phase of beam commissioning of the linac was completed and operations for ring and SPF injection has been ongoing for several months. In this paper we present the results from beam commissioning, injections to the storage ring and SPF operation.
