An asymmetric capacitive pick-up was installed at GSI SIS-18 for determination of the turn-by-turn beam quadrupole moment. The pick-up geometry is simulated to estimate its sensitivity towards the beam dipole and quadrupole moments. Turn-by-turn quadrupole moment measurement allows to calculate the frequency of beam-size oscillations. Recent beam measurements using this pick-up show clear indications of the beam-size oscillations induced by the injection mismatch. In this contribution, we present these measurements and discuss their relevance for the direct determination of the incoherent space charge tune shift.

Over 50 years in the history of accelerator physics, RF cavities have been used as beam position and intensity monitors. Their structure has been extensively discussed across numerous papers reporting their successful operation. The application of RF cavities as pick-ups has recently been extended to include radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities and heavy ion storage rings. These pick-ups allow for very sensitive, accurate, and quick characterisation of ion beams and turn out to be indispensable tools in nuclear as well as atomic physics experiments. A notable example is the resonant pick-up in the ESR at GSI Darmstadt (*) where single ion detection was achieved for lifetime measurements of radioactive nuclides (**). A similar cavity pick-up was installed in CSRe in IMP Lanzhou (***). In this work, we describe a novel conceptual approach that utilizes RF cavities with an elliptical geometry. While requiring a high precision determination of the position and intensity of particle beams, it has to cope with design restriction at heavy-ion storage rings such as large beam pipe apertures. The latter become inevitable at facilities aiming at storing large-emittance beams as, e.g., planned in the future Collector Ring (CR) of the FAIR project at GSI Darmstadt. Simulation results are accompanied by results achieved from bench-top measurements on model cavities.

The SuperKEKB accelerator is now being upgraded to bring the world highest luminosity (L=8x1035/cm2/s). Hence, the KEKB injector linac has to produce low emittance and high charge electron (20 mm mrad, 7 GeV/c2, 5 nC) and positron (20 mm mrad, 4 GeV/c2, 4 nC) beam, respectively. In order to achieve these criteria, the accelerator structure has to be aligned within 0.1 mm position error. Since BPMs are essential instruments for beam based alignment (BBA), it is required to have one magnitude better position resolution to get enough alignment results. We have begun to develop high position resolution BPM readout system with narrow bandpass filters (fc = 180 MHz) and 250 MSa/s 16-bit ADCs. It handles two bunches with 96 ns interval separately and has a dynamic range from 0.1 nC to 10 nC. To compensate circuit drift, two calibration (x-direction and y-direction) pulses are output to the BPM electrodes between beam cycles (20 ms). Since it needs to achieve not only high position resolution but also good position accuracy, overall non-linearity within ±0.02 dB is required and the system has to have more than ±5 mm accurate position range. We confirmed the system performance with a 3-BPM resolution tests at KEK Injector Linac and it turned out that the system has 3 μm position resolution. We plan to install this system during 2015 summer shutdown.

Beam monitors with long memories will be widely used in SuperKEKB accelerators. Since the slow data transfer time of such devices usually limit the operational performance, improvement of the transfer rate is required. Two kind of devices, VME-based module and Ethernet-based modules has been developed. On the VME-based devices such as turn-by-turn position monitors for damping ring or long bunch oscillation monitors, MBLT and BLT transfer method has been implemented. For the Ethernet based system, the gated turn-by-turn monitors, SiTCP has been implemented on the FPGA and the EPICS device support for SiTCP has been developed. The improvement of the data transfer speed with the long-term reliability will be presented.

The Beam Position Monitor system of the ESS linac will include in total more than 140 BPM detectors of different sizes and types. The resolution and accuracy of the position measurement with the nominal 62.5 mA beam current and 2.86 ms pulse width need to be 20 ?m and 100 ?m respectively, and those of the phase measurement are 0.2 deg and 1 deg respectively. The BPM system also needs to work successfully under off-optimal conditions, ex. with a de-bunched beam, or with the current and pulse width being as low as 6 mA and 10 ?s respectively. Options for the implementation of the ESS BPM electronics include: 1) a custom or commercial front-end card combined with a commercial digitizer with in-house developed firmware and 2) a fully commercial off the shelf system. Libera Single Pass H is an instrument intended for phase, position and charge monitoring in hadron and heavy ion LINACs. The instrument was tested at the ESS laboratory, to probe the feasibility of operation with ESS beam conditions. To give a realistic picture of the device performance, different testing setups were evaluated, including all the signal and environment conditions foreseen for the final ESS linac operation. The results present resolution, precision and accuracy evaluations, as well as stressful long-term and stability tests. This paper presents the achieved results of the Libera Single Pass H for the ESS beam parameters.

High repetition rate photoinjectors such as the APEX at LBNL are one of the enabling technologies for next generation MHz XFELs. Due to the higher repetition rate, a wider bandwidth is available for feedback systems to achieve ultra-stable beam performance. In a first step to improve APEX beam stability, the noise power spectra of the APEX laser beam and electron beam are characterized in terms of intensity and timing. Possible feedback systems are also discussed.

The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) is currently developing beam position and phase measurements (BPPMs) as part of the LANSCE risk mitigation project. BPPM sensors have been installed in the 805-MHz linac and development of the monitoring electronics is near completion. The system utilizes a high speed digitizer coupled with a field programmable gate array (FPGA) mounted in a VPX chassis to measure position, phase and intensity of a variety of beam structures. These systems will be deployed throughout the LANSCE facility. Details of the hardware selection and performance of the system for different timing structures are presented.

Wake field monitors (WFMs) are used to directly measure the alignment between beam and RF accelerating structure via the transverse higher mode spectrum. As a sub task of the EuCARD2 project, we are developing a front end for the monitors of the multipurpose X band structure installed at the SwissFEL Injector Test facility SITF at PSI. We plan to use electro optical technology offering strong advantages in the robustness to interference and radiation, and in the ease of signal transport. We present the concept of the device, discuss the theoretical performance in terms of noise. For a proof of principle, we built a basic system, which we tested together with the existing monitors with beam at SITF.

SwissFEL, the European XFEL (E-XFEL) and FLASH2 all use dual-resonator cavity beam position monitors (CBPMs). The CBPM electronics that is built by PSI has a larger number of calibration parameters that need to be determined in order to maximize the CBPM system performance. Beam measurements with the BPM electronics have been made in BPM test areas at the SwissFEL test injector and FLASH, as well as at FLASH2 where 17 E-XFEL type CBPMs have recently been installed in the undulator intersections [*,**]. The CBPMs are pre-calibrated in the lab using an automated test and calibration system [**], and then the final calibration is done with beam. This report discusses beam-based methods to optimize the system performance by improving the pre-beam system calibration as well as the mechanical alignment of the pickup position and angle.

For SwissFEL, two types of cavity BPMs are used. In the linac, injector and transfer lines, low-Q dual-resonator cavity BPMs with a loaded Q (QL) of ~40 and 3.3GHz mode frequency allow easy separation of the two adjacent bunches with 28ns bunch spacing. For the undulators that receive only single bunches from a beam distribution kicker with 100Hz repetition rate, dual-resonator BPM pickups with higher QL are used. The baseline version for the undulator BPMs is a stainless steel pickup with QL=200 and 3.3GHz frequency. In addition, an alternative version with copper resonators, QL=1000 and 4.8GHz frequency has been investigated. For both pickups, prototypes were built and tested. The status of pickup and electronics development as well as the latest prototype test results are reported.

SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a premier photon science laboratory. SLAC has a Free Electron Laser facility that will produce 0.5 to 77 Angstroms x-rays and a synchrotron light source facility. In order to achieve this high level of performance, the beam position measurement system needs to be accurate so the electron beam bunch can be stable. We have designed a general purpose stripline Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system that has a dynamic range of 10pC to 1nC bunch charge. The BPM system uses the MicroTCA (Micro Telecommunication Computing Architecture) for physics platform that consists of a 14-bit 250 MSPS ADC module (SIS8300 from Struck) that uses the Zone 3 A1.x classification for the Rear Transition Module (RTM). This paper will discuss the commissioning result at SLAC LCLS-I, SLAC SSRL, and Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The RTM architecture includes a bandpass filter at 300MHz with 30 MHz bandwidth, and an automated BPM calibration process. The RTM communicates with the AMC FPGA using a QSPI interface over the zone 3 connection.

In a synchrotron light source like SOLEIL, Beam Position Monitors (BPM) are optimized to have the highest sensitivity for an electron beam passing nearby their mechanical center. Nevertheless, this optimization is done to the detriment of the response linearity when the beam is off-centered for dedicated machine physic studies. To correct the geometric non linearity of the BPM, we have applied an algorithm based on a boundary element method. Moreover the BPM electronics is able to provide position data at a turn by turn rate. Unfortunately the filtering process in this electronics mixes the information from one turn to the neighboring turns. An additional demixing algorithm has been set-up to correct this artefact. The paper reports on performances and limitations of those two algorithms that are used at SOLEIL to correct the BPM data.

A new photon Beam Position Monitor (X-BPM) design has been developed in collaboration between the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) and SOLEIL Synchrotron. This blade-type X-BPM has been carefully studied in order to minimize beam current dependence and temperature dependence. The main advantages of the design are a good stability than the standard X-BPMs initially installed at SOLEIL. This new design is used for the new X-BPMs installed at SOLEIL and is being considered for the bending magnet front-ends of the future SIRIUS light source. A first “double” unit has been constructed by LNLS for the two canted Anatomix and Nanoscopium SOLEIL beamlines, and has been installed at SOLEIL in May 2014. Design and first results are presented.

A Transverse Multi-Bunch Feedback has been used in the Diamond Storage Ring for the stabilization of instabilities since 2007. Following a recent upgrade of the FPGA code and EPICS layer, a set of new features is now available to support operation and machine development: Firstly, a bunch by bunch choice of feedback filter allows for better stabilization of a single high charge bunch in a hybrid fill pattern. Secondly, complex grow-damp experiments are now possible using a sequencer of internal states allowing precise measurements of the damping rates on a mode by mode basis. Thirdly, a phase locked loop excitation and detection has been implemented to allow both extremely fast (kHz update rates) and extremely precise tracking of the betatron tune frequencies. Finally, short FIR filters on the ADC input and DAC output enable a fine tuning of the impulse response to provide maximum bunch to bunch isolation, as for instance required for efficient bunch cleaning.

A high bandwidth feedback demonstrator system has been developed for proof of concept transverse intra-bunch closed loop feedback control studies at the CERN SPS. This system contains a beam pickup, analog front end receiver, signal processor, back end driver, power amplifiers and kicker structure. The main signal processing functions are performed digitally, using very fast (4GSa/s) data converters to bring the system signals into and out of the digital domain. The digital signal processing function is flexibly implemented in an FPGA allowing for maximum speed and reconfigurability for testing multiple control algorithms. The signal processor is a modular design consisting of commercial and custom components. This approach allowed for a rapidly-developed prototype to be delivered in a short time with limited resources. Initial beam studies at the SPS using the system prior to the CERN long shutdown one (LS1) have been very encouraging. We are planning several key upgrades to the system, including the signal processor. This paper describes these upgrades and reports on their progress.

At the 1.5-GeV electron storage ring DELTA operated by the TU Dortmund University, a bunch-by-bunch feedback system was installed in 2011. Since then, it is in operation for different beam diagnostic purposes. A fast analysis of bunch-position data allows a real-time multibunch mode analysis during machine operation. In addition, the data analysis can be triggered by external events, e.g. beam losses or the injection process. In this paper, a feedback-based method to measure the damping times of multi-bunch modes is presented. Furthermore, a chromaticity-dependent single-bunch instability is analyzed. Finally, the use of the feedback system in the presence of an RF-phase modulation is presented.

NSLS2 Storage Ring transverse bunch by bunch feedback system has been designed to cure the coupled bunch instabilities, caused by HOM, resistive wall or ions. The system has been constructed, tested and commissioned with beam. Preliminary studies show that the feedback system can suppress single bunch instability. Mode analysis of the unstable coupled bunch motion reveals fast ion instability exist even at relative low current. The bunch by bunch feedback system performance will be presented in this paper.
