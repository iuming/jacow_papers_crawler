Accurate timing synchronization on the femtosecond scale is an essential installation for time-resolved experiments at free-electron lasers such as FLASH and the upcoming European XFEL. The European XFEL imposes greater requirements due to its exceptional specifications, large number of stabilized optical fibers and a total length of 3.4km. The development towards a reliable system, their results and the current status of the optical synchronization system at the European XFEL are presented.

Single-shot electro-optic sampling (EOS) is a powerful characterization tool for monitoring the shape of electron bunches, and coherent synchrotron radiation pulses. For reaching high acquisition rates, an efficient possibility consists to associate classic EOS systems with the so-called photonic time-stretch technique [1]. We present recent results obtained at SOLEIL and ANKA using this strategy. In particular, we show how a high sensitivity variant of photonic time stretch [2] EOS enabled to monitor the CSR pulses emitted by short electron bunches at SOLEIL [3]. We could thus confirm in a very direct way the theories predicting an interplay between two physical processes. Below a critical bunch charge, we observe a train of identical THz pulses stemming from the shortness of the electron bunches. Above this threshold, CSR emission is dominated by drifting structures appearing through spontaneous self-organization. We also consider the association of time-stretch and EOS for recording electron bunch near fields at high repetition rate. We present preliminary results obtained at ANKA, aiming at recording the electron bunch shape evolution during the microbunching instability.

The bunch longitudinal profile measurements using an optical dissector are introduced in the paper. The principles of the dissector operation are briefly discussed. The first measurements using the optical dissector at the Metrology Light Source are presented. Results are analyzed and compared with the bunch profiles from the streak camera measurements. Measurement errors and limitations of the both methods are estimated. Possible applications for the presented technique are discussed.
