SuperKEKB consists of 7 GeV electron and 4 GeV positron rings (HER and LER), a newly built positron damping ring and an injector linac. The target luminosity is 8x1035 cm-2s-1, which is 40 times higher than that achieved at KEKB. Construction of SuperKEKB is progressing on schedule, and beam commissioning is scheduled in 2015. Fabrication, treatment and installation of vacuum components, magnets and power supplies, and beam diagnostic and feedback systems are ongoing. Improvement of RF system and strengthening of cooling system for magnets and beam pipes are also underway. Detailed design of the interaction region has been finalized, and final focus superconducting magnets are under production. The damping ring tunnel and buildings has been completed, and installation of the accelerator components started. The upgrade of the injector linac is also progressing. This paper describes construction status of SuperKEKB main rings and the damping ring as well as recent design progress.

From mid-2012, the Two Beam Test Stand (TBTS) in the CTF3 Experimental Facility is hosting 2 high gradient accelerating structures powered by a single power extraction and transfer structure in a scheme very close to the CLIC basic cell. We report here about the results obtained with this configuration as: energy gain and energy spread in relation with RF phases and power, octupolar transverse beam effects compared with modeling predictions, breakdown rate and breakdown locations within the structures. These structures are the first to be fitted with Wake Field Monitors (WFM) that have been extensively tested and used to further improve the structures alignment on the beam line. These results show the unique capabilities of this test stand to conduct experiments with real beams.

The DAΦNE collider has been successfully commissioned after the experimental detector modification and a major upgrade and consolidation program involving a large part of the accelerator complex. This paper presents the Φ-Factory setup and the achieved performances in terms of beam currents, luminosity, detector background and related aspects.
