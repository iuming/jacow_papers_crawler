For high average electron beam currents the length of the electron bunches must match the acceptance of the accelerator. At Johannes Gutenberg-Universität we are able to measure the longitudinal pulse responses of different photocathodes: negative electron affinity (NEA) types and positive electron affinity (PEA) types. With NEA (Cs:GaAs), the pulse response depends on the wavelength of photoexcitation and show at 800nm a long and relatively intense tail whereas at 400nm a similar shape but with orders of magnitude lower intensity is observed. In comparison to this distribution, PEA pulse responses (K2CsSb) show a similar shape as well but another order of magnitude less intensity than NEA in the blue excitation.

Semiconductor Photocathode Development for the BERLinPro SRF Photoinjector

At HZB an ERL type accelerator, called BERLinPro, is being built. Cs-K-Sb photocathodes have been identified as electron source for low emittance and high current operation (100 mA). At the moment, the SRF-photoinjector for BERLinPro with an extensive diagnostics beam line is in the commissioning phase, which will also serve as a testbed to assess the performance of in-house produced Cs-K-Sb photocathodes. The deposition of Sb, K and Cs in order to prepare Cs-K-Sb photocathodes is demanding and requests an ultra-high vacuum. Even marginal changes to the process may influence the spectral quantum efficiency, the emittance and the lifetime of the photocathode, and hence change the characteristics of the electron bunch in the SRF-photoinjector. In my talk I will present the latest results of our photocathode research and I will give an update on the status of the SRF-photoinjector and BERLinPro.

The ability to produce high average current reliably and reproducibly over a long period of time with good quantum efficiency at visible wavelength is important for all ERL applications. There has been considerable interest in developing suitable cathodes for 24/7 operation under such stringent conditions. Recently, at BNL, we have fabricated cathodes with QE in the range of 10% for Cs-K-Sb cathodes and 5% for Na-K-Sb cathodes when irradiated with 532 nm laser and a single pulse charge up to 5 nC in the SRF gun has been produced. In this presentation, we discuss the fabrication of Cs-K-Sb and Na-K-Sb cathodes using both dispensers and effusion cells as sources of alkali metal, characterization of these cathodes, transporting them from the fabrication location to the RHIC tunnel under UHV conditions and installation in the electron guns in the tunnel.
