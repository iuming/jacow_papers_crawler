The Swiss FEL commissioning has started in 2016. SwissFEL consists of a 5.8 GeV Linac in C band technology feeding two FEL lines. The talk gives an overview over the challenges and achievements during design, construction and commissioning of the facility. Results of first FEL lasing are reported.

Methods for the control of polarization of the radiation emitted in high gain free electron lasers (FELs) are recalled. The first demonstration of full polarization control in the extreme ultra-violet at FERMI FEL is presented, and the polarization characterized by three independent instruments and methods. The measured radiation polarization is consistently > 90%; observed effects of photon beam transport from the undulator to the radiation detectors is discussed. The results from the different polarimeter setups validate each other, allow a cross-calibration of the instruments, and constitute a benchmark for user experiments.*
