Commissioning of PAL-XFEL started in April 2016 after its completion of building construction in 2014 and installation in 2015. Saturation of 0.15 nm FEL in the hard X-ray line was successfully done on 27 November 2016, followed by saturation of 15 nm FEL in the soft X-ray FEL line on February 2, 2017. For lasing of hard x-ray FEL a beam based alignment method and an undulator optimization scheme using undulator radiation spectrum analysis are fully exploited. In this paper we present the results of both schemes as well as the performance of FEL radiation.

At the Japanese x-ray free-electron laser (FEL) facility, SACLA, the beamline-1 has been upgraded from a spontaneous radiation to a soft x-ray FEL beamline, which generates FEL lights over a wide wavelength range from the extreme-ultraviolet to the soft x-ray regions. We started operation for users in July 2016. A dedicated accelerator, which is a refinement of the SCSS test accelerator operated in 2005-2013, was installed beside the XFEL beamlines in the SACLA undulator hall. The SCSS concept to make an FEL facility compact was continuously adopted. In the 2016 summer shutdown period, the beam energy was upgraded from 500 MeV to 800 MeV by adding two C-band rf units. The maximum K-value of the undulator magnet is 2.1. The available wavelengths of the FEL lights were extended to the range from 8 to 50 nm with pulse energies between a few to few tensμJ at an operational repetition rate of 60 Hz. In this conference, we will report an overview of the upgraded SACLA-beamline-1 and characteristics of the FEL light pulse.

Cryogenic Permanent Magnet Undulators (CPMUs) take advantage of the enhanced field performance of permanent magnets when cooled down to low temperature, enabling shorter period with sufficient magnetic field to achieve high brightness radiation in the X-ray domain. Several CPMUs have been manufactured at SOLEIL. The first CPMU of period 18 mm (U18), optimized with a phase error of 3.2° at temperature of 77 K, has been installed and operated for the past 5 years at SOLEIL for the NANOSCOPIUM beamline. We report on photon beam based alignment enabling for a better adjustment of the vertical position offset of the undulator with a precision of 50 μm, and on the correction of the taper with a precision of 5 μrad to enhance the radiation flux. A second U18 cryo-ready undulator, with a new mechanical and magnetic sorting of module shimming, has attained a phase error of 2.3° at CT without any further adjustments after the assembly. Currently, two more CPMUs are being built; a 2 m long U18 for the SOLEIL ANATOMIX beamline, and a 3 m long U15 undulator reaching a magnetic gap of 3 mm. The new challenges encountered with magnetic measurements and mechanical designs for U15 are presented.
