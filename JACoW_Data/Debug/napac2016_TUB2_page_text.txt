With the recent success in commissioning of MAX IV, the multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice has begun to deliver on its promise to usher in a new generation of higher-brightness synchrotron light sources. In this paper, we begin by reviewing the challenges, recent success, and lessons learned of the MAX-IV project. Drawing on these lessons, we then describe the physics challenges in even more ambitious rings and how these can be met. In addition, we touch on engineering issues and choices that are tightly linked with the physics design.

The use of an external laser to seed an electron beam at the beginning of the Free Electron Laser process has been proposed as a way to improve temporal coherence of modern short wavelength FELs. More recent studies and experiments have shown that electron beam manipulation through interaction with a seed laser can be exploited for tailoring FEL properties to specific users requests. Recently, experiment for phase control, multi-color emission and coherent control have been reported.

We analyze single bunch transverse instabilities due to wakefields using a Fokker-Planck model. We expand on the work of Suzuki*, writing out the linear matrix equation including chromaticity, both dipolar and quadrupolar transverse wakefields, and the effects of damping and diffusion due to the synchrotron radiation. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine the collective stability of the beam, and we show that the predicted threshold current for transverse instability and the profile of the unstable agree well with tracking simulations. In particular, we find that predicting collective stability for high energy electron beams at moderate to large values of chromaticity requires the full Fokker-Planck analysis to properly account for the effects of damping and diffusion due to synchrotron radiation.

Corrugated Structure Insertion to Extend SASE Bandwidth Up to 3% at the European XFEL
293

The usage of x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) in femtosecond nanocrystallography involves sequential illumination of many small crystals of arbitrary orientation. Hence a wide radiation bandwidth could be useful in order to obtain and to index a larger number of Bragg peaks used for determination of crystal orientation. Considering the baseline configuration of the European XFEL in Hamburg, and based on beam dynamics simulations, we demonstrate here that usage of corrugated structures allows for a considerable increase in radiation bandwidth. It allows for data collection with a 3% bandwidth, a few micrjoule radiation pulse energy, a few fs pulse duration, and a photon energy 4.1 keV.
