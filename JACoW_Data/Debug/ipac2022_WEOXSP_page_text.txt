Interest in high intensity generators of neutrons for basic and applied science has been growing, and thus the demand for an economical neutron generator has been growing. A major driver for the development of high intensity neutron generators are studies of neutron disturbance in integrated circuits, for which a compact generator that can be easily accommodated in an ordinary size lab would be highly desirable. We have investigated possible designs for neutron generators based on the D-D fusion reaction, which produce direction dependent mono-energetic neutrons with carry-off energy larger than 2.45 MeV. Specifically, we find a negative deuterium ion beam most attractive for this application, and plan to construct such a system with a negative deuterium ion beam of 200 keV energy and 100 mA current as a prototype of this concept.

We present progress and an experimental plan for multi-MeV relativistic energy gain in a dielectric laser-driven accelerator (DLA). Using a 780 nm, 100 fs pulse-front-tilted laser, we achieve interaction with 6 MeV electrons over a 4 mm long structure with 800 nm period. To compensate for resonant defocusing effects, the laser pulse is imprinted with a phase mask, applied by a Spatial Light Modulator, which uses alternating phase focusing (APF) to achieve stable beam transport. The DLA is mechanically mounted with a variable sized gap (600-1200 nm) in order to maximize transmission while maintaining high gradient within the channel. The combination of high interaction length and use of APF confines and accelerates the electrons by up to 3.5 MeV.

We report on the design of mm-wave accelerator structures operating near 100 GHz. Simulations of the cavity geometry and RF coupling are performed in ANSYS-HFSS and using SLAC’s parallel electromagnetic code suite ACE3P. We present experimental results for structures fabricated from copper, niobium, and copper plated with NbTiNi. We report on techniques for tuning these high frequency structures, as well as preliminary brazing results. A mm-wave accelerator cavity enables not only a high achievable gradient due to higher breakdown thresholds, but also reduced fill times which decrease pulsed heating and allow for higher repetition rates. We discuss the potential advantages and challenges for applications requiring ultra-compact structures.
