There are many interesting proposals and programs for accelerator driven subcritical facilities for waste transmutation(ADS) in the world, which is to speed up from the basic study to the real facility, and the significant progress in the development of accelerator technologies, in particular, superconducting RF linacs for ADS, but the key technologies in high power proton accelerator are still severe challenges which call for the closer international cooperation. This talk provides a broad overview of worldwide ADS accelerators.
