The MedAustron facility is a synchrotron-driven hadron therapy and research center presently under construction in Wiener Neustadt, Austria. In its final outline, the facility will provide H+ beams with kinetic energies ≤250MeV and C6+ beams of ≤400MeV/u for clinical applications, and for non-clinical applications H+ of up to 800MeV. First patient treatment is foreseen for the end of 2015. The (H3)+ and C4+ beams are generated at 8keV/u in continuous mode by three ECR ion sources and transported to the RFQ for acceleration to 400keV/u. An inter-tank section matches the beam to the entrance of an IH-mode DTL that accelerates the particles to 7MeV/u before they are stripped to, respectively, H+ and C6+, debunched and transported to the injection plane of the synchrotron. At a later stage of the project, beams of other species can be generated with similar optics. This contribution presents the results of the injector commissioning and operation. A comparison with the baseline optics and with the design error studies is given. In addition, an overview on the operational experience is given, with emphasis on the system reliability, stability and reproducibility.

In order to achieve the upcoming commissioning of the IFMIF-LIPAc prototype accelerator in Rokkasho, the precision and resolution required for all diagnostics must be determined. These specifications will depend on the precision at which the tuning parameters must be set and finally by the tuning errors that can be tolerated on the beam itself. We will here discuss the use of the ∆φ method to tune the SRF-Linac and the resolution requirements it implies for the BPMs. This method, using a relative time of flight measurement to assess the energy of the beam, has the advantages of allowing setting the beam energy and beam longitudinal focusing at once.

A Precise Determination of the Core-halo Limit

For high-intensity beams, the dynamics of the dense core is different from that of the much less dense halo. Relations between core emittance growth and halo generation are often studied, halo scraping often experienced and halo re-formation observed. For all that, a clear distinction between the core and the halo parts does not exist. This paper proposes a new method for precisely determining the core-halo limit applicable to any particle distribution type. Once this limit is known, the importance of the halo relative to the core can be precisely quantified. The core-halo limit determination may be easily extended to the nD phase space, allowing the definition of emittance and Twiss parameters for the core and the halo separately.

A low energy beam line (1.4 MeV/u) behind the GSI High Charge State Injecor will provide cw-heavy ion beams with high beam intensity. It is foreseen to build a new cw-heavy ion-linac for post acceleration up to 7.3 MeV/u. In preparation an advanced R&D program is defined: The first linac section (financed by HIM and partly by HGF-ARD-initiative) comprising a sc CH-cavity embedded by two sc solenoids will be tested in 2014/15 as a demonstrator. After successful testing the construction of an advanced cryomodule comprising four rf cavities is foreseen. As an intermediate step towards an entire cw-linac the use of a double of two CH-cavities is planned: Ashort 5 cell cavity should be mounted directly behind the demonstrator cavity inside a short cryostat. The design of the cw linac based on shorter sc CH-cavities would minimize the overall technical risk and costs. Besides with this cavity an optimized operation of the whole linac especially with respect to beam quality could be achieved. Last but not least the concept of continuous energy variation applying phase variation between the two cavities with constant beta profile could be tested.

A new high energy heavy-ion injector (HE-Linac) for the FAIR project was proposed as replacement for the existing post-stripper linac at the GSI UNILAC. Six 108 MHz IH-type drift-tube linac cavities within a total length of about 24 m accelerate the ions (up to U28+) from 1.4 MeV/u up to 11.4 MeV/u. Fast pulsed quadrupole triplet lenses are used for transverse focusing in between the IH cavities. The optimization of the HE linac with respect to the emittance growth reduction is investigated.

A dedicated high current uranium ion source and LEBT will be built at the GSI High Current Injector (HSI), to fulfil the intensity requirements for FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research at Darmstadt). This new injection line will be integrated into the existing complex which already comprises two branches. The new LEBT is designed as a straight injection line without dipole magnet, i.e. without dispersive charge state separation. All uranium charge states, coming from the ion source, are transported to the heavy ion high current GSI-HSI-RFQ. Only the design charge state U4+ is accelerated to the final RFQ energy. The new LEBT design is based on beam emittance and current measurements behind the existing ion source. Beam dynamics simulations have been performed with the codes TRACE-3D (envelopes), DYNAMION, BEAMPATH and TRACK (multiparticle). The recent layout of the LEBT, as well as the results of beam dynamics studies are presented.

A new Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) for multi-charge uranium beam will be built at GSI High Current Injector. All uranium charge states coming from the new ion source will be injected into GSI heavy ion high current HSI-RFQ, but only design ions U4+ will be accelerated to the final RFQ energy. A detailed knowledge about injected beam- current and -emittance for pure design U4+ ions is necessary for a proper beam line design commissioning and operation, while the measurements are possible only for a full beam including all charge states. Detailed measurements of beam current and emittance are performed behind the first quadrupole triplet at the beam line. A dedicated algorithm, based on combination of measurements and results of an advanced beam dynamics simulations, provides for an extraction of beam- current and -emittance for only U4+ component of a beam. The obtained results and final beam dynamics design for the new straight beam line are presented.

For demonstrating the technical feasibility of nuclear waste transmutation in an Accelerator Driven System (ADS), the MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) proton driver is under intensive studies. Good performance of the 2 – 4 mA, 1.5MeV RFQ (Radio-Frequency Quadrupole), the start of the accelerator chain, is essential to the reliability of the whole facility, so it must be very well designed. On the basis of the first reference design, further improvements with respect to electrode aperture, emittance growths and output distributions have been performed. The simulation results of the new reference design are presented in this paper.

The FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) Proton-Linac (P-LINAC) will be started with a 325.224 MHz, 3 MeV Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator. To ensure that a ≥35 mA beam can be injected into the downstream synchrotrons, the design beam intensity of this Proton-RFQ (P-RFQ) has been chosen as 70 mA. Based on the so-called NFSP (New Four-Section Procedure) method, two new beam dynamics designs with varying and constant transverse focusing strength, respectively, have been worked out to meet the latest design requirements using a compact structure. This paper presents the main design concepts and simulation results.

This pulsed linac activity aims on compact designs, which means a considerable increase in voltage gain per meter. At IAP – Frankfurt, a CH – cavity was developed for these studies, where mean effective accelerating fields well above 10 MV/m are expected at 325 MHz, β=0.164. This cavity is developed within a funded project. Currently, the cavity is under construction and expected to be ready for copper plating in autumn 2014. The results might influence the rebuilt of the UNILAC – Alvarez section, which aims on achieving the beam intensities specified for the GSI – FAIR project. The new GSI 3 MW Thales klystron test stand will be very important for these investigations. Detailed investigations for two different types of copper plating can be performed on this cavity. In this work, the status of the cavity fabrication will be presented. Moreover, low temperature operation of copper cavities is discussed for the case of very short RF pulses.

For the research program with cooled antiprotons at FAIR a dedicated 70 MeV, 70 mA proton injector is required. The main acceleration of this room temperature linac will be provided by six CH cavities operated at 325 MHz. Each cavity will be powered by a 2.5 MW Klystron. For the second acceleration unit from 11.5 MeV to 24.2 MeV a 1:2 scaled model has been built. Low level RF measurements have been performed to determine the main parameters and to prove the concept of coupled CH cavities. In 2012, the assembly and tuning of the first power prototype was finished. Until then, the cavity was tested with a preliminary aluminum drift tube structure, which was used for precise frequency and field tuning. In 2013 the final drift tube structure has been welded inside the main tanks and the preparation for copper plating has taken place. This paper will report on the main tuning and commissioning steps towards that novel type of DTL and it will show the latest results measured on a fully operational CH proton cavity shortly before copper plating.

For the FAIR proton linac at GSI a 325 MHz 4-rod RFQ prototype has been built. On this prototype RF measure- ments have been carried out. After low power conditioning in cw mode the structure was high power tested in pulsed mode. During the performance tests the 6 stem prototype was optimized and has shown the feasibility of a dipole free 4-rod RFQ at high frequencies and was testet up to 120 kW per meter. In this tests the input power and the electrode voltage was observed using gamma spectroskopy. From this the shunt impedance was calculated and compared to other methods of measurements. The power test results are presented in this paper.

The performance of an RFQ in case of its beam quality and transmission is in the basis dependent on the conformity of the field distribution of the manufactured structure with the one of its particle dynamic design. In the last years studies have been performed on the influence of various elements of the 4-rod RFQ on its field distribution. In particular the tuning process of the 4-rod RFQ with its tuning plates has been optimized. These studies have been complemented with detailed simulations on the fringe fields at the end of the electrodes and the conformity of the fields along the structure as well as the influence of other tuning elements like the piston tuner. Based on the findings of this research a proposal for a field optimized 4-rod RFQ model has been developed and will be presented in this paper.

The two Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) sections of the accelerator-driven neutron source FRANZ* consist of four solenoids. The first section with two solenoids will match the 120 keV proton beam into a chopper system**. Downstream from the chopper system a second section with two more solenoids will match the beam into the acceptance of the following RFQ. The accelerator will be operated using either a 2 mA dc beam or a pulsed beam with intensities from 50 mA to 200 mA at 250 kHz repetition rate. The high intensity of these ion beams requires the consideration of space-charge effects. Particle simulations with varying parameter sets have been performed in order to determine the settings providing best transmission and beam quality. Loss profiles along the transport channel were computed to identify hotspots. Simulation results for best transmission at lowest emittance growth will be presented.

Beam operation of an E×B chopper system has started in the Low-Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) section of the accelerator-driven neutron source FRANZ*. The chopper is designed for low-energy high-perveance beams and high repetition rates. It combines a static magnetic deflection field with a pulsed electric compensation field in a Wien filter-type E×B configuration**. Helium ions with 14 keV energy were successfully chopped at the required repetition rate of 257 kHz. The maximum chopped beam intensity of 3.5 mA, limited by the given test ion source, corresponds to a generalized perveance of 2.7·10-3. For the design species and energy, 120 keV protons, this is equivalent to a beam current of 174 mA. Beam pulses with rise times of 120 ns, flat top lengths of 85 ns to 120 ns and Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) between 295 ns and 370 ns were experimentally achieved.

The medium-energy section of the proton linear accelerator for radiotherapy under realization in the framework of the TOP-IMPLART Project consists in a high frequency 7-35 MeV SCDTL (Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac) structure. The structure, made of 4 modules supplied by one klystron, has been completely designed. The first module up to 11.6 MeV has been built and is under commissioning at ENEA-Frascati and the second and third modules are under realization. The paper describes the system and presents the main results of the experimental activity on this part of the accelerator.

The Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac (SCDTL) is a 3 GHz accelerating structure for proton therapy linac designed for TOP-IMPLART, an Intensity Modulated Proton Linear Accelerator for Radio-Therapy. The structure is made up of short DTL accelerating tanks for low current proton beams, coupled by side coupling cavities. The purpose of this paper is to report on the analysis of electromagnetic and the thermo-mechanical behavior for the SCDTL structure. The 3D electromagnetic analysis is used to derive the power dissipation on the structure; then one can infer the temperature distribution and deformation field in order to eventually evaluate their feedback on the electromagnetic properties of the structure as, for instance, the cavity resonant frequency shift. Such a "multi-physics'' analysis has been performed for different supporting stem geometries in order to optimize the shunt impedance and the R/Q for SCDTL cavities.

We shows the optimization of a five cell tank to be included as first multi-cavity within a LINAC section accelerating a proton beam from 7 MeV to higher energies, useful for proton therapy. The tank performance depends on a set of physical (beam characteristics) and geometrical parameters (radius and lengths of accelerating and coupling cavities, radius and thickness of the coupling holes among accelerating cells, the radius and the thickness of the coupling holes between off-axis coupling cells and accelerating ones). PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) have been used as approaches for the electromagnetic optimization. The model used for the fitness calculation takes into account all the most important effects occurring in the tank coupled cavities loaded by the proton beam. The codes based on PSO and ACO have enabled the global and stochastic identification of about ten optimized parameters. The design goodness has been tested via Particle and Microwave CST Studio © simulation. The optimized tank accelerates the proton beam input energy from Ein=7 MeV to about Eout= 8.2 MeV. These values, well agree with other designs reported in literature.

The Engineering Validation and Engineering Design Activities (EVEDA) phase of IFMIF aims at running a 9 MeV / 125 mA / CW deuteron accelerator to demonstrate the feasibility of IFMIF’s 40 MeV / 125 mA / CW accelerator with components mainly designed and constructed in European labs. LEDA was operated successfully in 1999-2001 as a 6.7 MeV / 100 mA / CW proton accelerator with high availability. The present paper assesses the experience gained in LEDA and explains how LIPAc, the IFMIF prototype accelerator, is inheriting its role of breaking through technological boundaries.

In order to achieve the required reliability and availability for the C-ADS accelerator, a fault tolerance design is pursued. The effects of cavity and solenoid failure in different locations have been studied and the schemes of compensation by means of local compensation have been investigated. After one cavity failure, by adjusting the settings of the neighbouring cavities and the focusing elements we can make sure that the Twiss parameters and energy are approximately recovered to that of the nominal ones at the matching point. However, the compensation work above is based on the TraceWin code, which has not considered the phase compensation, a code based on MATLAB is under developing to compensate the arrival time at the matching point that the linear space charge effect has also considered.

Superconducting technology is playing more and more important roles in high-power proton linacs. Periodic phase advance less than 90 degrees and equipartitioning design are considered very important principles in linac design. Due to the very high construction and operation costs, it is very important in optimizing the design to lower the costs. In usual, the longitudinal emittance is larger from the front-end, thus the transverse phase advance is designed to have a larger value. However, with the technical advancement, higher accelerating field can be obtained. In order to take this advantage, it is of much interest in increasing the longitudinal phase advance to shorten the linac or reduce the cost. In this paper, we present the design method that keeping the longitudinal phase advance as large as possible but smaller than 90 degree to maximize the use of the available accelerating gradient. Even though this method does not observe the equipartitioning condition, we can also obtain very good beam dynamics results by placing the tunes in resonant-free regions. In this paper, the design and simulation results by applying this method to the SPL and China-ADS linac will be present.

The project of SSC-LINAC RFQ has important progresses in the past year. The machine has been moved to the Institute of Modern Physics in the first season of 2013. The cavity measurement including tests of RF performance and field distribution is carried out again in the laboratory. The Q0 is 6440, and the unflatness of the electric field in longitudinal is ±2.5%. The results demonstrated a good agreement with simulation. The RF and beam commissioning of the RFQ has been carried out in the first half of 2014. The duty factor rose from 5% to CW gradually. By now, the cavity has been operated with 35 kW on CW mode. The measurement of the bremsstrahlung spectrum reveals that the 35 kW power is needed to generate the 70 kV inter-vane voltage. The beam transmission efficiency and energy spread has been obtained in beam commissioning by accelerating 16O5+ and 40Ar8+ beams. The efficiency of 40Ar8+ is as high as 94%, and the output energy is 142.78 keV/u. All the processes and results of the experiments will be discussed in details.

We present, in this paper, the operation status of the 3 MeV high current proton Linac for the Compact Pulsed Hadron Source (CPHS) at Tsinghua University. Proton beam with the peak current of 30 mA, pulse length of 100 μs and repetition rate of 50 Hz has been delivered to the Beryllium target to produce the neutron since July 2013. The pulse length will be further increased to 500 μs. The proton beam energy is expected to be enhanced to the designed value of 13 MeV after the Drift Tube Linac is ready in 2015.

We fabricated and assembled a hybrid single cavity (HSC) linac which is formed by combining a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) structure and a drift tube (DT) structure into one interdigital-H (IH) cavity. ]. The HSC linac was designed as an injector for a cancer facility and was able to be used as a neutron source for boron neutron capture therapy. The injection method of the HSC linac used a direct plasma injection scheme (DPIS), which is considered to be the only method for accelerating a high current heavy ion beam produced by a laser ion source. The input beam current was designed to be 20 mA, which could be produced by a laser ion source. According to the simulations and calculations, the HSC linac could accelerate a 6-mA C6+, beam which satisfies the particle number criteria for cancer therapy use (108~9 ions/pulse). Details of the measurements and evaluations of the assembled HSC linac, and details of a DPIS test using a laser ion source are reported in this paper.

A powerful heavy ion injector SSC-linac is under constructing at IMP in Lanzhou. The continuous wave (CW) 4-rod RFQ operating at 53.667 MHz has been developed as the low beam energy injector linac. The 40Ar8+ ion beam extracted from the ECR ion source was used for the RFQ commissioning. The particle energy 142.8 keV/u and the 198 euA beam current were measured at the exit of RFQ with the 94% transmission. In this paper, the recent R&D progress of the SSC-LINAC including the development of key components and the beam commissioning results are presented.

A new scheme of heavy ion injector I-3 designed for improvement of accelerated beam parameters has been proposed for ITEP-TWAC Facility. It is based on the usage of two quarter-wave double gap resonators operated on 5 MHz with accelerating voltage of 3 MV per gap. Existing 2.5 MHz double gap resonator will be retuned for operational frequency of 5 MHz and new additional one will be built. The new injector optimized for acceleration of heavy ions with A/Z in the range of 3-10 will allow accelerating any ions from C to U with beam current up to10 mA. Results of both electrodynamics and beam dynamics simulations of the accelerating structures are presented.

The CW proton linac has a number of important applications; serving as the initial part of a high-energy, high-power linac for an accelerator-driven system is the main of them. Its CW operation mode and a 5-10 mA beam current, however, are limiting factors for the accelerating field. The surface field should not exceed the Kilpatrick field by more than 1.2-1.5 times. This limitation leads to the increase in linac length and beam bunching complexity. The first results of a 2 MeV, 5 mA, CW RFQ, designed for the operating frequency of 162 MHz, are discussed. Beam dynamics simulation results, obtained by using the BEAMDULAC-RFQ code*, are presented. The electrodynamics of the accelerating structure based on the four-vane cavity is discussed. The accelerating cavity design uses coupling windows as was proposed earlier **, but with windows of an elliptical form. Such form allows for better separation of quarupole and dipole modes.

Superconducting linear accelerators based on short independently phased SC cavities are widely used today in ADS and FRIB. Such accelerator can be useful as proton therapy beam source*. The accelerator general layout to accelerate proton beam at the energy range 2-240 MeV will detail in this report. Obviously, in this linac will always violate the principle of synchronicity when the synchronous particle velocity is equal to the phase velocity of the accelerating wave and a slipping of particles relative to the accelerating wave. The beam dynamics simulation shows that linac should consist of four groups of identical cavities. Cavities should have phase velocities as βg=0.1, 0.18, 0.3 and 0.49 respectively. The choice of optimum parameters of accelerating cavities and focusing magnets will discussed and the beam dynamics simulation results will presented.

Beam transport from the exit of the LINCE linac to experimental areas has been optimized for a few ion species using transfer matrix calculations performed in MADX. An alpha spectrometer based on a double-bending achromat lattice has been used as dispersion suppressor and particle tracking studies have been carried out in GPT along it and the three beamlines. Realistic quadrupole and dipole magnet design achieved in Comsol enabled accurate particle tracking studies and evaluation of the beam parameters delivered at the target.

During the past ten years, ECOS working group and users strongly supported the construction of a dedicated high-intensity stable-ion-beam facility in Europe, with energies at and above the Coulomb barrier as part of the Long-Range Plan of the Nuclear-Physics community. LINCE will be a multi-user facility dedicated to ECOS science: fundamental physics, astrophysics, nuclear structure and reaction dynamics. Applied research is foreseen in the fields of medical physics, aerospace and material sciences with energetic heavy ions. The facility will produce a wide range of ions, from protons (45 MeV) up to Uranium (8.5 MeV/u) with 1mA maximum beam intensity. A very compact linac has been designed by using a HV platform with a double-frequency ECR ion source, multi-harmonic buncher, an innovative CW RFQ design (1 ≤A/Q ≤ 7) and 26 accelerating cavities made of bulk niobium (β = 0.045, 0.077 and 0.15) working at 72.75 and 109.125 MHz. This article gives an outline of the accelerator complex from the ion source to the experimental areas, and presents its research potential and the relevant physics instrumentation.

Low-energy acceleration for the LINCE project [1] will be achieved using a 72.75 MHz normal conducting four vanes RFQ designed to give a 460 keV/u boost for A/Q = 7 ions in about 5 m. The vanes are modeled to accommodate windows for a clear separation of the RFQ modes and easy fitting to an octagonal resonance chamber. This article presents the main numerical results of the radio-frequency modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Particle tracking studies optimized for bunching and acceleration are shown as well.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a pan-European project. It will be built by at least 17 European countries, with Sweden and Denmark as host nations. The Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) linac is composed of one section of spoke cavity cryomodules (352.21 MHz) and two sections of elliptical cavity cryomodules (704.42 MHz). These cryomodules contain niobium SRF cavities operating at 2 K. Following a redesign of its accelerator, SRF linac design shall comply with a new set of requirement, like an increase of the beam current from 50 mA to 62.5 mA and an increase of the peak electrical surface field from 40 MV/m to 45 MV/m. Requirements and the main disciplines needed to construct this portion of the linac are presented.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) uses a linear accelerator to deliver the high intensity proton beam to the target station. The average beam power is 5 MW with a peak beam power at target of 125 MW. In 2013 the ESS linac was costed and to meet the budget some modifications were introduced: the final energy was decreased from 2.5 GeV to 2.0 GeV and the beam current was increased from 50 mA to 62.5 mA to keep the same beam power. As a consequence the ESS Drift Tube Linac, DTL, has been re-designed to match the new requirements. This paper presents the main Radio Frequency (RF) and beam dynamics choices for the ESS DTL.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is one of Europe’s largest planned research infrastructures. The project is funded by a collaboration of 17 European countries and is under design and construction in Lund, Sweden. Three families of Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) cavities are being prototyped, counting the spoke resonators with a geometric beta of 0.5, medium-beta elliptical cavities (β=0.67) and high beta elliptical cavities (β=0.86). The ESS linac will produce 2.86 ms long proton pulses with a repetition rate of 14 Hz (4 % duty cycle), a beam current of 62.5 mA and an average beam power of 5 MW. A control system is being developed to operate the different accelerator systems. All operating modes of the superconducting linac shall ensure a safe operation of the accelerator. This paper presents the preliminary functional analysis and the operating modes of the 704 MHz SRF linac.

The European Spallation Source, ESS, uses a linear accelerator to bombard the tungsten target with the high intensity protons beam for producing intense beams of neutrons. The nominal average beam power of the linac is 5~MW with a peak beam power at target of 125~MW. During last year the ESS linac was costed, and to meet the budget a few modifications were introduced to the linac design. One of the major changes is the reduction of final energy from 2.5~GeV to 2.0~GeV and therefore beam current was increased accordingly to compensate for the lower final energy. As a result the linac is designed to meet the cost objective by taking a higher risk. This paper focuses on the driving forces behind the new design, engineering and beam dynamics requirements of the design and finally on the beam dynamics performance of the linac.

Following the completion of the latest layout of the ESS linac statistical error studies have been performed to define the field vector quality and alignment tolerances. Based on these tolerances and error study results a scheme for the correction system is proposed that assures low losses and permits hands-on maintenance. This paper reports on the strategy of simulating and performing the error studies as well as setting the tolerances.

A radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) and drift tube linac (DTL) in the ESS proton linac are connected with a medium energy beam transport (MEBT) to remove low intensity bunches on the head and tail of a macro-pulse with a chopper and house diagnostic devices to characterize and adjust the beam out of the RFQ for the DTL. These must be achieved within a relatively short space and without large degradation of beam quality due to space charge force, imposing a challenge on the lattice design. This paper presents a beam physics design of the MEBT in the ESS proton linac, which satisfies its requirement while preserving a decent beam quality.

Sorting optical elements has significant potential during the construction of superconducting linacs like the ESS, in the same way that it has proved to be very effective in circular accelerators like RHIC and the LHC. In the linac domain, the elements of primary interest are cavities and cryomodules, instead of the magnets (of all sorts) that are routinely sorted in circular accelerators. Multiple cavities can be sorted to optimise individual cryomodules, and cryomodules can be sorted into optimised locations within the tunnel. Different sorting strategies are discussed and preliminarily evaluated in this paper. Central to the evaluation is the identification of goal (or penalty) functions that are maximised (or minimised), and which can be rapidly quantified by simulation. Also crucial is the availability of a modeling system that is realistic in its complex representation of the linac, and which can easily be modified and developed.

Linac4 is a normal conducting 160 MeV H− linear accelerator presently being installed and progressively commissioned at CERN. It will replace the ageing 50 MeV Linac2 as injector of the PS Booster (PSB), increasing at the same time its brightness by a factor of two thanks to the higher injection energy. This will be the first step of a program to increase the beam intensity in the LHC injectors for the needs of the High-Luminosity LHC project. After a series of beam measurements on a dedicated test stand the 3 MeV Linac4 front-end, including ion source, RFQ and a beam chopping line, has been recommissioned at its final position in the Linac4 tunnel. Commissioning of the following section, the Drift Tube Linac, is starting. Beam commissioning will take place in steps of increasing energy, to reach the final 160 MeV in 2015. An extended beam measurement phase including testing of stripping equipment for the PSB and a year-long test run to assess and improve Linac4 reliability will take place in 2016, prior to the connection of Linac4 to the PSB that will take place during the next long LHC shut-down.

The Turkish Accelerator Center Proton Accelerator Facility (TAC PAF) based on a 1 MW, 2 GeV proton linac will include both normal conducting and superconducting accelerator structures. The project is currently in the technical design phase. The normal conducting part of the TAC PAF will consist of an ion source, a low energy beam transport line, a radio frequency quadrupole, a medium energy beam transport line, and two drift tube linac structures in order to accelerate the beam up to 65 MeV. Acceleration from 65 MeV up to 150 MeV and then 2 GeV energy will be provided by a SC-spoke cavity and two SC-elliptical cavities, respectively. In the long term, TAC PAF will be used as a neutron source. The accelerator structures, their design, and possible experimental stations of TAC PAF project will be presented.

The Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) of SNRTC Project Prometheus (SPP) will be a demonstration and educational machine which will accelerate protons from 20 keV to 1.5 MeV. The project is funded by Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK) and it will be located at Saraykoy Nuclear Research and Training Center (SNRTC) in Ankara. The SPP beamline consists of a multi-cusp H+ ion source, a Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) line and a four-vane RFQ operating at 352.2 MHz. The design studies for the multi-cusp ion source (RF or DC) were performed with IBSimu and SIMION software packages. The source has already been produced and currently undergoes extensive testing. There is also a preliminary design for the solenoid based LEBT, POISSON and PATH were used in parallel for the preliminary design. Two solenoid magnets are produced following this design. The RFQ design was made using LIDOS. RFQ.Designer and it was crosschecked with a home-grown software package, DEMIRCI. The initial beam dynamics studies have been performed with both LIDOS and TOUTATIS. This paper discusses the design of the SPP beamline focusing on the RFQ beam dynamics.

The ReA reaccelerator facility at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) will provide a unique capability to study reactions with low-energy beams of rare isotopes. A beam from the coupled cyclotron facility is stopped in a gas stopping system, charge bred in an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT), and then reaccelerated in a compact superconducting LINAC. At present the beam repetition rate at the ReA targets is the same as the LINAC RF frequency of 80.5 MHz. A lower frequency would be desirable for many types of experiments using time of flight data acquisitions. Studies were undertaken to investigate possible methods of reducing the beam frequency with minimal reduction in overall beam current. This paper reports the results of preliminary design studies of such a low frequency prebuncher designed to increase the pulse separation and minimize bunch lengths at the detector.

The ReA reaccelerator facility at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) will provide a unique capability to study reactions with low-energy beams of rare isotopes. A beam from the coupled cyclotron facility is stopped in a gas stopping system, charge bred in an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT), and then reaccelerated in a compact superconducting LINAC. The beam is injected into the LINAC by a room-temperature Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) combined with an external Multiharmonic Buncher. (MHB) In preparation for future upgrades to the capabilities of the ReA, an accurate determination of the longitudinal acceptance of the RFQ was conducted using a stable ion beam from a test source. This paper presents the results of the acceptance measurement, including empirical confirmation of a predicted asymmetry in the shape of the acceptance window.

Rationales to assess and minimize costs for a Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) proton linac are outlined. Operating frequency, velocity profile and temperature are regarded as variables when applicable. Hardware plus labor costs for cavities and cryomodules as well as expenditures for facility infrastructures including cryogenic systems, conventional facilities, and relevant subsystems are estimated. The focus is on the assessment of a 10 MW, 1 GeV Continuous Wave (CW) linac for an Accelerator Driven Subcritical Reactor (ADSR)

The construction of IPHI (High Power Proton Accelerator) is in its final step of installation. The RFQ will accelerate beam up to 100 mA with energy up to 3 MeV. The RFQ, made of six modules, one meter each, is of the four-vane type. The RFQ is divided in 2-meter long segments with capacitive coupling. It is also equipped with 96 fixed tuners and four waveguide RF ports located in the fourth module. This paper describes the procedure used to tune the accelerating field and power couplers of the RFQ.

The well-known 3-gradient method allows accessing to a beam RMS emittance and Twiss parameters at a position A by measuring its rms size at a downstream position B with at least 3 different transport conditions from A to B. We suggest extending this method to access to a beam phase-space distribution model at A from beam profiles measured at B. We propose to use an iterative method which consists in: - defining a parametric model describing the beam distribution in 4D transverse phase-space at a position A, - adjusting iteratively the model parameters by minimizing the difference between beam profiles measured at B and these obtained by transporting the beam generated according to the model with TraceWIN code from A to B. This method allows taking into account space-charge and other transport non-linearities.

The TraceWIN code is used to simulate the dynamics of the particles and to design linear particle accelerators. The growth of rms emittance along the accelerator is often used to estimate the quality of a design. For high beam powers, the aim is also to limit the production of halo in order to keep particle losses under a requested limit. We present in this article the different ways to quantify this halo in TraceWin.

The Frankfurt neutron source at the Stern-Gerlach-Zentrum (FRANZ) will provide ultra-short neutron pulses at high intensities and repetition rates. The neutrons will be produced using the 7Li(p, n)7Be reaction induced by a proton beam. The 175 MHz IH-type drift tube linac with 8 gaps succeeds a 4-rod-RFQ. Together they form a coupled linac combination with a length of 2.3 m and accelerate the protons from 120 keV to 2.03 MeV. As the RF losses add up to 200 kW, the cooling of both accelerators is a central challenge. The RFQ-IH combination is powered by a radio frequency amplifier, which couples the RF power into the RFQ. The two structures are connected via inductive coupling. The initial beam operation of the accelerators is configured for 50 mA in cw mode. The IH-components were fabricated, RF tuning measurements are underway. The RFQ and the IH-DTL will be conditioned separately and then be connected, aiming for a beam operation at the end of 2014. A main challenge in fabrication was the precise welding required for the water cooled drift tubes and stems.

The radiation leakage accident occurred at the J-PARC hadron experimental hall in May 2013 was triggered by a target damage due to an unanticipated short beam pulse from J-PARC main ring. An extremely short beam pulse was produced by a rapid current increase of the quadrupole (EQ) power supply system for a spill feedback. A simulation with the slow extraction process could explain such a short beam pulse generation. The cause of the malfunction has been identified by an intensive investigation of the EQ power supply system performed after the accident. We will show measures to prevent recurrence.

In J-PARC, a radioactive material leak accident occurred at the Hadron Experimental Facility on May 23, 2013. The accident was triggered by a malfunction of the slow extraction system of the Main Ring synchrotron. After seven-month long shutdown due to the accident, beam operation of the linac was restarted in December 2013. In this paper, the most recent status of the beam operation is presented.

The high intensity proton accelerator complex (J-PARC) consists of the Linac, the 25Hz rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) and the 50GeV main synchrotron (MR). During the long shutdown of 2013, the Linac energy was upgraded from 181MeV to the design value of 400MeV. In the RCS, we have installed the last 12th RF system. In operation from January 2014, beam commissioning aimed at 1 MW operation will be started. In the MR, the upgrade plan of the beam power, realizing by raising the repetition, has been started. For this reason the accelerating voltage must be increased, and all MR RF systems will be replaced with more efficient systems. A new magnetic alloy material (FT3L) has been developed. Manufacturing of the FT3L accelerating cavities has proceeded. It becomes possible to increase the accelerating voltage from 280 kV to 540 kV, using the new cavities in combination with the existing RF power supplies. We have started the developments of a 2nd harmonic system loaded with air-cooled FT3L cores and a high-Q VHF cavity system, too. Both systems are used for longitudinal dilution increase the bunching factor of the circulating high intensity proton beam.

Big issue for the J-PARC 3GeV RCS was displacement of main magnets caused by last big earthquake because this made beam loss more than 400 kW beam power. Since realignment of main magnet and other components was essential to realize higher beam power and stable operation, this work has been done last maintenance period. To minimize amount of realignment work, we decided that not all components moved to designed regular potions but also minimum components moved to the position which was secured design acceptance 486 π mm mrad. Almost all components which are main magnets, rf cavities, and extraction magnets had to be moved in the range of 10 mm for horizontal, 3 mm for vertical and 9 mm for longitudinal, respectively. It was not necessary for the components installed in injection straight line to move because displacement of these components was less than ± 0.2 mm. At same time 400 MeV injection upgrade work should be done. Beam commissioning is planned from the middle of January 2014. The progress and status of the RCS in J-PARC are presented.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade project (LIU), a complete replacement of the existing narrow-band rf systems of CERN PSB with wide-band magnetic alloy (MA) loaded rf systems is in progress. A single gap MA loaded rf system prototype, which uses solid-state power amplifier and includes fast rf feedback for beam loading compensation, has been installed in the J-PARC MR to investigate the system behavior with high intensity proton beams. We report the wake voltage measurement results with and without fast rf feedback. In addition to the fast feedback, the rf feedforward method is under consideration to compensate the heavy beam loading more effectively. Preliminary beam test results with feedforward are also presented.

Intensity upgrade of very heavy ions such as uranium or xenon beams is one of the main concerns at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF). The lifetime problem of carbon-foil strippers due to the high energy loss of beams was a principal bottleneck for the intensity upgrade. We have already developed and successfully operated a re-circulating He-gas stripper for 10-MeV/u uranium beams as an alternative to carbon foils. Recently, the 2nd gas stripper with air dedicated for 50-MeV/u 124Xe beams was developed. The differential pumping techniques similar to that used in the He gas stripper was applied. We confined a very thick gas target, up to 20~mg/cm2 of air, in a 0.5-m target chamber. One good feature of using air is that it can be inexhaustible for our use. The stripper was stably operated in user runs performed in June 2013. The service rate reached 91\%. The maximum beam intensity reached 38~pnA and the average intensity provided to users becomes approximately four times higher than it was in 2012. The down-time free gas strippers greatly contributed to these improvements. We also discuss the applicability of the air stripper to 50-MeV/u 238U beams.

The prospects for future high-power proton beams for producing neutrinos at CERN within the LAGUNA-LBNO study, include the design of a 2 MW High-Power Pro- ton Synchrotron (HP-PS). In this paper, the optics design of the ring is reviewed, comprising Negative Momentum Compaction (NMC) arc cells and quadrupole triplet long straight sections, flexible enough to achieve the constraints imposed mainly by different beam transfer equipment and processes. A global tunability study is undertaken includ- ing aperture and magnet parameter considerations. Basic correction systems are specified and their impact to beam dynamics including dynamic aperture is finally evaluated.

The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam dump system is a concern for the planned High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operation. The system has initially been designed for very different beam parameters compared to those which will reign after the completion of the LHC injectors upgrade, when the SPS will have to operate with unprecedented beam brightness. This paper describes the relevant operational and failure modes of the dump system together with the expected beam loading levels. Tracking studies are presented, considering both normal operation and failure scenarios, with particular attention on the location and level of proton losses. First FLUKA investigations and thermo-mechanical analysis of the high-energy absorber block are described

CERN has put in place an ambitious improvement programme to make the injector chain of the LHC capable of supplying the high intensity and high brightness beams requested by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project. The LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project comprises a new Linac (Linac4) as well as major upgrades and renovations of the PSB, PS and SPS synchrotrons. The heavy ion injector chain is also included, adding Linac3 and LEIR to the list of accelerators concerned. This paper reports on the work completed during the first long LHC shutdown, and outlines the further upgrade path.

The Front End Test Stand (FETS) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) is intended to demonstrate the early stages of acceleration (0-3 MeV) and beam chopping required for high power proton accelerators, including proton drivers for pulsed neutron spallation sources and neutrino factories. A Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), consisting of three solenoids and four drift sections, is used to transport the H− beam from the ion source to the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). We present the current performance of the LEBT with regards to beam alignment, transmission and focusing into the acceptance of the RFQ.

Measurements of reflected/generated on oscillating wire secondary particles/photons in synchronism with oscillating wire frequency are proposed to done. The differential signal on wire maximal deviations at oscillation process can provide a fast signal proportional to beam profile gradient. Idea of usage of such “Resonant Target” for beam transversal gradient investigation was tested with lightening the oscillating wire by a laser.

Proton/ion beams of multiple charge/mass ratio can be very complex. Orthogonal X-Y projections are often inappropriate to represent these profiles. An array of vibrating wires, rotating around the beam axis is under development. The mechanical implementation is described. An algorithm to reconstruct the profile is proposed. The tradeoffs between the number of wires, the rotation angles, the response time and the profile resolution are discussed.

The bunch length of the 3 GeV electron storage ring at the Australian Synchrotron has been measured using reflective input optics feeding a streak camera. An Offner optical design was employed to reduce the chromatic broadening of the input optics of the streak camera. Using the reflective input optics the bunch length is measured to be 15% shorter than with the refractive input optics. The measured bunch length is now in good agreement with the model of the storage ring and the values are being used for calibration, monitoring and optimisation of the machine. The results of studies to characterise the streak camera shall also be presented.

Preliminary plans are presented for a sub-Angstrom wavelength XFEL at the Australian Synchrotron light source site. The design is based around a 6 GeV x-band linac from the CLIC Project. One of the motivations for the design is to have an XFEL co-located on the site with existing storage ring based synchrotron light source. The desire and ability of the Australian photon science community to win beamtime on existing XFELs has lead to this design study to plan for a future machine in Australia. The technology choice is also driven by the Australian participation in the CLIC Collaboration and the local HEP community.

Sirius is a 3 GeV synchrotron light source that is being built by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). It will be part of a novel class of light sources with emittances in the sub-nm level. Both horizontal and vertical beam sizes at the dipoles will be of the order of or below 10μm, creating difficulties for measuring them using conventional techniques. This paper proposes a series of beamlines using different techniques that, combined, will be able not only to resolve beam sizes, but also measure energy spread and local transverse coupling in the storage ring.

In a synchrotron light source like SOLEIL, Beam Position Monitors (BPM) are optimized to have the highest sensitivity for an electron beam passing nearby their mechanical center. Nevertheless, this optimization is done to the detriment of the response linearity when the beam is off-centered for dedicated machine physic studies. To correct for the geometric non-linearity of the BPM, we have applied an algorithm using boundary element method. Moreover the BPM electronics is able to provide position data at a turn-by-turn rate. Unfortunately the filtering process in this electronics mixes the information from one turn to the neighboring turns. An additional demixing algorithm has been set-up to correct for this artefact. The paper reports on performance and limitations of those two algorithms that are used at SOLEIL to correct the BPM data.

Fiber beam loss monitor (FBLM) is an attractive solution to measure intensity and position of the beam losses in the real time. It is a very useful tool, especially, for the commissioning and beam alignment. In this article we report on the development of the FBLM at PHIL (PHotoinjector at LAL, Orsay, France) as a prototype of the beam loss monitor for the ThomX machine, the compact Compton based X-ray source being in the construction phase in Orsay.

Measurements of coherent radiation at accelerators typically give the absolute value of the beam profile Fourier transform but not its phase. Phase reconstruction techniques such as Hilbert transform or Kramers Kronig reconstruction are used to recover such phase. We report a study of the performances of these methods and how to optimize the reconstructed profiles.

The use of Smith-Purcell radiation to measure electrons longitudinal profiles has been demonstrated at several facilities in the picosecond and sub-picosecond range. There is a strong interest for the development of non intercepting longitudinal profile diagnostics for high current proton beams. We present here results of simulations on the expected yield of longitudinal profile monitors using Smith-Purcell radiation for such proton beams.

Super luminous flavor factories, as SuperKEKB in Japan, aim to achieve very high luminosity thanks to a newly employed concept, the nano-beam scheme, where ultra-low emittance beams collide at very large crossing angle . Luminosity optimisation and dynamic imperfections require fast luminosity measurements. The aimed precision, 10-3 in 10 ms, can be achieved thanks to the very large cross-section of the radiative Bhabha process at zero-photon scattering angle. As a result of huge particle fluxes, diamond sensors are chosen to be placed just outside the beam-pipe, downstream of the interaction point, at locations with event rates consistent with the aimed precision and small enough contamination by backgrounds from single-beam particle losses . We will present the results concerning the investigation of the optimal positioning of our diamond sensors, taking into account the rate of Bhabha particles, their interactions with the beam pipe material.

Beam halo hitting on the beam pipe after the Interaction Point (IP) can generate a large amount of background for the measurements of the nano meter beam size using the laser interferometer beam size monitor (Shintake monitor) at ATF2. In order to investigate the beam halo transverse distribution, a diamond detector will be installed downstream of the IP. A feasibility study of a transverse halo collimation system to reduce the background for these measurements is also in progress. Prior to the diamond detector installation, a first attempt of beam halo measurements have been performed in 2013 using the currently installed wire scanners. Modeling of the beam halo distribution in the extraction (EXT) line was done and compared with the old modeling for ATF. Beam halo measurements were also done using the post-IP wire scanner to investigate the beam halo distribution at post-IP.

We are developing a diamond detector for beam halo and Compton spectrum diagnostics after the interaction point (IP) of ATF2, a low energy (1.3 GeV) prototype of the final focus system for ILC and CLIC linear collider projects. Tests of a 500 μm thick sCVD diamond detector with a dimension of 4.5 mm×4.5 mm have been carried out with radioactive sources and with electron beam from PHIL low energy (<10 MeV) photo-injector at LAL. The tests at PHIL were done with different beam intensities in air, just after the exit window at the end of the beam line, to test the response of the diamond detector and the readout electronics. We have successfully detected signals from single electrons, using a 40 dB amplifier, and from an electron beam of 108 electrons, using a 24 dB attenuator. A diamond sensor with 4 strips has been designed and fabricated for installation in the vacuum chambers of ATF2 and PHIL, with the aim to scan both the beam halo (with 2 strips of 1.5 mm×4 mm) and the beam core (with 2 strips of 0.1 mm×4 mm) transverse distributions.

The E-203 collaboration is testing a device on FACET at SLAC to measure the longitudinal profile of electron bunches using Smith-Purcell radiation. At FACET the electron bunches have an energy of 20GeV and a duration of a few hundred femtoseconds. Smith-Purcell radiation is emitted when a charged particle passes close to the surface of a metallic grating. The set-up installed in FACET consists in four targets (three gratings and a blank) on a carrousel on one side and eleven pyroelectric detectors on the opposite side, the beam passing between. At the moment, the measurement is averaged over a hundred pulses or more. We have studied the stability of the measurement from pulse to pulse and the resolution of the measure depending on the number of grating used.

Measuring electron beam charge lower than 1pC is very challenging since the traditional diagnostics, like Faraday Cup and ICT, are limited in resolution to a few pC. A way to simply measure lower charge would be to use the linear relation, existing before saturation regime, between the incident charge and the total light intensity emitted by a YAG screen. Measurement has been performed on PHIL accelerator at LAL, with charge lower than 50pC, with a YAG screen located just in front of a Faraday Cup. It shows a very good linear response of the YAG screen up to the Faraday Cup resolution limit (2pC) and therefore allows calibrating the YAG screen for lower charge measurement with an estimated precision of 4%. A noise analysis allows estimating the YAG screen resolution limit around 40fC. Results of low charge measurement on PHIL will be shown and compared to those coming from a diamond detector installed on PHIL, in order to validate the measurement principle and to determine its precision and resolution limit. Such simple measurement may thereafter be used as single-shot charge diagnostic for electron beam generated and accelerated by laser-plasma interaction.

The goal of 3-phase method is to determine the length of an electron beam without dedicated diagnostics by varying the measurement conditions of its energy spread, through a change in the RF phase of an accelerating structure. The originality here comes from the fact that it is applied on high-brightness electron beams of few MeV generated by RF photo-injectors. It allows testing the accuracy of 3-phase method, since the length to reconstruct is known as being that of the laser pulse generating the beam. It requires establishing the longitudinal transfer matrix of a RF photo-injector, which is difficult since the electron velocity vary from 0 to relativistic during its path*. The 3-phase method in RF photo-injector has been simulated by ASTRA and PARMELA codes, validating the principle of the method. First measurement has been done on PHIL accelerator at LAL, showing a good agreement with the expected length. I will then show results obtained at PITZ with a standing wave booster and a comparison with those coming from a Cerenkov detector. Finally, measurements at higher energy performed on the SOLEIL LINAC with travelling wave accelerating structures will be exposed.

At JLab and Bergoz Instrumentation Goubau lines are used for beam instrumentation testing. A Goubau line differs fundamentally from standard bench testing techniques in the way it produces the electromagnetic fields which interact with the DUT. This allows to acquire complementary information about DUT characteristics. Consequently, we improve our knowledge about the DUT. At JLab BPM responses have been successfully mapped and at Bergoz Instrumentation high frequency behavior of current transformers is under study. We present results, highlight benefits and outline ideas for future studies of additional accelerator components.

Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the terahertz frequency range is a powerful tool for the diagnostics of the electron-beam relying on the fact that the emission spectrum of THz CSR depends on the shape of the electron bunch from which the radiation is emitted. Among available direct THz detectors only superconducting microbolometers and Schottky diodes are capable to resolve single CSR pulses. Here we present recent photoresponse measurements of CSR with a quasioptical zero-bias Schottky diode detector which was produced at ACST GmbH. The rise-time of the recorded real-time transient was limited to approximately 20 ps by the 18-GHz bandwidth of interconnecting cables. Non-saturated responsivity of the detector, that is the amplitude of the voltage transient referred to the total CSR pulse energy in the detector quasioptical mode, was approximately 1.5 mV/fJ. The dynamic range of the detector spans almost three orders of magnitude from 3 fJ to 1 pJ. The intrinsic jitter of the detector was less than 2 ps thus not affecting the effective time resolution and allowing us to measure the arrival-time jitter of CSR pulses for different settings of the storage ring parameters.

For the upgrade of the accelerator facility ELSA towards higher stored beam currents, a non-destructive beam analysis is being implemented at the 2.5 GeV booster synchrotron. It is a fast ramping combined function synchrotron with an extraction repetition rate of 50 Hz. Typically, beam currents of 10 mA are accelerated from 20 MeV to the extraction energy of 1.2 GeV within 8.6 ms, hence the magnetic field is increased by up to 85 T/s. A synchrotron light monitor as the primary diagnostic tool will be utilized for measuring the transversal position and intensity distribution of the beam. Its dynamics on the fast energy ramp is of distinct interest. The proposed set-up of the synchrotron light monitor and the current development are presented.

The pulse stretcher ring ELSA delivers polarized and non-polarized electrons with an adjustable beam energy of 0.5 - 3.5 GeV to external experimental stations. To meet the growing demands of the user community regarding beam intensity and quality, the upgrade of vital accelerator components is an ongoing process. This includes the improvement of the beam diagnostics in order to resolve and monitor intensity and quality limiting effects. ELSA has recently been equipped with a diagnostic synchrotron radiation beamline housing a streak camera as main beam imaging device. It extends the diagnostics capabilities into the picosecond temporal resolution regime and captures fast longitudinal and transverse beam dynamics. The obtained measurements provide crucial feedback for further machine optimization. The overall performance of the streak camera system and machine relevant measurements are presented.

At the planned Proton LINAC at the FAIR facility, four-fold button Beam Position Monitor (BPM) will be installed at 14 locations along the 30 m long FAIR p-LINAC. The LINAC comprises of crossbar H-mode (CH) cavity to accelerate a 70 mA proton beam up to 70 MeV at frequency of 325 MHz. At four locations, the BPMs will be an integral part of the inter-tank section between the CCH and CH cavities within an evacuated housing. As the BPM centre is only 48 mm apart from the upstream cavity boundary, the rf-background at the BPM position, generated by the cavity must be evaluated. In this paper the mechanical design of the BPM for the inter-tank section is presented and the rf-noise at the BPM location is discussed.

The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is a complex yet ongoing project which will allow for a broad range of experimental physics programs as well as a variety of material and medical applications. Being a heavy ion storage ring at FAIR, the Collector Ring (CR) is perfectly suitable for scientific investigations on fundamental properties – such as masses and lifetimes – of short-lived radioactive nuclei when it operates in isochronous mode. To fulfill stringent experimental requirements, a compatible heavy ion detector sensitive to beam intensities and positions is highly demanded. In this paper we present a conceptual design of cavity-based Schottky noise pickup to achieve non-destructive detections of stored particles. Computer-aided simulations follow immediately to justify the feasibility of such a design.

The FAIR facility will serve as a versatile accelerator for ions of energies between 100 MeV/u and 29 GeV/u with an intensity variation over more than 6 orders of magnitude. In the transport lines the transverse profile determination will be based mainly on intersecting methods: Scintillations screens, SEM-Grids, Multi-Wire-Proportional Chambers and possibly Optical Transition Radiation screens. The devices are tested at the existing SIS18 at GSI where ions are ex-tracted either in a fast mode (about 1 mus) or resonant mode within about typically 0.3 s. The imaging properties of scintillation screens of different materials (ceramics, phosphor screens and single crystals) with ion beams with energies above 300 MeV/u were investigated. Over intensities 105 to 109 particles per pulse the light yield for the screens is linear with respect to the ion intensity. Moreover, the radiation resistance of the screens was tested. The applicability of optical transition radiation for beams of velocities below 90%c was investigated systematically with heavy ions. The experimental results are compared to wire-based methods obtained with SEM-Grids and MWPCs.

The FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) accelerator facility presently under construction at GSI will supply a wide range of beam intensities for physics experiments. Design beam intensities range from 2.5·1013 protons/cycle to be delivered to the pBar-target and separator for production of antiprotons, to beams of e.g. 109 ions/s in the case of slowly extracted beams. The large intensity range demands for dedicated beam current monitors for precise, non-destructive beam intensity measurements in the synchrotrons, transport lines and storage rings of the FAIR facility. This report describes GSI developments of purpose-built beam current monitors for the SIS100 synchrotron and high-energy beam transport lines (HEBT) of FAIR. Prototype measurements with a SQUID-based Cryogenic Current Comparator and a resonant beam charge transformer are presented, and possibilities for further upgrades are discussed.

At the 1.5-GeV electron storage ring DELTA operated by the TU Dortmund University as a synchrotron radiation user facility, bunch-by-bunch feedback systems are in use for electron beam diagnostics and for the suppression of multibunch instabilities. An automatic readout of bunch position data allows a real-time modal analysis during machine operation. An excitation of particular multibunch modes enables the determination of growth and damping times for all modes independently. Further investigations of beam stability and natural damping times of all modes even below the instability threshold have been performed. In addition, first bunch-by-bunch data taken from the booster synchrotron are shown.

Bunch compression monitors are essential for the efficient operation of linear accelerators. The spectral distribution of coherently generated THz radiation is a favorable measure for the shape of the electron bunches. Today, THz spectrometers are bulky and costly. Here, the concept of an integrated on-chip semiconductor spectrometer being developed in a joint effort by HZDR and TU Dresden within the scope of the BMBF project InSEl is presented. This potentially low-cost and compact solution based on Schottky diode detectors, integrated on-chip THz antennas and filters fabricated in a commercial GaAs process will not exceed 5 mm in size replacing current single element THz detectors in the bunch compression monitors in the ELBE accelerator at HZDR. Covering the frequency range from 0.1 to 1.5 THz (and more in the future) with a resolution of 5 to 20 points, it could also be of interest for the longitudinal electron bunch diagnostic at other electron linacs such as FLUTE, BERLinPro, FLASH or the European X-FEL. Furthermore, the detector bandwidth in the GHz range supports the high repetition rates of superconducting radio frequency accelerators.

The ELBE accelerator is a super conduction electron cw machine located at the Helmholtz Center Dresden Rossendorf Germany with 1 mA current, now tested for up to 2 mA. Besides other important diagnostics for setting up the machine for user beam time and further improvement of the machine – a THz source is momentary under commissioning – a EOS measuring station for bunch length measurements is locate right behind the second super conducting Linac. Measuring with a crystal in the vicinity of an up to 2 mA cw beam implies higher beam loss and also higher radiation exposure of the crystal and hence also a safety risk for the UHV conditions of the super conducting cavities in the case of crystal damage. Therefore the EOS measuring principle is adapted to larger measuring distances and also for beam requirements with lower bunch charge at ELBE. A description of the setup, considerations of special boundary conditions and as well results for 13 MHz cw beam operation are presented.

One of the most important parameters of accelerators is their beam energy. So far, the method of resonant depolarization was used to accurately determine the energy at 2.5 GeV of the ANKA electron storage ring, which, however, becomes cumbersome for lower energies. A good alternative is the detection of Compton backscattered photons, generated by laser light scattered off the relativistic electron beam. To achieve compactness and integration into the storage ring, the setup of transverse scattering is proposed instead of conventional head-on collision. The feasibility has been studied by comparison between simulations of Compton backscattered photons by AT and CAIN 2.35 and actual measurement of background radiation with an HPGe (High Purity Germanium) spectrometer. The layout of the setup is also included in the paper.

The commissioning of a new real-time and high-accuracy data acquisition system suitable for recording individual ultra-short coherent pulses detected by fast terahertz detectors will be presented. The system is able to monitor turn-by-turn all buckets in streaming mode. The main board consists of a direct sampling board operating with a minimum sampling time of 3 psec and a time jitter less than 1.7 psec. The very low noise layout design combined with a wide dynamic range and bandwidth of the analog front-end allows to sample pulse signals generated by various GHz/THz detectors, like NbN and YBCO superconductor film detectors or zero biased Schottky Diode detectors. The digitized data is transmitted to the DAQ system by an FPGA readout board with a data transfer rate of 4 GByte/s. The setup is accomplished by a real-time data processing unit based on high-end graphics processors (GPUs) for on-line analysis of the frequency behaviour of the coherent synchrotron emissions. The system has been successfully used to study the beam properties of the ANKA synchrotron radiation source located at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and operating in the energy range between 0.5-2.5 GeV

The project goal was to develop, commission and operate a complete beam diagnostics system to fully characterize the compact medical linear electron accelerators. An overview of the whole system including the beam diagnostics, linear accelerator and control and supply unit is given. The system was successfully commissioned in July 2013. We report on initial experiences and first experimental results on current measurements, transverse beam size, transverse emittance and momentum and momentum distribution gained during the commissioning phase.

Recent experience from linac based FELs like LCLS or FLASH shows that transverse beam imaging based on optical transition radiation (OTR) might fail due to coherence effects in the OTR emission process. In order to overcome the problem it was proposed to use transition radiation (TR) in the EUV region*. For a reliable beam diagnostics however, an increase of the light output in the EUV region is required. One possibility to increase the radiation yield in the geometry of interest (target tilt angles 22.5 or 45 degrees) is to exchange the conventional monolayer target by a multilayer structure which acts as a multilayer X-ray mirror for EUV radiation. In this case, two radiation components are expected to contribute to the measured signal, diffracted transition radiation (DTR) and parametric radiation (PR)**. In this report we present results of an experimental investigation of EUV TR generated by a 5.7 MeV electron beam at monolayer and multilayer targets. The angular characteristics of the radiation was investigated and compared with theoretical models.

The long-term stability of the beam optics at FLASH is crucial for all connected experiments and the operation of the new second beamline FLASH2. It is therefore desirable to have a simple procedure to monitor the beam optics routinely and at the same time minimally invasive. This way user operation is not disturbed. An automated procedure, which has been successfully employed at the SLAC linac is presented in the context of FLASH. The betatron oscillations of selectively kicked pulses are recorded using BPMs at a fixed time interval. An online algorithm is then used to extract the betatron phase advance, as well as potential growth of the betatron oscillation amplitude and the Twiss parameters beta and alpha. Using this method, the long-term beam optics stability can be monitored in order to identify potential sources of drifts.

The FLASH facility at DESY is currently enhanced by a second beamline (FLASH2) to extend the capacity for user experiments. In addition, certain support systems like the timing system and the BPM system at the existing FLASH accelerator have been partly renewed and are now under commissioning. New button BPM electronics based on the MTCA.4 for physics standard is provided for the FLASH2 beamline and is foreseen as a replacement of the old BPM electronics at FLASH. Compared to the predecessor of the FLASH button BPM electronics, the new system has been specifically designed for low charge operation exceeding a wide dynamical charge range between 100pC and 3nC. Special provisions have been made to enable single bunch measurements in a self-triggered mode, enabling timing-system-independent measurements during commissioning and at fallback during normal operation.

When a laser pulse with focused intensity exceeding 1018W/cm2 interacts with a solid target, electrons in the focal spot are accelerated to relativistic velocity and where they generate inner-shell vacancies and hard x-ray(>10 keV) spectral line and Bremsstrahlung radiation. In laser plasma interactions, the resonance between betatron motion of electrons and ultraintense laser pulses is an interesting phenomenon in both electron acceleration and gamma photon production. Even though the gamma-ray synchrotron is micron scale, the energy ranges from ~1 MeV to ~102MeV. To detect the energy of the gamma-ray accurately is particularly significant. Owing to a lot of various energy of gamma-ray are emitted in femtosecond scale, which are impossible distinguished from each other on the time. A small freon-filled bubble chamber is being built to measure the energy spectrum of high-energy photons. After that, we can calculate the electron’s energy and then offer the data for various of electron acceleration theories. It combines a good spatial resolution with a large depth of field, allowing a large number of tracks. This improves the statistical quality of the photon spectrum.

A new linac, named REGAE (Relativistic Electron Gun for Atomic Exploration) has been built at DESY and operates as an electron source for ultra-fast electron diffraction. An RF photocathode gun provides electron bunches of high coherence, sub-pC charge and energies of 2-5 MeV. In order to film time-resolved structural changes of excited specimens, bunch lengths of several femtoseconds need to be created. Taking into account these critical parameters, beam diagnostics at REGAE is very challenging. The existing diagnostics consists of energy, energy spread, beam profile, beam charge and emittance measurements. For transversal diagnostics, specific approaches have to be considered to overcome complications associated with the low charge and to carry out the beam diagnostics in single shot. In this paper, the contribution of the transversal diagnostics to the measurement of the transverse emittance is presented.

The Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center (HIT) is a heavy ion accelerator facility located at the Heidelberg university hospital and intended for cancer treatment with heavy ions and protons. Currently ionization chambers with highly sensitive charge amplifiers are regularly used for intensity measurements of the high-energy ion beams. A new intensity measuring method will be presented based on the combination of fluorescent light from inorganic scintillators and an optoelectronic sensor with adjacent electronics as an alternative to the ionization chambers. A special measurement set-up with a large-area Si PIN-diode and adapted optics was investigated with respect to signal dynamics, resolution and linearity. The experimental results with proton and carbon beams will be presented in detail. Worth mentioning is a variation in sensitivity relating to the position of the beam spot, which could be reduced to some percent only.

The cryogenic storage ring (CSR) at MPI für Kernphysik is an electrostatic storage ring for low velocity phase space cooled ion beams. Among other experiments cooling and storage of molecular ions in their rotational ground state is projected. The stored beam current will be in the range of 1 nA - 1 μA. The resulting low signal strengths on the beam position pickups, current monitors and Schottky monitor put strong demands on these diagnostics tools. Methods and systems were developed to measure the profile of the ion beam. In the paper a summary of the CSR diagnostics tools and diagnosis of the first stored ion beam will be given.

A Cryogenic Current Comparator (CCC) was developed for the upcoming FAIR-Project, providing a non-destructive online monitoring of the beam current in the nA-range. The CCC was optimized for a lowest possible noise-limited current resolution together with a high system bandwidth. Therefore, the low temperature properties of ferromagnetic core materials used in the pick-up coil were investigated and different SQUID-systems were tested. In this contribution we present results of the completed Cryogenic Current Comparator for FAIR working in a laboratory environment, regarding the improvements in resolution and bandwidth due to the use of suitable ferromagnetic core materials and optimized SQUID-system components.

A new compact linear accelerator FLUTE is currently under construction at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in collaboration with DESY and PSI. It aims at obtaining femtosecond electron bunches (~1fs - 300 fs) with a wide charge range (1 pC - 3 nC) and requires a precise bunch length diagnostic system. Here we present the layout of a bunch length monitor based on the electro-optic technique of spectral decoding using an Yb-doped fiber laser system (central wavelength 1030 nm) and a GaP crystal. Simulations of the electro-optic signal for different operation modes of FLUTE were performed and main challenges are discussed in this talk.

Micro-bunching instabilities occur at synchrotron light sources when the particle density rises due to compression of the electron bunches. They lead to powerful bursts of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the THz range at the cost of very unstable intensity and spectral properties, highly fluctuating on a millisecond time scale. For interferometry this changing source demands a long averaging time to achieve a reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio or balancing by the use of an additional reference detector. In this study we present measurements taken by a Martin-Puplett-interferometer in the bursting regime with ultra-fast THz-detectors.

High-Tc thin-film YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) detectors were deployed for the real-time observation of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR). Due to enhanced fabrication techniques enabling the patterning of sub-μm sized detector areas responsivity values as high as 1V/pJ for pulsed THz excitations have been achieved at the ANKA synchrotron facility at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Response of the detectors is linear over the whole dynamic range of the IR1 beamline. Combining the picosecond scaled response mechanism of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) to THz excitations with broad-band readout a temporal resolution of 15 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) was reached. Real-time resolution of CSR single shots was observed at ANKA and UVSOR-III, the synchrotron facility of the Institute of Molecular Science in Okazaki, Japan.

In order to design Button Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) for synchrotron facilities, one algorithm by C# have been developed which can calculate all required parameters to analyze optimal design based on vacuum chamber and button dimensions. Beam position monitors are required to get beam stabilities on submicron levels. For this purpose, different parameters such as capacitance, sensitivity versus bandwidth, intrinsic resolution, induced charge and voltage on buttons are calculated. Less intrinsic resolution and high sensitivity and capacitance are desired. To calculate induced charge and voltage on each button, Poisson's equation has been solved by Green method. For sensitivities calibration, two-dimensional map of BPM response is obtained theoretically and compared with the CST simulation map. Results show a good agreement where as their difference is less than 5%.

In the past years electron beam stability has been intensively addressed In new-generation Synchrotron Radiation (SR) sources. Many SR machines have been equipped with a Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB) based on electron Beam-Position Monitors (eBPMs). Also photon Beam-Position Monitors (pBPMs) are a useful tool for keeping the electron beam under control by simultaneously monitoring position and intensity of the delivered radiation; the machine control system can take advantage of this information in order to improving the electron beam stability. At Elettra, a diagnostic beamline, which utilizes a couple of single-crystal CVD diamond detectors as fast pBPMs, has been built and inserted into a bending-magnet front end. Preliminary tests carried out during normal machine operations show that this system allows to monitor the beam position with sub-micrometric precision at the demanding readout rates required by the FOFB. Therefore, this diagnostic line represents a demonstrator for future implementation of pBPMs at several bending-magnet front ends of Elettra.

The KEKB accelerator at KEK is being upgraded to SuperKEKB, and will be starting operation in 2015. SuperKEKB will have 444 Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) in the positron ring (LER), and 466 in the electron ring (HER). Two BPMs in each ring will be newly introduced for measuring fast beam orbit oscillations, and another two BPMs in each ring will be introduced for the fast beam orbit interlock at SuperKEKB. The required resolution is below several μm for fast beam orbit oscillation monitoring, and the requirement for the response time is less than 100 μs for the fast beam orbit interlock. We plan to use the Libera Brilliance+ from Instrumentation Technologies as signal processors for these special purpose BPMs. This paper discusses the application of the Libera Brilliance+ to these special purpose BPMs.

A new data acquisition system has been developed to improve band-width and dynamic range of the beam loss monitor systems. It consists of isolation current amplifiers with the gain of 1M and the band-width of DC-100kHz, and VME-based 24bit ADCs with the band-width of DC-300kHz and the noise level of 100uV peak to peak. The waveform data of 1MS/s and 1KS/s, and the charge count which is the integrated waveform data are generated and these are compared with alarm levels for the machine protection system. Long-term ground-level stability is essential to monitor residual dose activities. Some beam loss signals include effect of radiations from activated devices, and thus its fractions should be excluded. If the residual dose activities just before the beam injections can be monitored, these fractions would be roughly estimated. Furthermore, on-line monitoring of the residual dose activities after a beam operation will be useful for activation control of the devices at the high level activation area like the collimator and the slow-extraction area. A shot by shot DC offset cancellation is adopted to ensure high ground level stability.

We have developed an accurate and efficient analysis method with a multi-conductor transmission line model for beam position monitors (BPMs). This method combines the two-dimensional electrostatic analysis including beams in the transverse plane and the transmission line analysis in the longitudinal direction. The loads are also included in the boundary condition of the transmission line analysis. Calculation of 2D electrostatic fields can be easily performed with the boundary element method. The BPM response to a beam is compared with that to a stretched wire.

Ultrashort electron bunches are essential for time-resolved measurement methods such as pulse radiolysis* from the viewpoint of time resolutions. On the other hand, generation of electro-magnetic wave in the THz range using short electron bunches has been investigated**. Frequency spectra of coherent transition radiation (CTR) emitted by an electron bunch depend on bunch form factor (BFF), which is expressed by Fourier coefficients of longitudinal distribution in the electron bunch. In this study, the bunch length measurement was demonstrated by analyzing THz-waves generated by CTR. Femtosecond electron bunches were generated by a laser photocathode RF gun linac and magnetic bunch compressor. THz-waves generated by CTR, which was emitted on an interface of an aluminum mirror along the beam trajectory, were transported to a Michelson interferometer. The bunch length was measured by analyzing interferogram, which was an infrared detector output as a function of a moving mirror position. Finally, the bunch length was measured according to fitting curves for the interferogram near the centerburst***. Minimum bunch length of 1.3 fs was obtained at a bunch charge of ~1 pC.

We have been studying on a system to measure the length of electron bunch generated by a photocathode rf electron gun at Waseda University. We adopted the rf-deflector system which can convert the longitudinal distribution to transverse by sweeping the electron bunch. By using HFSS, we optimized the design of the 2 cell rf-deflector which is operating on π-mode, dipole (TM110-like) mode at 2856 MHz. The fabrication and the tuning of the rf deflector have successfully processed. We have installed the rf-deflector in the accelerator system of Waseda University, and performed the measurement of the bunch length. It is confirmed that this rf-deflector has the temporal resolution of 167fs with 700kW supply when the beam energy is 4.8MeV. This means that our rf-deflector system has possibility to measure the ultra-short bunch length. In this conference, the rf-deflector system in Waseda University, the result of the bunch length measurement, the performance of the rf-deflector and the future plan will be reported.

A novel, least invasive beam profile monitor based on a supersonic gas jet has been developed by the QUASAR Group at the Cockcroft Institute, UK. It allows the measurement of beam profiles for various particle beams across a range of energies and vacuum levels to be made. A finely collimated neutral gas jet, produced by a nozzle and several skimmers, is injected into a vacuum chamber perpendicular to the main particle beam. Ionization by the primary beam produces ions which are extracted from the interaction region and directed towards an imaging detector. This contribution presents the design of the monitor and first experimental results obtained with a low energy electron beam. It also discusses solutions of previous alignment problems and challenges in the realization of a versatile control and data acquisition system

A gas-jet monitor has been developed and commissioned by the QUASAR Group at the Cockcroft Institute, UK. It is designed to measure the transverse profile of a beam by crossing it with a neutral supersonic gas-jet. An array of high voltage electrodes is used to extract ions from the region where the beam and gas-jet interact. These ions first hit a micro-channel plate (MCP) and are then imaged through a phosphor screen and a CCD camera. It is important to understand and characterise the measured ion distribution in order to extract the beam profile. Therefore, numerical investigations using the commercial COMSOL and OPERA codes were carried out benchmarking profile measurements obtained from a low energy electron beam. This paper presents results from these studies. It compares measurements based on the interaction of the primary beam with the residual gas or the ultra-cold gas curtain, and discusses the comparisons of simulated profiles and extraction field configurations on the measured profile.

Monitors that use plastic scintillator (scintillation monitors) were fabricated to measure the energy and longitudinal profiles of heavy-ion beams at the RIKEN RI beam factory (RIBF).Six pairs of scintillation monitors (12 monitors) installed in the transport lines were used to measure the particle time-of-flight (TOF) to determine the acceleration energy of the heavy-ion beams. In addition, five scintillation monitors were installed to optimize the phase between the rebuncher cavities and the beam for the beam injection to the cyclotrons. Longitudinal beam profiles were obtained by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC), which digitizes the detected signals from the scintillator and the RF clock. The energy of the beam can be calculated from the measured TOF of the beam by using a scintillation monitor pair. Recently, to help users operate the system more easily, a new embedded processor with a higher-performance CPU was introduced, and LabVIEW programs were newly written or greatly improved. Development of the scintillation monitor system and results of experimental measurements of heavy-ion beams are reported.

Two non-invasive beam profile measurement methods were developed for China high intensity proton beams projects, including CSNS and ADS. The first consists in an IPM (ionization beam profile monitor) system which detect the ionized products from a collision of the beam particle with residual gas atoms or molecules present in the vacuum pipe. The second is an electron beam scanner which using a low energy electron beam instead of a metal wire to sweep through the beam. The deflection of electron beam by the collective field of the high intensity beam is measured. The charge density in the high intensity beam can be restored under certain conditions or estimated by various mathematical techniques. Here we present the design parameters of the IPM system, the signal intensity of ionization products, optimization of the electric field, machine designs of electrode, tracking of the ionization products and so on. The principle of the electron beam scanner and the test results which is based on a commercial electron gun from Kimball Physics are also introduced in details.

The injector scheme I (injector-I) of China ADS test stand is a superconducting Linac which accelerates 10mA beam to 3.2MeV, 5MeV, 10MeV, and then transports it to the dump. The dump line is designed to meet the requirement of beam expansion at the three different energies. The XAL from SNS was selected for the commissioning of China ADS. Because the beam current is so high, the nonlinear space charge force cannot be omitted. As we know, XAL calculates the space charge force with linear resolver. So, whether it could display the beam exactly enough is an important issue to consider. As a preparation for beam commissioning, the virtual accelerator in XAL frame was built and tested. Here in this paper, the envelopes of the 5MeV and 10MeV lattices from general XAL mpx application are shown and compared with the multiparticle tracking code TraceWin.

The C-ADS project has started beam commissioning. The ion source and LEBT has been commissioned successfully, while the RFQ is under conditioning. The Medium Energy Beam Transport line-1 (MEBT) is the place where extensive beam parameter measurement will be carried out. Beam emittance is one of the most critical parameters which have to characterized. In the C-ADS injector-I, the MEBT-1 has installed three wire scanners to measure the beam sizes. The transverse emittance measurement method using the wire scanners will be discussed in detail in this paper.

A new beam intensity measurement (BIM) system has been developed and has been used in the upgrade project of HLS II. After the upgrading is accomplished, electron energy in Injector endpoint will increase from 200MeV to 800MeV to achieve the goal of top-off injector. Meanwhile, macro pulse width changes from 1us to 1ns and peak intensity from 50mA to 1A approximately. So three fast current transformers (FCTs) and two integrating current transformer (ICTs) are installed in Linac and Transport Line to measure single pass beam parameters. In this article, off-line calibration of beam transformer is elaborated. Since the fast pulse signals from beam transformer will be hugely distorted after they transmit from Injector vacuum chamber to the Injector beam diagnostic centre room after hundreds of meters long LMR-400 cable, signal recovery algorithm based on FFT/IFFT is used to re-appear the true original signal and calculate the calibration efficient. In the end, resolution and measurement result of the BIM system is presented.

Design of the Beam Profile Monitors for THz Source Based FEL* J. Liu, P. Lu, B. G. Sun#, Y. J. Pei, Y. L. Yang, Z.R. Zhou, J. G. Wang, K. Tang, J. Xu NSRL, School of Nuclear Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230029, P. R. China Abstract To meet requirements of high performance THz-FEL, a compact FEL facility was proposed. In order to characterize the beam, some beam profile monitors were designed. There are four flags for beam profiles in Linac，one pop-in monitor for high precision beam profile inside a small-gap undulator, and two screens to measure the beam energy spread and emittance of Linac. On one hand, we need to use software to control the position of these profile monitors, on the other hand, we need screens to display the results. This paper describes how to design and control these monitors, as well as how to measure the beam parameter.

In order to nondestructively measure the beam energy spread with a beam energy of 0.8GeV in the injector at the upgrade project of Hefei Light Source (HLS II) in real time, a beam energy spread monitor (BESM) using beam position monitor (BPM) with four stripline electrodes has been developed. And a screen monitor (SM) near the BESM is used to measure beam energy spread destructively. This paper introduces in brief the beam position measurement system and beam transverse profile measurement system. The relationship between the transverse size at the BESM and at the SM (Flag3) is discussed in detail in this report. The result shows that energy spread measuring result of BESM and SM is 0.19% and 0.18% respectively. So we can draw a conclusion that the BESM is capable of nondestructively measuring the beam energy spread.

A 14MeV Linac with both the micro-pulse repetition rate 2856MHz and the macro-pulse width 6us for the THz Source Based FEL was proposed. In order to measure the beam position, a stripline beam position monitor (BPM) was designed, and a commercial BPM electronics Libera Brilliance Single Pass was adopted. As the input carrier frequency of the BPM electrode signal is 2856MHz, but the operating frequency of the Libera Brilliance Single Pass is 500MHz, so a front-end electronics was needed before the electrode signals feed into Libera Brilliance Single Pass. The front-end electronics was designed to make the BPM electrode signals of 2856MHz convert to 500MHz.

A new BPM system on the upgraded Hefei light source (HLSII) storage ring is installed. Before the machine commissioning, the BPM system should be carefully tested, such as the conductivity and integrity of BPM signal channels from button electrodes to digital beam position processors (pickups, cables and connectors). This paper presents an experience of signal channel test based on time domain reflection (TDR) for HLS II storage ring BPM system. Basing on the wave propagation method, an analytic expression for the signal from TDR on BPM signal channel is briefly introduced. The conductivity and integrity of the BPM signal channels can be verified by comparing the TDR waveform to theory signal. All the BPM signal channels are tested by the TDR in order to verify electronic characteristic and the usability. And some breakdowns are analysed and handled.

The development of future light source and linear colliders require high quality electron beams with short bunch length. The measurement of the bunch length is important technique for future electron machine. In general, the bunch length was measured by using deflecting cavity which has the time dependent transverse electromagnetic field. However, the transverse electric field of 2-cell superconducting RF (SRF) cavity can also provide the correlation between the bunch length and beam size as like the role of the deflecting cavity in bunch length measurement. The deflection strength was calibrated by changing the RF phase and the beam offset because the strength of transverse electric field of RF cavity depends on the phase of RF field and the beam offset in the cavity. We will present new way to measure the bunch length by using 2-cell SRF cavity, which has the acceleration field of 15 MV/m, and the measured result with the bunch length of 3 ps in cERL injector.

An ultra high position resolution cavity BPM was developed for the final focus system of ATF2, which is a accelerator test facility for ILC final focus system. The main purpose of ATF2 are achievement of 37 nm beam size and nano-meter beam orbit stability at IP(Interaction Point). For these purposes, a few nano meter beam position resolution was required for this cavity BPM, which is called the IP-BPM. The IP-BPM was fabricated 2 blocks of IP-BPM, the first block consists of two cavities in one block and second block consists of single cavity. IP-BPM can measure beam position in vertical and horizontal independently by using rectangular shape single cavity. Three IP-BPMs were installed at ATF IP region inside IP-chamber, and its position resolution was measured. We will present the detailed results on the beam tests.

The driver linac of RAON heavy ion accelerator based on the superconducting technology, which consists of a 28 GHz ECR ion source, a low energy beam transport line, a RFQ accelerator, a medium energy beam transport line, a low energy linac(SCL1), a charge stripping section and a high energy linac(SCL2), will produce the stable ion beam from proton with 600 MeV to uranium with 200 MeV/u. Many beam dynamics issues such as beam steering effect due to QWR cavities with the peak electric field of 35 MV/m, emittance growth in charge stripper due to the straggling effect, parametric resonance and envelope instability were verified to design the high power heavy ion machine which can produce the high quality beam. In this presentation, we explain our study results for achieving longitudinal acceptance larger than 27 keV/u-ns for the stable operation and minimizing the emittance growth less than 30 % in the superconducting linac for high quality beam at the in-flight target.

The accelerator for RISP, which is the superconducting technology based heavy ion linear accelerator construction project, is composed mainly of the driver linac for stable ion beam from an ECR ion source and post linac for unstable ion from an ISOL system. The post accelerator can accelerate the unstable ion beams up to 16.5 MeV/u for 132Sn and 16.0 MeV/u for 58Ni, which has the ratio of mass to charge, A/q, of 8.3. The unstable ion beam such as 132Sn from an ISOL system has the large transverse and longitudinal emittances. Hence acceptance and envelope of the post accelerator should optimize for stable operation. The beam was transported by the post-to-driver transport (P2DT) line which consists of a charge stripper, two charge selection sections and a telescope section with the bunching cavities. In this presentation, we will show the criteria for the design of the post accelerator and result of beam tracking simulation from the low energy transport line to the end of post linac. The initial coordinates of the particles were acquired by the tracking simulation from the low energy beam transport (LEBT) line to the medium energy beam transport (MEBT) line.

The paper is dedicated to a new station for optical observation of electron beam parameters which was built at the synchrotron radiation (SR) storage ring SIBERIA-2 at Kurchatov Institute. The station serves for the automatic measurement of electron bunches transverse and longitudinal sizes with the use of SR visible spectrum in one-bunch and multi-bunch modes; the study of individual electron bunches behaviour in time with changing different accelerator parameters, the precise measurement of betatron and synchrotron oscillations frequency. The station with its diagnostic systems on the optical table is located outside the shielding wall of the storage ring. The paper contains an outline scheme of SR beam line and a block-scheme of optical measurement part, describes the principle of operation and technical characteristics of main system elements (dissector tube, 16-element avalanche photodiode array, CCD-matrix, etc.) as well as results of electron beam optical diagnostics and an estimation of accuracy of the bunches parameters measurements.

Cherenkov radiation is a convenient tool for charged particle detection and bunch diagnostics. However, due to the complexity of real radiator geometry, different approximate techniques are elaborated for investigation of excited radiation*. Here we develop recently reported** approximate method for calculating Cherenkov radiation of a charge flying near a dielectric target having two main boundaries (the first interacts with a charge field and the second mainly refracts a generated radiation). We focus on cases where the radiation outside the target is convergent and use two methods for field investigation: ray optical technique and aperture integration technique. First, we deal with the case of a conical target with a vacuum channel. Under certain conditions, this radiation is concentrated near the line being the symmetry axis of the target. Second, we find the specific shape of the target that concentrates radiation in a small vicinity of given point (focus). Such targets can be used for improvement of detectors and bunch diagnostics systems based on Cherenkov effect.

The structure under consideration represents a set of long thin parallel wires which are placed in a plane with fixed spacing. The wires can exhibit a limited conductivity. If the period of the structure is much less than the typical wavelength, the structure’s influence can be described with help of the averaged boundary conditions*. The main attention is given to the case when the bunch flies through the grid in the orthogonal direction. Radiation of charged particle bunch which have small transversal size and limited longitudinal one is studied. Analytical expressions for volume and surface waves are given for the bunches with arbitrary longitudinal profile. A separate analysis is performed for the particular case of the plane which is ideally conducting in only one direction. It is shown that the surface wave is similar, in some way, to the radiation field of the bunch moving in a wire metamaterial**. It is demonstrated that the detection of surface waves can be used to estimate the longitudinal sizes of bunches. Typical numerical results for bunches of different shapes and structures with different parameters are given.

The ability to use a radiation of relativistic electrons in optical fibers for beam diagnostics was proposed by X. Artu recently *. In the cited work the properties of different types of radiation, such as diffraction and Cherenkov radiation in the visible region, induced in fibers by relativistic electron were considered. In our report we present the results of experimental investigation of such a phenomenon for millimeter wavelength radiation. The origin and properties of radiation in fibers were investigated for different geometries of fiber position in respect to the electron beam. The spectral characteristics and dependence on the orientation angle of fibers relative to the electron beam were investigated. One of the useful properties of fibers is the fiber flexibility. The characteristics of radiation accepted by flexible fiber with diameter D=11 mm and length L=600 mm were investigated as a function of curvature radius of the fiber R. The experimental results show the allowable transport factor of radiation for the condition L>R>>D. We believe that fibers for mm and submm range can be used for beam diagnostics also.

Recently our group starts to investigate a feasibility of double diffraction radiation (DR) target interferometry for non-invasive micro-train beam diagnostics at KEK: LUCX facility. Double DR target consists of two metal plates and one of them can be moved relative to another along the beam trajectory. Micro-train beam is a sequence of short electron bunches with sub-ps spacing. As it was shown* double DR target can be used for such a beam diagnostics measuring DR yield versus plates displacement. The obtained tuning curve (interferogram) allows to determine a number of bunches within the micro-train and spacing between them. In order to design a reliable device for this aim we have to take into account different double DR target interferometer plate’s adjustment inaccuracies. These inaccuracies can be as follows: inaccuracies in the mutual adjustment of plates tilt angles to the beam trajectory, outer plate edge shift along the beam trajectory and other. The influence of the bunch form-factor shape is also considered. We investigated double DR target preparation accuracy requirements in order to minimize measurements uncertainties and increase interferometer resolution.

The Beam Current Monitor system of the ESS linac will be mainly based on AC Current Transformers. The BCM system will be used to monitor the beam current and charge in absolute and differential modes. The differential current measurement is also intended for detecting large and sudden beam losses and acting on the Machine Interlock System (MIS), especially in areas where Beam Loss Monitors cannot be reliably used. A demo BCM based on a Bergoz ACCT and MTCA.4 electronics has been procured and integrated into EPICS. A VHDL code has been developed and successfully tested for the required FPGA signal processing including droop compensation, filtering, DC level correction and interfacing to the MIS. This paper gives an overview of the current status of the BCM system design and implementation as well as some preliminary test results in absolute and differential modes.

MedAustron is a synchrotron based accelerator complex, used for cancer treatment as well as for non-clinical research, and is situated in Wiener Neustadt, Austria. Cosylab has been working closely with MedAustron to develop the core accelerator control system and is now also working on on-site integration of beam diagnostics (BD) devices. These devices are critical for commissioning of the accelerator as well as later during regular operation to ensure high up-time of the machine. Beam instrumentation devices are fully integrated into the Front End Controller Operating System (FECOS) of the accelerator. FECOS is a custom designed control system framework implemented in LabVIEW, which provides unified interfaces and core services to all software components in the system. The Master Timing System component provides configurable real-time events distribution (triggers), essential for measurement and control in sections where the beam is bunched and device actions need to be synchronized. Both companies, MedAustron and Cosylab also developed user interfaces that are designed to be intuitive, while maintaining a level of flexibility for physics research.

At the ALBA synchrotron light source, the filling pattern is measured using a Fast Current Transformer (FCT). Applying a data analysis the filling pattern is measured with a dynamic range in the order of 102, limited by the electronic noise in the device. A new experimental set-up for filling pattern measurements was implemented using the Time Correlated Single Photon Counting. The technique consists in the measurements of the temporal distribution of the produced synchrotron radiation using Electro-Optical devices, from where the filling pattern is inferred. Two different photomultipliers are used to perform the measurement and results are compared. A further comparison between results from the photomultipliers and the FCT is performed to verify the accuracy of the results.

Precise and fast beam size measurement and emittance reconstruction in the different subsystems and transfer lines of the Future Linear Colliders (ILC and CLIC) will be essential for beam tuning in order to achieve the required luminosity. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using a multi-Optical Transition Radiation (m-OTR) system for fast transverse beam size measurement, emittance reconstruction and coupling correction in the Ring to Main Linac (RTML) of the FLCs. Diagnostic sections of the RTML have been matched to the optimum optical conditions for emittance reconstruction. The necessary requirements for the OTR monitors to be placed in the RTML are discussed.

Funding: This project is funded by the European Union under contract PITN-GA-2011-289485.
The linear accelerator of European Spallation Source will produce 5 MW proton beam. Beam of this power will likely generate significant losses along the beamline. To study these losses, a coherent model of the whole machine is being made using custom generator. This model is used to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the propagation of the accelerated beam and the losses in the MARS code system. Preliminary simulations utilizing the uniform beam loss distribution were done. More detailed simulations based on the various different loss patterns focused around hot spots in magnets were also performed and their results compared. This confirmed the limit of 0.5 W/m average heat load on accelerating cavities foreseen by the cooling requirements. Additional studies investigated the dose absorbed by fragile cooling system’s elements during the normal operation of the facility defining their radiation resistance to the levels of few kGy/y. Further simulations will also give the information about the expected beam loss detectors signal at possible locations. These data will be further analysed using custom algorithms.

It is planned to install more than 140 button BPMs along the ESS linac. The BPMs will be used to measure the beam position and phase in all foreseen beam modes and to provide input to the Machine Interlock System. The phase measurement is mainly intended for cavity tuning and Time-Of-Flight energy measurements. A customized BPM detector based on the European XFEL button style has been designed for the cold linac through a collaboration with DESY. Large buttons with diameters up to 40 mm are foreseen to provide enough S/N ratio not only with the nominal beam, but also with a low-current or a de-bunched beam. A demo MTCA.4 system has been procured and successfully integrated into EPICS. Also, a customized Rear Transition Module for down-mixing the BPM signals will be developed with SLAC. Electronics tests with a BPM test bench are currently going on at ESS. BPM installation in the linac is foreseen for 2017 and afterwards.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) consists of a partly superconducting linac which will deliver a 2 GeV proton beam to a rotating tungsten target. In this way, the ESS will be the world's most powerful neutron source. To measure the proton beams transverse profile at high intensity, the ESS develops two types of non-invasive profile devices. The first monitor is based on luminescence of the residual gas, the second one on ionization of the same gas. The latest developments of these profile monitors will be presented.

Conceptual design of an imaging system for the ESS proton beam current density on target is presented. The window separating the linac HV from the 1bar He-filled target station will be used as a source for imaging by means of either OTR or luminescence. The system presents many challenges to be addressed. The window and the primary optics will be exposed to extremely high radiation doses, providing heat cycles and mechanical stresses near the engineering limits, but also may change the surface properties of the window and the optics. The window lifetime expected to be less than 1 year will have to be replace bi-annually, imposing remote handling design for the window but also for part of the optics. In addition, the imaging system should be able to form an image from low to high current beam operations, in order to retrieve beam profile distribution and power density distribution of both static and raster beam, imposing a large numerical aperture (NA), but also to transport the image at more than 15m distance where radiation level is compatible with camera and pc stable operation and human access during commissioning and neutron production.

The Swiss Light Source (SLS) campaign on vertical emittance minimization and measurement required a beam size monitor with the ability to verify a sub-pmrad vertical emittance. This corresponds to a beam height of less than 4 μm. Within the TIARA Work Package ‘SLS Vertical Emittance Tuning’ a new beam size monitor was designed and built. The monitor is based on the imaging of the pi-polarized synchrotron radiation (SR) in the visible and UV spectral ranges. Besides imaging the monitor provides interferometric methods using vertically or horizontally polarized SR. With these complementary methods the consistency of beam size measurements is verified. An intermediate configuration of the monitor beamline using a lens as the focusing element has been commissioned in 2013. With this setup a vertical beam size of 4.8±0.5 μm, corresponding to a vertical emittance of 1.7±0.4 pmrad has been measured. During 2014 the monitor was commissioned in its final configuration with a toroidal mirror. The use of reflective optics allows wider bandwidth imaging and thus higher intensity. We report on challenges during commissioning and present first images of SR taken with the toroidal mirror.

Knowing the longitudinal phase space of an electron beam is one of the most important and crucial issues in short-pulses linacs. To achieve this task expensive and rather complicated setups (like transverse deflecting cavities) are usually implemented. The MAX IV 3 GeV linac will be used to inject into two rings and to drive a short pulse facility. Nevertheless, a more deep understanding of the beam quality would be useful especially in view of an upgrade as FEL driver. Another interesting aspect is to evaluate how the double-achromat bunch compressors are performing. We are studying how to implement off-phase acceleration: last part of the linac will be set at zero-crossing phase and the transfer line to the 3 GeV ring could be used as energy spectrometer to retrieve the bunch profile. In the present configuration of the MAX IV linac this procedure will allow to check the bunch length after the first bunch compressor. Since it is work in progress, in this contribution we present a sketch of the measurement and the feasibility of the method will be explored by means of simulations.

We discuss a spectrometer to analyze the electrons and ions ejected from a high-gradient CLIC accelerating structure that is installed in the klystron-driven 12 GHz test-stand at CERN. The charged particles escaping the structure provide useful information about the physics of the vacuum breakdown within a single RF pulse. The spectrometer consists of a dipole magnet, a pepper-pot collimator, a fluorescent screen and a fast camera. This enables us to detect both transverse parameters such as the emittance and longitudinal parameters such as the energy distribution of the ejected beams. We can correlate these measurements with e.g. the location of the breakdown inside the structure, by using information from the measured RF powers, giving in that way a complete picture of the vacuum breakdown phenomenon. The spectrometer was installed during Spring 2014 and will be commissioned during Summer 2014.

Understanding the sources of ultra-fast failures, with durations of less than 3 LHC turns, is important for a safe operation of the LHC, as only passive protection is possible in these time scales. Diamond particle detectors with bunch-by-bunch resolution and high dynamic range have been successfully used to improve the understanding of some new ultra-fast loss mechanisms discovered in the LHC. To fully exploit their potential, diamond detectors were characterized with a high-intensity electron beam (105 to 1010 electrons per shot). For the first time their efficiency and linearity has been measured in such a wide range of intensities. In this paper the experimental setup will be described and the signals of the different detectors will be discussed. Finally, future applications of these detectors in high-radiation applications will be discussed.

During 2013 run a systematic campaign of beam-based measurement on the CERN Proton Synchrotron wire scanners has been performed. In this work we report the conditions of the measurements, we describe the results and their interpretation. The observations are compatible with an emittance relative precision and accuracy respectively better than 2 % and 5 % in the vertical plane for nTOF beams. The present limitations of the system are discussed and possible solutions are presented.

Electron cloud effects such as heat load in the cryogenic system, pressure rise and beam instabilities are among the main limitations for the LHC operation with 25 ns spaced bunches. A new observation tool was developed to monitor the e-cloud activity and has been successfully used in the LHC during Run 1 (2010-2012). The power loss of each bunch due to the e-cloud can be estimated using very precise bunch-by-bunch measurement of the synchronous phase shift. In order to achieve the required accuracy, corrections for reflection in the cables and some systematic errors need to be applied followed by a post-processing of the measurements. Results show clearly the e-cloud build-up along the bunch trains and its evolution during each LHC fill as well as from fill to fill. Measurements during the 2012 LHC scrubbing run reveal a progressive reduction in the e-cloud activity and therefore a decrease in the secondary electron yield (SEY). The total beam power loss can be computed as a sum of the contributions from all bunches and compared with the heat load deposited in the cryogenic system. The plan to use this method in the LHC operation is also presented.

The Beam Gas Vertex (BGV) detector is foreseen as a possible non-invasive beam size measurement instrument for the LHC and its luminosity upgrade. This technique is based on the reconstruction of beam gas interaction vertices, where the charged particles produced in inelastic beam gas interactions are measured with high-precision tracking detectors. The design studies and expected performance of the currently developed BGV prototype will be presented with an overview given of the associated vacuum, detector, and readout systems. A brief description will be given of the BGV Monte Carlo simulation application, which is based on the LHCb computing framework (Gaudi) and allows simulation studies to be performed and online event reconstruction algorithms to be developed.

CERN is currently constructing an Extra Low ENergy Antiproton ring (ELENA), which will allow the further deceleration of antiprotons from the currently exploited Antiproton Decelerator (AD). In order to meet the challenges of ELENA the beam instrumentation systems of the CERN AD are being consolidated and upgraded. An updated controls architecture with a more flexible timing system needs to be adopted and obsolete systems must be replaced. This paper presents the status and plans for improved performance and measurement availability of the AD beam instrumentation with a decreased risk of failure.

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, synchrotron radiation (SR) is used to continuously monitor the transverse properties of the beams. Unfortunately the machine and beam parameters are such that the useful radiation emitted inside a separation dipole, chosen as source, is diffraction limited affecting heavily the accuracy of the measurement. In order to deconvolve the diffraction effects from the acquired beam images and in order to design an alternative monitor based on a double slit interferometer an extensive study of the synchrotron light source and of the optical propagation has been made. This study is based on simulations combining together several existing tools: SRW for the source, ZEMAX for the transport and MATLAB for the "glue" and analysis of the results. The resulting tool is very powerful and can be easily adapted to other synchrotron radiation problems. In this paper the simulation package and the way it is used will be described as well as the results obtained for the LHC and SPS cases.

The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is an e+/e− collider based on the two-beam acceleration principle, proposed to support precision high-energy physics experiments in the energy range 0.5-3 TeV. To achieve a high luminosity of up to 6e34cm-2s−1, the transport and preservation of a low emittance beam is mandatory. A large number and great variety of beam diagnostics instruments is foreseen to verify and guarantee the required beam quality. We present the status of the beam diagnostics developments and experimental results accomplished at the CLIC Test Facility (CTF), including new ideas for simplification and cost reduction of the CLIC beam instrumentation.

As part of the CERN LHC injector chain upgrade, LINAC4 will accelerate H− ions to 160 MeV, replacing the old 50 MeV proton linac. The ion source, the Low Energy Beam Transfer (LEBT) line, the 3 MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole and the Medium Energy Beam Transfer (MEBT) line hosting a chopper, have been first commissioned in a dedicated test stand and are now tested in the LINAC4 tunnel. Diagnostics devices are installed in the LEBT and MEBT line and in a movable diagnostics test bench which is temporarily added to the MEBT exit. The paper gives an overview of all the instruments used, including beam current transformers, beam position monitors, wire scanners and wire grids for transverse profile measurements, a longitudinal bunch shape monitor and a slit-and-grid emittance meter. The movable test bench also includes a spectrometer that allows measuring the beam energy spread in conjunction with a wire grid. The present understanding of the instrumentation performance is discussed and the measurement results that allowed characterizing the 3 MeV beam in the LINAC4 tunnel are summarized.

The oncoming completion of Taiwan Photon Source is closely constructed beside Taiwan Light Source (TLS). Few civil works are continuously under construction. Building the measurement, recording and analysis platform of software and hardware is the one of the main directions of operation group. To diagnose the instability problem of the light source, the external influence must be eliminated. One of the factors causing the instability is the physical vibration. Vibration measurement helps to evaluate if newly installed equipments are suited for adding on or the influence of the earthquake to the stability of TLS and to improve the light source quality for users. Software has been developed to provide assistance to do some preliminary diagnoses at TLS. In this article, some actual cases in routine operation are also presented.

The ISIS Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK produces intense neutron and muon beams for condensed matter research. Its 50 Hz, 800 MeV proton synchrotron delivers a mean beam power of 0.2 MW to two spallation targets. Recent developments to beam control and measurement systems at ISIS are described. New PXI-based digitising hardware and custom software developed with LabVIEW have increased the capability to study beam behaviour. New, more flexible power supplies for steering and trim quadrupole correction magnets have been commissioned allowing greater control of beam orbits and envelopes. This paper looks at recent linear lattice measurements and attempts to identify the source of lattice errors.

For the pulse charge q injected into a capacitor of a parallel resonating circuit, the oscillation voltage V on a series resistor R is V=qwRexp(wt/2Q)sin(wt–1/2Q), t>τ, where w is the resonance frequency, Q>>1 is the quality factor and τ<<1/w is the pulse length. Of the two main parameters, R is known, and w can be found directly from the signal above. The quality factor contribution is low, and its rough estimation is sufficient to retain voltage accuracy. The observations above open a possibility of precise bunch charge measurement. We describe a bunch charge monitor that is a cavity with a lump capacitor as a low impedance coaxial line connected to a gap in the vacuum pipe. An LC electronic circuit is also presented. It integrates the single bunch current delivered by a Faraday Cup, or a Wall Current Monitor, or a Fast Current Transformer. The circuit has w~30MHz, Q~20, and with a Faraday Cup, the lower range is 10pC/V and the noise floor is about 20fC. Several such circuits are in use on the VELA injector in Daresbury Laboratory.

The microbunching instability is a phenomenon characterized by the onset of radiation bursts above a threshold bunch current. These bursts consist of coherent emissions with wavelengths comparable to the bunch length and shorter. The instability has recently been observed at Diamond Light Source, a 3rd generation synchrotron. The operating conditions for triggering the instability at Diamond Light Source are well known, however measuring the spectral content of the resulting emissions is a more challenging investigation. A Michelson interferometer has been installed with the aim of recording the coherent spectrum from the bunches, using ultra-fast response Schottky Barrier Diode detectors. The longitudinal profile of the bunches can be estimated with subsequent analysis.

Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) is emitted when a charged particle crosses the interface between two media with different dielectric properties. It has become a wide-spread method for beam profile measurements. However, there are no tools to simulate the propagation of the OTR electric field through an optical system. Simulations using ZEMAX have been performed in order to quantify optical errors, such as aberrations, diffraction, depth of field and misalignment. This paper focuses on simulations of vertically polarized OTR photons with the aim of understanding what limits the resolution of realistic beam imaging systems.

Non–invasive, highly accurate and reliable beam monitors are a desired aim of any beam diagnostics design. Knowledge of beam parameters is essential in fundamental research, industry or medical applications with varying demands. It is critical for the optimization of ion beams used for cancer treatment. Ocular tumor treatment at the Clatterbridge Cancer Center (CCC) uses a 60 MeV proton beam. Disturbances introduced to a beam by intercepting devices risk affecting its energy and energy spread, thereby limiting its effectiveness for treatment. The advantageous semi-circular structure of the LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO) detector has been investigated in the QUASAR Group. It is an interesting option for a non-invasive online beam monitor relying on beam ‘halo’ measurements without disturbing the part of the beam used for treatment. This contribution discusses the measurement method, setup design and integration within the CCC treatment beam line.

A series of beam position monitors (BPMs) will be installed at the Front End Test Stand (FETS) at RAL as part of the 3 MeV Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT). The BPMs analyse 2 ms long, 60 mA beam pulses delivered to the MEBT by a 324 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). Initial linearity and resolution measurements from the prototype button BPMs are shown. The development of the algorithm for the processing of the BPM signals using a commercial PXI-based FPGA card is discussed and initial measurements of the electronics and signal processing are presented. The test-rig used to characterise each BPM and further develop the processing algorithm is described. The position and phase are measured several times throughout the duration of each pulse, and the measurements are made available via an EPICS server.

Principal component analysis is a powerful data analysis tool, capable of reducing large complex data sets containing many variables. Examination of the principal components set allows the user to spot underlying trends and patterns that might otherwise be masked in a very large volume of data, or hidden in noise. Diamond Light Source archives many gigabytes of machine data every day, far more than any one human could effectively search through for correlations. Presented in this paper are some of the results from running principal component analysis on years of archived data in order to find underlying correlations that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. The advantages and limitations of the technique are discussed.

Transition Radiation (TR) and Diffraction Radiation (DR) are produced when a relativistic charged particle moves through a medium or in the vicinity of a medium respectively. The target atoms are polarised by the electric field of the charged particle, which then oscillate thus emitting radiation with a very broad spectrum. The spatial-spectral properties of TR/DR are sensitive to various electron beam parameters. Several projects aim to measure the transverse (vertical) beam size using TR or DR. This paper reports on recent studies using Zemax, presenting studies on finite beam sizes and the orientation of the beam ellipse.

The new LINAC4 will accelerate H− ions to 160 MeV and ultimately replace the existing 50 MeV LINAC2 in the injector chain for the LHC upgrade. During commissioning in 2013, a laserwire scanner and diamond strip detector were installed for non-invasive emittance measurements of the 3 MeV H− beam. Synergy with the 3 MeV H− Front End Test Stand at RAL, has stimulated collaborative development of a novel laserwire system. A low peak power (8kW) pulsed laser is fibre-coupled for remote installation and alignment free operation. Motorized focusing optics enable remote control of the thickness and position of the laserwire delivered to the vacuum chamber, in which the laser light neutralises a small fraction of H− ions. Undeflected by a dipole magnet, these H atoms drift downstream, where their spatial profile is recorded by a highly sensitive diamond strip detector with ns-time resolution. We present first tests of the laserwire emittance scanner, including measurements of the photo detachment signal with respect to the background from residual gas interactions. The first laserwire transverse beam profile and emittance measurements are compared with conventional slit-grid diagnostics.

The Front End Test Stand (FETS) at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) has been developed to demonstrate a high current (60 mA) H− beam with the energy of 3 MeV that will be required for future proton drivers. At such high power beam machine a non-invasive diagnostics is required. To measure the emittance of the ion beam a laserwire scanner is being developed. A high power laser will scan across the H− ion beam. The H− particles will be neutralized via a photo-detachment process producing a stream of fast neutral hydrogen atoms bearing information about the phase space distribution of the initial H− beam. To design an effective detection system and optimize its parameters a simulation of the processes at the interaction point is required. We present recent simulation results of theц FETS laserwire system. Simulations were performed using measured data of the laser propagation and ion beam distribution, obtained with General Particle Tracer code.

A comprehensive set of graphical user interfaces is being developed for the drive laser of the Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) facility at Fermilab. These interfaces have been designed in Synoptic, a Java-based GUI development platform with credential-dependent access to the Fermilab accelerator controls network. Such implementation facilitates the user's ability to monitor and control many aspects of the drive laser system in an intuitive environment, as well as timely updates on the part of the developers made necessary by the evolving drive laser system. Furthermore, the current interface hierarchy readily allows integration into the larger pool of Synoptic applications being developed for other subsystems at ASTA.

A fast current transformer is mounted in the staging line of the Berkeley 88-inch isochronous cyclotron. The measured signal is amplified and connected to the input of a lock-in amplifier. The lock-in amplifier detects the signal vector from the input signal at the RF reference frequency of the cyclotron second harmonic. The magnitude of the signal detected is calibrated against a Faraday cup and shows the beam current leaving the cyclotron.

We report on the design and performance of coded aperture optics elements in the CesrTA x-ray beam size monitor (xBSM). Resolution must be sufficient to allow single-turn measurements of vertical beam sizes of order 10um by imaging synchrotron radiation photons onto a one-dimensional photodiode array. Measurements with beam energies above 2.1GeV and current above 0.1mA can be performed with a single-slit (pinhole) optic. At lower energy or current, small beam size measurements are limited by the diffractive width of a pinhole image and counting statistics. A coded aperture is a multi-slit mask that can improve on the resolution of a pinhole in two ways: higher average transparency improves counting statistics; and the slit pattern and masking transparency can be designed to obtain a diffractive image with narrower features. We have previously implemented coded apertures that are uniform redundant arrays (URA). A new coded aperture design is optimized for imaging with 1.8 GeV beam energy (1.9keV average x-ray energy) and with beam sizes below 20um. Resolution measurements were made in December 2013. Performance of the new coded aperture is compared to the pinhole and the URA.

National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan has completed the construction of the civil and utility system engineering of the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The contract power capacities of the Taiwan Light Source (TLS) and the TPS with the Taiwan Power Company (TPC) are 5.5MW and 3MW currently, respectively. The ultimate power consumption of the TPS is estimated about 12.5MW. To cope with increasing power requirement in the near future, we have been conducting several power saving schemes for years. They include power consumption control, optimization of chillers operation, air conditioning system improvement, power factor improvement, application of heat pump, and promotion for power saving.

The TPS infrastructure and the whole subsystems for the accelerator are now approach to finish. The cable trays for booster and storage ring in tunnel are almost finished. The 3 layers cable trays for booster ring are for dipole, quaturpole power supply cable and IC/VA signal cable respectively. The designed for limited space for cooling water below the cable tray and the magnet girder above. The storage ring cable tray also designed for different subsystems, and separate the power and signal layer. The power racks for all subsystem are located in control and instrument area (CIA). The magnet and ID power supply are placed in the 1st floor and the IC, VA, MP and FE control racks are placed in the 2nd floor. The separation between the power and signal cable tray are noticed for the whole path inside tunnel and CIA. Now the subsystem is under installation, although it is hard to cabling but it would not be the problem.

For successful operation of X-ray source NESTOR it is necessary that all the focusing elements should be installed in design position according to the designed lattice, which should provide a low emittance value and small beam size at the interaction point . Accuracies of NESTOR electromagnetic elements installation are 100 mkm in the transverse coordinate, 200 mkm in the longitudinal coordinate and 200 mrad for all three rotation freedom. To achieve these objectives coordinate net, which allows us to align the elements, was designed and developed in the hall of the NESTOR storage ring. The whole process is controlled by means of optical instruments and theodolite 3T2KP with angular accuracy of 2" and laser meter system LMS - 100, which measure the distance with micron accuracy. The final errors budget consists of the accuracy of the measuring instruments, the quality of elements manufacture and assembling. A well-planned methodology allows to realize the design parameters of the X-ray generator "NESTOR " and was proved by experiments of the facility.
