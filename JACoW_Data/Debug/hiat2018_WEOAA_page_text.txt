The brand-new Superheavy Element Factory at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) in JINR, Dubna, is under completion, with the high-current DC-280 cyclotron installed, mapped and tested and first beams will be made available during the last term of 2018. To improve the efficiency of studies on heavy and superheavy nuclei, it will deliver a wide range of species with high intensity, which in turn require effective separators providing high suppression of unwanted reaction products. The first experiment fed by the cyclotron, GFS-2, is a universal gas-filled separator for synthesis and study of the properties of heavy isotopes, based on the QvDhQvQhD scheme. The presentation describes its study and design in close collaboration between FLNR and Sigmaphi, starting from the initial demand in 2015 and going through the different steps, up to its construction in 2017 and installation a few months ago.

Interdigital H-mode (IH) drift tube linacs (DTLs) based on KONUS beam dynamics are very sensitive to the rf-phases and voltages at the gaps between tubes. In order to design these DTLs, a deep understanding of the underlying longitudinal beam dynamics is mandatory. The report presents tracking simulations along an IH-DTL using the PARTRAN and BEAMPATH codes together with MATHCAD and CST. Simulation results illustrate that the beam dynamics design of the pre-stripper IH-DTL at GSI is sensitive to slight deviations of rf-phase and gap voltages with impact to the mean beam energy at the DTL exit. Applying the existing geometrical design, rf-voltages, and rf-phases of the DTL were re-adjusted. In simulations this re-optimized design can provide for more than 90% of transmission of an intense 15 emA beam keeping the reduction of beam brilliance below 25%.

Stochastic cooling is a broadband feedback system, which is very effective for reducing the beam size without beam loss. It has advantage over electron cooling in cooling low intensity beam with large emittance and mo-mentum spread, which is required for precise study of the decay properties of RIB (Radioactive Ion Beam) using SMS method. This paper mainly concerns on cooling of primary beam and its secondary beam, pointing out the range of mass-to-charge spread that could be cooled for secondary particles. Meanwhile, TOF cooling combined with filter cooling was also studied. The simulation results provide theoretical supports for analysing different ions circulating in the ring at the same time in the experiments.
