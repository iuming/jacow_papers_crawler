Pulsed power facilities require a wide variety of control systems to operate efficiently. Relatively slow distributed control systems that process water are okay taking hundreds of milliseconds to respond to a physical change while small pulsed power lasers may need to reliably respond to a change within hundreds of nanoseconds. Building these control systems requires more than just the ability to write lines of code and wire up embedded controllers. Knowledge of hardware capability and planning appropriately will end up saving lots of time. Tailoring your hardware/software choices to the environment in which the system is expected to function and correctly choosing a solution that will fit your needs will contribute to the overall success and longevity of your control system. In this presentation, we will cover some of the design decisions that go into 'making things work fast enough' while providing a real-world example of a system that is 'good enough'.

The National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses powerful lasers to compress targets, to study high energy density physics. Sophisticated diagnostics are placed close to the targets to record the results of each shot. The placement of these diagnostics relative to the target is critical to the mission, with alignment tolerances on the order of 500 microns. The integration of commercial laser-based survey instruments into the NIF control system has improved diagnostic alignment in many ways. The Advanced Tracking Laser Alignment System (ATLAS) project incorporates commercial Faro laser tracker instruments into the diagnostic factory and the target chamber, improving alignment accuracy over prior systems. The system uses multiple retroreflectors mounted on each of the diagnostic positioners to translate to a 6D position in the NIF target chamber volume. This enables a closed loop alignment process to align each diagnostic. This paper provides an overview of how the laser tracker is used in diagnostic alignment, and discusses challenges met by the control system to achieve this integration.

The ITER-CERN collaboration agreement initiated the development of a PROFINET communication interface which may replace the WorldFIP interface in non-radiation areas. The main advantage of PROFINET is a simplified integration within the CERN controls infrastructure that is based on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). CERN prepared the requirements and subcontracted the design of a communication card prototype to the Technical University of Bern. The designed PROFINET card prototype uses the NetX Integrated Circuit (IC) for PROFINET communication and a FPGA to collect the electrical signals from the back-panel (electrical signals interface for instrumentation conditioning cards). CERN is implementing new functionalities involving programming, automation engineering and electronics circuit design. The communication between the card and higher layers of control is based on the OPC UA protocol. The configuration files supporting new types of instrumentation cards are being developed and are compatible with the SIEMENS SIMATIC automation environment. It is worth to mention that all required data calculations and protocol handling are performed using a single netX50 chip.

All particle accelerators and most experiments at CERN require high (HV) or ultra-high (UHV) vacuum levels. Contributing to vacuum production are two types of mobile devices: Turbo-Molecular Pumping Groups and Bakeout Racks. During accelerator stops, these PLC-controlled devices are temporarily installed in the tunnels and integrated in the Vacuum SCADA, through wired Profibus-DP. This method, though functional, poses cer-tain issues which a wireless solution would greatly miti-gate. The CERN private LTE/3G network is available in the accelerators through a leaky-feeder antenna cable which spans the whole length of the tunnels. This paper describes the conception and implementation of an LTE/3G-based modular communication system for PLC-controlled vacuum mobile devices. It details the hardware and software architecture of the system and lays the foun-dation of a solution that can be easily adapted to systems other than vacuum.

In industry the open standard EtherCAT* is well established as a real-time fieldbus for largely distributed and synchronised systems. Open source solutions for the bus master have been first introduced in scientific installations by Diamond Light Source** and PSI using EtherCAT hardware for digital and analog I/Os. The European Spallation Source (ESS) decided to establish open source EtherCAT systems for mid-performance data acquisition and motion control on accelerator applications. In this contribution we present the motion control software package ECMC developed at the ESS using the open source Etherlab*** master to control the EtherCAT bus. The motion control interfaces with a model 3 driver to the EPICS motor record supporting it's functionalities like positioning, jogging, homing and soft/hard limits. Advanced functionalities supported by ECMC are full servo-loop feedback, a scripting language for custom synchronisation of different axes, virtual axes, externally triggered position capture and interlocking. On the example of prototyping a 2-axis wire scanner we show a fully EPICS integrated application of ECMC on different EtherCAT and CPU hardware platforms.

MARWIN is a mobile autonomous robot platform designed for performing maintenance and inspection tasks alongside the European XFEL accelerator installation in operation in Hamburg, Germany. It consists of a 4-wheel drive chassis and a manipulator arm. Due to the unique Mecanum drive technology in combination with the manipulator arm the whole robot provides three degrees of freedom. MARWIN can be operated in a pre-configured autonomous as well as a remotely controlled mode. Its operation can be supervised through various cameras. The primary use case of MARWIN is measuring radiation fields. For this purpose MARWIN is equipped with both a mobile Geiger-Mueller tube mounted at the tip of the manipulator arm and a stationary multi-purpose radiation detector attached to the robot's chassis. This paper describes the mechanical and electrical setup of the existing prototype, the architecture and implementation of the controls routines, the strategy implemented to handle radiation-triggered malfunctions, and the energy management. In addition, it reports on recent operations experiences, envisaged improvements and further use cases.

ALMA is composed of many hardware and software systems each of which must be properly functioning to ensure the maximum efficiency. Operators in the control room, follow the operational state of the observatory by looking at a set of non-homogeneous panels. In case of problems, they have to find the reason by looking at the right panel, interpret the information and implement the counter-action that is time consuming so after an investigation, we started the development of an integrated alarm system that takes monitor point values and alarms from the monitored systems and presents alarms to operators in a coherent, efficient way. A monitored system has a hierarchical structure modeled with an acyclic graph whose nodes represent the components of the system. Each node digests monitor point values and alarms against a provided transfer function and sets its output as working or non nominal, taking into account the operational phase. The model can be mapped in a set of panels to increase operators' situation awareness and improve the efficiency of the facility.
