We report on the design and progress in implementing a THz-driven relativistic electron accelerator and associated X-ray source, the AXSIS Facility at DESY. We have developed a full layout of the machine based on a THz gun followed by a multi-cycle dielectric loaded metal waveguide THz linear accelerator to generate 20 MeV level, 10 fs electron bunches. The required THz pulse energies are on the mJ-level for the gun and multi-10-mJ-level for the THz linac. Customized laser technologies have been developed allowing for the generation of these pulses up to 1 kHz repetition rate. The generated electron bunches are then focused into a counter propagating optical pulse ’optical undulator’ to generate X-rays in the 6-7 keV range. We will discuss the overall layout of the machine, status of its implementation and technical challenges in the different components as well as diagnostics of this new type of accelerator and X-ray source.

Scaling the RF-accelerator concept to terahertz (THz) frequencies brings several compelling advantages, including compactness, intrinsic timing between the photoemission and driving field sources, and high field gradients associated with the short THz wavelength and high breakdown threshold. Recent demonstrations of such THz powered accelerators relied on two counter-propagating single-cycle THz pulses. However, to achieve high energy gains in the acceleration process high energy THz pulses are needed which in turn require complex optical setups. Here, we present on the development of a matchbox sized multi-layered accelerator designed to boost the 50 keV output of a DC electron gun to energies of ~400 keV that only requires a single THz pulse to be powered. An integrated tunable mirror inside the structure interferes the front of the driving THz pulse with its rear part such that the field in the interaction region is optimized for efficient acceleration. This reduces the complexity of the required optical setup. Such a compact booster accelerator is very promising as electron source in ultrafast electron diffraction experiments and as booster stage prior to THz based LINACs.

GaAs-based photocathodes are the most popular electron sources for producing highly spin-polarized electron beams in accelerator physics and condensed matter physics. Spin-polarized photoemission requires activation to achieve Negative Electron Affinity (NEA). Conventional NEA surfaces such as CS-O/NF3 are extremely vacuum sensitive, and this results in rapid QE degradation. In this work, we activated GaAs with various recipes using Cs, Te, and oxygen. We demonstrate NEA activation on GaAs surfaces. Among Cs-Te activated samples, the oxidized sample showed the highest QE and longest lifetime at 780 nm.

We present start-to-end simulations for a fully THz-driven table-top X-ray source. A dielectric-loaded metallic cavity operating at its Higher Order Mode accelerates 1 PC photo emitted electron bunch up to 430 keV kinetic energy. The output beam of the gun is injected into a dielectric-loaded waveguide where phase velocity of the traveling wave is adjusted in such a way that electrons see an accelerating field all the way along the tube resulting to an 18.5-MeV output beam which is then transported to an inverse Compton scattering (ICS) stage. The injection phase of the electrons can be tuned to introduce a negative energy chirp to the electron bunch leading to a ballistic bunch compression after the linac. In addition, a set of permanent magnet quadrupoles is designed to focus the beam at the ICS interaction point where the electron beam scatters off a 250-mJ, 0.5ps, 1-µm laser beam and generates an X-ray beam with 2.6x107 photons per shot containing photon energies 2keV< Eph <8keV in a beam with 50 mrad half opening angle. The required terahertz waves to power the gun and linac are 550-ps pulses at 300 GHz containing 5 mJ and 23 mJ energies respectively with 1 kHz repetition rate.

Dielectric loaded waveguides (DLW) powered by multicycle terahertz (THz) pulses have shown promising performance as compact linear accelerators due to higher breakdown fields at THz frequencies compared to conventional RF components. By changing the dielectric dimensions one can control phase and group velocities of the THz pulse inside the DLW. Since optimum waveguide dimensions are dependent on initial electron energy, THz pulse energy, and etc., it is worthwhile to determine optimum values for different conditions to maximize final kinetic energy. In this work, we present a combined analytical/numerical guide to determine the optimum DLW parameters for single on-axis electron acceleration. We also introduce normalized graphic representations to visualize optimum designs for different initial electron and THz pulse energies.

Ion beam produced in laser-driven ion acceleration by ultra-intense lasers has characteristics of high peak cur-rent and low emittance. These characteristics become an advantage to operate the request for the beam applica-tion. Therefore, we study how to control the parameters with the laser-plasma interaction. Here, we used 2D Particle-in-Cell code to simulate the laser-driven ion acceleration and investigated the results in terms of transverse emittance, beam current, and brightness. The laser spot size and target thickness were changed in the simulation. And, these qualitative results show that interaction target thickness is a major factor in controlling beam characteristics.

Beam-driven dielectric wakefield accelerators (DWA) have the potential to provide accelerating gradients in the GV/m range. The transverse dynamics in such devices need to be understood to avoid instabilities over long transport distances and facilitate beam matching to specific applications (e.g. FELs). This presentation details simulation studies of the magnitude of beam-breakup instability (BBU) in planar dielectric lined waveguides (DLWs). These are for DWA drive beams, with high charge and momentum that can be produced at current facilities. Using a series of perpendicular DLW segments has been proposed to control instabilities over larger distances. Using self-developed software, the beam dynamics of a drive beam within a DLW are simulated and the magnitude of beam losses along a DLW of varying lengths calculated and beam quality preservation investigated. Methods to reduce transverse instabilities have been explored, and the impact of these on the length of a possible DWA acceleration stage are investigated. An acceleration stage with m-scale length, consisting of multiple alternating planar DLWs, is suggested and preservation of beam quality along this distance is shown.

Beam-driven collinear wakefield acceleration using structure wakefield accelerators promises a high gradient acceleration within a smaller physical footprint. Sustainable extraction of energy from the drive beam relies on precise understanding of its long term dynamics and the possible onset or mitigation of the beam instability. The advance of computational power and tools makes it possible to model the full physics of beam-driven wakefield acceleration. Here we report on the long-term beam dynamics studies of a drive beam considering the example of a dielectric waveguide using high fidelity particle-in-cell simulations performed with WarpX.

A short pulse high gradient RF gun has been recently tested at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility. The carried-out test showed that the 1,5-cell gun was able to inject 3 MeV, up to 100 pC bunches at room tem-perature being fed by 9 ns up to 300 MW 11.7 GHz puls-es. The cathode field was as high as about 400 MV/m. So high field is aimed to mitigate repealing Coulomb forces substantially. In accordance with simulations the emit-tance could be as low as less than 0.2 mcm. To obtain so low emittance in the experiment, the gun is assumed to be equipped with a downstream linac to be fed from the same power extractor as the gun itself. Here we report design of the RF power distribution system splitting RF power among the gun and the linac, results of low-power tests, and emittance measurement plans for upcoming new experiment at AWA.

A high-gradient X-band (11.7-GHz) photoinjector developed by Euclid Techlabs, was recently commissioned at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA). The system comprises a 1+1/2-cell RF gun powered by short RF pulses generated as a train of high-charge bunches from the AWA accelerator passes through a slow-wave power extraction and transfer structure. The RF photoinjector was reliably operating with electric fields in excess of 300 MV/m on the photocathode surface free of breakdown and with an insignificant dark-current level. We report on the RF-gun setup, commissioning, and the associated beam generation via photoemission.

We have measured the THz near-field in order to inform the design of improved THz-frequency accelerating structures. THz-frequency accelerating structures could provide the accelerating gradients needed for next generation particle accelerators with compact, GV/m-scale devices. One of the most promising THz generation techniques for accelerator applications is optical rectification in lithium niobate using the tilted pulse front method. However, accelerator applications are limited by significant losses during transport of THz radiation from the generating nonlinear crystal to the acceleration structure. In addition, the spectral properties of high-field THz sources make it difficult to couple THz radiation into accelerating structures. A better understanding of the THz near-field source properties is necessary for the optimization of THz transport and coupling. We have developed a technique for detailed measurement of the THz near-fields and used it to reconstruct the full temporal 3D THz near-field close to the LN emission face. Analysis of the results from this measurement will inform designs of novel structures for use in THz particle acceleration.

Carbon-based nanostructures and metamaterials offer extraordinary mechanical and opto-electrical properties, which make them suitable for applications in diverse fields, including, for example, bioscience, energy technology and quantum computing. In the latest years, important R&D efforts have been made to investigate the potential use of graphene and carbon-nanotube (CNT) based structures to manipulate and accelerate particle beams. In the same way, the special interaction of graphene and CNTs with charged particles and electromagnetic radiation might open interesting possibilities for the design of compact coherent radiation sources, and novel beam diagnostics techniques as well. This paper gives an overview of novel concepts based on nanostructures and metamaterials with potential application in the field of accelerator physics. Several examples are shown and future prospects discussed.

First investigations on Gabor Lens GL2000 at Goethe University have shown that it is possible to confine a 2m long stable Electron Plasma Column and to apply it as a hadron beam focusing device. With this knowledge theoretical implementations of GLs in final focus and transfer lines have started. The focusing with GLs is a weak but smooth focusing in radial direction. The GL is a suitable and inexpensive choice in addition to the existing focusing elements eg. magnetic quadrupoles. The device helps to improve beam quality and minimize losses over long distances. The investigation of relativistic hadron beams in GeV range using the example of the proposed NA61/SHINE VLE-beamline at CERN is carried out and will be presented. Thin-matrix simulations with a generated distribution as well as field map simulations with generated and realistic distributions (Geant4) at 1 - 6 GeV/c have been analysed and compared. In addition, the H4-beamline at North Area (CERN) is proposed to implement GLs for experimental tests.

At Goethe-University, a novel concept of heating metallic cathodes is currently under investigation. In the scope of the ARIES collaboration WP16, an RF-modulated electron gun was developed and manufactured for application in electron lenses for space charge compensation. The goal of this project is to increase the intensity of primary beams, especially in low energy booster synchrotrons like the SIS18 and SIS100 at GSI/FAIR or the SPS at CERN. The gun was designed to produce electron currents of 10 A at extraction voltages of 30 kV. The tungsten electron emitter (TE²) and the grid electrode were designed and manufactured to be integrated in the extractor of the original volume type ion source. Significant effort was put into a robust and flexible design with highly reliable key components. The cathode is heated by a plasma stream generated in the plasma chamber of the source. Different heating options of the cathode are currently being studied. This contribution presents the working principles of the electron gun and first measurements results of cathode heating.

A new RF photo-injector has been designed, realized and successfully installed at the SPARC_LAB facility (INFN-LNF, Frascati, Rome). It is based on a 1.6 cell RF gun fabricated with the new brazing free technology recently developed at the National Laboratories of Frascati. The electromagnetic design has been optimized to have a full compensation of the dipole and quadrupole field components introduced by the coupling hole with an improvement of the effective pumping speed with two added pumping ports. The gun is overcoupled (\beta=2) to reduce the filling time and to allow the operation with short RF pulses. The overall injector integrates a new solenoid with a remote control of the transverse position and a variable skew quadrupole for the compensation of residual quadrupole field components. It also allows an on axis laser injection system with the last mirror in air, and the possibility of a future integration of an X/C band cavity linearizer. In the paper we report the main characteristics of the electromagnetic and mechanical design and the low and high power test results that shows the extremely good perfomances of the new device.

It is now well-established that for the generation of very high brightness beams, required for fourth generation light sources, it is highly advantageous to use injectors based on Radiofrequency photo-guns with very high peak electric fields on the cathode (>120 MV/m). This very high surface electric field leads to the generation of undesirable electrons due to the field emission effect. The emitted electrons can be captured and propagate along the Linac forming a dark current beam, leading to background radiation that can damage the instrumentation and radioactivate components. Consequently, it is important that the emission of these electrons, and their subsequent transportation, is carefully evaluated. Recently, in the framework of the I-FAST project, a high gradient, standing wave, C-band (5712 MHz) RF photogun has been designed and will be realized soon. In this paper, the results of dark current studies and simulations are illustrated. The transport efficiency and the spectrum of the dark current have been evaluated by Particle-In-Cell simulations for different cathode peak field values considering also the effect of the focusing solenoid on the dark current beam.

RF photo-injectors are widely used in modern facilities, especially in FEL, as very low-emittance and high-brightness electron sources. Presently, the RF technology mostly used for RF guns is the S band (3 GHz) with typical cathode peak fields of 80-120 MV/m and repetition rates lower than 120 Hz. There are solid reasons to believe that the frequency step-up from S band to C band (6 GHz) can provide a strong improvement of the beam quality due to the potential higher achievable cathode field (>160 MV/m) and higher repetition rate (that can reach the kHz level). In the contest of the European I.FAST project, a new C band gun has been designed and will be realized and tested. It is a 2.5 cell standing wave cavity with a four port mode launcher, designed to operate with short RF pulses (<300 ns) and cathode peak field larger than 160 MV/m. In the paper we present the electromagnetic and thermo-mechanical design and the results of the prototyping activity and rf measurements.

In the framework of the Compact Light XLS project, a Ka-band linearizer with electric field ranging from 100 to 150 MV/m is requested. In order to feed this structure, a proper Ka-band high power klystron amplifier with a high efficiency is needed. This paper reports a possible solution for a klystron amplifier operating on the TM010 mode at 36 GHz, the third harmonic of the 12 GHz linac frequency, with an efficiency of 44% and 10.6 MW radiofrequency output power. We discuss also here the high-power DC gun with the related magnetic focusing system, the RF beam dynamics and finally the multiphysics analysis of a high- power microwave window for a Ka-band klystron providing 16MW of peak power.

Proposals for new linear accelerator-based facilities are flourishing world-wide with the aim of high spectral brilliance radiation sources. Most of these accelerators are based on electron beams, with a variety of applications in industry, research and medicine such as colliders, free-electron lasers, wake-field accelerators, coherent THz and inverse Compton scattering X/’ sources as well as high-resolution diagnostics tools in biomedical science. In order to obtain high-quality electron beams in a small footprint, we present the optimization design of a C-band linear accelerator machine. Driven by a novel compact C-band hybrid photoinjector, it will yield ultra-short electron bunches of few 100’s pC directly from injection with ultra-low emittance, fraction of mm-mrad, and a few hundred fs length simultaneously, therefore satisfying full 6D emittance compensation. The normal-conducting linacs are based on a novel high-efficiency design with gradients up to 50 MV/m. The beam maximum energy can be easily adjusted in the mid-GeV’s range. In this paper, we discuss the start-to-end beam-dynamics simulations in details.

The performance expected from the next generation of electron accelerators is driving research into photocathode technology as this fundamentally limits the achievable beam quality. The performance characteristics of a photocathode are most notably; normalised emittance, brightness and energy spread*. Ultra–thin Oxide films on metal substrates have been shown to lower the work function (WF) of the surface, enhancing commonly utilised metal photocathodes, potentially improving lifetime and performance characteristics**. We present the characterisation of two MgO/Cu photocathodes grown at Daresbury. The surface properties such as; surface roughness, elemental composition and WF, have been studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The photoemissive properties have been characterised with quantum efficiency (QE) measurements at 266 nm. Additionally, we measure the Transverse Energy Distribution Curves (TEDC) for these photocathodes under illumination at various wavelengths using ASTeC’s Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS) and extract the Mean Transverse Energy (MTE)***.

Caesium Telluride (Cs2Te) photocathodes, are the elec-tron source of choice, by many global accelerators such as European XFEL, FLASH and AWA. It offers high quantum efficiency and reasonable operational lifetime with lower vacuum requirements than multi-alkali photocathodes. In this paper, we report on the first synthesised CsxTe photocathodes at ASTeC, using both sequential and co-deposition of Te and Cs on Mo substrate. Te deposition is carried out using ion beam deposition whilst the Cs is deposited using a SAES getter alkali. The ion beam deposition of Te provides a high degree of control to give a dense, smooth layer with a reproducible film thickness. The chemical state with respect to film composition of the deposited CsxTe is determined with in-situ XPS anal-yses. The films exhibit a quantum efficiency between 7.5 to 9 % at 266 nm wavelength.

Electron cooling is a fundamental process to guarantee beam quality in low energy antimatter facilities. In ELENA, the electron cooler reduces the emittance blow-up of the antiproton beam so that a focused and bright beam can be delivered to the experiments at the unprecedentedly low energy of 100 keV. To achieve a cold beam at this low energy, the electron gun must emit a monoenergetic and relatively intense electron beam. An optimization of the electron gun involving a cold cathode is studied to investigate the feasibility of using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as cold electron field emitters. CNTs are considered among the most promising field emitting materials. However, stability data for emission over hundreds of hours, as well as lifetime and conditioning process studies to ensure optimal performance, are still incomplete or missing, especially if the aim is to use them in operation. This contribution reports experiments that characterize these properties and assess whether CNTs are suitable to be used as cold electron field emitters for many hundreds of hours.

The production of soft to hard x-rays (up to 25 keV) at XFEL (x-ray free-electron laser) facilities has enabled new developments in a broad range of disciplines. Great potential exists for new scientific discovery at higher energies (42+ keV) such as envisioned at MaRIE (Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. These instruments can require a large amount of real estate, which quickly escalates costs: The driver of the FEL is typically an electron beam linear accelerator (LINAC) and the need for higher beam energies capable of generating these X-rays can dictate that the linac becomes longer. State of art accelerating technology is required to reduce the linac length by reducing the size of the cavities, providing for compact, high-frequency, high acceleration gradients. Here, we describe using the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) to facilitate our investigations into design concepts for future XFEL high-gradient LINAC’s in the C-band (~4-8 GHz). We investigate two different traveling wave (TW) geometries optimized for high-gradient operation as modeled at the ALCF using VSim software.*

New compact particle acceleration structures, including but not limited to plasma, THz and direct laser driven accelerators, have in common that they cover a wide energy range of potential final energies and often show a large energy spread. Moreover, they may initially have a rather large emittance. To analyze the energy range of a single shot and/or to deflect the beam to safely dump the electrons away from an end-station requires an electron kicker covering a large energy range. Here, we present a magnetic dipole structure based on a 2D Halbach array. For the current experimental test accelerator in AXSIS, an electron beam in the energy range from 4 to 20 MeV is deflected by 90 degree and energetically dispersed. In direct contrast to a simple magnetic dipole, an array of cubic magnet blocks with tailored magnetization directions allows a focusing of the beam for both longitudinal and transverse directions at 90 degree bend. A generic algorithm optimizes the magnetic field array to the predefined deflection angle and divergence. The modular array structure, in combination with the algorithm enables a simple exchange of magnets to adapt for different beam parameters.

High brightness cathodes are increasingly a focus for accelerator applications ranging from free electron lasers to ultrafast electron diffraction. There is further an increasing interest in fabrication and control of cathode surface to better control the emission characteristics and improve beam brightness. One method which we can consider is based on well-known silicon nanofabrication techniques which we use to create patterned cathode surfaces. The sharp edges produced lead to field emission increases and high brightness emission. We have demonstrated that a beam can be successfully extracted with a low emittance and we have reconstructed a portion of the energy spectrum. Due to the simplicity of extended geometries in nanofabrication our beam uniquely possesses a high aspect ratio in its transverse cross section. We can begin to consider modifications for emittance exchange beamlines and having shown the patterning principle is sound we can consider additional patterns such as hollow beams. Future work will continue to characterize the produced beam and the addition of fabrication steps to remove one of the blades in the double blade geometry in order to more accurately characterize the emission.

Electron field emission is a complicated phenomenon which is sensitive not only to the particular material under illumination but also to the specific crystalline orientation of the surface. Summarizing the ability for a crystal to emit in a particular direction would be of great use when searching for good field emitters. In this paper we propose a material normal energy distribution which describes the ability of the bound electrons to tunnel under an intense electric field. This framework breaks a computationally expensive 3-D system down to a source distribution representation applicable for more efficient 1-D models. We use the Fowler-Nordheim framework to study the yield and MTE (mean transverse energy) from sources including gold, copper, and tungsten in both monocrystalline and polycrystalline forms. We find an increase in effective work function for field emission in the (111) direction for gold and copper associated with the Bragg plane intersections of the Fermi surface.

Laser-induced field emission from nanostructures as a means to create high brightness electron beams has been a continually growing topic of study. Experiments using nanoblade emitters have achieved peak fields upwards of 40 GV/m, begging further investigation in this extreme regime. A recent paper has provided analytical reductions of the common semi-infinite Jellium system for pulsed incident lasers. We utilize these results as well as similar previous results to further understand the physics underlying electron rescattering-type emissions. We progress in numerically evaluating the analytical solution to attempt to more efficiently generate spectra for this system. Additionally, we use the full 1-D time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a Hartree potential and a dispersion-relation transition from material to vacuum to study the same system. We determine what importance the inclusion of the material band structure may have on emissions using this computationally challenging approach.

Lead is typically used as the initial target in a design for beam dumps for high energy electron beams (>20 MeV). Electron beams with energies above 20 MeV are usually built within concrete bunkers and therefore the design of any beam dump would just be a lead block (very cost effective) as close to the electron source as possible, after a vacuum flange of some sort. In a study of a hypothetical 100 MeV electron beam inside a concrete bunker with an extremely low dose rate constraint outside the bunker, the thickness of lead required would have been too restrictive for a compact design. In this study we investigate the potential benefits of designs that incorpo-rate low Z materials like graphite as the primary target material in vacuum followed by progressively higher Z materials up to lead. The results show the more diffuse elastic scattering from the primary target reduces the back scattered photons and reduces the overall neutron genera-tion. The effect was a more compact design for the beam dump to meet the same dose rate constraint.

Here we report radiation dose estimates calculated for the X-band Laboratory for Accelerators and Beams (X-LAB) under construction at the University of Melbourne (UoM). The lab will host a CERN X-band test stand containing two 12 GHz 6 MW klystron amplifiers. By power combination through hybrid couplers and the use of pulse compressors, up to 50 MW of peak power can be sent to any of to either of the two test slots at pulse repetition rates up to 400 Hz. The test stand is dedicated to RF conditioning and testing CLIC’s high gradient accelerating structures beyond 100 MV/m. This paper also gives a brief overview of the general principles of radiation protection legislation; explains radiological quantities and units, including some basic facts about radioactivity and the biological effects of radiation; and gives an overview of the classification of radiological areas at X-LAB, radiation fields at high-energy accelerators, and the radiation monitoring system used at X-LAB. The bunker design to achieve a dose rate less than annual dose limit of 1 mSv is also shown.

Proton therapy systems are used worldwide for patient treatment and fundamental research. The generation of secondary particles when the beam interacts with the beamline elements is a well-known issue. In particular, the energy degrader is the dominant source of secondary radiation. This poses new challenges for the concrete shielding of compact systems and beamline elements activation computation. We use a novel methodology to seamlessly simulate all the processes relevant to the activation evaluation. A realistic model of the system is developed using Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM), a Geant4-based particle tracking code that allows a single model to simulate primary and secondary particle tracking and all particle-matter interactions. The secondary particle fluxes extracted from the simulations are provided as input to FISPACT-II to compute the activation by solving the rate equations. This approach is applied to the Ion Beam Applications (IBA) Proteus®ONE (P1) system and the shielding of the proton therapy research centre of Charleroi, Belgium. Proton loss distributions are used to model the production of secondary neutrals inside the accelerator structure. Two models for the distribution of proton losses are compared for the computation of the clearance index at specific locations of the design. Results show that the variation in the accelerator loss models can be characterised as a systematic error.

In this paper we present a systematic benchmark between the simulated and the measured data for the radiation monitors useful for Radiation to Electronics (R2E) studies at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. For this purpose, the radiation levels in the main LHC tunnel on the right side of the Interaction Point 1 (ATLAS detector) are simulated using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code and compared against Total Ionising Dose (TID) measurements performed with the Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system, and 180 m of Distributed Optical Fibre Radiation Sensor (DOFRS). Considering the complexity and the scale of the simulations as well as the variety of the LHC operational parameters, we find a generally good agreement between measured and simulated radiation levels, typically within a factor of 2 or better.

The CERN injector complex is essential in providing high-energy beams to various experiments and to the world’s largest accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Beam losses linked to its operation result in a mixed radiation field which, through both cumulative and single-event effects poses a threat to the electronic equipment exposed in the tunnel. Therefore, detailed knowledge of the radiation distribution and evolution is necessary in order to implement adequate Radiation to Electronics mitigation and prevention measures, resulting in an improvement of the accelerator efficiency and availability. In this study, we present the automated analysis scheme put in place to efficiently process and visualise the radiation data produced by various radiation monitors, distributed at the four largest CERN accelerators, namely the Proton Synchrotron Booster, Proton Synchrotron, Super Proton Synchrotron, and the LHC, where a proton beam is accelerated gradually from 160 MeV up to 7 TeV.

During the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2, 2019-2020), the CERN accelerator complex has undergone major upgrades, mainly in preparation for the High-Luminosity (HL) LHC era, the ultimate capacity for its physics production. Therefore, several novel equipment and systems were designed and deployed throughout the accelerator complex. To comply with the radiation level specifications and avoid machine downtime due to radiation effects, the electronics systems exposed to radiation need to follow Radiation Hardness Assurance (RHA) methodologies developed and validated by the Radiation to Electronics (R2E) project at CERN. However, the establishment of such procedures is not yet fully implemented in the LHC injector chain, and some R2E failures were detected in the SPS during the 2021 operation. This work is devoted to describing and analysing the R2E failures and their impact on operation, in the context of the related radiation levels and equipment sensitivity.

The vacuum system of ALPI accelerator includes about 40 pumping groups based on turbomolecular pumps. The instrumentation of the accelerators complex is mainly the one installed in 90s, with consequent maintenance issues. The control and supervision systems were developed in the same period by an external company, which produced custom solutions for the HW and SW parts. Control devices are based on custom PLCs, while the supervision system is based on C and C#. The communication between the field and the supervisor is composed of multiple levels: RS-232 standard is used to transfer control parameter from the field devices up to custom multiplexers; RS-485 transmission is used from the multiplexers to two PC servers covering different sections of the installation; while Ethernet, is used to connect the servers and the operation console. Obsolescence and rigidity of the system, deficit of spare parts and impossibility of reparation or modification without external support, required a complete renovation of the vacuum system and relative controls in the next years. This paper describes the adopted strategy and the implementation status.

The energy extraction systems for the protection of the new HL-LHC superconducting magnet circuits are based on vacuum breakers. This technology allows to significantly reduce the switch opening time and increases the overall system reliability with reduced maintenance needs. This paper presents the results of detailed reliability studies performed on these new energy extraction systems. The study quantifies the risk of a failure which prevents correct protection of a magnet circuit and identifies the most critical components of the system. For this, the model considers factors such as block or component level failure probabilities, different maintenance strategies and repair procedures. The reliability simulations have been performed with AvailSim4, a novel Monte Carlo code for availability and reliability simulations. The results are compared with the system reliability requirements and provides insights into the most critical components.

We report the status of the development of an High Power RF Laboratory in X-Band called TEX (TEst-stand for X-Band). TEX is part of the LATINO (Laboratory in Advanced Technologies for INnOvation) initiative that is ongoing at the Frascati National Laboratories (LNF) of the Italian Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) that covers many different areas focused on particle accelerator technologies. TEX is a RF test facility based on solid-state K400 modulator from ScandiNova with a 50MW class X-band (11.994 GHz) klystron tube model VKX8311A operating at 50 Hz. This RF source will operate as resource for test and research programs such as the RF breakdown on RF waveguide components as well as high power testing of accelerating structures for future high gradient linear accelerator such as EuPRAXIA and CLIC. In this context we will present the whole EPICS control system design focusing on archiving, user interfaces and custom development made as part of the functional safety to deliver real-time RF breakdown detection integrated with the timing system of the facility.

In order to protect the hardware components of the de-tector and accelerator from sudden beam loss of high beam currents, the fast beam abort system is developed in the SuperKEKB. The previous abort system was not fast enough for sudden beam loss that caused QCS quench, and it gave a damage to the collimator and the Belle-II detector. A fast abort system is required to pre-venting such damage. The abort system consists of sev-eral sensors that generate interlock signal (the loss moni-tor, dose in the Bell-II detector, and the magnet failure etc.), optical cable system to transfer the interlock signal to central control room (CCR), the abort trigger signal generation system and the abort kicker. To reduce total time, we reduce transmission time from local control room to CCR by changing signal cable route. Since the interlock signal produced by magnet power supply was slow, we modified the magnet power supply. For more quick generation of abort trigger signal, we increased number of the abort gap. By these improvements, an average abort time is reduced from 31µsec to 25µsec. This improvement looks small, but it brought preventing the serious radiation damage to many hardware compo-nents. Detail of the system and result is presented in this paper.

Beam-driven radiation sources based on open-ended waveguide structures with dielectric filling are of essential interest due to their attractive possibilities to generate high-power narrow-band Cherenkov radiation*. An important problem here is to effectively extract the radiation from the waveguide to the open space. Therefore, further development of this scheme requires rigorous mathematical approach describing the interaction of both charged particle bunch and produced radiation with the open end of a waveguide. In this report, we present the corresponding analytical approach based on our recent paper** where diffraction of a waveguide mode at the open end of a dielectrically loaded waveguide has been rigorously investigated.

A novel 6 MeV hybrid photo injector was designed and commissioned at Ariel University in Israel as an on-going collaboration with UCLA. This unique, new generation design provides a radically simpler approach to RF feeding of a gun/buncher system, leading to a much shorter beam via velocity bunching owed to an attached traveling wave section of the photo-injector. This design results in better performance in beam parameters, providing a high quality electron beam, with energy of 6 MeV, emittance of less than 3 ’m, and a 150 fs pulse duration at up to 1 nC per pulse. The Hybrid gun is driven by a SLAC XK5 Klystron as the high power RF source, and third harmonic of a fs level IR Laser amplifier (266 nm) to extract electrons from the Cathode. The unique e-gun will produce a bunched electron pulse to drive a THz FEL, which will operate at the super-radiance regime, and therefore requires extraordinary beam properties. It will also be used for MeV UED experiments in a separate line using a dogleg section. Here we describe the gun and presents experimental results from the gun and its sub-systems, including energy and charge measurements, compared with the design simulations.
