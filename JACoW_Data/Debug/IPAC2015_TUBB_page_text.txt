The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University is building a heavy ion linac to produce rare isotopes by the fragmentation method. The linac will accelerate ions up to U to energies above 200 MeV/u with beam powers up to 400 kW. At energies between 16 and 20 MeV/u the ions will be stripped to higher charge states to increase the energy gain downstream in the linac. The main challenges in the stripper design are due to the high power deposited by the ions in the stripping media (~ 30 MW/cm3) and radiation damage if solids are used. For that reason self-recovering stripper media must be used. The baseline stripper choice is a high-velocity, thin film of liquid lithium with an alternative option of a helium gas stripper. We present in this paper the status of the R&D and construction of the final stripper. Extensive experimental work has been performed on both options.

The accelerators of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research – FAIR are under construction. The sophisticated system of accelerators is designed to produce stable and secondary beams with a significant variety of intensities and beam energies. FAIR will explore the intensity frontier of heavy ion accelerators and the beams for the experiments will have highest beam quality for cutting edge physics to be conducted. The main driver accelerator of FAIR will be the SIS100 synchrotron. In order to produce the intense rare isotope beams (RIB) at FAIR, a unique superconducting fragment separator is under construction. A system of storage rings will collect and cool secondary particles from the FAIR. Intense work on test infrastructure for the huge number of superconducting magnets of the FAIR machines is ongoing at GSI and several partner labs. In addition, the GSI accelerator facility is being prepared to serve as injector for the FAIR accelerators. As the construction of the FAIR accelerators and the procurement has started, an overview of the designs, procurements plans and infrastructure preparation can be provided.

Via a series of the injector linac upgrades in 2013 and 2014, the J-PARC RCS got all the design parameters. Thus the RCS is now in the final beam commissioning phase aiming for the 1-MW design output beam power. This paper presents the recent progress of the RCS beam commissioning, mainly focusing on our approaches to beam loss issues that appeared on the process of the beam power ramp-up.
