This tutorial covers the design issues for ERLs and description of various projects that rely on ERLs, including the JLAB-FEL, LHeC, eRHIC, Cornell's x-ray ERL, KEK's CERL, BERLinPro, and MARS. It highlights recent progress toward beam parameters of ERL beams in terms of emittance and current, as well as hardware prototypes and progress toward ERL cryomodules, and operational experiences with CW SRF, essential for ERLs.
