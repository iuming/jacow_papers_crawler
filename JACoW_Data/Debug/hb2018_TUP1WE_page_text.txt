The ultimate goal of RAON is to accelerate uranium and proton beams up to 200 MeV/u and 600 MeV, with a maximum beam currents of 8.3 pμA and 660 pμA, respectively. Various types of beam diagnostic devices such as beam current monitor, beam position monitor (BPM), beam profile monitor, beam phase monitor, and beam loss monitor are required for setting accelerator parameters, monitoring beam acceleration and transport, and improving accelerator system. ACCT and Faraday cup will be used for beam intensity measurement. Hundreds of BPMs will be used for the measurement of transversal position and phase. Various profile monitors such as wire scanner, wire grid, and Fast Faraday cup will be installed for monitoring beam shapes in the transversal and longitudinal beam directions. And plastic detector, proportional counter, and Halo Monitor Ring are considered for beam loss monitor. The design and status of RAON beam diagnostics system will be discussed.

The hollow electron lens (e-lens) is a very powerful and advanced tool for active control of diffusion speed of halo particles in hadron colliders. Thus, it can be used for a controlled depletion of beam tails and enhanced beam halo collimation. This is of particular interest in view of the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, in the framework of the High-Luminosity LHC project (HL-LHC). The estimated stored energy in the tails of the HL-LHC beams is about 30 MJ, posing serious constraints on its control and safe disposal. In particular, orbit jitter can cause significant loss spikes on primary collimators, which can lead to accidental beam bump and magnet quench. Successful tests of e-lens assisted collimation have been carried out at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab and a review of the main outcomes is shown. Preliminary results of recent experiments performed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven, put in place to explore different operational scenarios studies for the HL-LHC, are also discussed. Status and plans for the deployment of hollow electron lenses at the HL-LHC are presented.

As increase of beam power, beam instruments play an essential role in the Hadron accelerator facility. In J-PARC, the pitting erosion on the mercury target vessel for the spallation neutron source is one of a pivotal issue to operate with the high power of the beam operation. Since the erosion is proportional to the 4th power of the beam current density, the minimization of the peak current density is required. To achieve low current density, the beam-flattening system by nonlinear beam optics using octupole magnets in J-PARC. By the present system, the peak density was successfully reduced by 30% compared to the ordinary linear optics. Also in J-PARC, transmutation experimental facility is planned for the realization of the accelerator-driven system (ADS), which will employ powerful accelerator with the beam power of 30 MW. To achieve equivalent damage on the target as the ADS, the target will be received high current density. For the continuous observation of the beam status on the target, a robust beam profile monitor is required. We have been developed beam profile monitor by using heavy-ion of Ar beam to give the damage efficiently.
