A 1034 luminosity 100 TeV proton-antiproton collider is explored. The cross section for many high mass states is 10x higher in p-pbar than p-p collisions. Antiquarks for production can come directly from an antiproton rather than indirectly from gluon splitting. The higher cross sections reduce the synchrotron radiation in superconducting magnets and the vacuum system, because lower beam currents can produce the same rare event rates. Events are also more central, allowing a shorter detector with less space between quadrupole triplets and a smaller beta twiss for higher luminosity. To keep up with the antiproton burn rate, a Fermilab-like antiproton source would be adapted to disperse the beam into 12 different momentum channels, using electrostatic septa, to increase antiproton momentum capture 12x. At Fermilab, antiprotons were stochastically cooled in one debuncher and one accumulator ring. Because the stochastic cooling time scales as the number of particles, 12 independent cooling systems would be used, each one with one debuncher/momentum equalizer ring and two accumulator rings. One electron cooling ring would follow the stochastic cooling rings. Finally antiprotons in the collider ring would be recycled during runs without leaving the collider ring, by joining them to new bunches with snap bunch coalescence and longitudinal synchrotron damping.

In the medium energy electron ion collider (MEIC) project at Jefferson Lab, the traditional electron cooling technique is used to reduce the ion beam emittance at the booster ring, and to compensate the intrabeam scattering effect and maintain the ion beam emittance during collision at the collider ring. A DC cooler at the booster ring and a bunched beam cooler at the collider ring are proposed. To fulfil the requirements of the cooler design for MEIC, we are developing a new program, which allows us to simulate the following cooling scenarios: DC cooling to coasting ion beam, DC cooling to bunched ion beam, bunched cooling to bunched ion beam, and bunched cooling to coasting ion beam. The new program has been benchmarked with existing code in aspect of accuracy and efficiency. The new program will be adaptive to the modern multicore hardware. We will present our models and some simulation results.

A test experiment was performed with 12C3+ ion beams at an energy of 122 MeV/u on the CSRe in September 2014. A pulsed UV laser system from HZDR was employed for this test laser cooling experiment. The closed 2s1/2―2p1/2 optical transition at a wavelength of 155.07 nm of the Li-like carbon ions was Doppler-shifted to be resonant with the UV-laser at the wavelength of 257.5 nm in the experiment. The injected number of C3+ ~5×108,which was sufficient for testing laser cooling. Stable operation of the CSRe was observed over several days, including rf-bunching and diagnostic systems. The dynamics of the electron-cooled and RF-bunched ion beams were investigated systematically. However, first results did not yet indicate a strong interaction of the laser with the ions. Further data analysis is currently in progress. We will present the experimental results on this workshop, including Schottky spectra of electron-cooled and rf-bunched ion beams, fluorescence signals observed by the UV-sensitive PMT and CPM, and the planning of the upcoming laser cooling experiment at the CSRe.

Muon beams of low emittance can provide the intense, well known beams for physics of flavour at the Neutrino Factory and multiTev collisions at the Muon Collider. The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will demonstrate the technique proposed to reduce the phase­space volume of the muons. In an ionization ­cooling channel, the combination of energy loss by muons traversing an absorbing material with reacceleration by RF cavities reduces the transverse emittance of the beam (transverse cooling). The rebaselined MICE project will deliver a demonstration of ionization cooling by Sep 2017: a central Li­-H absorber, two superconducting focus-coil modules and two 201 MHz single­cavity RF modules. The phase space of the muons entering and leaving the cooling cell will be measured by two solenoidal spectrometers. All the magnets for the ionization-cooling demonstration are available at RAL and the first single­cavity prototype was tested successfully in the MTA Area at Fermilab. The design of the cooling demonstration experiment, a summary of the performance of each of its components and the cooling performance of the configuration will be presented.

Laser cooling of heavy ion beams at storage ring is one of the most promising techniques to reach high phase-space densities and achieve phase transition, ordered beam even crystalline beam. It has many advantages such as fast-cooling, ultra-strong cooling force and providing the ultra-low temperature ion beams. In this paper, we introduce the laser cooling system at CSRe in IMPCAS, and then present the main procedure of the simulation program. Finally, we show the preliminary test result of the laser cooling simulation program at CSRe.

Muon beams of low emittance provide the basis for the intense, well-characterised neutrino beams of the Neutrino Factory and for lepton-antilepton collisions at energies of up to several TeV at the Muon Collider. The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will demonstrate ionization cooling ' the technique by which it is proposed to reduce the μ-beam phase-space volume. MICE is being constructed in a series of steps. At Step IV, MICE will study the properties of liquid hydrogen and lithium hydride that affect cooling. A solenoidal spectrometer will measure emittance up and downstream of the absorber vessel, where a focusing coil will focus muons. The construction of Step IV at RAL is nearing completion. The status of the project will be described together with a summary of the performance of the principal components. Plans for the commissioning and operation and the Step IV measurement programme will be described.

An overview of the recent developments regarding the RF signal processing for the stochastic cooling system of the Collector Ring is given. In focus are the developments of generic RF components which can be used at different locations within the signal paths between the pick-up and kicker tanks in the frequency band 1-2 GHz. Two of these components are discussed in detail, a power meter with high dynamic range (+9 dBm to -68 dBm), low phase distortion (± 0.75deg(max)) and low attenuation (≤ 0.4dB) and a variable phase shifter with exceptionally flat amplitude (± 0.4dB(max)) and linear phase response (± 3.5deg(max)). Furthermore, we present the status and the newest enhancements of other components with stringent specifications, such as optical notch filters, pick-up module controllers, variable attenuators, beta-switch combiners and the power amplifiers at the kickers.

A high efficiency electron collector for the COSY high voltage electron cooling system was developed. The main feature of the collector is usage of special insertion (Wien filter) before the main collector, which deflects secondary electron flux to special secondary collector, preventing them fly to the electrostatic tube. In first tests of the collector in COSY cooler efficiency of recuperation better then 10-5 was reached. Before assembling of the cooler in Jülich upgrades of the collector and electron gun were made. After the upgrade efficiency better then 10-6 was reached. Design and testing results of the collector are described.

To get a luminosity level of 1033 cm-2 s-1 at all design points of the MEIC, small transverse emittance is necessary in the ion collider ring, which is achieved by an electron cooling. And for the electron cooling, two solenoids are used to create a cooling environment of temperature exchange between electron beam and ion beam. However, the solenoids can also cause coupling and matching problem for the optics of the MEIC ion ring lattice. Both of them will have influences on the IP section and other areas, especially for the beam size, Twiss parameters, and nonlinear effects. A symmetric and flexible method is used to deal with these problems. With this method, the electron cooling section is merged into the ion ring lattice elegantly.

In the current MEIC design, the ion collider ring needs to be cooled by a bunched electron beam of up to 200 mA 55 MeV, with the possibility to upgrade to 1.5 A. Although it's not impossible to design and build an ERL to provide such a beam, the technical risk and cost associated with such an ERL will be very high. An alternative is to recirculate the electron bunches in a ring for up to 25 turns until the bunch's quality is degraded, reducing the beam current in the ERL by a factor of 25. This scheme requires a pair of fast kickers that kick one in every 25 bunches. In this paper, we will analyze the electrodynamics of a harmonic stripline kicker for this application, and compare it to a harmonic resonator kicker.

Electron cooling is essential for achieving high luminosities for hadron colliders by enabling a reduction of emittance of hadron beams in storage rings. For several future projects such as low energy RHIC cooling program (LEReC) at BNL, a low energy electron-ion collider based on HIAF at IMP and a Medium energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) at JLab, since the hadron beam energies are in a range from several GeV to 100 GeV, the required electron energy is up to 55 MeV. Such high energy electron beams can only be provided by a RF/SRF linac. As a result, the electron beam is highly bunched. Cooling of ions by a bunched electron beam has never been realized before, thus it becomes a critical R&D to these projects. Recently we proposed a proof-of-concept experiment to demonstrate cooling by a bunched electron beam utilizing an existing DC cooler at IMP. Here we present a progress report of this experiment. We briefly describe the experiment and show the design parameters. We then report hardware installation and results of the bench tests. We also summarize the results of the cooling simulation studies and discuss the required beam measurement capability.

Relativistic electron cooling is a key technology for achieving high luminosity required by the next generation of electron-ion and hadron-hadron colliders. We present a selection of computational techniques developed over the past several years for modeling the cooling physics on the ‘‘microscopic" timescales, i.e., during a single traversal of the cooling system. We will discuss modeling of the coherent electron cooling (CeC) scheme and its variants, and also the computation of the dynamical friction force responsible for conventional electron cooling. Modeling CeC requires a coupling between delta-f-PIC simulation of the modulator, customized simulations of the FEL amplifier, and electrostatic PIC simulations of the kicker subsections of the CeC cooler. Improved algorithms for computing the dynamical friction in single-pass frictional cooling simulations allow to control noise and correctly account for the statistics of rare but strong small-impact-parameter electron-ion collisions. We will present and briefly discuss the results of our simulations for the parameters of the CeC Proof-of-Principle Experiment at RHIC and the proposed MEIC CCR.

Microbunching instability is one of the most challenging issues in the design of the transport lines for recirculating or energy recovery linac machines. We have developed a linear Vlasov solver to incorporate relevant collective effects, including coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and longitudinal space charge (LSC) impedances, for a general linear beamline analysis. With application of this code to two specially designed recirculation arcs * and a circulating cooler ring design of MEIC at Jefferson Lab **, the resultant microbunching gain functions are presented. Some underlying physics with inclusion of these collective effects are discussed. We expect that the analysis can help illustrate the microbunching gain evolution and its spectral response, and further improve the advanced beamline designs.
