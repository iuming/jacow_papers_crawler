Two years ago, at the 2015 ICALEPCS conference in Melbourne Australia, we presented a paper entitled 'Replacing The Engine In Your Car While You Are Still Driving It*'. In that paper we described the mid-point of a very ambitious, multi-year, upgrade project involving the complete replacement of the low-level RF system, the timing system, the industrial I/O system, the beam-synchronized data acquisition system, the fast-protect reporting system, and much of the diagnostic equipment. That paper focused mostly on the timing system upgrade and presented several observations and recommendations from the perspective of the timing system and its interactions with the other systems. In this paper, now nearly three quarters of the way through our upgrade schedule, we will report on additional observations, challenges, recommendations, and lessons learned from some of the other involved systems.

Virtual Control Commissioning for a Large Critical Ventilation System: The CMS Cavern Use Case
92

The current cavern ventilation control system of the CMS experiment at CERN is based on components which are already obsolete: the SCADA system, or close to the end of life: the PLCs. The control system is going to be upgraded during the CERN Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2020) and will be based on the CERN industrial control standard: UNICOS employing WinCC OA as SCADA and Schneider PLCs. Due to the critical nature of the CMS ventilation installation and the short allowed downtime, the approach was to design an environment based on the virtual commissioning of the new control. This solution uses a first principles model of the ventilation system to simulate the real process. The model was developed with the modelling and simulation software EcosimPro. In addition, the current control application of the cavern ventilation will also be re-engineered as it is not completely satisfactory in some transients where many sequences are performed manually and some pressure fluctuations observed could potentially cause issues to the CMS detector. The plant model will also be used to validate new regulation schemes and transient sequences offline in order to ensure a smooth operation in production.

The real-time control systems for the Gemini Telescopes were designed and built in the 1990s using state-of-the-art software tools and operating systems of that time. These systems are in use every night, but they have not been kept up-to-date and are now obsolete and also very labor intensive to support. This led Gemini to engage in a major effort to upgrade the software on its telescope control systems. We are in the process of deploying these systems to operations, and in this paper we review the experience and lessons learned through this process and provide an update on future work on other obsolescence management issues.

Funding: Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory(JUNO) Experiment
The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is the second phase of the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment. The detector of the experiment was designed as a 20k ton LS with a inner diameter of 34.5 meters casting material acrylic ball shape. Due to the gigantic shape of the detector there are approximate 40k monitoring point including 20k channels of high voltage of array PMT, temperature and humidity, electric crates as well as the power monitoring points. Since most of the DCS of the DayaBay was developed on the framework based on LabVIEW, which is limited by the operation system upgrade and running license, the framework migration and upgrade are needed for DCS of JUNO. The paper will introduce the new framework of DCS based on EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System). The implementation of the IOCs of the high-voltage crate and modules, stream device drivers, and the embedded temperature firmware will be presented. The software and hardware realization and the remote control method will be presented. The upgrade framework can be widely used in devices with the same hardware and software interfaces.

Lightweight Acquisition System for Analogue Signals
110

In a complex machine such as a particle accelerator there are thousands of analogue signals that need monitoring and even more signals that could be used for debugging or as a tool for detecting symptoms of potentially avoidable problems. Usually it is not feasible to acquire and monitor all of these signals not only because of the cost but also because of cabling and space required. The RF system in the Large Hadron Collider is protected by multiple hardware interlocks that ensure safe operation of klystrons, superconducting cavities and all the other equipment. In parallel, a diagnostic system has been deployed to monitor the health of the klystrons. Due to the limited amount of space and the moderate number of signals to be monitored, a standard approach with a full VME or Compact PCI crate has not been selected. Instead, small embedded industrial computers with USB oscilloscopes chosen for the specific application have been installed. This cost effective, rapidly deployable solution will be presented, including existing and possible future installations as well as the software used to collect the data and integrate it with existing CERN infrastructure.

Funding: LCLS is an Office of Science User Facility operated for the US Department of Energy Office of Science by Stanford University.
The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), a US Department of Energy Office of Science user facility, achieved first light in 2009; a total of seven scientific instruments were commissioned through 2015. The EPICS-based control system, in terms of both hardware and software has evolved significantly over eight years of operation as the rate of experiment delivery has increased through means such as photon-beam multiplexing. A description of the upgrades and improvements to hardware, software, tools, and procedures will be presented. Additional discussion points will focus on: (1) the positive effect of upgrades regarding reduction of staffing levels and required skill-level required to support operations; (2) enabling highly skilled staff to focus on further improvements; and (3) current and future upgrades required to support the LCLS-II which will further expand experiment output when it achieves first light in 2020. LCLS-II topics include requirements for automation of routine tasks such as x-ray and optical-laser beam alignment, and focusing as well as improvements to user-interfaces and user-experience which will allow users and non-expert staff to execute experiments.

The ambitious upgrade plan of the ALICE experiment expects a complete redesign of its data flow after the LHC shutdown scheduled for 2019, for which new electronics modules are being developed in the collaborating institutes. Access to prototypes is at present very limited and full scale prototypes are expected only close to the installation date. To overcome the lack of realistic HW, the ALICE DCS team built small-scale prototypes based on low-cost commercial components (Arduino, Raspberry PI), equipped with environmental sensors, and installed in the experiment areas around and inside the ALICE detector. Communication and control software was developed, based on the architecture proposed for the future detectors, including CERN JCOP FW and ETM WINCC OA. Data provided by the prototypes has been recorded for several months, in presence of beam and magnetic field. The challenge of the harsh environment revealed some insurmountable weaknesses, thus excluding this class of devices from usage in a production setup. They did prove, however, to be robust enough for test purposes, and are still a realistic test-bed for developers while the production of final electronics is continuing.
