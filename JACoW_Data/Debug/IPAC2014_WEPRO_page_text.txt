As part of the R&D for the 50 MeV ThomX Compton source project, we have studied the effect of several beam dynamics processes on the evolution of the beam in the ring. The processes studied include among others Compton scattering, intrabeam scattering, coherent synchrotron radiation. We have performed extensive simulations of a full injection/extraction cycle (400000 turns). We show how each of these processes degrades the flux of photons produced and how a feedback system contributes to recovering most of the flux.

At DELTA, a 1.5-GeV electron storage ring operated as a light source by the Center for Synchrotron Radiation at the TU Dortmund University, coherent ultrashort THz pulses are routinely generated by density-modulated electron bunches. Tracking simulations as well as experimental studies using ultrafast THz detectors and an FT-IR spectrometer aim at understanding the turn-by-turn evolution of the density modulation after an initial laser-electron interaction. Furthermore, intensity-modulated laser pulses are applied to create narrow-band THz radiation. This setup is part of the new short-pulse facility based on coherent harmonic generation.

A nondestructive assay system of isotopes by quasi-monochromatic gamma-rays and nuclear resonance fluorescence is under development in JAEA. The quasi-monochromatic gamma-rays are generated by laser Compton scattering (LCS) based on energy-recovery linac accelerator and laser technologies. In order to demonstrate the accelerator and laser performance required for the gamma-ray source, an LCS experiment is planned at Compact ERL (cERL) at KEK. A mode-locked fiber laser, laser enhancement cavity, beamline, and experimental hatch are under construction for the LCS experiment. Up-to-date construction status is presented in detail.

We have developed a laser Compton scattered gamma-ray source based on a 150-MeV racetrack microtron at Japan Atomic Energy Agency. The microtron equipped with a photocathode RF gun accelerates a single bunch of electrons to collide with a laser pulse from a Nd:YAG laser. Such gamma-ray source realizes industrial application of nuclear material detection in a ship cargo, which is one of the urgent requests of international nuclear security. Recent status of gamma-ray generation experiments and design study of a practical machine is presented.

We have launched a 5-year research program to develop superconducting spoke cavity for laser Compton scattered (LCS) photon sources. For realizing a wide use of LCS X-ray and gamma-ray sources in academic and industrial applications, we adopt 325-MHz superconducting spoke cavity to electron beam drivers for the LCS sources. The spoke cavity, originally invented for ion and proton acceleration, can be used for electron accelerators, in which we can make best use of features of spoke cavity: relative compactness in comparison with a TM cavity of the same frequency, robustness with respect to manufacturing inaccuracy due to its strong cell-to-cell coupling, couplers on outer conductor for the better packing in a linac, and so on. In this paper, we present our research plan and results of cavity shape optimization.

Electromagnetic waves with frequencies from 0.1 THz to 10 THz (usually called the Terahertz gap) are of great importance for a number of scientific and practical applications. Different techniques are known allowing generating these frequencies. However, a current trend of physics and industry is to fill this gap with more powerful and efficient sources. For example, recent experiments have shown promising THz generation in dielectric loaded structures*. Developing this area, we consider the THz emitting scheme where an ultrarelativistic charge exits the open end of a cylindrical waveguide with a dielectric layer and produces THz waves in a form of Cherenkov radiation. The end of the waveguide is supposed to be either orthogonal to the structure axis or skewed. To obtain THz frequencies from waveguides with centimeter or millimeter radii, we consider high order modes. We present typical field patterns (in the Fraunhofer zone) and show that the aperture of the vacuum channel gives, as a rule, the main contribution. We also give simple expressions for the angle of the main pattern lobe.

We present PIC simulations of electron bunches with nm scale longitudinal modulation produced using a compact 2-20 MeV LINAC. The modulation is initially imparted in the transverse dimension of the electron bunch with a nano-patterned photo-emitter in a X-band RF gun with 2 MeV exit energy. The electron bunch passes through a 1 m standing wave X-band LINAC which can raise the beam energy up to 20 MeV. The transverse modulation is exchanged into the longitudinal dimension using a double dog-leg emittance exchange setup with a 5 cell RF deflector cavity. The modulation pitch can be tuned by adjusting the spacing of the nano-patterned photo-emitter or magnification of the transverse pitch with electron optics. The electron beam parameters are optimized to produce coherent XFEL radiation upon interacting with a “laser undulator”.

Microwave waveguides can in principle be used for undulators with periods less than 1 cm. Intensive work has been done on the recently proposed design that operates at the HE11 hybrid mode of a corrugated waveguide; successful experimental results have been reported recently [S.Tantawi Talk at POSIPOL 2012]. In this presentation we propose a beam driven design for an undulator based on an electron bunch train powering a microwave or mm waveguide. The drive bunch train propagates towards the undulating beam inside a dielectric loaded structure or corrugated waveguide generating high power RF. The “smart” waveguide design and a proper bunch spacing of the electron drive beam train provide single mode generation of the high magnitude undulating field that gives an undulator parameter in the range of K~1 for a high frequency device.*

The design for the Sirius full energy booster has been modified after the decision to change the storage ring lattice from TBA to 5BA in July 2012. In the new design the booster is concentric with the storage ring and shares the same tunnel. The achieved emittance of 3.7 nm.rad at 3 GeV for this large booster (496.8 m circumference) is better matched to the 5BA storage ring emittance of 0.28 nm.rad. Good nonlinear behaviour and efficient closed orbit correction in the presence of realistic errors are shown. Injection and extraction schemes and eddy current effects during ramping are also discussed.

Since March of 2013 the user operation has been started with the top-up injection mode of the storage ring at Aich SR.The accelerators of Aichi SR consisted with a 50 MeV linac, an 1.2 GeV full energy booster and the storage ring. The　operation current of the storage ring is 300 mA and the injection rate is up to 1 Hz. The single bunch injection scheme is　employed and the electron beam can be injected into the arbitrary bucket of the storage ring. Up to now, the stabilitiy of 0.2 % for the stored beam current was achieved, however, the coherent oscillation of stored beams due to injection kikers is also obserbed. In order to introduce the new injection scheme into Aichi SR and to suppress that coherent oscillation, we have designed the pulsed multipole injection system. The system consists of the sextupole-like pulsed magnet and the micro-sec responce power supply. In the paper, we will report the results of beam tracking calculations with our designed magnet and power supply.

The storage ring Siberia-2 is SR source of second generation with circumference 124 m. The electron beam is injected into the ring at the energy 450 MeV. The Siberia-2 injection system was initially consisted of two high voltage rectangular pulses generators connected to the two in-vacuum strip – line kickers of traveling wave (wave impedance 50 Ohm) – a pre-inflector and an inflector. The amplitude voltage was 25-35 kV with 20 ns pulse duration and 2-3 ns pulse front/fall. Recently the new injection generators were proposed. Injection system now includes the same kickers and the new 1 microsecond pulse duration and 10 kV voltage amplitude generators. A dynamics of the electron beam after injection moment is considered in the article. The possibility of effective injection with kikers pulse duration over 2 periods of revolution of the electron beam is shown. The results of the new injection system commissioning are also demonstrated.

The prototype of TPS injection girder system was designed and installed in a temporary factory. As the leakage field of the kicker magnet in the prototype was found to be too large according to both simulation and measurement to be acceptable, the lattice was altered to fit the requirements. In this paper, we present the design modifications of the injection girder system due to the new lattice. The DC septum magnet is replaced by a pre-AC septum magnet, of which its adjustable stage must be redesigned. The positions of vacuum components in the injection girder are also altered; we add some new holes in the prototype girder. The prototype of an injection girder system after modification has been installed in the tunnel of Taiwan Photon Source. The accuracy of position of three girders installed, and the stages for the septum or kicker magnet are within 0.25 and 0.08 mm, respectively.

The installations of the In-Vacuum kicker system of the booster injection in TPS are presented in this article. Due to the more than 20 kV operation voltages and precise positioning requirements, the insulations and positioning systems are designed with more attentions. Although increasing the gap between high potential parts and ground could provide enough withstanding voltage, on the other hand, the insufficient space and vacuum requirements limit the sizes of insulators. Therefore, lots of effort have been done to deal with these conflicts. All assembling processes will be described in this paper as well.

LCLS-II is a proposal for a high repetition rate (>1 MHz) FEL, based on a CW, superconducting linac. The LCLS-II injector is being optimized by a collaboration from Cornell University, Fermilab, LBNL, and SLAC. There are a number of different possible technical choices for the injector including an rf gun or a high voltage DC gun. In this paper we present the status of the simulations for the injector optimization for an rf gun choice for LCLS-II. A multiobjective genetic optimizer is implemented for this reason, and optimized solutions for different bunch charges, corresponding to different operating modes, are presented. These operating points are also the initial part of the start-to-end simulations for LCLS-II. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs between compression and brightness conservation in the low energy (<100 MeV) part of the accelerator, as well as the status of sensitivity studies.

The ALS-II proposal consists in the upgrade of the existing Advanced Light Source at LBNL to a new ultra-low emittance lattice for production of diffraction-limited soft x-rays. In order to compensate for the reduced beam lifetime we intend to operate the machine in continuous top-off mode, where one of several bunch trains is extracted every 30-60 seconds and swapped with a fresh train from the accumulator ring, which is injected on axis without perturbing the circulating beam. In this paper we present a possible design for the injection/extraction kicker based on matched stripline electrodes. The main parameters of such a kicker are discussed in reference to the minimum gap between trains, the storage ring lattice, and the characteristics of a suitable pulser. We also present results from 3D electromagnetic modeling of the proposed kicker performed to evaluate its rise and fall time and field uniformity characteristics.

An analysis of the maximum available NSLS-II linac current was performed as part of the preparation for NSLS-II Booster commissioning. The analysis was necessary in order to establish the maximum beam current available from the linac and the maximum current that would be available to the booster accelerator. In this paper we discuss the assumptions that were used in determining the maximum linac current, the model of the linac and comparison to operational conditions.

The NSLS-II linac and associated transport lines were successfully installed and commissioned in the spring of 2012. Various beam measurements were performed to ensure that the linac met specifications and would be a suitable injector for the NSLS-II booster. In this paper we discuss the outcomes of these measurements and compare them to the model of the NSLS-II linac.

Under normal operational conditions in NSLS-II the energy of the beam extracted from the Booster and transferred to and injected into the Storage Ring (SR) is 3 GeV. It was determined that for the commissioning purposes energy range of the beam reaching the SR is allowed to be 2 GeV - 3.15 GeV. While the upper limit of the beam energy is defined by the maximum possible settings of Booster dipoles at the top of the ramp, the lower energy limit has to be provided by magnet interlocks. The constraints of time and resources do not allow providing dynamic interlocks of the Booster dipoles for commissioning stage of NSLS-II. In this paper we find a feasible solution for the static interlock of magnets in the Booster to SR transfer line (BSR) which creates a required “energy filter”.

Preventing Superconducting Wiggler Quench during Beam Loss at the Canadian Light Source

The Canadian Light Source utilizes two superconducting wigglers for the production of hard x-rays. These superconducting wigglers often quench during beam loss, even though tracking calculations predict that the beam is lost on an aperture far from the wigglers. We present measurements that suggest the tracking simulations are correct and the electron beam indeed strikes the predicted limiting inboard aperture. By simulating the interaction of the beam with the aperture, we find that some scattered electrons can retain sufficient energy to remain inside the storage ring. The simulations show that some of these scattered electrons strike the wiggler vacuum chamber and deposit energy in the superconducting coils, causing the quench.

Simulation of a Long-period EPU Operating in Universal Mode at the Canadian Light Source
1995

The Canadian Light Source is implementing an elliptically polarizing undulator (EPU) with period 180 mm for the production of soft x-rays with variable polarization. Two issues arise from implementing such a device. First, a long-period EPU can cause significant loss of dynamic aperture due to strong dynamic focusing. Second, to compensate for polarization effects due to beamline optics, the EPU must be able to produce light with an arbitrary polarization at the source point, which is referred to as universal mode. We present a scheme for operating the EPU in universal mode and discuss the use of BESSY-style current strips in order to compensate for dynamic effects. Tracking simulations suggest that dynamic aperture can be sufficiently recovered for all required operating points in universal mode.

The W164 out-vacuum wiggler was designed and built at SOLEIL with the double goal of producing high energy photons for the PUMA beamline (10 keV to 70 keV) and to be used as a modulator for the FEMTOSLICING project. The insertion device requires simultaneously reaching low resonant energy (1.55 eV) and high critical energy of photons (above 10 keV), leading to the choice of high field and large periods. The 3.28 m long wiggler is composed of 20 periods of 164 mm made of NdFeB magnets and vanadium permendur poles. The required effective field for the FEMTOSLICING is 1.53 T and the maximum total field reaches 1.8T at the minimum gap of 14.5 mm. The small transverse size of the poles was optimized to minimize the magnetic forces (8 tons maximum) resulting, together with the large field produced at minimum gap, to a large vertical dynamic field integral (DFI) inside the horizontal physical aperture of the chamber. A dedicated permanent magnet system was designed, constructed and installed at both wiggler ends to cancel the DFI at minimum gap. The construction of the wiggler, the results of the magnetic measurements and the effects on dynamics measured on electron beam are presented.

The Metrology Light Source (MLS), situated in Berlin (Germany) is owned by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt and was built / is operated by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. It is an electron storage ring operating from 105 MeV to 630 MeV. The MLS serves as the national primary source standard from the near infrared to the extreme ultraviolet spectral region *. Users of synchrotron radiation demand an improved lifetime which is Touschek dominated at the MLS. A possible solution to meet this demand is to lengthen the electron bunches. By installing a Robinson Wiggler (RW), damping effects can be transferred from the longitudinal to the horizontal plane **,***, thereby increasing the energy spread and reducing the horizontal emittance. By varying the energy spread, the bunch length can be increased and thus the scattering rate decreased, resulting in an improved lifetime. According to preliminary estimations a considerable increase in lifetime seems achievable, while preserving the source size.

Cryogenic in vacuum permanent magnet undulators with periods less than 10 mm and correspondingly narrow gaps require tighter geometric and magnetic tolerances and complex pole designs from different materials to achieve the needed high field strengths. We use new mechanic designs and manufacturing technologies for magnet and pole assembly. We develop new precise and UHV-compatible joining methods which are different from the current approaches which are based on mechanical clamping or gluing. . We examine the mechanical and magnetic properties by performing tests and discuss the results.

This paper reports about aspects of design, manufacturing, and commissioning of the 12 FLASH2 variable gap undulator segments. The accuracy of gap drive and encoder systems was tested by magnetic measurements; changes in the phase error proved to be a highly sensitive probe to verify a reproducibility of 1 μm. After magnetic tuning of the IDs, the remaining gap dependence in the field integrals could be successfully compensated by corrector coils. Inconsiderate handling of components during assembling necessitated an elaborate demagnetisation process before the tuning could start.

The FLASH2 SASE undulator section consists of 12 IDs. Each of them is followed by an intersection component comprising a phase shifter and various parts for diagnostics and beam steering. The phase shifter is a compact and simple electromagnetic chicane and has to assure constructive interference of the radiation of adjacent undulators for all wavelengths. The magnetic performance, field errors and the hysteresis behavior have been investigated and were found to be within the required accuracy. The results are discussed in relation to the undulator conditions. From these data tables for steering the phase shifter current as function of undulator gap were derived and implemented in the control system.

In recent years there exists interests in harmonic lasing of free electron lasers for short wavelength operation with low energy electron beams. In a planar undulator , the electron radiates at odd harmonics on axis however the harmonic gain of the FEL is much less than that of fundamental. It has been shown in earlier works that it is possible to enhance the harmonic radiation by increasing the harmonic wiggler field to the fundamental by putting high permeability shims inside the undulator. The common material is the vanadium permendur (μ ~800) , which has been used effectively to design the harmonic undulator. In this paper, we report the design and fabrication of seventh and ninth harmonic undulator for free electron laser applications. We use CRGO shims with μ ~ 2-3. The permanent magnet undulator is a four block per period design. The undulator is a variable gap type and consists of NdFeB magnets with six periods, each period is of 5cm length. The undulator has been measured in hall probe and pulsed wire bench. It is shown that the pulsed wire magnetic measurements yields results in close agreement with hall probe results.

FLASH2 is an extension of the present VUV-FEL facility at DESY. It includes a separate tunnel with a 12 x 2.5m = 30m long planar hybrid undulator. The undulators have 31.4mm period length and 1T field at a minimum gap of 9mm. The paper presents recent progress in the magnetic measurements of these undulators. Several specific details of the measurement tools will be discussed like peculiarities in the Hall probe calibration and noise, positioning accuracy and synchronization of voltage measurement with probes movement during scan, noise issues of various voltage integrators for stretched wire and search coil measurements.

In the new octant of PETRA~III, there are 14 undulator beamlines covering photon energy range from 0.3keV to 150keV. There are also 80m of damping wigglers in order to achieve a low emittance of 1nmrad. Some of these devices, operating at PETRAIII since 2008, accumulated total radiation doses of about 100kGy. Visible corrosion at the magnet structures of some permanent magnet undulators setting in after a few years and a high dose rate measured regularly by thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) gave reason to inspect the magnetic field of all insertion devices in the PETRA tunnel. This paper presents details of the magnetic field degradation caused by radiation damage to the undulator magnets. For some undulators changes in the spectral properties of the generated light were observed. It was measured with different taper settings in order to partly compensate the nonuniform demagnetization along the structure. The results are compared with the data from the sFLASH undulators and measurements of special 3 pole "sacrificial" undulator, installed in FLASH. Its magnetic field is periodically remeasured and shows field amplitude decrease of 1% per 16kGy accumulated dose.

This undulator in combination with a specialized beam transport line will be employed to produce undulator radiation with natural bandwidth despite the relatively large energy spread of the electrons produced by the LWFA. The fabrication of this undulator and first results of the magnetic field measurement are discussed in this paper.

An intense on-axis radiation power from an undulator is a serious problem especially for a low-photon-energy beamline in a facility with high or medium energy storage ring. This problem may be solved by using a Figure-8, a Pera, or a Knot undulator configuration*,**. However, these schemes are useless for variably polarizing undulators such as an APPLE undulator and other similar variations since such devices are not capable for reducing on-axis power density in the linear mode. In these circumstances, we have completed a conceptual magnet design of Knot-APPLE udulator which is capable to generate elliptically polarized radiation as well as linearly polarized radiation. This pure permanent magnet device is equipped with a motion mechanism of APPLE undulator. In this paper, we present detailed magnet design feature, magnetic field distributions, and radiation properties including variations of polarization in comparisons with other exotic devices. In addition, a possibility to introduce a quasi-periodicity in this type of undulator is considered in order to achieve further reduction of second and third harmonic radiation intensities.

Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) is developing 10 GeV, 0.1 nm SASE based FEL for high power, short pulse X-ray coherent photon sources named PAL-XFEL. At the first stage PAL-XFEL needs two undulator lines for photon source. PAL is developing undulator magnetic structure based on EU-XFEL design. Recently, the hard X-ray undulator changed its minimum magnetic gap to 8.3 mm from the previous 7.2 mm to alleviate the wake field impact, and to increase the allowances for the re alignment. Accordingly, the period is also changed from 24.4 mm to 26.0 mm to generate 0.1 nm at 10 GeV electron energy. In this report, the modification efforts and the progress on the prototyping of hard x-ray undulator system will be presented.

Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) is developing the SASE based FEL for X-ray coherent photon sources. The PAL developed the prototype undulator that was 5.0 m magnetic length. The PAL has constructed the undulator field measurement facility to confirm the field qualities of the XFEL undulators in the assembly building. The temperature stability of the measurement rooms was controlled within ±0.1°C. Two field measurement benches that included Hall probe scan, flip coil and stretched wire system were installed and evaluated their performances. The field profile of the prototype undulator was characterized and shimmed using the installed measurement system. This paper described the field measurement facility with the performance test results of the two benches.

A relativistic electron passing through an undulator generates electromagnetic radiation at the expenses of its own kinetic energy. This effect is usually not taken into account if the number of periods of the undulator is relatively small (100 - 200). However, at FEL facilities, long installations have been built, planned or are under construction, where many undulators are installed one after another for a total of several thousand undulator periods. For instance, the SASE1 and SASE2 lines at the European XFEL will consist of 35 undulators with 124 periods each. In this case, because of the electron energy decrease along its trajectory, the radiation from different undulators will drop out of synchronism. As a result, the radiation spectral line will be much wider. In the presented report, this effect was analyzed analytically and numerically. An expression for the critical number of undulator periods, when the effect of electron energy loss should be properly taken into account, is derived. It is found that, for the case of the European XFEL, this number is about 1200 periods.

Strong-field short-period wigglers installed in electron storage ring increase the radiation damping integral I2 and either increase or decrease the I5 integral responsible for quantum excitation. In case of the I5 integral decreasing, the beam emittance can be substantially reduced. In the paper we discuss additional reduction of I5 by applying of the longitudinal modulation of the wiggler period (tapering).

A cryogenic undulator with a permanent magnet (CPMU) is an important insertion device now under construction at NSRRC. For an undulator of this kind, the distribution of the magnetic field must be measured along the axis; the phase error, trajectory and photon flux must be calculated after the magnetic arrays are installed in the vacuum chamber and cooled to cryogenic temperature. We developed a Hall-probe system to measure the magnetic field in an evacuated environment; this system uses lasers and stages to monitor and to correct dynamically the positions of the Hall probe. All components installed inside the vacuum chamber are compatible with an environment of high vacuum and low temperature. The details of the design and completed fabrication are presented in this paper.

Robinson wiggler is a special insertion device that can be used to decrease natural emittance of the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) storage ring. There are four poles in one set of Robinson Wiggler and each pole has combined with dipole and quadrupole field strength. The dipole field strength multiply quardupole field strength in each pole should be negative. This Robinson wiggler can change damping partition number and then affect the emittance. This study will evaluate practicability of reducing the emittance of TPS storage ring by muti-period Robinson wiggler and will be installed in the 7 m long-straight section. One period of the traditional Robinson Wiggler include four poles with different field polarity. In the same length, the mult-period Robinson Wiggler have many period in one set of Robinson Wiggler that is different from the traditional Robinson wiggler. Due to the traditional Robinson wiggler can not be effective to improve emittance in TPS storage ring (the efficiency is only 7%). So we adopt to use muti-period Robinson wiggler, the efficiency can be up to 37%, and the linear matching result is better than one period Robinson Wiggler.

Cryocooled permanent magnet undulators (CPMUs) using NdFeB magnets around 150K were first proposed by Hara*. These are cooled by using either GM cryocoolers or circulating sub-cooled liquid nitrogen. Due to the heat load from radiation and wakefield heating from the electron beam, temperature gradients can develop along the length of the magnet girders which could be as large as several degrees for the Diamond Light Source (DLS) storage ring operating parameters. Some grades of the magnetic material (NdxPr1-x)2Fe14B have remanence curves versus temperature which increase significantly for temperatures below 150K with peaks below 80K**. This means that the operating temperature of a CPMU using this material can be close to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. The proposed cooling system for the new DLS CPMU is based on a thermosiphon allowing nitrogen to boil inside the cooling channels without a circulating pump. This has the advantage of absorbing large amounts (>250W) of heat with very small temperature gradients. We report here the results of a prototype magnet beam cooled with a thermosiphon producing a temperature gradient of less than 0.05K along a 2m beam at ~77K.

Tiny round electron beams of free-electron lasers and relatively new diffraction-limited storage rings make possible utilization of electromagnetic helical undulators based on double-helical windings. It has been understood for a while that a coaxial pair of double-helical windings can generate helical as well as planar magnetic fields*. Such a coil structure can potentially be realized with superconducting windings thus forming the concept of a universal superconducting undulator (Universal SCU). An example of a possible universal SCU for the recently suggested Advanced Photon Source multi-bend achromat storage ring is given in this paper. The results of the magnetic simulation together with initial cryogenic considerations are presented.

The first year's experience of operating such a novel insertion device at the APS is summarized in this paper. The performance of the SCU0 as a photon source is presented. The measured heat load from the electron beam is described together with the observed cryogenic behavior of the device. The effect of the SCU0 on the APS electron beam is also presented.

Laser Compton X-ray source is studied as an accelerator-laser hybrid technology to realize a compact source from soft X-ray to gamma ray*. It is critical to design a solid state laser of 1J pulse energy with 1ps pulse length, and a high beam quality for 10 microμm diameter interaction. The required M2 is less than 1.5 in a standard normal incidence configuration. X-ray total photon number is ~109 with 1nC, 3ps 43MeV electron bunch for each shot. HiLASE project is committed to make a progress in the field of new generation solid state laser based on Yb-doped materials, to deliver 1J at 120Hz of 1-2ps with M2<1.5. The laser system consists of a seed fiber laser and two amplifier stages, an Yb:YAG thin disk regenerative amplifier, and a cryogenically cooled single slab booster amplifier. We have obtained output energy of 45mJ from the regenerative amplifier at 1 kHz with M2 <1.2. Booster amplifier is designed by a conduction cooling to build a compact system. Gain bandwidth was 1.2nm at 120K, enough to obtain 1-2ps pulses. Improvement of the crystal holder and the experimental results are presented to indicate the available pulse energy and M2.

The aim of the Femto-Slicing project at SOLEIL is to generate 100 fs X-rays pulses on two beamlines, CRISTAL and TEMPO in a first step, for pump-probe experiments in the hard and soft X-rays regions and possibly on two other beamlines in the future. Two fs lasers are currently in operation on TEMPO and CRISTAL for pump-probe experiments on the ps time scale enabling time resolved photoemission and photodiffraction studies. The Femto-Slicing project is based on the fs laser of the CRISTAL beamline, which can be adjusted to deliver 5 to 3 mJ pulses of 30 fs duration at 1 to 2.5 kHz respectively. The laser beam is separated in three branches: one delivering about 2 mJ to the modulator Wiggler and the other ones delivering the remaining energy to the TEMPO and CRISTAL experiments. This layout will yield natural synchronization between IR laser pump and X-ray probe pulses, only affected by drift associated with beam transport. In this paper, we present the current status of the Femto-Slicing project at SOLEIL, with particular emphasis on the characterization of the laser beam transport to the wiggler, to the CRISTAL beamline, and with the first results that will be obtained.

In Travelling-Wave Thomson Scattering (TWTS) the pulse front of a high-power, short-pulse laser is tilted and the dispersion of the pulse is controlled in such a way that electrons can interact over a long distance with a quasi-monochromatic electromagnetic wave. We present a complete three dimensional analytic time-dependent description of the TWTS field and use this description to derive an analytic FEL equation that shows that TWTS indeed provides for an all-optical FEL. We further derive conditions for optimum operation of the TWTS FEL, showing that EUV and XUV FEL sources are in reach using Petawatt lasers and conventional few-hundred MeV electron sources. Future laser-wakefield accelerators could potentially drive all-optical TWTS-FELs in the X-ray and beyond. TWTS itself is optimum to provide full flexibility in terms of the wavelength and bandwidth of the scattered radiation, allowing for application-optimized, highly-brilliant Thomson Scattering sources for a broad range of wavelengths from the EUV to the gamma ray spectral region.

3-D ellipsoidal photo cathode laser pulses are considered as the next step in optimization of photo injectors required for a successful operation of linac based free electron lasers. Significant improvements in electron beam emittance obtained from the beam dynamics simulations using such laser pulses compared to the conventional cylindrical pulses motivated the experimental studies in order to develop a laser system for quasi 3-D ellipsoidal pulses. The Institute of Applied Physics (Nizhny Novgorod, Russia) in collaboration with the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) and the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ) is developing such a photo cathode laser system. Experimental tests of the laser system with photoelectron beam production are planned at PITZ. The laser pulse shaping is realized using the spatial light modulator technique. The laser system is capable of pulse train generation. First cross-correlation measurements were done demonstrating in principle the ability to generate and measure quasi ellipsoidal laser pulses. In this contribution the overall set-up, working principle and the actual progress of the development will be reported.

A nondestructive assay system of isotopes by quasi-monochromatic gamma-rays by laser Compton scattering (LCS) is under development. In order to demonstrate the accelerator and laser performance required for the gamma-ray source, an LCS experiment is planned at Compact ERL (cERL) at KEK. An optical resonant cavity is under construction for the LCS experiment. The new optical cavity is designed by combination of two bow-tie cavities to achieve fast optical polarization switching. The performance of the optical cavity is presented in detail.

At the Iranian Light Source Facility (ILSF), two different storage ring options are being studied. The designs differ in emittance. In the first option the calculated emittance is 3.278 nm-rad whereas for the second option emittance is 0.937 nm-rad. In this paper the electron beam emittance effects on the source radiation properties from bending magnet, wiggler and undulator, X-ray optics and the beamline design are carefully studied. The present calculations demonstrate that in the case of 0.937 nm-rad brilliance of undulator is increased by a factor of about 5. For bending magnet, flux is reduced almost 1 order of magnitude for hard x-ray regime. Because of smaller size of the source for undulator at the case of 0.937 nm-rad, we can achieve to a smaller spot size and higher resolution with easier focusing systems and usual kind of monochromator than the emittance of 3.278 nm-rad and for the bending magnet hard x-ray beamline, size of the mirrors reduced 30% in the 0.937 nm-rad emittance case, so its result is shorter mirror, low cost and perhaps more challengeable heat load.

The Spectromicroscopy beamline is one of the day one beamlines of the Iranian Light Source Facility project in the field of soft x-ray spectroscopy. This beamline is designed to cover the 90-2500eV energy range with about 8000 resolving power, and the minimum spot size of about 10×4 micrometer 2 at sample position. Brilliance, flux and photon size and divergence in the whole range of energy has been calculated for a 4.3m linear undulator using SPECTRA code. This undulator has 1015 ph/s(0.1% B.W.) photon flux at 96 eV energy & 400 mA electron current. A circular pinhole with maximum diameter size of 2.52mm has been inserted in a distance of 10m from the source to pass 95% radiated. Primary layout of this branch includes a collimating mirror, a varied included-angle plane grating monochromator, and a KB bendable elliptical cylinder mirror. The ray tracing calculation by using computational software SHADOW has been done to determine and optimize of the important optical parameters. Three plane gratings with different uniform line density (700, 900, 1200 lines/mm) have been used to cover the whole energy range with the resolving power of 0.75-0.8×104 depending on the photon energy.

Funding: This research is part of the results of the Basic Science Research Program performed by the support of the NRF of Korea funded by the Korean Ministry of Education (2013R1A1A2012390).
In this research, a new K-B mirror system was developed for focusing a microbeam to 1 μm x 1 μm at the 4B beamline of the Pohang Light Source-II. The new K-B mirror system consists of a pair of assemblage having three mechanisms that adjust the position, pitch, and curvature of each vertically and horizontally focusing mirrors and stages that support both the assemblages to enable translations along two orthogonal axes and rotation on the horizontal plane. Both the pitch- and curvature-adjusting mechanisms were designed as flexural mechanisms driven by their respective single actuators to minimize the movement of the mirror center even when the pitch or the curvature of each mirror was adjusted. The K-B mirror system with these features will be robust against possible disturbances and will help promote easy and simple mirror adjustment. This paper describes the whole design of the new K-B mirror system in detail and the structural analysis results of the pitch- and the curvature-adjusting mechanisms, and reports the operation principle of the curvature-adjusting mechanism.

The accelerators of the facility for Antiproton and Ion Research – FAIR are designed to deliver stable and rare isotope beams covering a huge range of intensities and beam energies. The ion and antiproton beams for the experiments will have highest beam quality for cutting edge physics to be conducted within the four research pillars CBM, NuSTAR, APPA and PANDA. The challenges of the accelerator facility to be established are related to the systems comprising magnets, cryo technology, rf-technology, vacuum etc. FAIR will employ heavy ion synchrotrons for highest intensities, antiproton and rare isotope production stations, high resolution separators and several storage rings where beam cooling can be applied. Intense work on test infrastructure for the huge number of superconducting magnets of the FAIR machines is ongoing at GSI and several partner labs. In addition, the GSI accelerator facility is being prepared to serve as injector for the FAIR accelerators. As the construction of the FAIR facility and procurement has started, an overview of the designs, procurements status and infrastructure preparation will be provided.

Optimization of the SIS18 Injector Operation for FAIR

In the FAIR accelerator complex, the existing synchrotron SIS18 will serve as an injector, supplying intense beams of heavy ions and protons for further acceleration in the synchrotron SIS100. In order to satisfy the intensity requirements for FAIR, SIS18 has to be operated routinely at the space charge limit. Particularly demanding requirements arise from the operation with medium charge state heavy ions due to the dynamic vacuum created by ions lost through charge exchange reactions. It is therefore crucial to avoid losses in SIS18 as much as possible while confining unavoidable losses onto low desorption surfaces. In this contribution we report on the ongoing activities related to minimizing the losses by means of a better quantitative understanding and control of the beam. This includes the development of more accurate theoretical models, benchmarked with machine experiments, as well as the practical integration of the models into the control system, using beam instrumentation data in the calculation of set values whenever possible.

At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre (HIT) cancer patients are treated using the raster-scanning method. A synchrotron provides pencil beams in therapy quality for 255 energy steps per ion type allowing to vary the penetration depth and thus to irradiate tumors slice-by-slice. So far, changing the beam energy necessitates a new synchrotron cycle, including all phases without beam extraction. As the no. of ions that can be accelerated in the synchrotron usually exceeds the required no. of ions for one energy slice, treatment time could be significantly reduced by reaccelerating or decelerating the remaining ions to the next energy level. By alternating acceleration and extraction phases several slices could be irradiated with only short interruptions. Therefore the reacceleration of a transversally blown up beam – due to RF-knockout extraction – must be investigated, beam losses have to be minimized. To estimate the benefit of this operation mode, treatment time has been simulated and compared to the time achieved in the past. A reduction of up to 65% is possible and more patients can be treated! Simulations and first tests of a reaccelerated and extracted beam are presented.

The FAIR complex (Facility for Antiprotons and Ion Research) will be built in different stages. Due to the postponed RESR in the first stage, both RF-cavities of the HESR have to operate in different modes to achieve the required beam quantity and quality. The RF-system of the HESR will now consists of two identical cavities with a common low-level RF control (LLRF). Both cavities will be driven by low noise solid state amplifiers. Each cavity contains of one gap and two tanks operating in push-pull mode and each tank will house 6 ring cores wound of modern magnetic nano-alloy ribbon. Meanwhile all ring cores were delivered and first results at low power and at high power will be presented. The construction of the new air cooling concept is now in the final stage.

The present J-PARC main ring (MR) injection system has worked for 6 years since 2008, and the performance has been improved a lot by correcting the original design faults. But there are still problems in the existing injection system that affects the daily operation. In order to realize the MR beam power to the design limit, a high performance injection system is crucial. The remaining problems may have severe effects on high intensity beam, and become a big block to the realization of high beam power operation. Thus, upgrade the present injection system to satisfy the demands of high beam power operation is extremely important. The upgrade will redesign injection septa to obtain high performance, which will reduce the leakage field greatly. The kicker rise time will be reduced greatly by optimizing the configuration and using speed-up circuit. A compensation kicker magnet is being studied for reflection tail field cancelation. Careful 3D electromagnetic field simulations and 3D particle tracking are performed to ensure the accuracy of magnets design.

Choice of tune operating point is serious for operation of high intensity proton machine. Space charge force induces tune spread and nonlinear resonance. Nonlinear resonances are also contained in accelerator lattice. We discuss optimization of operating point based on space charge simulation in J-PARC Main Ring.

The CERN Super Proton Synchrotron accelerates beams for the Large Hadron Collider to 450 GeV. In addition it produces beams for fixed target facilities which adds complexity to the SPS operation. During the run 2012-2013 drifts of the extracted beam trajectories have been observed and lengthy optimizations in the transfer lines were performed to reduce particle losses in the LHC. The observed trajectory drifts are consistent with the measured SPS orbit drifts at extraction. While extensive studies are going on to understand, and possibly suppress, the source of such SPS orbit drifts the feasibility of an automatic beam steering towards a “golden” orbit at the extraction septa, by means of the interlocked correctors, is also being investigated. The challenges and constraints related to the implementation of such a correction in the SPS are described. Simulation results are presented and a possible operational steering strategy is proposed.

The development of magnetic cogging is part of the Fermilab Booster upgrade within the Proton Improvement Plan (PIP). The Booster is going to send 2.25·1017 protons/hour which is almost double the present flux, 1.4·1017 protons/hour to the Main Injector (MI) and Recycler (RR). The extraction kicker gap has to synchronize to the MI and RR injection bucket in order to avoid a beam loss at the rising edge of the extraction and injection kickers. Magnetic cogging is able to control the revolution frequency and the position of the gap using the magnetic field from dipole correctors while radial position feedback keeps the beam at the central orbit. The new cogging is expected to reduce beam loss due to the orbit changes and reduce beam energy loss when the gap is created. The progress of the magnetic cogging system development is going to be discussed in this paper.

Imperfection and vertical intrinsic depolarizing resonances have been overcome by the two partial Siberian snakes in the AGS. The relatively weak but numerous horizontal resonances are the main source of polarization loss in the AGS. A pair of horizontal quads have been used to overcome these weak resonances. This technique needs very accurate jump timing. Fast roll-over magnet cycle has been used and it improves the polarization transmission efficiency near extraction when acceleration usually is slowing down. Emittance preservation is also important to mitigate polarization loss. Recent experimental results including jump quad timing and emittance preservation are presented in this paper.

Future RHIC physics program calls for polarized He3 beam. The He3 beam from the new EBIS source has a relative low rigidity which requires delicate control of injection and RF setup in the Booster. The strong depolarization resonance strength in both AGS and AGS Booster requires careful consideration of beam energy range and optics setup. Recently, the He3 beam was accelerated to 11GeV/n in the AGS. The near term goal fo 3*1010 at RHIC requires several RF bunch merges in both AGS and the Booster. The beam test results are presented in this paper.

The ESS will nominally operate with an average (peak) proton current of 2.5 mA (62.5 mA) at 2.0 GeV. To reduce the beam peak current density at the spallation target, the ESS HEBT will apply a fast transverse raster system consisting of 8 dithering magnet dipoles. The raster system sweeps the linac beamlet on the target surface and gives a rectangular intensity outline within a macropulse of 2.86 ms. The magnets are driven by triangular current waveforms of up to 40 kHz. The preliminary magnet design and power supply topology will be discussed.

Following an optimization of the European Spallation Source (ESS) linac, a number of changes have been introduced in the High Energy Beam Transport (HEBT). In particular, about 120 m of beam transport has been allocated to enable an extension of the superconducting linac, thus providing some contingency against poor linac performance and potentially allowing a future beam power upgrade. The changes in layout and beam optics in all HEBT lines will be discussed.

With a nominal beam power of 5 MW, the demands for low relative beam losses in the ESS linac are unprecedented. In the HEBT, where the beam first reaches full power, this is especially relevant. The acceptance of the HEBT should thus encompass beams of non-nominal parameters and ideally be tolerant to partial hardware failure for at least a pulse train of 2.86 ms. In this paper, the sensitivity towards errors in beam parameters and optical elements will be presented.

In order to feed the nuclear data needs for design of the Chinese Accelerator Driven sub-critical System (CADS) and new generation nuclear energy systems, we plan to construct the China White Neutron Source (CWNS). The CWNS will be composed of a Proton Linac, an Accumulator Ring, a Target and Experimental Facilities. The linac is designed to deliver a proton beam having an average current of 1 mA at energy up to 300 MeV. The revolution frequency of the accumulator ring will be ~1.4 MHz. Two spallation targets are planned, with one for short pulsed modes and the other for micro-pulsed mode.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a neutron science facility comprising a linear H+ accelerator, a tungsten target station, 22 neutron instruments, a suite of laboratories and a supercomputing data processing centre. The Accelerator project represents about a third of the total ESS construction budget and several European countries participate as in-kind contributing partners to it. It is crucial to guarantee requirements consistency, clarity of interface definition and proper space allocation. Potential functional and design inconsistencies must be promptly detected and actively resolved, bridging the project from the conceptual design towards a smooth, cost and time effective installation. Moreover, while the correct synergies are established and maintained, the organisational burden has to be minimized, aspect particularly relevant given the intrinsic prototypic nature of projects of this type. This paper describes the system architecture and the tools deployed to integrate the design of the ESS Linear Accelerator and to prepare for its installation.

The Swiss spallation neutron source (SINQ) at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) provides beams of thermal and cold neutrons to different neutron instruments. In a view of a potential SINQ upgrade, an experimental program characterizing the current performance of SINQ neutron beams was started in 2013. We present experimental results of the irradiation of imaging plates and gold foils at one of SINQ thermal neutron beam lines that hosts the high resolution powder diffractometer (HRPT) and compare the experimental results to the numerical MCNPX simulations of the neutron flux from the SINQ target-moderator system.

Expected backgrounds in the final accelerator-to-target region of the European Spallation Source, to be built in Lund, Sweden, have been calculated using the MCNPX program. We consider the effects of losses from the beam, both along the full length and localised at the bending magnets, and also backsplash from the target. The prompt background is calculated, and also the residual dose, as a function of time, arising from activation of the beam components. Activation of the air is also determined. The model includes the focussing and rasterising magnets, and shows the effects of the concrete walls of the tunnel. We give the implications for the design and operation of the accelerator.

A second target station is planned for the Oak Ridge Spallation Neutron Source. The ion source will be upgraded to increase the peak current from 38 to 49 mA, additional superconducting RF cavities will be added to the linac to increase the H− beam energy from 933 to 1300 MeV, and the accumulator ring will receive modifications to the injection and extraction systems to accommodate the higher beam energy. After pulse compression in the storage ring one sixth of the beam pulses (10 out of 60 Hz) will be diverted to the second target by kicker and septum magnets added to the existing Ring to Target Beam Transport (RTBT) line. No further modifications will be made to the RTBT so that when the kicker and septum magnets are turned off the original target 1 beam transport lattice will be unaffected. In this paper we will discuss these and other planned modifications and upgrades to the accelerator facility, and also the status of this project.

HIGH POWER MOLTEN TARGETS FOR RADIOACTIVE ION BEAM PRODUCTION: FROM PARTICLE PHYSICS TO MEDICAL APPLICATIONS

Megawatt-class molten targets, combining high material densities and good heat transfer properties are being considered for neutron spallation sources, neutrino physics facilities and radioactive ion beam production. In order to cope with the limitation of long diffusion times affecting the extraction of short-lived isotopes, a lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) target loop equipped with a diffusion chamber has been proposed and tested offline at IPUL, Latvia, by E. Noah and co-workers. To validate the concept, a molten LBE loop is now in the design phase and will be prototyped and tested on-line at CERN-ISOLDE using a 1.4-GeV proton beam. Primary focus is given to the dimensioning of the diffusion chamber. The molten LBE concept inspired a new alternative route to produce 1013 18Ne/s for the Beta Beams project, where a molten salt loop would be irradiated with 7 mA, 160-MeV proton beam. The concept has been validated by testing a molten fluoride salt static unit at CERN-ISOLDE using a 1.4-GeV proton beam. The investigation of the release and production of neon isotopes allowed the first measurement of the diffusion coefficient of this element in molten fluoride salts.

The Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and the University Hospital Charité in Berlin provide a treatment of ocular tumors with a proton beam. The 68 MeV proton beam is delivered by the isochronous HZB-cyclotron as main accelerator. Very important in tumor irradiation treatments is the positioning of the radiation field. For the treatment of eye tumors it is even more important, due to the small and sensitive structures in the eye. Therefore, because of the well-defined Bragg peak, a proton beam is a good choice to achieve very constrained fields of dose delivery. Especially the knowledge of the proton beam energy and the proton beam range with a high accuracy is crucial, due to the small critical structures in the eye. A possible solution for a quick and precise measurement of the range of such proton beams is a Multi-Leaf Faraday Cup (MLFC). This work has the task to develop such a MLFC adapted to the special requirements of the eye tumor therapy. An overview of the progress of this work regarding the MLFC principles and issues such as the first technical realization and results will be given.

Cancer therapy with light heavy ions is now a well proven technology. Almost all facilities are running Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Sources (ECRIS) to produce carbon ions and protons as well. In the 1990’s the idea of using a Electron Beam Ion Source was proposed (EBIS) [1]. Some proof of principle measurements were carried out [2] but the application of EBIS ion sources in radiation facilities has not been established. We present results from the implementation of a superconducting EBIS, the Dresden EBIS-SC, at an RFQ accelerator at the testbench of the Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center (HIT). First results from C 4+ ions produced by the Dresden EBIS-SC [3] and injection in an RFQ accelerator at the HIT testbench are shown. Furthermore, emittance measurements as well as investigations of the ion energy and the transmission through the RFQ were done. The emittance of the EBIS source is lower by a factor of nine compared to an ECRIS, which improves the transmission through the RFQ. With the current setup the ion output from the EBIS-SC is lower by a factor of 7 compared to an ECRIS to fulfill the requirements of the highest irradiation level. Further improvements are discussed.

A variable energy (3-7 MeV) and pulsed current (0.1 – 100 μA) proton beam has been made available for different applications (radiobiology experiments, detectors development, material studies) in an irradiation facility at ENEA-Frascati based on the 7 MeV injector of the protontherapy linac under realization in the framework of the TOP-IMPLART Project. It is a 425 MHz linear accelerator consisting in a 3 MeV RFQ followed by a DTL up to 7 MeV (PL-7 ACCSYS-HITACHI model) followed by an horizontal and a vertical beam transport line. The latter one is particularly suitable for radiobiology in vitro studies allowing to irradiate besides cell monolayes also cell growing in suspension culture. The paper describes the facility and the recent results of the experimental activity.

Manufacture of superconducting rotating-gantry for heavy-ion radiotherapy is currently in progress. This rotating gantry can transport heavy ions having 430 MeV/nucleon to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over 0-360 degrees, and enable advanced radiation-therapy. The three-dimensional scanning-irradiation method is performed in this rotating gantry. Therefore, uniformity of magnetic field is quite important since scanned beams traverse through these superconducting magnets before reaching to the isocenter. In the present work, we precisely measured the magnetic-field distributions of the superconducting magnets for the rotating gantry. We used Hall probes to measure the magnetic field. The magnetic-field distributions were determined by measuring Hall voltage, while moving the Hall probes on a rail, which has the same curvature as a center trajectory of beams. The measured-field distributions were compared with calculated distributions with a three-dimensional electromagnetic-field solver, the OPERA-3D code. Furthermore, beam-tracking simulations were performed by using the measured magnetic-field distributions to verify the design of the superconducting magnets.

A new beam transport and a irradiation system were designed for radionuclides production with heat damageable targets. The incident beam is swept along a circle on the irradiation target with fast steering magnets. The width and the sweeping radius of the incident beams were optimized to achieve high production efficiency and avoid the heat damages. Based on those optimized parameters, beam optics of the new beam transport lines was optimized. To obtain initial conditions for the optical calculations, the beam emittance and the Twiss parameters were measured at the upper stream of the new beam transport lines. In this paper, we present the results of the calculations and the optimized beam transport lines.

The X-band RF linear accelerators (LINAC’s) are popular for medical application due to its compactness. To increase the precision of treatment accuracy under circumstance in which the LINAC is mounted on an apparatus such as gantry frame or robot-arm; this is an advantage as the weight and size are more reduced. It is a 9.3 GHz magnetron with the most readily available RF generator in the X-band frequencies from 8 GHz to 12 GHz and the magnetron is mainly used for the source of the RF power in a compact LINAC. The average power of the magnetron at 9.3~GHz is generally a few MW and this amount could provide a sufficient radiation dose-rate for tumour therapy. KAERI has been developing a new compact 9.3 GHz X-band electron LINAC for a cancer treatment system. The maximum energy of the electron beam is 6 MeV and the average beam power at the tungsten target is about 1 kW. In this paper, we describe the status of development of the 6 MeV X-band LINAC at KAERI.

Development of accelerators for hadron therapy is one of JINR activities in the field of acceleration technique. The JINR-IBA collaboration has developed and constructed the C235-V3 cyclotron for Dimitrovgrad hospital center of the proton therapy. Proton transmission in C235-V3 from radius 0.3m to 1.03 m is 72% without beam cutting diaphragms, the extraction efficiency is 62%. The cyclotron was delivered in this center in 2012. The project of the medical carbon synchrotron together with superconducting gantry was developed in JINR. Carbon ion beams are effectively used for cancer treatment. The PET is the most effective way of tumor diagnostics. The radioactive carbon ion beam could allow both these advantages to be combined. JINR-NIRS collaboration develops formation of a primary radioactive ion beam for the scanning radiation and on line PET diagnostic. A superconducting cyclotron C400 was designed by the IBA-JINR collaboration. This cyclotron will be used for therapy with proton, helium and carbon ions.

A medical complex for carbon ion therapy has been developed in the JINR based on the own technology of the superconducting ion synchrotron - Nuclotron. One important feature of this project is related to the application of superconducting gantry. In the project, two schemes of superconducting gantries have been considered. In the first scheme, the last gantry element is supposed to be represented by a superconducting magnet with a scan region in it of 20 × 20 cm. In the second scheme the gantry consists of four 45°bending sections, each including two similar dipole magnets of a low aperture (about 120 mm). Such gantries are intended for multiple raster scanning with a wide carbon beam and the technique of layer wise irradiation with a spread out Bragg peak of several mm. The comparison and simulation of superconducting dipole magnet for JINR carbon ion gantry is under discussion.

The infrared undulator constructed at JINR and installed at FLASH in 2007 is used for longitudinal bunch shape measurements in the range of several tenths of μm. The presented below electromagnetic wiggler is applied for a narrow-band THz radiation for measurements of electron bunch longitudinal structure in FEL with electron energy of several tenths of MeV. This is a planar electromagnetic device with 6 regular periods, each of 30 cm long. The K parameter is varied in the range 0.5- 7.12 corresponding to a range B=0.025- 0.356 T of the peak field on axis. The wiggler is simulated for 19.8 MeV/c FEL. The bunch compression scheme allows the whole wavelength range to be covered by super-radiant emission with a sufficient form factor. The wavelength range corresponds to 126 μm - 5.3 mm for the electron beam momentum of 19.8 MeV/c. The 3D Opera simulations of THz wiggler will be discussed.

Radiation detectors based onμchannel plates (MCP) are planned for installation at the European XFEL. Main purpose of these detectors is searching a signature of lasing and further fine tuning of the FEL process. Detectors operate in a wide dynamic range from the level of spontaneous emission to the saturation level (between a few nJ and 25 mJ), and in a wide wavelength range from 0.05 nm to 0.4 nm for SASE1 and SASE2, and from 0.4 nm to 4.43 nm for SASE3. The SR tests validation of the MCP-based detector applied for XFEL lines SASE1 and SASE2 were performed at the DORIS beamline BW1 at SR with photon energy of 8.5-12.4 keV. The absolute measurements of a photon pulse energy for hard X-ray radiation were performed with application of MCP and photodiode detectors. Pulse-to-pulse photon energy measurements with MCPs and silicon photo detector were done with 192 ns and 96 ns repetition intervals. The SR beam imaging measurement at X-ray irradiation was performed at test validation experiments.

Possibilities of beam lines improvement for medical application at ITEP Accelerator Complex were observed. Existing beam lines were constructed for transport fast extracted proton beam with energy <230MeV from synchrotron U10 to three treatment rooms with fixed horizontal direction of targets irradiation. Scattering and collimation were used to distribute irradiation dose to the target volume. New beam lines are developed for transport of slow extracted proton (E<230MeV) or carbon (E<400MeV/n) beams from synchrotron UK to the same three treatment rooms and to experimental building. They will be equipped with scanning magnets. The fixed horizontal directions will be used in two rooms for treatment of special localizations in eye or head. To treat any targets from different directions compact “planar system” is developed covering irradiation directions of ±45 degrees to horizontal plane. Planar system can be used in two rooms. Main features of proposed beam lines are compared with existing and planned centers of therapy by proton and ion beams.

Angiography is one of the most reliable and contemporary procedure of the vascular system imaging. X-ray spectrums provided by all modern medical angiographs are too broad to acquire high contrast images and provide low radiation dose at the same time. The new method of narrow X-ray spectrum achieving is based on the idea of channelling radiation application. The X-ray filters used in this method allows eliminating the high energy part of the spectrum and providing dramatic dose reduction. The scheme of the facility including the X-ray filter is discussed. The results of the spectrum analysis for the channelling radiation source and typical angiography X-ray tube are discussed. Doses obtained by the water phantom and contrast of the iodine agent image are also provided for both cases.

A compact and light-weight electron linac is attractive for a number of medical applications including intra-operational and cyber-knife systems. The design of such an accelerator can nowadays be based on using of a powerful high-voltage high-frequency gyrotron which can provide now in pulsed regime a peak power up to 15 MW at the frequency about of 30 GHz. Taking into account this possibility, the paper presents the results of design and numerical simulations for the electron beam dynamics in a linac with the operating frequency of 27 GHz. Designed linac consists of two parts: gentle buncher and main accelerating section. The beam bunching is complicated at 1 cm wavelength because high energy about 2 MeV is necessary for beam injection into the main stage with v/c=1. Beam dynamics simulations are held using BEAMDULAC-BL code*. The electrodynamics of accelerating structure based on biperiodic structure is presented. The electron gun simulation is also discussed. The RF feeding is planned to be realized using a gyrotron to be designed in IAP RAS. The gyrotron is capable to produce 2 MW peak RF power in pulses with pulse duration 400 μs and repetition rate 10 Hz.

Gamma-sources with two-energy spectrum are used in industrial and medical diagnostics for quantitative introscopy (tomography). Commonly, such sources are obtained by a reactor technology (153Gd) or using an ultrastable X-ray tube with properly shaped spectrum of radiation. We suggested utilize the 179Ta isotope (Ex~ 55 keV, T1/2= 665 day) in combination with 57Co (Eγ=122 keV, T1/2=273 day). A soft technology for producing planar sealed 179Ta/57Co sources at an electron accelerator by X-ray irradiation of a target from natural tantalum and nickel was developed. The isotope yield and absorbed power of radiation in the target device vs electron beam energy were calculated using a modified transport code PENELOPE-2008. The results of experiment conducted to determine the yields of the target isotopes and by-products are in good agreement with the simulation data.

Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a binary cancer therapy particularly well-suited to treating aggressive tumours that exhibit a high degree of infiltration of the surrounding healthy tissue. Such tumours, for example of the brain and lung, provide some of the most challenging problems in oncology. The first element of the therapy is boron-10 which is preferentially introduced into the cancerous cells using a carrier compound. Boron-10 has a very high capture cross-section with the other element of the therapy, thermal neutrons, resulting in the production of a lithium nucleus and an alpha particle which destroy the cell they are created in. However, a large flux of neutrons is required and until recently the only source used was a nuclear reactor. In Birmingham, studies of an existing BNCT facility using a 2.8 MeV proton beam and a solid lithium target have found a way to increase the beam power to a sufficient level to allow clinical trials, while maintaining the target solid. In this paper, we will introduce BNCT, describe the work in Birmingham and compare with other accelerator-driven BNCT projects around the World.

We present a design for a 30~-~350~MeV scaling racetrack FFAG accelerator for medical application - NORMA (NOrmal-conducting Racetrack Medical Accelerator) - which utilises normal-conducting magnets. NORMA consists of 12 FDF triplet cells with a maximum drift length of  ∼ 2~m; an additional drift space inserted into two places forms a racetrack lattice with enough space for injection/extraction. Optimisation routines in PyZgoubi are used to find optimum cell parameters and working point.

The primary advantage of proton beam therapy as a cancer treatment is its ability to maximize the radiation dose delivered to the target volume and minimize the dose to surrounding healthy tissue, due to the inherently narrow Bragg peak at the end of the proton range. This can be further enhanced by imaging the target volume and surrounding tissues using proton Computed Tomography (pCT), which directly measures the energy loss from individual protons to infer the tissue density. Proton energies up to 330 MeV are required for pCT. We describe a superconducting gantry design which can deliver protons for both therapy and pCT with a similar size to existing treatment gantries. The use of ten identical combined-function superconducting dipole magnets minimizes the weight and technical development required. Based on experience with superconducting magnets for carbon gantries it should be possible to change the magnetic field sufficiently quickly to perform spot-scanning over successive layers without inducing quenching. It is envisaged that a combination of cryogenic cooling and cryogen-free cooling will be used to achieve the required operating temperature for the magnet windings.

The first prototype of RF gun based relativistic-energy electron microscopy has been constructed at Osaka University to study ultrafast structural dynamic processes in matter. The RF gun driven by a femtosecond laser has generated a 100-fs-pulse MeV electron beam with emittance of 0.1 mm-mrad and energy spread of 10-4. Both the electron diffraction and image measurements have been succeeded in the prototype using the femtosecond electron beam. In the diffraction measurement, an excellent quality of diffraction pattern was acquired with electron number of 106. The single-shot measurement is available in the prototype. In the image measurement, the TEM image was acquired with a total electron number of 108. The magnification was 3,000 times. In the next step, we will reduce further the emittance to increase the beam brightness on the sample, and then improve the spatial resolution to <10 nm.

Recently several tunnel collapses have happened in the world. To prevent this kind of accidents, the non-destructive inspection for tunnel is seriously needed. Backscattering X-ray system which makes one-side operation possible is a very important way to solve this problem. But the backscattering X-ray systems using X-ray tubes could only get the superficial information of the concrete target*. Now we are using our 950 keV X-ray source to construct the backscattering X-ray system to detect the deeper part of the concrete target.

The film irradiation complex “ALFA” dedicated to expose the polymer films used in the track membranes production was designed and manufactured by Joint Institute for Nuclear Research for “TRACKPORE TECHNOLOGY" holding company and put into operation in 2002 year in Dubna, Russia. The complex consists of the isochronous cyclotron CYTRACK with external injection of ions, the extraction system, the beam transport of accelerated ions and the film irradiation chamber. Cyclotron CYTRACK accelerates argon ions upto the energy - 2,4 МeV/nucleon, intensity of extracted beam is about 500nA, extraction efficiency totaled 50%. The complex “ALFA” products polyethylene terephthalate track membranes with less than 25 μm thickness and less than 40cm width. After ten years of the successful operation complex “ALFA” was upgraded. Vacuum, control and power supply systems were replaced. As a result the stability and efficiency of the operation of the equipment were increased.

Since 2009 year the LEPTA facility at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna is operated with positron beam. Today it is developed into two directions. The first one is getting orthopositronium flux in flight. Slow positrons from 22Na source are accumulated in Surko trap and then are injected into the ring where they should overlap with electrons from the single-pass electron beam. In this way the flux of orthopositronium atoms will appear and will be observed in the process of registration of gamma quanta from annihilation process. The second group of works focuses on using the positron injector for Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS) applications. This method is dedicated to detection of structural defects as vacancies in the solid body lattice. The latest progress of this technique is strictly connected with measurements of PAS characteristics using positron beams. The progress in the LEPTA development, the first results obtained in the PAS, idea and actual state of works concerning the construction of the pulsed positron beam will be presented. The creation of pulsed positron beams is the modern tendency in the PAS domain.

Experimental studies of neutron spectra of three different subcritical assemblies driven by an accelerator (Accelerator Driven Systems – ADS) for investigation of the possibility of transmutation and energy amplification have been carried out. The assemblies were constructed in the framework of the international project “Energy and Transmutation of Radioactive Wastes” and experiments with them are running in the Veksler and Baldin Laboratory of High Energy Physics of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) at the accelerator complex “Nuclotron”. In this paper the results of measurements of 239Pu(n, f), 235U(n, f), 238U(n, f) and 238U(n,γ) reactions cross-sections and reactions rates using solid state nuclear track detectors and activation gamma-spectroscopy are presented. A comparison of the experimental results with FLUKA calculations is given. The obtained experimental values characterize the neutron spectra in the experimental points and allow the efficiency of the ADS technology for the systems with similar parameters to be evaluated.

Nuclear power plant based on accelerator driven subcritical reactor (ADSR) is considered. Such systems demonstrate higher safety because the fission proceeds in subcritical core and necessary neutron flux is reached with external neutrons generated in target of heavy nuclides. In order to efficiently use ADSR for energy production, it’s needed the total power, generated in the reactor, to be greater than power inputs for charged particles acceleration. The plant driven by middle-energy accelerator, which is cheaper than high-energy accelerators, proposed for these purposes, is considered. So it’s necessary to find other ways to amplify reactor power outputs. Thus, the technical solution to increase power gain of small-sized power plant with a linear proton accelerator (energy 300-400 MeV, average current 5 mA) is proposed. Thermal power up to 300 MW was reached.

The current reliance on X-Rays and intelligence for national security is insufficient to combat the current risks of smuggling and terrorism seen on an international level. There are a range of neutron based security techniques which have the potential to dramatically improve national security. Neutron techniques can be broadly grouped into neutron in/neutron out and neutron in/photon out techniques. The use of accelerator based fusion devices will potentially enable to wide spread application of neutron security techniques due to the potential for much safer operation than that offered by fission or sealed tube sources. In this paper we discuss some of the neutron security techniques available and the advantages they present.

There is a growing interest in the use of neutrons for national security. The majority of work on security focuses on the use of either sealed tube DT fusors or fission sources, e.g. Cf-252. Fusion reactions enable the energy of the neutron beam to be chosen to suit the application, rather than the application being chosen based on the available neutron beam energy. In this paper we discuss simulations of fusion reactions demonstrating the broad range of energies available and methods for adapting the neutron beam energy produced by target/projectile combinations.

ELBE is based on a 40 MeV superconducting Electron Linac able to operate in CW mode and provides manifold secondary user beams. The suite of secondary beams include: two free electron lasers operating in the IR/THz regime; a fast neutron beam; a Bremsstrahlung gamma-ray beam; a low-energy positron beam; and patented single-electron test beams. The primary electron beam is also used for radiobiology research, or in interaction with ultra-intense PW-class lasers. Through 2014 ELBE will be upgraded to a Centre for High Power Radiation Sources. The ELBE beam current was increased to 1.6 mA by using novel solid state RF amplifiers. The concept also contains additional broad and narrow band coherent THz sources and the development of a 500 TW TiSa Laser and even a 1.5 PW diode pumped laser system. Laser plasma electron acceleration and proton acceleration experiments for medical applications are planned. Additionally, coupled electron laser beam experiments like Thomson scattering or injection of ELBE electron into the laser plasma will be done.

We present on overview of the STAR project (Southern european Thomson source for Applied Research), in progress at the Univ. of Calabria (Italy) aimed at the construction of an advanced Thomson source of monochromatic tunable, ps-long, polarized X-ray beams, ranging from 20 to 140 keV. The project is pursued in collaboration among: Univ. della Calabria, CNISM, INFN and Sincrotrone Trieste. The X-rays will be devoted to experiments of matter science, cultural heritage, advanced radiological imaging with micro-tomography capabilities. One S-band RF Gun at 100 Hz will produce electron bunches boosted up to 60 MeV by a 3m long S-band TW cavity. A dogleg will bring the beam on a parallel line, shielding the X-ray line from the background radiation due to Linac dark current. The peculiarity of the machine is the ability to produce high quality electron beams, with low emittance and high stability, allowing to reach spot sizes around 15-20 microns, with a pointing jitter of the order of a few microns. The collision laser will be based on a Yb:Yag 100 Hz J-class high quality laser system, synchronized to an external photo-cathode laser and to the RF system to better than 1 ps time jitter.

In laser produced plasma EUV source, high intensity pulse CO2 laser is essential for plasma generation. To achieve high conversion efficiency and stable EUV power, we desire to measure laser profile in collision point. However, focused laser profile has not been observed directory by existing techniques. We have been developing laser profiler based on laser Compton scattering. Laser profile can be measured by scanning focused electron beam while measuring Compton scattering signal. This method is suitable for a high intensity laser, but very small spot size of electron beam is required. To achieve small spot size, we use S-band photocathode rf gun and special design solenoid lens. The beam size was simulated by General particle tracer (GPT) and directory measured by Gafchromic film HD-810. We have succeeded in observing minimum beam size of about 20 μm rms. We are preparing beam scanning system, pulse CO2 laser and a detector for Compton signal. In this conference, we will report the results of focused electron beam measurement and future prospective.

The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a research centre based on the world’s most powerful neutron source currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, using 2.0 GeV, 2.86 ms long proton pulses at 14 Hz for the spallation facility (5MW on target). The possibility to pulse the linac at 28 Hz to deliver, in parallel with the spallation neutron production, a very intense, cost effective, high performance neutrino beam. The high current in the horns of the target system for the neutrino production requires proton pulses far shorter than the linac pulse. Therefore an accumulator ring is required after the linac to produce the shorter pulses. Charge exchange injection of an H− beam from the linac would be used. The Linac would deliver 1.1 1015 protons per pulse. Due to space charge limits, several rings or one ring re-filled several times during the neutrino cycle are necessary. A cost effective design of an accumulator that can handle this large number of ions will be shown, taking into account the structure of the linac pulse and the requirements of the target system. Beam dynamics issues, the injection system, the extraction and the distribution on the targets are addressed.

A number of methods for producing sub-picosecond electron bunches have been demonstrated in recent years. A train of these bunches is capable of generating THz radiation via multiple mechanisms like transition, Cherenkov and undulator radiation. We propose to use a bunch train like this to selectively excite a high order mode in a dielectric wakefield structure. This allows us to use wakefield structures that are geometrically larger and easier to fabricate for beam-based THz generation. In this paper we present a THz source design based on this concept and experimental progress to date.
