Ion Beam Therapy with Ions Heavier than Protons: Performance and Prospects
3654


 

U. Linz
                       FZJ, Jülich, Germany

 


 

Starting from a short discussion on the pros and cons of heavier ions for therapy, the presentation will concentrate on two aspects of the therapy with ions heavier than protons: technical equipment and choice of ion. As major components of an IBT facility, accelerator and gantry issues will dominate the part on equipment. Biophysical, medical, and economical considerations will be discussed in the part featuring the choice of the proper ion.

Ultrafast Electron Diffraction - Present Status and Future Advances
 


 

O.J. Luiten
                       TUE, Eindhoven, The Netherlands

 


 

In this review I will first discuss beam requirements for ultrafast electron diffraction, in particular the biggest challenge: what is needed for recording diffraction patterns of complex macromolecular crystals in a single, femtosecond shot. Subsequently I will discuss the present state of the art provided by bright photoemission guns, both non-relativistic DC guns and relativistic RF guns, in combination with RF bunch compression. Finally I will go into several more exotic methods that are being developed to achieve an even higher degree of spatial coherence and temporal resolution: sources based on laser plasma acceleration and ultracold sources based on photoionization of laser-cooled gases or on cryo-cooled semiconductors photocathodes.
