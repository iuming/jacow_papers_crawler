Harmonic seeding is a promising method for producing transform-limited FEL pulses in the soft x-ray region. While harmonic multiplication schemes extend seeding to shorter wavelengths, they also amplify the spectral phase errors of the initial seed laser, degrading the final pulse quality and decreasing longitudinal coherence. Here we consider the effect of seed laser phase errors on longitudinal coherence for high gain harmonic generation and echo-enabled harmonic generation. We develop simulations to confirm analytical results for the case of linearly chirped seed lasers, and extend the results for arbitrary seed laser envelope and phase.
