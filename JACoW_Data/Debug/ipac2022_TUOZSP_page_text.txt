Within the framework of the Future Circular Collider Feasibility Study, the design of the electron-positron collider FCC-ee is optimised, as a possible future double collider ring, currently foreseen to start operation during the 2040s. With close to 100 km of circumference and strong synchrotron radiation damping at highest beam energy, adequate beam measurements are needed to control the optics at the desired level. Various possible techniques to measure the optics in FCC-ee are explored, including the option of turn-by-turn measurements in combination with an AC-dipole.

Chromatic x-y coupling correction at the interaction point was carried out using skew sextupole field created by tilting the sextupole magnets in the SuperKEKB positron ring. Twenty four sextupole magnets are mounted on a tilting table and their tilt angles can be varied form - 30 degree to + 30 degree remotely to control the ratio of the skew to normal sextupole magnetic field components. In the 2021c run, one of the chromatic coupling parameters was varied using different setups of the tilting angles of the 24 sextupole magnets for the first time in a collider. It was found that the emittance growth at the primary (nux-nuy-nus=n) and secondary (nux-nuy-2nus=n) synchro-beta resonance lines can be controlled by tilting the sextupole magnets. Luminosity increase followed after optimizing the chromatic coupling parameters and finding a better tune working point. The study results are summarized in the paper.

Following the European Strategy process in 2019, five Roadmap Panels were set up to prepare the technologies needed for future accelerators and colliders: high-field magnets, SRF, muon colliders, plasma wakefield accelerators and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERLs). The ERL Roadmap Panel, consisting of ERL experts from around the world, first developed an overview of current and future ERLs. From this it was possible to carry out a gap analysis to see what R&D would be needed, from which the Roadmap could be developed. The European ERL Roadmap focused on three main aspects: 1) the continuation and development of facility programs for which no additional funds are needed, S-DALINAC in Darmstadt and MESA in Mainz; 2) technology development for room-temperature HOM damping and twin-axis SRF cavities; 3) the timely upgrade of bERLinPro for 100 mA current and the construction of PERLE at Orsay as a dedicated 10 MW power multi-turn facility. The roadmap entails a vision of future energy frontier electron-positron and electron-hadron collider and describes a high quality ERL program for 4.4 K SRF technology at high Q0. The presentation will address the ERL Roadmap process and result in detail.
