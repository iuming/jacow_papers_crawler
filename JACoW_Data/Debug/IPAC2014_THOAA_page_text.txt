A new bunch-by-bunch beam position measurement prototype system has been designed and built to monitor and analysis beam trip in the BEPCⅡ(Beijing Electron-Positron ColliderⅡ) machine. The fast ADC and programmable FPGA can obtain the beam information bunch-by-bunch, so we can analyze base on both time domain and frequency domain. In this paper we will presentation the system architecture and discuss some beam trip analysis result, such as beam instability, tune drifting, RF breakdown, and so on.

A low-latency, intra-train, beam feedback system utilising a cavity beam position monitor (BPM) has been developed and tested at the final focus of the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2) at KEK. A low-Q cavity BPM was utilised with custom signal processing electronics, designed for low latency and optimal position resolution, to provide an input beam position signal to the feedback system. A custom stripline kicker and power amplifier, and an FPGA-based digital feedback board, were used to provide beam correction and feedback control, respectively. The system was deployed in single-pass, multi-bunch mode with the aim of demonstrating intra-train beam stabilisation on electron bunches of charge ~ 1nC separated in time by c. 280ns. The system has been used to demonstrate beam stabilisation to below the 100nm level. Results of the latest beam tests, aimed at even higher performance, will be presented.

We will report the development of a new broadband (bandwidth of around 100MHz) feedback system for suppression of intra-bunch oscillations and reduction of particle losses at the J-PARC Main Ring (MR). A new BPM has been designed based on the exponential coupler stripline type (the diameter of 134 mm and the length of 300 mm) and it is now under fabrication. In this BPM system, the frequency characteristics are corrected using the equalizer as bunch signals are differentiated. The design detail and the performance of the new BPM as well as preparation of newly installed exciter and power amplifiers will be presented. We will also report beam test results of head-tail mode suppression at 3 GeV with the bunch length of 150-250 ns.
