Advanced technology innovations are disrupting our world, while eagerly making it more efficient and connected. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, big data and analytics, all with the need for cybersecurity. IoT is everywhere, in your homes, cars, labs and lives. Increased connectivity brings risk to the integrity of our scientific experiments, to the safety of humans in connected vehicles, and protection of connected healthcare devices and patients. We will discuss how to harness the power of advanced technology innovations, while securing the future, with a focus on TIPPSS - Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety and Security. Inclusion is an imperative for innovation, let’s harness advanced technology innovations and the diversity of our world to build our tomorrow…starting today.
