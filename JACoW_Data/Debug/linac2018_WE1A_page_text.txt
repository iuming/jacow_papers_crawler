PERLE is a proposed multi-pass Energy Recovery Linac, based on SRF technology, to be built at Orsay, France, in a collaborative effort between local laboratories LAL/IN2P3, IPNO/IN2P3 and international partners such as JLAB, STFC, Liverpool University, BINP and CERN. A part from experimental program, PERLE will serve as testbed to study a broad range of accelerator phenomena and to validate technical choices for the LHeC, which aims at electron proton collisions using the existing LHC machine together with an added electron ERL. In its final configuration, PERLE provides a 500 MeV electron beam using high current (20 mA) acceleration during three passes through 801.6 MHz cavities. This talk outlines the technological choices, the lattice design and describes the potential contributions of the interested partners.

A collaboration between Cornell University and Brookhaven National Laboratory has designed a novel accelerator and is constructing it at Cornell: CBETA, the Cornell-BNL ERL Test Accelerator. The ERL technology that has been prototyped at Cornell for many years is being used, including a DC electron source and an SRF injector Linac with world-record current and normalized brightness in a bunch train, a high-current linac cryomodule optimized for ERLs, a high-power beam stop, and several diagnostics tools for high-current and high-brightness beams. BNL has designed a multi-turn ERL and a recirculating linac for eRHIC; in both designs the beam is transported many times around the 4 km long RHIC tunnel. The number of transport lines is minimized by using two arcs with Fixed Field Alternating Gradient design. This technique will be tested in CBETA, which has a single return for the 4-beam energies with strongly-focusing permanent magnets of Halbach type. The high-brightness beam with 150 MeV and up to 40 mA will have applications for Electron Ion Colliders (EICs), e.g. for their electron cooling, and for applications in industry, in nuclear physics, and in X-ray science.

Continuous wave (CW) 100 mA electron rf gun for injecting high-quality 300-400 keV electron beam to the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) driving the Novosibirsk Free Electron Laser (FEL) was developed, built, and commissioned in a diagnostics beam line. The rf gun consists of normal conducting 90 MHz rf cavity with a gridded thermionic cathode unit. Tests of the rf gun confirmed its design performance in strict accordance with numerical simulations. The gun was tested up to the design specifications at a test bench that includes a diagnostics beam line. The design features of different components of the rf gun are presented. The commissioning experience is discussed. The latest beam results are reported.

The presentation will be on the design, construction and commissioning of the high power RF system for the European XFEL. The RF system consists of 26 high power RF stations each capable of 10MW RF pulse power. It will report on the overall system layout, cover RF system components e.g. klystrons, modulators and high power RF waveguide distribution. It will also cover system modifications during construction phase and report on commissioning results.

SwissFEL, the hard x-ray free-electron laser facility at PSI, is in an advanced commissioning phase. The commissioning of the 5.8 GeV Linac started in 2016 and the first FEL pilot-experiments were performed at a reduced beam energy in the end of 2017. In 2018, it is foreseen to progressively increase the electron beam energy and photon energy up to the maximum design values, interleaved by several FEL pilot experiments. This paper gives an overview of the commissioning progress including the achieved machine performance and first operational experience.

The KEK injector linac has delivered electrons and positrons for particle physics and photon science experiments for more than 30 years. It is planned to inject electron and positron beams with energies from 2.5 GeV to 7 GeV pulse-by-pulse at 50 Hz into the dual ring SuperKEKB collider and two light source storage rings. As the beam quality requirement from SuperKEKB is demanding, the beam orbit and optics conditions have to be maintained precisely. To that end 64 newly designed pulsed magnets were installed. Quadrupole magnets with the inductance of 1 mH are driven by power supplies with pulses up to 330 A and 0.5 ms, which recover the energy stored in coils up to 65%. Orbit corrector magnets with the inductance of 3 mH are driven with bipolar pulsed power supplies up to 10 A. Those power supplies are controlled under the event-based synchronized controls and monitored pulse-by-pulse, and are confirmed to have the stability over weeks within 0.1%. The details of the design and the operational performance will be reported.
