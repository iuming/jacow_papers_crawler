Status of JINR FLNR cyclotrons and plans of their modernization together with plans on creation of new facilities will be reported. At present, three cyclotrons: U400, U400M and IC100 and MT-25 microtron are under operation at the JINR FLNR. U400 and U400M are the basic FLNR facilities that both are under operation is about 12000 hours per year. The U400 (pole diameter of D=4 m) was designed to accelerate ions from B to Bi up to 19 MeV/u. U400 reconstruction is planned. The U400M cyclotron (D=4 m) is used to accelerate ions from Li to Xe up to 60 MeV/u. U400M modernization is planned. The IC100 accelerator (D=1m) is used for applied researches with Ar, Kr and Xe ions at energy of 1.2 MeV/u. Creation of the dedicated DC-130 cyclotron (D=2m) with ion energies of 4.5 and 2 MeV/u is planned on the base of U200 cyclotron. The Super Heavy Element Factory (SHE factory) is the new FLNR JINR project. The DC-280 cyclotron (D=4 m) is the basic facility of the SHE factory, which will accelerate ions with energies 4 - 8 MeV/u cyclotron at intensities up to 10 pmkA for ion masses over A=50. The main systems of the DC-280 were assembled and tested, the cyclotron is preparing for commissioning.
