Funding: Supported by the project Advanced research using high intensity laser produced photons and particles (ADONIS) CZ.02.1.01/0.0./0.0/16019/0000789 from European Regional Develepment Fund (ERDF).
In 2022 ELI Beamlines is a Petawatt-laser facility in a phase of maturing operations and late-stage commissioning: We have been providing open access to users to experimental hall E1 with five stations since 2019, and will significantly expand this offering in the upcoming months, while simultaneously completing installations as well as ramping up the performance of both the lasers and secondary sources. This contribution gives an overview of the control system environment, developments and status

At DESY, a technical design report is currently being prepared for the upgrade of the PETRA III synchrotron light source to PETRA IV, a fourth-generation low-emittance machine. Within the framework of this planned project, the accelerator control system is also to be renewed and adapted to the growing user requirements. This concerns on the one hand the core components of the control system itself, but also the hardware interfaces, the technical and beam physics control applications, the data acquisition and archiving systems, and the entire supporting IT infrastructure. The paper reports on the details of the proposed technical design concept.

Strategy for Modernizing a 40-Year-Old Accelerator Control System
6

Modernizing the Fermilab accelerator control system is essential to future operations of the laboratory’s accelerator complex. The existing control system has evolved over four decades and uses hardware that is no longer available and software that uses obsolete frameworks. The Accelerator Controls Operations Research Network (ACORN) Project will modernize the control system and replace end-of-life power supplies to enable future accelerator complex operations with megawatt particle beams. The project team is evaluating three design concepts, and the future deployment of artificial intelligence capabilities for accelerator operations is an important consideration. An overview of the ACORN Project will be presented, including R&D used for evaluating the conceptual designs in the context of requirements for future accelerator operations.
