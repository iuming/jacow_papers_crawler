The next generation light sources are to be compact, highly efficient, have high repetition rates and high-brilliance radiation pulses. To generate such a beam a high charge electron beam is required. Adding an energy recovery (ER) stage to improve efficiency leads to the appearance of beam break-up instabilities as the use of same or strongly coupled cavities in ER means that the positive feedback between electron's transverse momentum and the high order modes is readily established. The ultimate goal of the UH-FLUX project is to design a compact, efficient, a single turn [1] SRF ERL, capable of driving either source of THz or X-ray radiation. In the deceleration section most of the beam energy is extracted and guided through a resonant coupler back to acceleration section. The sections consist of the same number of cells, adjusted to insure that only the operating modes of both structures are fully overlapping [2]. It is expected that the ERL will be capable of generating fs, up to 1nC bunches of energies from 10MeV to 100MeV. We show (via analytical and numerical models) that in this case the regenerative BBU instability can be minimised allowing high currents to be achieved.

The Low-energy RHIC electron Cooler (LEReC) system has been approved to be build at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The electron cooling system will be able to deliver an electron beam of adequate quality in a wide range of electron beam energies (1.6-5 MeV). While existing electron coolers use a DC electron beam this will be the first application of using a bunched electron beam provided by an ERL, paving the way for future electron coolers at higher energies.

If constructed, the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) based on a Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) lattice proposed by Cornell University and Brookhaven National Laboratory would provide a unique opportunity to implement a variant of the MIT inverse Compton source concept.* Such a source could deliver an intense (6x1014 ph/sec), high repetition-rate (100MHz) beam of short pulses (0.05 – 2 ps) of hard x-rays (155 keV) with 1% bandwidth. We will review the generic design, major technical choices, and some potential scientific applications of such a x-ray facility.

Cornell University has prototyped technology essential for any high-brightness electron ERL, including a DC gun and an SRF injector Linac, a high-current CW cryomodule, a high-power beam stop, and diagnostics tools. All these are now available to equip a one-cryomodule ERL, and laboratory space for a 300MeV, 40mA ERL is available at Cornell. This beam of high current at moderate energies opens new experimental regimes for nuclear and high-energy physics. This presentation will discuss the 4-turn single-cryomodule ERL, space for detectors, and the internal target and optimal target densities for several experiments.
