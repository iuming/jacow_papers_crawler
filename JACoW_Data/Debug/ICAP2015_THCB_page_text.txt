We present 2D Synergia and WARP simulations of 2.5 MeV proton beams in the IOTA ring, including significant space charge tune depression. Results are presented for the underlying linear lattice and also with strong nonlinear magnets that are designed to impose strong tune shift with amplitude, while preserving one or two dynamical invariants. The two theoretical invariants are well-conserved in the zero current limit, but evolve in the presence of space charge. Consistent with earlier work, the short-time dynamics of any initial distribution involves rapid phase space filamentation to a quasi-stationary Vlasov equilibrium. Analytical calculations indicate that subsequent dynamics of the invariants will be diffusive over a longer time scale. The possible contribution of numerical effects to any such diffusion are quantified and minimized, and a comparison of numerical and theoretical predictions are presented.

In extremely high energy circular lepton collider correct consideration of synchrotron radiation (SR) is important for beam dynamics simulation. We developed fast, precise and effective method to track the paricles in the lattice (including nonlinearities) when the radiation effects - classical damping and quantum emittance excitation - are distributed along the beam orbit. As an example we study beam dynamics in the FCC-ee lepton collider which is now under development at CERN. Radiation effect on beam optics, dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance is discussed.

Theory and Simulation of Emittance Growth Caused by Space Charge and Lattice Induced Resonances

Emittance growth is caused by resonances under tune spread due to space charge force. Fixed point and resonance width characterize the resonace strangth and emittance growth. We discuss resonances induced by lattice nonlinearity and space charge force. Some resonances are induced by lattice errors; beta function devation from the design. Resonance strangth is evaluated by design and measured beta function.

Stationary Distributions in Cyclotrons with Higher Order Moments of the Charge Distribution

This paper covers the topic of finding matched, i.e. stationary, distributions for coasting beams that takes into account higher order moments of the charge distribution. We present a general approach based on Lie-Algebra and Truncated-Power-Series Algebra, where the non-linear space-charge maps up to k-th order are constructed. The physical input parameters are intensity, projected emittances, and the energy. Our general approach is firstly compared and benchmarked with the well-known linear theory applied to the PSI Injector-2 and the Ring Cyclotron. Secondly we compared the non-linear approach to PIC calculations. Open questions such as constraining the higher order moments will be discussed as well as applications beyond cyclotrons.
