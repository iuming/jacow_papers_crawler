The upgrade of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL to a diffraction limited storage ring (ALS-U) is an approved project that is currently in the conceptual design phase. There is a focused R&D program to develop critical components of the ALS-U design. The design includes swap-out on-axis injection with a fast stripline kicker as the key enabling technology. The development of the kicker and the associated pulser will be presented as well as results from installation and beam tests at the ALS.

Solid state amplifiers (SSA) are being increasingly used instead of electronic vacuum tubes to feed accelerating cavities with radio frequency power in the 100 kW range. Power is obtained from the combination of hundreds of transistor amplifier modules. The dramatic evolution of SSA technology will be presented and illustrated with a number of examples from existing accelerator applications at various frequencies.

The future synchrotron light facility in Thailand is in designing process, which has a goal to complete a detailed design report in 2018. The new light source will be a ring-based light source with the circumference of approximately 300m and an electron energy of 3GeV. The maximum beam current is 300mA with a beam emittance below 1.0 nm·rad. The accelerator is based on a full energy linac, which will utilize a S-band frequency structures. The RF system of the storage ring is based on 500MHz frequency. The EU-HOM damped cavity and the new SPring-8 design TM020 cavity is the choice of the storage ring cavity. The RF power transmitter can either be a high-power klystron (1 MW klystron) feed all RF cavities or a combination of low power IOTs or solid-state amplifiers feed each cavity. The high gradient S-band structure is considered as the main accelerating structure for linac. The RF power system for linac will base on klystron and a modular modulator. This paper presents details of RF systems options for this new light source project.
