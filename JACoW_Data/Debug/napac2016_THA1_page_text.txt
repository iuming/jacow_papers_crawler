This talk will present the summary of the latest progress in nitrogen doping and magnetic flux reduction strategies, starting from the knowledge of the basic phenomena developed via single cell cavities studies in vertical and horizontal cryogenic dewars and via advanced surface studies of samples, to the implementation in an actual large scale cryomodule. Results of studies of the quality factors as a function of cooldown details though critical temperature for the first LCLS2 prototype cryomodule will be presented.

The CEBAF accelerator at Jefferson Lab consists of an injector and two linacs connected by arcs. Each linac contains 25 cryomodules that are designed to deliver an integrated energy of 2.2 GeV per pass to an electron beam in order to meet 12 GeV energy requirements. Helium processing is a processing technique that is used to reduce field emission (FE) in SRF cavities. Helium processing of the 50 installed linac cryomodules was seen as necessary to support 12 GeV energy requirements. This paper will describe the processing procedure and summarize the results of this effort. Notice: Authored by Jefferson Science Associates, LLC under U.S. DOE Contract No. DE-AC05-06OR23177.

The magnet design of the MAX IV and Solaris 1.5 GeV storage rings replaces the conventional support girder + discrete magnets scheme of previous third-generation synchrotron radiation light sources with an integrated design having several consecutive magnet elements precision-machined out of a common solid iron block, with mechanical tolerances of ±0.02 mm over the 4.5 m block length. The production series of 12+12 integrated magnet block units, which was totally outsourced to industry, was completed in the spring of 2015, with mechanical and magnetic QA conforming to specifications. This article presents mechanical and magnetic field measurement results of the full production series.

Nb3Sn magnets with operating fields of 15-16 T are considered for the LHC Energy Doubler and a future Very High Energy pp Collider. Due to large coil volume, high critical current density and large superconducting (SC) filament size the persistent current effect is very large in Nb3Sn dipoles al low fields. This paper presents the results of analysis of the persistent current effect in the 15 T Nb3Sn dipole demonstrator being developed at FNAL, and describes different possibilities of its correction including passive SC wires, iron shims and coil geometry.

A conceptual design for a helical superconducting undulator (HSCU) for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has been completed. The device differs sufficiently from the existing APS planar superconducting undulator (SCU) design to warrant development of a new cryostat based on value engineering and lessons learned from the existing planar SCU. Changes include optimization of the existing cryocooler-based refrigeration system and thermal shield as well as cost reduction through the use of standard vacuum hardware. The end result is a design that provides significantly larger 4.2 K refrigeration margin in a smaller package for greater installation flexibility in the APS storage ring. This paper presents ANSYS-based thermal analysis of the cryostat, including estimated static and dynamic (beam-induced) heating, and compares the new design with the existing planar SCU cryostat.

Development of superconducting undulator (SCU) technology continues at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Experience of building and successful operation of the first short-length, 16-mm period length superconducting undulator SCU0 paved a way for the second 1-m long, 18-mm period device, SCU1, which is in operation since May 2015. The APS SCU team has also built and tested a 1.5-m long, 21-mm period undulator as a part of LCLS SCU R&D program aiming at demonstration of SCU technology availability for free electron lasers. This undulator successfully achieved all the requirements including a phase error of 5 degree rms. Our team is currently completing one more 1-m, 18-mm period undulator that will replace the SCU0. We are also working on a helical SCU for the APS. The status of these projects will be presented.
