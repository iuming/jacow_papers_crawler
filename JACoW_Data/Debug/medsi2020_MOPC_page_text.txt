Achieving photon beam stability, a critical property of modern synchrotron beamlines, requires a means of high resolution, non-invasive photon beam position measurement. While such measurement techniques exist for hard x-ray beamlines, they have yet to be achieved for soft x-ray beamlines. A new soft X-ray beam position monitor (SXBPM) design based on GaAs detector arrays is being developed and will be installed in the first optical enclosure of the Coherent Soft X-ray Scattering (CSX) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). The SXBPM assembly contains four water-cooled blade assemblies, each of which will have a GaAs detector assembly mounted within it, that can be inserted into the outer edges of the CSX undulator beam with sub-micron accuracy and resolution. The primary challenges in design of the SXBPM include: 1) mechanical stability of the assembly, 2) management of the heat load from the undulator x-ray beam to protect GaAs detector assemblies from unwanted illumination, 3) assembly compactness to fit within the first optical enclosure (FOE) of the CSX beamline, and 4) accessibility for modifications. Balancing the unique design requirements of the SXBPM along with their associated constraints has resulted in the design of a non-invasive beam position monitor which will be installed in the CSX FOE as a prototype for testing and iterative improvement. The ultimate goal is development of a widely useful SXBPM instrument for soft X-ray beamlines at high brightness synchrotron storage ring facilities worldwide. The following work seeks to present an overview of the current design of the SXBPM and an analysis of the challenges encountered and the proposed solutions by which they will be addressed.

The next generation light sources will require x-ray optical components capable of handling large instantaneous and average power densities while tailoring the properties of the x-ray beams for a variety of scientific experiments. Diamond being radiation hard, low Z material with outstanding thermal properties is proposed for front pre-focusing optics applications. Euclid Techlabs had been developing x-ray refractive diamond lens to meet this need. Standard deviation of lens shape error figure gradually was decreased to sub-micron values. Post-ablation polishing procedure yields ~ 10nm surface roughness. In this paper we will report on recent developments towards beamline-ready lens including packaging and compound refractive lens stacking. Diamond lens fabrication is done by femtosecond laser micromachining. We had been using this technology for customization of other beamline components. Several application cases will be highlighted in this presentation: diamond anvils, x-ray flow cells and in-beam mirrors.

The Instrumentation Development, Evaluation & Analysis Beamline (IDEA Beamline) will characterize the performance of the state-of-the-art X-ray optics and devices planned for the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U). The expected two orders of magnitude increase in brightness along with the increased power density due to the circular aspect ratio of the X-ray beam produced by the Multi-bend Achromat (MBA) magnetic lattice in the upgraded storage ring will set new demanding performance requirements on optical components. The upgrade offers a coherent source that many beamlines will utilize for proposed experimental studies, and it is essential that the chosen optics preserve the coherence of the X-ray beam from undulator to sample. The scientific goal of the IDEA Beamline is to obtain performance metrics for proposed beamline optics and components for the APS-U to ensure the best performance of both the planned featured beamlines and the enhanced beamlines. Questions being explored at the IDEA beamline are wavefront and coherence preservation, monochromator stability, optics surface quality, and effects of high heat loads on optical components. One of the objectives is to directly map monochromator vibration and crystal surface roughness to wavefront degradation. Currently the APS-U does not have a suitable testing location for X-ray optics and components that provides the necessary flux or brightness to simulate the planned APS-U source. The IDEA beamline fills this gap. Measurements will simulate the expected MBA upgraded operating conditions for the tested systems and the data obtained will be used to validate, optimize, or re-engineer for best possible performance.

An electronic autocollimator is a valuable tool that can assist in the alignment of optical beamline components such as mirrors and monochromators. It is also a powerful tool for in situ diagnoses of the mechanical behavior of such components. This can include the repeatability of crystals, gratings, and mirrors as they are rotated; the parasitic errors of these same optical elements as they are rotated and/or translated; and the repeatability and parasitic errors as bendable mirrors are actuated. The autocollimator can even be used to establish a secondary reference if such components require servicing. This paper will provide examples of such alignments, diagnoses, and references that have been made with an autocollimator on existing and recently commissioned beam-lines at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). In addition, this paper will discuss how this experience influenced the specifications and subsequent designs of the new primary high-heat-load mirror systems (PHHLMS) that are currently under fabrication for six of the APS Up-grade (APS-U) feature beamlines. Each mirror was specified to provide in situ line-of-sight access for an autocollimator to either the center of the mirror’s optical surface or to a smaller polished surface centered on the backside of each mirror substrate. This line of sight will be used for initial alignment of the mirror and will be available for in situ diagnoses if required in the future.

A novel design for a weldable copper chromium zirconium (CuCrZr) mask has been developed for use in Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APSU) beamlines. In the past, welding has been avoided for CuCrZr; however, the approach this alternative utilizes promises to drastically reduce cost and lead time over traditional brazed CuCrZr and welded Glidcop mask designs. Multiple thermal analyses of the mask have predicted that it will meet required mechanical and thermal requirements suitable for high heat load applications. As of the writing of this paper, a prototype is being fabricated for installation and testing on the 28-ID Coherent High Energy X-ray (CHEX) beamline.

Beam collimation is crucial to maintaining machine and personnel safety during LCLS-II operation. The high density of optics and beam transport components needed to steer the beam to multiple beam lines places a premium on compact collimator design. This presentation discusses a compact collimator consisting of an X-ray beam power collimator, a burn through monitor (BTM) designed to detect failure of the X-ray beam collimator, and a Bremsstrahlung collimator. The collimator body is a monolith machined from CuCrZr (C18150) that eliminates costly braze operations and reduces assembly time and complexity. Sintered high thermal conductivity SiC is employed as the X-ray absorber with design provisions incorporated to permit the inclusion of additional absorbers (e.g. diamond). The allowed FEL beam power is limited to 100W. Finite element analyses ensure that the power absorber remains in safe temperature and stress regimes under the maximum power loading and smallest expected beam dimensions. The beam power will be limited via credited controls placed on the electron beam. Beam containment requirements stipulate the inclusion of a monitor to detect burn through events owing to absorber failure. The BTM is a gas-filled, thin wall vessel which, if illuminated by the beam, will burn through and release the contained gas and trip pressure switches that initiate beam shutdown. The beam absorber and BTM shadow the Bremsstrahlung collimator shielding after appropriate propagation of manufacturing, assembly, and installation tolerances. Tooling is developed to minimize assembly complexity and ensure minimal alignment errors.

The In Situ Nanoprobe (ISN, 19-ID) beamline will be a new best-in-class long beamline to be constructed as part of the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) project*,**. To achieve long working distance at high spatial resolution, the ISN instrument will be positioned 210 m downstream of the x-ray source, in a dedicated satellite building, currently under construction***. The ISN instrument will use a nano-focusing Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirror system, which will focus hard x-rays to a focal spot as small as 20 nm, with a large working distance of 61 mm. The large working distance provides space for various in situ sample cells for x-ray fluorescence tomography and ptychographic 3D imaging, allows the use of a separate, independent vacuum chambers for the optics and sample, and provides the flexibility to run experiments in vacuum or at ambient pressure. A consequence of the small spot size and large working distance is the requirement for high angular stability of the KB mirrors (5 nrad V-mirror and 16 nrad H-mirror) and high relative stability between focus spot and sample (4 nmRMS). Additional features include fly-scanning a maximum of a 2 kg sample plus in situ cell at 1 mm/s in vertical and/or horizontal directions over an area of 10 mm x 10 mm. Environmental capabilities will include heating and cooling, flow of fluids and applied fields, as required for electrochemistry and flow of gases at high temperature for catalysis. To achieve these features and precise requirements we have used precision engineering fundamentals to guide the design process. We will discuss in detail the current design of the instrument focusing on the precision engineering used to achieve the stability, metrology, and positioning requirements.

The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade storage ring arc vacuum system features a diverse set of photon beam-intercepting components, including five discrete photon absorbers and a series of small-aperture vacuum chambers that shadow downstream components. The discrete photon absorbers, typically fabricated from electron beam-welded GlidCop AL-15, are subject to heat loads ranging from approximately 170 to 3400 watts, with a peak power density up to approximately 610 W/mm2 at normal incidence. Four of the five photon absorber designs are housed in vacuum chambers, including three that are mounted to the antechambers of curved aluminum extrusion-based L-bend vacuum chambers and one that is mounted to a stainless steel vacuum-pumping cross. Furthermore, two of the photon absorbers that are mounted to L-bend vacuum chambers are equipped with position-adjustment mechanisms, which are necessitated by the challenging design and fabrication of the curved vacuum chambers. The fifth photon absorber, unlike the rest, is a brazed design that is integral in sealing the vacuum system and intercepts approximately 170 watts. Each photon absorber design was optimized with thermal-structural finite element analyses while ensuring functional and spatial requirements were met. Some of these requirements include meeting internal high-heat-load component design criteria, respecting challenging component interfaces and alignment requirements, and minimizing impedance effects. Furthermore, photon beam scattering effects called for the use of scattering shields on three designs to minimize potential heating of vacuum chambers. This paper details the careful balance of functionality and manufacturability, and the overall design process followed to achieve the final designs.

A new magnetic measurement system is under construc-tion at BNL for accurate field harmonic measurements and fiducialization of magnets for a future upgrade of the NSLS- II storage ring. The entire storage ring is envi-sioned to be replaced with a new lattice concept, known as Complex Bend, which superimposes dipole and high-gradient quadrupole fields. The magnetic measurement system will use rotating wire and a PCB rotating coil specifically designed for small-aperture (< 15 mm) high gradient magnets. In this paper we describe in detail the mechanical design and the data acquisition hardware and software.

The designs of various girder support systems were reviewed recently in a MEDSI School tutorial*. A comparison of their horizontal transmissibility values in (2-100) Hz band showed that the NSLS-II girder support system had a lower horizontal transmissibility despite its first natural frequency being the lowest (~30 Hz). Detailed vibration tests and FE analyses have been performed to understand this anomaly and to assess the role of viscoelastic damping pads underneath the NSLS-II girders. The analyses were extended to include harmonic response to model viscoelastic properties and random vibrations to obtain relative motions between the magnets. The results of these new tests and FE analyses are discussed in this paper.

The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) storage ring arc consists of a diverse system of nar-row-aperture chambers in compact magnet assemblies with gaps often less than 1 mm. The vacuum system contains two stainless steel pumping crosses and two keyhole-shaped vacuum chambers, as well as eight non-evaporative getter (NEG) coated aluminum cham-bers and crosses per sector (40 total sectors). Each chamber contains a 22 mm diameter electron beam aperture and the keyhole components also feature a photon extraction antechamber. Each design balances functionality, manufacturability, and installation needs. The design process was aided by a flexible CAD skeleton model which allowed for easier adjustments. Synchrotron radiation heat loads applied to inline chamber photon absorbers and photon extraction beam envelopes were determined via a 3D ray tracing CAD model. The inline photon absorber and the key-hole shapes were optimized using iterative thermal-structural FEA. Focus was put on mesh quality to mod-el the <0.5 mm tall synchrotron radiation heat load absorbed across the length of the chamber to verify cooling parameters. The design process also required careful routing of the water system and vacuum pumps. The designs incorporate beam physics con-straints of the inline absorbers, cross-housed discrete absorbers, and pumping slots.

The Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U) is an ongoing upgrade of the ALS facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The project utilizes an on-axis swap-out injection between a new Storage Ring (SR) and a full-energy Accumulator Ring (AR) to enable small dynamic apertures to deliver higher brightness. The ALS-U injection scheme plans to use a pulsed stripline kicker design based off of a successful research and development kicker that was installed on the existing ALS Storage Ring. A key challenge in the ALS-U Swap-out kicker is optimizing the distance between the electrodes to balance the benefits of tight spacing to lower required pulser voltage and the challenges to the mechanical design that comes from higher electrode thermal expansion due to increased synchrotron and beam induced heating. Structural and thermal analysis shows that adapting high emissivity coatings, an accommodating mechanical supports design and using molybdenum as an electrode material provide a robust solution.

The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) accelerator magnets have stringent stability requirement*. The project schedule and budget did not allow for full prototyping of the final design. Therefore, the engineers relied on accurate simulation to ensure that the design would meet the specifications. Recently, assembly and free-boundary vibration tests have been done on the first article of the upstream quadrupole Doublet, Longitudinal gradient dipole and Multipole module (DLM-A). The top surface flatness of the girder and the magnet alignment measurement results demonstrate the static positioning requirement of magnet-to-magnet is met. The free-boundary condition modal test results were used to validate the FEA analysis used in the DLM-A design. This validation then confirms the predicted performance of the magnet support system design. Mode shapes and corresponding frequencies from the FEA modal analysis agree with the experimental modal analysis within an acceptable tolerance. The validation approves not only the procedure for accurate modeling of magnet support system that APS-U has developed, but also provides confidence in predicting the accelerator performance.
