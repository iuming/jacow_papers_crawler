Deflecting RF Structures find now applications for the bunch rotation with the purposes of diagnostic for the longitudinal distribution, emittance exchange and for the luminosity improvements in colliders. Report describes results of R&D program for development of deflectors with minimized level of aberrations in the distribution of deflecting field. Such structures, applied for bunch rotation along transverse axis, provide much smaller emittence growth, as compared to another options. In comparison with classical and widely used deflectors, based on disk loaded waveguide, developed structures have, depending on modification, in 2-6 times higher RF efficiency. Structures can operate both in Traveling Wave (TW) and in Standing Wave (SW) modes. To create long RF cavities for SW operation, compensated (bi-periodical) options are developed, combining field stability and high RF efficiency. The problem of stabilization for the plane of deflection is removed due to essentially 3D geometry. The main solutions for such structures development are described and achieved parameters are reported.
