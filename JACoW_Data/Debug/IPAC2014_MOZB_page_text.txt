This talk reviews advances in photocathode technology for accelerators: cathodes demonstrating record average currents and deliverable charge, possessing ultra-low intrinsic emittance and sub-picosecond response time. It addresses the grand challenge to combine all these useful properties into a single photoemitter - one that is being actively pursued by the research community.
