The Z Machine is the world's largest pulsed power machine, routinely delivering over 20 MA of electrical current to targets in support of US nuclear stockpile stewardship and in pursuit of inertial confinement fusion. The large-scale, multi-disciplinary nature of experiments ('shots') on the Z Machine requires resources and expertise from disparate organizations with independent functions and management, forming a Collaborative System-of-Systems. This structure, combined with the Emergent Knowledge Processes central to preparation and execution, creates significant challenges in planning and coordinating required activities leading up to a given experiment. The present work demonstrates an approach to scheduling planned activities on shot day to aid in coordinating workers among these different groups, using minimal information about activities' temporal relationships to form a Simple Temporal Network (STN). Historical data is mined, allowing a standard STN to be created for common activities, with the lower bounds between those activities defined. Activities are then scheduled at their earliest possible times to provide participants a time to check-in when interested.

KEK injector linac has delivered electrons and positrons for particle physics and photon science experiments for more than 30 years. It is being upgraded for the SuperKEKB project, which aims at a 40-fold increase in luminosity over the previous project of KEKB, in order to increase our understanding of flavour physics. This project requires ten-times smaller emittance and five-times larger current in injection beam from the injector. And many hardware components are being tested and installed. Even during the 6-year upgrade, it was requested to inject beams into light sources storage rings of PF and PF-AR. Furthermore, the beam demanding approaches from those storage rings are different. SuperKEKB would demand highest performance, and unscheduled interruption may be acceptable if the performance would be improved. However, light sources expect a stable operation without any unscheduled break, mainly because most users run experiments for a short period. In order to deal with the both requirements several measures are taken for operation, construction and maintenance strategy including simultaneous top-up injections.

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) complex of accelerators at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) operates using a large distributed controls system, consisting of approximately 1.5 million control points, over 430 VME based control modules, and thousands of server processes. We have developed a new testing platform that can be used to improve code reliability and help streamline the code development process by adding more automated testing. The testing platform simulates the control system using the actual controls system code base but by redirecting the I/O to simulated interfaces. In this report, we will describe the design of the system and the current status of its development.

The ASTRI SST-2M telescope is a prototype proposed for the Small Size class of Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The ASTRI prototype adopts innovative solutions for the optical system, which poses stringent requirements in the design and development of the Telescope Control System (TCS), whose task is the coordination of the telescope devices. All the subsystems are managed independently by the related controllers, which are developed through a PC-Based technology and making use of the TwinCAT3 environment for the software PLC. The TCS is built upon the ALMA Common Software framework and uses the OPC-UA protocol for the interface with the telescope components, providing a simplified full access to the capabilities offered by the telescope subsystems for normal operation, testing, maintenance and calibration activities. In this contribution we highlight how the ASTRI approach for the design, development and implementation of the TCS has made the prototype a stand-alone intelligent and active machine, providing also an easy way for the integration in an array configuration such as the future ASTRI mini-array proposed to be installed at the southern site of the CTA.

Control systems of large experimental facilities need a great number of heterogeneous interconnected parameters to control software applications. As configuration information grows in volume, it becomes harder to be maintained manually and poses a potential threat to data integrity. To tackle this problem, we applied ontological approach to storing configuration data. Ontology is a formal representation of concepts and relations of the domain of discourse, enriched by rules for inferring assumed knowledge. We designed the ontology that describes the controlling electronics for the double-direction bipolar transfer line K-500, which transports beam from the Injection Complex to colliders VEPP-4 and VEPP-2000 at BINP, Novosibirsk, Russia. We populated the ontology by importing data from existing configuration files of the control system and developed the interface for querying configuration data. The designed storage has several benefits over the conventional approaches. It maintains heterogeneous objects with non-trivial dependencies in centralized form, performs data verification and can be expanded to the diverse ontology describing all information about the facility.

The ELI Beamlines facility is a Petawatt laser facility in the final construction and commissioning phase in Prague, Czech Republic. The central control system connects and controls more than 40 complex subsystems (lasers, beam transport, beamlines, experiments, facility systems, safety systems) with hundreds of cameras. For this, a comprehensive set of standard solutions is provided: Hardware interface standards guarantee ad-hoc software integration, for commonly used models, standardised auxiliary hardware (triggering: optical/TTL, power supplies) is available. Information on key parameters (vacuum compatibility, noise levels) is collected. 95% of cameras are interfaced using an vendor-independent C+±SDK. Exceptions are only made for special detectors (for example: wavefront sensors, x-ray cameras). By using a strict model-based approach and a component-based design, all cameras and 2D-detectors can be controlled with the same C+±API. This leads to standardized GUIs, TANGO-servers,..

In X-ray experimental stations at SPring-8, beamline staff and experimental users sometimes need to reconfigure the measurement system for new experiments. Quick reconfiguration for the system is required and this resulted in elaborated work. Aim of DARUMA is to provide standardized procedure for constructing a flexible system of the data collection and control system for experimental stations. It utilizes the control framework MADOCA II* developed for the distributed control of accelerators and beamlines at SPring-8. Unified control procedure with abstracted text-based messaging helps to reduce significant time and cost for preparing the measurement system. DARUMA provides the applications for 2D detectors such as PILATUS, pulse motor and trigger system used in stations. Image data are collected with metadata into NoSQL database, Elasticsearch. Analysis tools for image such as online monitoring and offline analysis are also provided. User applications can be easily developed with Python and LabVIEW. DARUMA can be flexibly applied to experimental stations and is being implemented into BL03XU at SPring-8. We are also planning to introduce it into other experimental stations.

LCLS-II's high beam rate of almost 1MHz and the requirement that several "high-performance" systems (such as MPS, BPM, LLRF, timing etc.) shall resolve individual bunches precludes the use of a traditional software based control system but requires many core services to be implemented in FPGA logic. SLAC has created a comprehensive open-source firmware framework which implements many commonly used blocks (e.g., timing, globally-synchronized fast data buffers, MPS, diagnostic data capture), libraries (Ethernet protocol stack, AXI interconnect, FIFOs, memory etc.) and interfaces (e.g., for timing, diagnostic data etc.) thus providing a versatile platform on top of which powerful high-performance systems can be built and rapidly integrated.

A new VME-based crate and modules are presented in this work. This hardware is primarily intended for LIA-20 control system, but we also plane to use it for the upgrade of the controls of existing complexes such as: VEPP-2000, VEPP-4, VEPP-5 Preinjector. Modules were designed with an ability to be used planned projects such as Super c-tau factory. A crate is 6U VME64x compatible crate with additional synchronization, daisy-chain lines and 6U RIO-modules. Each crate has a built-in status monitoring over CAN-BUS with independent power supply. A family of VME modules is based on the same design sample and include: digitizers, timing modules, CAN-interface module, interlock module. All modules are cost effective and have TANGO device servers developed for them.
