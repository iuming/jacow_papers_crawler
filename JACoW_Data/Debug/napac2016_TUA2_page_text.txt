It is the aim of the AWAKE project at CERN to demonstrate the acceleration of electrons in the wake created by a proton beam passing through plasma. The proton beam will be modulated as a result of the transverse two-stream instability into a series ofμbunches that will then drive strong wakefields. The wakefields will then be used to accelerate electrons with GV/m strength fields. The AWAKE experiment is currently being commissioned and first data taking is expected this year. The status of the experimental program is described as well as first thoughts on future steps.

We report on recent Two-Beam-Acceleration (TBA) experiments conducted at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility (AWA), which used 70 MeV electron bunches to accelerate a 0.5 nC witness bunch in gradients of up to 150 MV/m. The wakefields were generated by the passage of the 15 - 45 nC drive bunches through iris-loaded metallic structures operating at 11.7 GHz. No indication of witness beam quality degradation was observed, and bunch charge was preserved during the acceleration process. Another series of experiments was conducted using two TBA stages, demonstrating acceleration of the witness beam in these two subsequent stages by means of two independent drive bunch trains.

A novel concept of a high-power magnetron transmitter allowing dynamic phase and power control at the frequency of locking signal is proposed. The transmitter compensating parasitic phase and amplitude modulations inherent in Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities within closed feedback loops is intended for powering of the intensity-frontier superconducting accelerators. The concept uses magnetrons driven by a sufficient resonant (injection-locking) signal and fed by the voltage which can be below the threshold of self-excitation. This provides an extended range of power control in a single magnetron at highest efficiency minimizing the cost of RF power unit and the operation cost. Proof-of-principle of the proposed concept demonstrated in pulsed and CW regimes with 2.45 GHz, 1kW magnetrons is discussed here. A conceptual scheme of the high-power transmitter allowing the dynamic wideband phase and mid-frequency power controls is presented and discussed.

A 1.5 MW, 110 GHz gyrotron is used to produce a linearly polarized quasioptical beam in 3 μs pulses. The beam is concentrated in vacuum to produce strong electric fields on the surfaces of dielectric and metallic samples, which are being tested for breakdown threshold at high fields. Dielectrics are tested in the forms of both windows, with electric fields parallel to the surface, and sub-wavelength dielectric rod waveguides, with electric fields perpendicular to the surface. Currently, visible light emission, absorbed/scattered microwave power, and vacuum pressure diagnostics are used to detect discharges on dielectric surfaces. Future experiments will include dark current diagnostics for direct detection of electrons. Dielectrics to be tested include crystal quartz, fused quartz, sapphire, high resistivity float-zone silicon, and alumina. Metallic accelerator structures will also be tested in collaboration with SLAC. These tests will require shortening of the microwave pulse length to the nanosecond scale.
