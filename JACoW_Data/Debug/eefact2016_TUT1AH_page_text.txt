The design of the interaction region is one of the most important issue in SuperKEKB. The lattice design with the final focus system and the local chromaticity correction as well as the dynamic aperture under the influence of beam-beam interactions are presented.

The CEPC is a proposed circular electron positron collider to study the Higgs boson more accurately. To make sure the machine works well, the compatibility of the machine and the detector is very important. In order to make sure the detector is compatible with the machine, two kinds of problems must be resolved. Firstly, the mutual influence between the machine and the detector must be well studied. It includes the beam induced background, the influence on the beam status from the detector solenoid field and so on. Secondly, the interface between the machine and the detector must be well designed, including the mechanical supporting, the procedure to assemble the interaction region and so on. In this talk, we present the recent progress of the IR design and MDI study of CEPC. The dominant sources of beam induced background have been studied and some preliminary results are obtained. The compensating solenoid and anti-solenoid will be used to suppress the influence on the beam status from the detector solenoid. A global design of the interaction region is undergoing to balance the conflict of performance between the machine and the detector.

The design of the region close to the interaction point of the FCC-ee experiments is especially challenging. The beams collide at an angle (±15 mrad) in the high-field region of the detector solenoid. Moreover, the very low vertical beta' of the machine necessitates that the final focusing quadrupoles have a distance from the IP (L') of around 2 m and therefore are inside the main detector solenoid. The beams should be screened from the effect of the detector magnetic field, and the emittance blow-up due to vertical dispersion in the interaction region should be minimized, while leaving enough space for detector components. Crosstalk between the two final focus quadrupoles, only about 6 cm apart at the tip, should also be eliminated.

Designing eRHIC Interaction Region (IR) magnets faces special Machine Detector Interface challenges. Based upon HERA-II experience, a fundamental consideration is to avoid excessive background due to synchrotron radiation striking masks and septa in the vicinity of the experiment. Circumventing such radiation is problematic because the colliding beams have quite different rigidities; we must shield the e-beam from hadron IR magnet multi-tesla coil fields. On the outgoing-hadron, i.e. forward IR side, this difficulty is compounded by needing large hadron beam apertures to enable downstream separation and experimental detection of a mix of scattered and produced forward going charged particles and (in the electron-ion case) a wide-spread cone of neutrons. We adopt sweet spot, active shielding and passive shielding in designing magnets for two IR solutions. To study performance/risk tradeoff, BNL explores both the linac-ring and ring-ring design options. Linac-ring uses a multi-pass energy-recovery linac for the polarized e-beam; ring-ring injects polarized electrons into a full-energy storage ring. The corresponding beam parameters drive IR optimization to two different solutions.
