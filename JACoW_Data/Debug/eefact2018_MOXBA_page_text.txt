The physics program at the Future Circular Colliders is summarised. The synergy and complementarity between the leptonic FCC-ee collider and the hadronic FCC-hh collider are discussed. The foreseen improvements on Higgs measurements are presented using the data from both the leptonic and the hadronic FCC machines . The improvements obtainable on several searches for physics beyond SM are discussed. The possibilities presented by the FCC-eh machine are also briefly shown.
