China ADS project is lunched in 2011 by CAS (Chinese Academy Science), which aims to solve the nuclear waste disposition problem. The Injector as a demonstrated facility composed by RFQ cavity, superconducting cavities has been installed on-line and commissioned from June 2014. Proton beam has been accelerated to 5 MeV at CW operation mode successfully. More than 25kW proton beam has been operated stable for one hour, which is the highest record among the same type linacs. In this paper, the commissioning issues and results for high beam power superconducting linac will be presented in detail.

The RISP (Rare Isotope Science Project) has been proposed as a multi-purpose accelerator facility for providing beams of exotic rare isotopes of various energies. It can deliver ions from proton to uranium. Proton and uranium ions are accelerated up to 600 MeV and 200 MeV/u respectively. The facility consists of three superconducting linacs of which superconducting cavities are independently phased. Requirement of the linac design is especially high for acceleration of multiple charge beams. In this paper, we present the RISP linac design, the prototyping of superconducting cavity and cryomodule.

The High Charge State Injector (HochLadungsInjektor) HLI was commissioned in 1991. It was the first linac comprising of a Radio Frequency Quadrupole RFQ and an Interdigital H-Type cavity IH. For more than twenty years, it successfully provided essential heavy ion beams with high duty cycle for several lighthouse experiments and developments at GSI. Among them are the Super Heavy Element Research SHE, namely the experiments SHIP, TASCA, SHIPTRAP, and the heavy ion cancer therapy. Three out of the six transuranium elements found at GSI were discovered with ion beams from the HLI. The ever increasing demand for beam intensity was met by the proposal of a SuperConducting Continuous Wave sc cw-Linac. As the HLI will serve as an injector for this new accelerator, a cw upgrade for the HLI was developed.
