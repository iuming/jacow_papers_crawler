The first proton run of the LHC was very successful and resulted in important physics discoveries. It was followed by a two-year shutdown where a large number of improvements were carried out. In 2015, the LHC was restarted and this second run aims at further exploring the physics of the standard model and beyond at an increased beam energy. This article gives a review of the performance achieved so far and the limitations encountered, as well as the future challenges for the CERN accelerators to maximize the data delivered to the LHC experiments in Run 2. Furthermore, the status of the 2016 LHC run and commissioning is discussed.

The main ring (MR) of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) has been providing 30-GeV proton beams for elementary particle and nuclear physics experiments since 2009. The beam power of 390 kW has been recently achieved with 2·1014 protons per pulse and the cycle time of 2.48 s for the neutrino oscillation experiment. Main efforts in the beam tuning are to minimize beam losses and to localize the losses at the collimator section. Recent improvements include the 2nd harmonic rf operation to reduce the space charge effect with a larger bunching factor and corrections of resonances near the operation setting of the betatron tune. Because the beam bunches were longer with the 2nd harmonic rf operation, the injection kicker system was improved to accommodate the long bunches. We plan to achieve the target beam power of 750 kW in 2018 by making the cycle time faster to 1.3 s with new power supplies of main magnets, rf upgrade and improvement of injection and extraction devices. The possibility of the beam power beyond 750 kW is being explored with new settings of the betatron tune.

Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) is the centerpiece of Fermilab’s plan for upgrading the accelerator complex to establish the leading facility in the world for particle physics research based on intense proton beams. PIP-II has been developed to provide 1.2 MW of proton beam power at the start of operations of the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE), while simultaneously providing a platform for eventual extension of LBNE beam power to >2 MW and enabling future initiatives in rare processes research based on high duty factor/higher beam power operations. PIP-II is based on the construction of a new, 800 MeV, superconducting linac, augmented by improvements to the existing Booster, Recycler, and Main Injector complex. PIP-II is currently in the development stage with an R&D program underway targeting the front end and superconducting rf acceleration technologies. This paper will describe the status of the PIP-II conceptual development, the associated technology R&D programs, and the strategy for project implementation.
