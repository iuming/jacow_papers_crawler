The cooling methods in particle accelerator technologies has already longstanding history that has been began by Gersh Budker in 1966 and is under intense and active development since that time and up to now. Further still, more and more novel ideas of both principle and technological character appear continually. In this review paper the history of cooling methods creation, present status of the methods, future projects with cooling methods application, trends in their development and some novel ideas are briefly presented.

The RHIC luminosity increase with bunched beam stochastic cooling is reviewed. Most notably, during 2012 with uranium beams, we observed a tripling of instantaneous luminosity and a 5 fold increase in integrated luminosity.
