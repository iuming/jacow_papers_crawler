A 100-MeV proton linear accelerator at the KOMAC (Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex) was under development for past 15 years, including preliminary design study period, and was successfully commissioned in 2013. The operation of the linac for user service started in July 2013 with two beam lines: one for a 20-MeV beam and the other for a 100-MeV beam. The linac is composed of a 50-keV microwave proton source, a 3-MeV four-vane-type RFQ (radio-frequency quadrupole) and a 100-MeV DTL (drift tube linac). In 2015, the linac operating time was more than 2,800 hours with an availability of better than 89% and unscheduled downtime was about 73 hours, mainly due to the ion source and HVCM problems. More than 2,100 samples from various fields such as material science, bio and nano technology and nuclear science, were treated in 2015. Currently, additional beamline for radioisotope production is being commissioned and a new beamline for low-flux irradiation experiments are under construction along with a continuous effort being made to increase the average beam power.

The heavy ion linac UNILAC at GSI will be upgraded in order to meet the beam requirements imposed by the upcoming FAIR facility. This upgrade includes several innovative techniques and applications. They comprise a new gaseaous stripper with enhanced efficiency, full 4d transverse emittance measurements, a round-to-flat beam adaptor, asymmetric transverse focusing along the new Alvarez DTL, optimized shape of the drift tube surface w.r.t. shunt impedance per surface field, and a field stabilization and tuning scheme without post-couplers. Additionally, we report on development of a super-conducting cw linac for intermediate mass ions which will be dedicated to production of super heavy elements close to the Coulomb barrier.

In the last years the SARAF 176 MHz 3.8 m long 4-rod RFQ accelerates routinely 2-4 mA CW proton beams to 1.5 MeV for basic studies in physics. However, it has not been successful in running CW deuteron beam for long periods. The findings imply that the RF coupler is the bottle neck to reach 250 kW CW dissipated power, equivalent to 65 kV inter-rod voltage, required to run the CW deuteron beam. A new design that splits the RFQ power between two couplers was built and commissioned successfully. A 3dB splitter and two new RF couplers were installed. The RF couplers improved design allows better brazing methods, vacuum properties and RF sealing. This design is innovative from two points of view: (a) implementation of two synchronized couplers located in two separated RF cells in a 4-rod RFQ. (b) The ability to run the RFQ in 200-250 kW to accelerate a 5 mA CW deuteron beam by 2.6 MV required for the new modulation design for 1.3 MeV/u. To our knowledge, SARAF RFQ will be the first 4-rod RFQ capable of running a CW deuteron beam at these power densities. This work may contribute to other 4-rod RFQ projects which intend to run CW beams in high dissipation power, like FRANZ and MYRRHA.

All 18 sections of the IFMIF RFQ were completed in summer 2015. A 2 m section (the last three modules and one prototype used as RF termination) were RF tested at LNL at the design value of 90 kW/m in cw conditions. The three 3.3 m long supermodules were sent to Japan in January 2016. The RFQ was installed and tuned with fixed tuners to the nominal field frequency and field distribution. The very high design shunt impedance was achieved.

CERN has completed the construction of a 750 MHz RFQ reaching 5 MeV proton energy in a length of only 2 meters, to be used as injector for a compact proton therapy linac. Beyond proton therapy, this compact and lightweight design can be used for several applications, ranging from the production of radioisotopes in hospitals to ion beam analysis of industrial components or of artworks. The ex-perience with the construction of the first unit will be pre-sented together with the design and plans for other appli-cations.
