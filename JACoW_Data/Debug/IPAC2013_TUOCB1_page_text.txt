The recently upgraded AWA facility is being commissioned. Operation of the new L-Band RF gun with a Cesium Telluride photocathode will generate long electron bunch trains, with high charge per bunch (up to 100 nC). The six new linac tanks will boost the beam energy to 75 MeV, making it an extremely well suited drive beam to excite wakefields in structures. One of the main goals of the facility is to generate RF pulses with GW power levels, corresponding to accelerating gradients of hundreds of MV/m and energy gains on the order of 100 MeV per structure. A key aspect of the studies and experiments carried out at the AWA facility is the use of relatively short RF pulses (15 – 25 ns), which is believed to mitigate the risk of breakdown and structure damage.

A new facility named SPARC_LAB (Sources for Plasma Accelerators and Radiation Compton with Lasers and Beams) has been recently launched at the INFN National Labs in Frascati, merging the potentialities of the an ultra-brilliant electron beam photoinjector and of a high power Ti:Sa laser. The test facility is now completed, hosting a 150 MeV high brightness electron beam injector which feeds a 12 meters long undulator. Observation of FEL radiation in variuous configurations has been performed. In parallel to that a 200 TW laser that is linked to the linac and devoted to explore laser-matter interaction, in particular with regard to laser-plasma acceleration of electrons (and protons) in the self injection and external injection modes. The facility will be also used for particle driven plasma acceleration experiments (the COMB experiment). A Thomson scattering experiment coupling the electron bunch to the high-power laser to generate coherent monochromatic X-ray radiation is also in the commissioning phase. We report in this paper the recent results obtained at the SPARC_LAB facility.

We are developing a new RF gun for SuperKEKB. High charge low emittance electron and positron beams are required for SuperKEKB. We will generate 7.0 GeV electron beam at 5 nC 20 mm-mrad by J-linac. In this linac, a photo cathode S-band RF gun will be used as the electron beam source. For this reason, we are developing an advanced RF gun. We have tested a Disk and Washer (DAW) type RF gun. Additionally, another new RF gun which has two side coupled standing wave field is developed. We call it quasi traveling wave side couple RF gun. This gun has a strong focusing field at the cathode and the acceleration field distribution also has a focusing effect. The design of RF gun and experimental results will be shown.
