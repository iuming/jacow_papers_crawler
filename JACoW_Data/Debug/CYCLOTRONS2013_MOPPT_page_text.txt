Experience gained since the commissioning of the IBA C-30 Cyclotron at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC) in 2010, has shown this facility to be viable entity. In addition to the C-30 Cyclotron, the facility includes two other Cyclotrons namely; the RDS-111 and the CS30 Cyclotrons. The latter has dual responsibilities; while is kept as a backup for the other Cyclotrons for radioisotopes production, it’s used for proton therapy researches and Bragg Peak measurements at that particular energy. During the commission of the C30 cyclotron, 700 uA dual beam were measured. Facility operating history, usage and radiopharmaceuticals productions are described.

For 15 years, eye tumours are treated in collaboration with the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. In 2012 we celebrated the 2000th patient. Our cyclotron is again served by 2 different injectors: a 6 MV Van-de-Graaff and a 2 MV tandetron. The tandetron was optimized especially for the requirements of therapy. Its advantages are easier handling, lower service requirements and a shorter injection beam line. Development of the source resulted in safe operation of more than 600 h and extremely stable beam current. The tandetron is in operation for therapy since 2011. The Van-de-Graaff was considered to be a temporary backup. New requests for beams with a very specific time structure occurred, which can be provided only with the Van-de-Graaff-cyclotron beam line. Pulse structures of high variability; from single pulses of 1 ns at a max. repetition rate of 75 kHz to pulse packets with a length up to 100 μs were tested. The latter was used for the production of pulsed neutron radiation for comprehensive testing of dosimeters. Although major breakdowns have a huge impact on the up-time due to the small number of beam time hours, breakdowns over the past years amounted to less than 5%.

The accelerator facility COSY/Jülich is based upon availability and performance of the isochronous cyclotron JULIC as pre-accelerator of the 2.88 GeV cooler synchrotron. Since 1993 the cyclotron provides beams in 24/7 operation for more than 6500 hours/year on average. The cyclotron has been in operation since commissioning in 1968 and has reached in total 260000 hours of operation. JULIC provides routinely polarized and unpolarized negatively charged light ions for COSY experiments in the field of fundamental research in hadron, particle and nuclear physics. The ongoing program at the facility foresees increasing usage as a test facility for accelerator research and detector development for realization of FAIR, and other novel experiments on the road map of the Helmholtz Association and international collaborations. In parallel to the operation for COSY the cyclotron beam is used for irradiation and fundamental nuclide production for research purposes. A brief overview of activities at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, the cooler synchrotron COSY and its injector cyclotron JULIC, with focus on recent technical developments, will be presented.

The High Intensity Proton Accelerator Facility of the Paul Scherrer Institut is routinely operated at an average beam power of 1.3 MW. Since the last cyclotron conference several highlights have been achieved. The maximum current extracted from the 590 MeV Ring Cyclotron could be increased from 2.2 mA to 2.4 mA during several beam development shifts. Furthermore, the availability of the facility has reached its highest level to date, beyond 93%. The new neutron source UCN which utilizes the full proton beam in pulsed mode, has been commissioned. To ensure reliable operation in the years to come and to further increase the intensity, an upgrade and refurbishment program is under way. Important parts of this program are the replacement of two resonators in Injector II and the installation of new RF amplifiers.

The use of the K130 cyclotron during the past few years has been normal. The total use of the cyclotron in 2012 was 6441 hours out of which 4610 hours on target. Three quarters of the beam time was devoted to basic nuclear physics research and one quarter for industrial applications, the main industrial application being space electronics testing. Altogether over 20 different isotopes were accelerated in 2012. Beam cocktails for space electronics testing were the most commonly used beams (26 %). Since the first beam in 1992 the total run time for the K130 cyclotron at the end of 2012 was 124’138 hours, and altogether 32 elements (73 isotopes) from p to Au have been accelerated. The MCC30/15 cyclotron will deliver proton and deuteron beams for nuclear physics research and for isotope production. The experimental set-up has been mainly under construction and we have had only a couple of beam tests. Isotope production with the MCC30/15 cyclotron has suffered from severe administrative delays. Finally in December 2012 a preliminary budget study for a GMP laboratory for FDG production (18F) was done. Decisions on the radiopharmaceuticals production at JYFL will be done during 2013.

The cyclotron facility at National Institute of Radiological Science (NIRS) consists of a NIRS-930 cyclotron (Thomson-CSF AVF-930, Kb=110 MeV and Kf=90 MeV) and a small cyclotron HM-18(Sumitomo- Heavy- Industry HM-18). The NIRS-930 has been used for production of short-lived radio-pharmaceuticals for PET, research of physics, developments of particle detectors in space, and so on. The orbit of a beam in the NIRS-930 cyclotron was simulated with integrated approach to modelling of the cyclotron, including calculation of electromagnetic fields of the structural elements. And some improvements such as installation of extracted beam probe, a beam attenuator and a beam viewer in an injection beam line, were performed in the NIRS-930. The HM-18 has been used for production of short-lived radio-pharmaceuticals for PET. It allows us to accelerate H-and D- ion at fixed energies of 18 and 9 MeV, respectively. In order to improve the isochronism, a phase probe has been newly installed in the HM-18. Above improvements and operational status of the cyclotron facility are to be presented in this report.

The multi-particle cyclotron C70 ARRONAX, located at Nantes, France is used to accelerate non- concurrently four types of particles downstream several beamlines. The particle energy and intensity range of the cyclotron has allowed a wide variety of application including radiolysis, neutron and isotope productions, and physics experiments. Also regular operations are performed both with dual beam runs at 2x100 μA for isotope production and at 350 μA for neutron production using 70 MeV proton beams. At low intensity, 70 MeV alpha beam is one distinctive feature of the machine with the possibility to use pulsed beam with variable time between two consecutive bunches. The status of the machine is presented as well as the operational updates on the beamlines, including the alpha particle pulsing system, the newly installed alpha degrader and beam loss monitor being developed for high intensity runs.

The LNS Superconducting Cyclotron has been operating for almost 20 years. Several beams are currently accelerated and delivered, allowing for a wide variety of experimental activity to be carried out. In addition, clinical activity is regularly accomplished: over 11 years of protontherapy of the eye pathologies, around 300 patients have been treated. This has stimulated a growing number of interdisciplinary experiments in the field of radiobiology and dosimetry. On the side of nuclear physics, a significant achievement is the production of radioactive beams: several rare isotopes are produced mainly exploiting the in-flight fragmentation method. The development activity carried out on several components of the user oriented facility will be described.

During the last 9 years, Varian’s superconducting isochronous ProBeam™ medical proton cyclotrons proved their maturity when they accumulated more than 20 operational years at factory testing and patient treatment without any unscheduled down time caused by quenches or failures of the cryogenic supply systems. Their reliable superconductive technology features a fast initial cool-down and low operating costs. Besides the two machines which are in clinical operation in Switzerland and Germany, one more ProBeam™ cyclotron is already fully commissioned and delivering a 250MeV proton beam at Scripps Proton Therapy Center in San Diego, USA. Several other ProBeam™ cyclotrons are under fabrication or in the phase of factory beam acceptance tests. We report on fast cool-down and time-to-beam-extraction achievements as well as on the latest status and operational experience with Varian’s ProBeam™ cyclotrons. Additionally, we give an insight in new developments for further reduction of commissioning time and improvement of reliability.

TSL has a long history of producing beams of accelerated particles. The laboratory was restructured in 2005/2006 with nuclear physics phased out, the CELSIUS ring dismantled and the WASA detector moved to Jülich. The focus of activities became thereby shifted towards, mainly, proton therapy and, in addition, radiation effects testing using protons and neutrons in a beam sharing mode. The increase in demand on (a) beam time and b) consequential faster changes between various set-ups necessitated some minor upgrades. Two of these will be presented. For the same reason our energy measuring system needed to be streamlined. As a consequence of the restructuring, night shifts have been phased out. Studies indicated that a substantial energy saving can be accomplished by switching off certain power supplies. Results of this energy saving programme will be presented. The future? In 2012 our ECR ion source has been “recalled to life”, the purpose being to investigate radiation of electronics and thin films (micropore industry). The results for three test runs with heavy ions will be mentioned. Will TSL be able to survive after the Skandion Clinic has taken over Cancer Therapy with protons?

The 100 MeV high intensity compact cyclotron CYCIAE-100 being built at CIAE adopts an external ion source system, accelerates H− ions up to 100 MeV and provides dual proton beams by stripping. The status at different stages, including the preliminary design*, technical design and construction preparation**, and progress***, was reported at previous conferences. The ground breaking ceremony for the building was conducted in April, 2011. Then in September of 2012, the major systems for the machine, including the 435-ton main magnet, two 46.8 kAT exciting main coils, 200-ton hydraulic elevating system with a precision of 0.02mm, high precision magnetic mapper, the 1.27m high vacuum chamber, two 100kW RF amplifiers, magnet power supplies etc., have been in place for installation. The paper will demonstrate the results of high precision machining and installation of large scale magnet, mapping and shimming with vacuum deformation, study on the multipacting effects and RF conditioning. The test results for the 18mA H− ion source and injection line as well as the cryopanel and vacuum system will also be presented. The first beam is expected in the latter half of this year.

A 70 MeV H− cyclotron system has been planned for the rare isotope science project (RISP) in Korea mainly to be used as ISOL driver. The maximum beam current requested is 1 mA, and the beam will be used for the nuclear and neutron science programs. A commercial cyclotron with two extraction ports is to be installed for the facility, and the beam distribution lines have been designed with consideration of radiation shielding. The injection beam line has been also studied to produce pulsed beams in the range of 0.01-1 MHz for the users of neutron science to utilize the time of flight technique. A chopper and collimator system is thought as a feasible scheme, and beam optics calculation has been performed. The cyclotron is scheduled to produce a first beam for the RISP in 2007.

In order to study and optimize the ion source and injection system of our multiple cyclotron products, Best® Cyclotron Systems Inc. (BCSI) has assembled in its Vancouver office a 1 MeV cyclotron development platform. To accommodate different injection line configurations, the main magnet median plane is vertically oriented and rail mounted which also allows easy access to the inner components. In addition, the main magnet central region is equipped with interchangeable magnetic poles, RF elements, and inflector electrodes in order to replicate the features of the simulated cyclotrons. Multiple diagnostic devices are available to fully characterize the beam along the injection line and inside the cyclotron. This paper will describe the design of two system configurations: the 60 MeV H2+ for the DAEΔALUS experiment (MIT, BEST, INFN-LNS) and the BCSI 70 MeV H− cyclotron.

Numerical simulation of 6-dimensional, end-to-end beam transport in the prototype EMMA linear FFAG is presented and discussed. The simulation uses the 3-D OPERA field maps of the 42 cells, including the specific injection and extraction cells. It starts from upstream of the injection septum, and ends downstream of the extraction septum after 10-turn "serpentine" acceleration from 10 to 20 MeV. It includes the time function of the septa and injection and extraction pairs of kickers, and possible stray fields.

High-intensity and energy compact proton accelerators, especially those requiring milliamp currents, imply both CW operation and high acceleration gradients to mitigate losses. Above a few hundred MeV, losses must be under a per cent to avoid massive shielding and unmanageable activation. As relativistic energies are approached, the orbit separation on consecutive acceleration turns decreases for isochronous performance and to achieve higher acceleration gradients and orbit separation, RF modules must be employed rather than Dees, resulting in the larger separated-sector cyclotron footprint. However, the addition of strong focusing – with reversed gradients to capture both transverse planes – to conventional cyclotron fields promote inclusion of long synchrotron-like straight sections and implementation of high-gradient RF, even SCRF. The nsFFAG design has evolved into a a recirculating linear accelerator form with FFAG arcs. An ultra-compact, 0.2 – 1 GeV RLA FFAG design will be discussed (with a 3m x 5-6m footprint) that uses SC RF cryomodules achieving complete orbit separation at extraction and CW operation.

Compact cyclotrons which accelerate high current of H− ions in the range of 10-30MeV have been widely used over the last 25 years for medical isotope production and other applications. For a number of these, low weight, low power consumption, portability or low radiation background are key design requirements. We have evaluated the feasibility of a compact superconducting cyclotron that would provide proton beams up to 20 MeV by accelerating H− ions and extracting them by the stripping process with current of 100uA. The study demonstrates that the survival of the H− ion under high magnetic field environment could be large enough to guarantee low beam losses as long as the RF voltage is high. The compact cyclotron is energized by a set of superconducting coils providing the needed magnetic field, while the azimuthal varying field is done by four iron sectors. Additional superconducting coils are added to minimize the stray magnetic field, eliminating the need for a return yoke. The option of accelerating negative deuteron molecules has also been considered and is presented.

At the RIBF, uranium beams are accelerated up to the energy of 345 MeV per nucleon with a RFQ linac, DTL, and four ring cyclotrons (RRC, fRC, IRC, SRC). However, the present beam current of the uranium is 10-15 pnA at the exit of the SRC, still low, because we have to use two charge strippers located upstream and downstream of the fRC to convert the U35+ ions extraced from the 28 GHz ECR ion source to U64+ and U86+, respectively. Accordingly, in order to increase the beam current more than tenfold, we performed the design study of the new superconducting ring cyclotron with the K-value of 2200 which can accelerate the U35+ ions from 11 MeV/u to 48 MeV/u without the first charge stripper. The number of sector magnets is four and the RF frequency is fixed. The maximum magnetic field strength on the beam orbit is 3.2 T, and the superconducting main coils of the dense winding of NbTi and the trim coils of normal-conducting Cu are used. The total weight of the iron yokes is approximately 4800 t. This paper also describes the beam injection and extraction system which includes one superconducting magnetic channel.

A new class of isochronous cyclotron is described in which more general radial field profiles B(r) are allowed than the simple proportionality to total energy found in conventional radial- and spiral-sector cyclotrons. Isochronism is maintained by using different field profiles in the hills and valleys. Suitably chosen profiles will produce high flutter factors and significant alternating-gradient focusing, enabling vertical focusing to be maintained up to 1 GeV or more using radial rather than spiral sectors.

Optimum Serpentine Acceleration in Scaling FFAG

Serpentine acceleration is typified by fixed radio frequency, fixed magnetic field and a near (but not) isochronous lattice, radial motion of the orbit, and two or more reversals of the motion in RF phase. This was discovered in 2003 for linear non-scaling FFAGs in the relativistic regime. In 2013, Kyoto University School of Engineering pointed out that serpentine acceleration is possible also in scaling FFAGs and may span the non-relativistic to relativistic regime. As a function of two key parameters, field index and synchronous energy, this paper shows how to optimize the extraction energy and the voltage per turn for the scaling case. Optimization is difficult, and typically leads to poor performance: either extreme voltage or small acceleration range. Nevertheless, designs with credible acceleration parameters can be obtained; and indicative examples are presented herein.

The testing of radiation effects (displacement damage DD, single event effects SEE) with energetic protons for electronics used in space and accelerators is of growing importance. Setup and past experience of a dedicated test stand used by Fraunhofer INT at the JULIC cyclotron will be presented. For general DD testing and for testing SEE of the trapped protons in space, the energy of 35 MeV of the JULIC Cyclotron is usually sufficient. During solar proton events, as well as at high energy accelerators (CERN, FAIR), electronics are confronted with protons of much higher energy. Recent scientific studies have shown that for single event upsets* as well as destructive failures (e.g, single event latch-ups)** a cross section measured at energies in the tens oF one/two-hundred MeV range (e.g. PIF@PSI) can significantly underestimate the failure rate. To avoid unnecessary high safety margins there is a growing need for the opportunity to test electronics at several GeV, like the beam provided by the Cooler-Synchrotron COSY in Jülich.

SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species) is an INFN project with the aim to develop a Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) facility as an intermediate step toward EURISOL. The SPES Project is under realization at the INFN Legnaro National Laboratories site. The SPES Project main goal is to provide a production and accelerator system of exotic beams to perform forefront research in nuclear physics by studying nuclei far from stability. The SPES Project is concentrating on the production of neutron-rich radioactive nuclei with mass in the range 80-160. The final energy of the radioactive beams on target will range from few MeV/u up to 11 MeV/u for A=130[1]. The SPES facility acceleration system will be presented.

iThemba LABS is a multidisciplinary research facility in the fields of nuclear physics research, neutron therapy, proton therapy and radionuclide production. Three long running projects, the construction of a new ECR ion source, a beam phase measuring system for the separated-sector cyclotron comprising 21 fixed probes and an RF amplitude and phase monitoring system for the 16 RF systems have been completed. The first results will be reported. The status of the newly developed low-level RF control system will be discussed and an interactive magnetic field calculation method for an injector cyclotron, making use of a data base developed from calculations with the computer program TOSCA, will be presented. Plans to save on the power consumption of the accelerators will be reported on. The beam statistics and the progress with the planning of a radioactive ion beam facility will be discussed.
