As the newest and most advanced third generation light source, NSLS2 commissioning has started recently. A total of 50mA stored beam was achieved in the storage ring. Most of the diagnostic systems have been commissioned with beams and proved to be critical to the success of machine commissioning. This paper will present beam commissioning results of various diagnostic systems in the NSLS2 injector and storage ring, including profile monitors, current monitors, and position monitors. We will discuss some preliminary machine measurements as well, such as beam current and lifetime, tune, beam stability, filling pattern etc.
