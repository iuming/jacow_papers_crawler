ADANES (Accelerator Driven Advanced Nuclear Energy System) consist of the Accelerator Driven Burner (ADB) and the Accelerator Driven Recycle Used Fuel (ADRUF). ADB is optimized for nuclear waste transmutation, fissile material breeding and energy production in situ, which is long refueling period (~30yrs) fast core and initialed by accelerator driven. Since the higher controllable reactivity, the 'raw' recycle fuel (>50% Fission Products) could be used inside ADB. Therefore, ADANES is the ideal close fuel cycle for utilizing fissile fuel 95% and minimizing radiotoxicity <4% with live time <500 yr. In this approaches, the SCL play ADB's starter (<15% duration) which could drive ~10 set of the fast reactor. So far, the key technical R&D make a significant breakthrough. Two injector (325/162.5 MHz) have extracted ~10 MeV/1.1~2.7 mA CW proton beam and the integral SCL has extracted ~25 MeV beam. The new concept of the granular target is made of fluid solid grain in mm and driven by gravity, which power could increase to 10~100 MW. Next phase ADANES will start soon which include ADB power ~2.5 MW@500MeV proton SCL; ADRUF's compact neutron source driven by <250 MeV/5mA deuteron SCL.

Accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments have played an important role in the confirmation of the neutrino oscillation and in precision measurements of the oscillation parameters. Two cutting-edge experiments, T2K and NOvA, open a door for the CP violation study in the neutrino sector using intense proton beams of several hundred kW from the Main Ring of J-PARC and the Main Injector of Fermilab, respectively. In this talk, a review of high intensity proton accelerator facilities for the next-generation accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments is presented. In these facilities, superconducting rf is a key technology to realize MW and multi-MW proton beams.
