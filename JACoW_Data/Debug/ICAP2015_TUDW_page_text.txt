Ridgetron is designed with a frequency of 100MHz and electron energy of 10MeV and power of 50kW. It used for disinfection and sterilization of medical appliers. The electro-magnetic field simulation and cavity design of the Ridgetron is carried out by CST code. The influences of the cavity length, accelerating gap and electrode head on electric field and effective shunt impedance are analyzed, and cavity structure is determined. After that, we calculate the energy gain, analyse influence of different acceleration times on shunt impedance and energy gain. The results show that with the same cavity length, the more the acceleration times, the greater the shunt impedance, but the cavity diameter is greater too. Finally according to the objective of the design requirements, we optimize the accelerating times to obtain electron energy of 10 MeV.

The design and performance analysis of a DC electron gun for S-band klystron has been worked out with the help of EGUN and CST PS Codes. The optimization of the characteristic beam parameters of the gun were calculated through parameterization and compared with the simulated and experimental values. The simulation results are in agreement with the test results.

We study the radiation intensity of the transversal oscillation of rotating charged particle. We analyse the influence of the trajectory shift from the circular one on the characteristics of the radiation intensity. Recently in this frame we have investigated the radiation intensity of a charged longitudinal oscillator moving along a helical trajectory around a dielectric cylinder. Similar to the case of coaxial circular motion under certain conditions for the parameters of the trajectory and dielectric cylinder strong narrow peaks appear in the angular distribution of the radiation intensity in the exterior medium. Instead of a single peak in the case of a uniform coaxial circular motion, for a longitudinal oscillator set of peaks appear. The increase of the oscillating amplitude leads to the increase of the number of the peaks and the peaks are shifted to the direction of small angles. For transversal oscillator it is in reason to get the same results.
