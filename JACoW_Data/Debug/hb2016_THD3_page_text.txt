After a successful career as an antiproton storage and cooling ring, Recycler has been converted to a high intensity proton stacker for the Main Injector. We discuss the commissioning and operation of the Recycler in this new role, and the progress towards the 700 kW design goal.

A 100-MeV proton linac at the KOMAC (Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex) is composed of a 50-keV microwave ion source, a 3-MeV four-vane-type RFQ, a 100-MeV DTL and 10 target stations for proton irradiation on samples from many application fields. The linac was commissioned in 2013 and the user service started in July 2013 with delivering proton beam to two target stations: one for a 20-MeV beam and the other for a 100-MeV beam. In 2015, the linac has been operated more than 2,800 hours with an availability of greater than 89%. The unscheduled downtime was about 73 hours, mainly due to problems of ion source arcing and failures of pulsed high-voltage power system. More than 2,100 samples from various fields such as materials science, bio-life and nano technology and nuclear science, were treated in 2015. Currently, a new target station for radioisotope production is under commissioning and a new target station for low-flux irradiation experiments is being installed. Operational experiences of the 100-MeV linac during the past 3 years will be presented in the workshop.

Funding: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC, under Contract No. DE-AC0500OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.
The SNS began commissioning of the entire accelerator, with beam to target, ten years ago in April 2006. Since then significant improvements we have made which have resulted in reduced beam loss and increased availability and beam power on target. The SNS accelerator systems have operated recently for significant periods of time at about 1.4MW with greater than 90% availability. Component status, improvements and operating experience will be presented.

The higher efficiency and higher availability (fault-tolerant oriented) of RF&Cavity system (with beam loading) to operate at, the more dynamic details needs to be identified, so as to have the abilities (a) to work at nonlinearities, (b) to work close to limitation, and (c) to change operation point quickly and correctly. Dynamic detail identifications rely heavily on high precision measuring and characterizing basic cavity parameters (Ql, R/Q, dynamic detuning, phase and amplitude) and system behaviours under beam-RF-cavity interactions. It is especially challenging to characterize these dynamics under varying operating points or environment. Advanced technologies in LLRF and ICS providing real time/online characterizing will be the key enablers for addressing such challenges. However, to be successful, the deployment of these technologies must be embedded within local conditions taking into account available resources, existing hardware/software structures and operation modes. Several improvement approaches will be introduced. For example, 15% or more energy efficiency improvement at ESS will be obtained by reduction of power overhead and optimization of operation.
