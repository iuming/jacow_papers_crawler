The Low Energy RHIC Electron Cooling (LEReC) facility at BNL demonstrated, for the first time, cooling of ion beams using a bunched electron beam from an SRF accelerating cavity and photoinjector. LEReC is planned to be operational to improve the luminosity of the Beam Energy Scan II physics program in RHIC in the following two years. In order to establish cooling of the RHIC Au ion beam using a 20 mA, 1.6 MeV bunched electron beam; absolute energy, angular and energy spread, trajectory and beam size were precisely matched. A suite of instrumentation was commissioned that includes a variety of current transformers, capacitive pick-up for gun high voltage ripple monitor, BPMs, transverse and longitudinal profile monitors, multi-slit and single-slit scanning emittance stations, time-of-flight and magnetic field related energy measurements, beam halo & loss monitors and recombination monitors. The commissioning results and performance of these systems are described, including the latest design efforts of high-power electron beam transverse profile monitoring using a fast wire scanner, residual gas beam induced fluorescence monitor, and Boron Nitride NanoTube (BNNT) screen monitor

The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is a storage ring at the end of the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility. The complex is intended to support accelerator R&D for the next generation of particle accelerators. The IOTA ring is currently operating with 150 MeV electrons injected from the FAST Linac and will also receive 2.5 MeV protons from the IOTA Proon Injector currently be installed. The current instrumentation and results along from the first electron commissioning run will be presented along with future plans.

The commissioning of the high power deuterium accelerator of Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator, LIPAc, is presently under progress. During the so-called Phase B, the accelerator is operating with a high current pulsed proton and deuteron. The Phase B operation has the goals of fulfilling an exhaustive characterization of equipment and machine parameters in pulsed beam operation up to 5 MeV and 125 mA at Low Duty Cycle. The LIPAc beam diagnostics are aimed to demonstrate at this first stage of the commissioning the correct performance of the accelerator and are used for a complete characterization of the accelerator matching and tuning parameters. The characterization and calibration of beam diagnostics developed are providing relevant feedback of the accelerator operation. Measurements of the centroid position, beam profile, energy, intensity or emittance have been acquired and analyzed. The experimental results gathered have been compared with beam dynamics simulations. In this contribution, an overview of the main results provided by the beam diagnostics during Phase B operation in proton will be shown, together with the status of each instrument.

The monitoring of losses is crucial in any accelerator. In the new high intensity hadron facilities even low energy beam can damage or activate the materials so the detection of small losses in this region is very important. A new type of neutron beam loss monitor has been developed specifically targeting this region, where only neutrons and photons can be produced and where typical BLM, based on charged particle detection, could not be appropriate because of the photon background due to the RF cavities. The BLM proposed is based on gaseous Micromegas detectors, designed to be sensitive to fast neutrons and with little sensitivity to photons. Development of the detectors presented here has been done to fulfil the requirements of ESS and they will be part of the ESS-BI systems. The detector has been presented in previous editions of the conference. Here we focus on the neutron/gamma rejection with the final FEE and in the first operation of one of the modules in a beam during the commissioning of LINAC4 (CERN) with the detection of provoked losses and their clear separation from RF gammas. The ESS-nBLM system is presented in this conference in a separate contribution.
