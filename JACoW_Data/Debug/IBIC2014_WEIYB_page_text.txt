Digital signal processing by means of undersampling the analog signal has become a popular method for acquiring beam position monitor signals. This presentation discusses the technique and its principle limitations, presents today’s technical limits (e.g. in terms of performance of available ADCs), and provides an outlook for the future. It will also try to compare the technique with more tradition analog downmixing and signal processing methods.
