The development and use of accelerators for research has been closely linked to an era of modern physics which of course includes quantum mechanics. Niels Bohr was one of the foreground figures in the development of quantum mechanics and the IPAC community would like to recognise his contributions to this field in 2017, when IPAC takes place in Copenhagen, where he was active. Quantum computing is a subject of enormous potential and interest, and we would like to hear about the historical links to Niels Bohr and the so called Copenhagen School of Quantum Mechanics, and what we realistically can expect from this development.
