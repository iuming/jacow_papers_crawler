Local interaction region (IR) linear coupling in the LHC has been shown to have a negative impact on beam size and luminosity, making its accurate correction for Run 3 and beyond a necessity. In view of determining corrections, supervised machine learning has been applied to the detection of linear coupling sources, showing promising results in simulations. An evaluation of different applied models is given, followed by the presentation of further possible application concepts for linear coupling corrections using machine learning.

The Future Circular electron-positron Collider (FCC-ee) will have stored beam energies of up to 20 MJ. This is a factor 100 higher than any current or past lepton collider. A safe and reliable disposal of the beam onto a beam dump block is therefore critical for operation. To ensure the survival of the dump core blocks, transversal dilution of the beam is necessary. To reduce the complexity of the system and guarantee high availability, an optimized, semi-passive beam dumping system has been designed. The main dump absorber design has been optimized following recent studies for high energy dump block materials for the LHC High Luminosity upgrade. First simulations regarding the radiation environment of the dumping system have been carried out, allowing the definition of preliminary constraints for the integration with respect to radiation sensitive equipment. The performance of the system has been evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations as well as thermomechanical Finite-Element-Analysis to investigate potential material failure and assess safety margins. An experiment at the CERN HiRadMat facility has been carried out and preliminary results show good agreement with simulations.

The idea of the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) search using the storage ring with polarized beam demands long Spin Coherence Time (SCT). It is the time during which the RMS spread of the orientation of spins of all particles in the bunch reaches one radian. Long SCT is needed to observe a coherent effect on polarization induced by the EDM. The possibility of getting a 1000 s SCT for deuterons has been shown experimentally at COoler SYnchrotron (COSY), accelerator at FZJ Jülich, Germany. Reaching high values of SCT for protons is more challenging due to a higher anomalous magnetic moment. Obtaining sufficient proton SCT is obligatory for planned EDM search experiments at COSY and the ProtoType EDM Ring (PTR). It has been shown that the second order momentum compaction factor (alpha1) has to be optimized along with chromaticities to get high SCT. Three families of sextupoles have to be used. The optimal values of chromaticities and alpha1 are discussed. The racetrack option of PTR is investigated.

Amplitude detuning measurements in the LHC have shown that a significant amount of detuning is generated in Beam 1 via feed-down from decapole and dodecapole field errors in the triplets of the experiment insertion regions, while in Beam 2 this detuning is negligible. In this study, we investigate the cause of this behavior and we attempt to find corrections that use the feed-down from the nonlinear correctors in the insertion region for amplitude detuning.

In order to maximize the luminosity production time in the FCC-ee, top-up injection will be employed. The positron and electron beams will be accelerated to the collision energy in the booster ring before being injected with either a small transverse or longitudinal separation to the stored beam. Using this scheme essentially keeps the beam current constant and, apart from a brief period during the injection process, collision data can be continuously acquired. Two top-up injection schemes, each with on- and off-momentum sub-schemes, viable for FCC-ee have been identified in the past and are studied in further detail to find a suitable design for each of the four operation modes of the FCC-ee. In this paper, injection straight optics, initial injection tracking studies and the effect on the stored beam are presented. Additionally, a basic proxy error lattice is introduced as a first step to studying injection into an imperfect machine.

The LHC heavy-ion program with 208Pb82+ beams is foreseen to benefit from a significant intensity upgrade in 2022. A performance limitation may arise from ion fragments scattered out of the collimators in the betatron cleaning insertion, which risk quenching superconducting magnets during periods of short beam lifetime. In order to mitigate this risk, an alternative collimation technique, relying on bent crystals as primary collimators, will be used in future heavy-ion runs. In this paper, we study the power deposition in superconducting magnets by means of FLUKA shower simulations, comparing the standard collimation system against the crystal-based one. The studies focus on the dispersion suppressor regions downstream of the betatron cleaning insertion, where the ion fragment losses are the highest. Based on these studies, we quantify the expected quench margin expected in future runs with 208Pb82+ beams.

At the synchrotron light source DELTA operated by the TU Dortmund University, the short-pulse facility employs the seeding scheme coherent harmonic generation (CHG) and provides ultrashort pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet and terahertz regime. Here, the interaction of laser pulses with the stored electron bunches results in a modulation of the longitudinal electron density which gives rise to coherent emission at harmonics of the laser wavelength. The spectral and temporal properties of such coherent short pulses can be manipulated by the seed laser properties and chicane strength. CHG spectra at several harmonics of the 800 nm seed laser were recorded using an image-intensified CCD (iCCD) camera and a newly installed XUV spectrometer. Numerical simulations to calculate the spectral phase properties of the seed laser from the observed spectra were carried out.

In a light Source, unused synchrotron radiation is being distributed along the walls of the chambers. Due to the small conductance of the chambers, vacuum pumping is based on the distributed concept, and then non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating is extensively used. The vacuum chambers are made of copper alloys tube, and cooling circuits are welded to the chamber to remove the heat load from the radiation generated. Filler metal is used to create a brazed joint between the water cooling pipe and the vacuum chamber body. The thermal conductivity of the fillers is less than the vacuum chamber body. Moreover, the water velocity in the cooling pipe must be taken into account in thermal calculations. In this paper, we study and investigate the effects of the filler metal and the cooling water velocity in cooling the chambers.

The free-electron laser (FEL) user facility FLASH at DESY is currently undergoing an upgrade which involves the transformation of one of its beamlines to allow for external seeding via so-called Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG). With this seeding technique it will be possible to provide stable, longitudinal coherent and intense radiation in the XUV and soft X-ray regime at high repetition rate. To ensure an efficient FEL amplification process, sustainable energy exchange between the electrons and the electromagnetic field in the undulator is mandatory. Adequate adjustment of the undulator strength along the beamline allows to compensate for electron energy loss and to preserve the resonance condition. The impact of this undulator tapering on the temporal and spectral characteristics on the EEHG FEL radiation at 4 nm is investigated by means of numerical simulations performed with the FEL code GENESIS 1.3, version 4. Different tapering methods are examined and it is shown that specific tapering of the undulator strength allows to exceed the FEL saturation power while maintaining a clear temporal and spectral shape of the FEL pulse.

At the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory, the system to generate MIR-FEL using the electron linac has been developed. In this contribution, the design and simulation results of the MIR-FEL generation system are presented. The system is designed as the oscillator-FEL type consisting of two mirrors and a 1.6-m permanent planar undulator. The middle of the undulator is determined as the laser beam waist position. Both two mirrors are the concave gold-coated copper mirrors placing upstream and downstream the optical cavity, which has a total length of 5.41 m. The FEL is designed to coupling out at a hole with diameter of 2 mm on the upstream mirror. The optical cavity is optimized to obtain high FEL gain and high FEL power using GENESIS 1.3 simulation code. The electron beam with energy of 25 MeV is used in the consideration. As a result, the MIR-FEL with central wavelength of 13.01 ’m is obtained. The optimum upstream and downstream mirror curvatures are 3.091 m and 2.612 m, respectively, which give the Rayleigh length of 0.631 m. This optical cavity yields the power coupling ratio of 1:1000 and the FEL gain of up to 40%. The extracted MIR-FEL peak power in 100 kW scale is obtained at the coupling hole. The construction of the practical MIR-FEL system is conducted based on the results from this study.

Funding: This work was supported by NSF grant PHY-1734215 and DOE grant No. DE-SC0009914 and DE-SC0021190. The undulator construction has been carried out under SBIR/STTR DE-SC0017102 and DE-SC0018559.
Free electron lasers are an attractive option for high average and peak power radiation in the THz gap, a region of the electromagnetic spectrum where radiation sources are scarce, as the required beam and undulator parameters are readily achievable with current technology. However, slippage effects require the FEL to be driven with relatively long and low current electron bunches, limiting amplification gain and output power. Previous work demonstrated that a waveguide could be used to match the radiation and e-beam velocities in a meter-long strongly-tapered helical undulator, resulting in 10\% energy extraction from an ultrashort 200 pC, 5.5 MeV electron beam. We present simulations for a follow-up experiment targeting higher frequencies with improvements to the e-beam transport including a permanent magnet chicane for strong beam compression. FEL simulations show >20\% extraction efficiency from a 125 pC, 7.4 MeV electron beam at 0.32 THz.

Work has been underway for some time to design a compact electron beamline utilising X-band linear accelerating structures in the new Melbourne X-band Laboratory for Accelerators and Beams (X-LAB). The original design utilised an S-band RF photogun as an input to a pair of high gradient X-band linear accelerating structures, but we have been motivated to investigate an alternative starting section to allow for initial testing. This will utilise a DC photogun and S-band accelerating structure similar to those used at the Australian Synchrotron.

We have studied the generation of the broadband THz pulse using a compact linear accelerator. The THz pulse is generated by control of an electron beam angle to Cherenkov radiation angle. In addition, we have succeeded in producing a quasi-monochromatic THz pulse by the spatially modulated electron beam by passing through a slit. This work aims to develop a detection system to elucidate the spectrum of the quasi-monochromatic THz pulse. To detect it stably in a noisy radiation environment, the stability of probe laser system for Electro Optic sampling and timing synchronization system are important. In this conference, the generation method of each THz pulses, the results of development of detection system, and future prospect will be reported.

In this paper, we build on previous work where multi-objective genetic algorithms were used to optimise RF cavities using non-uniform rational basis splines (NURBS) to improve the cavity geometries and reduce peak fields. These optimisations can produce thousands of Pareto optimal solutions, from which a final cavity solution must be selected based on design criteria, such as accelerating gradient and power requirements. As all points are considered equally optimal, this can prove difficult without further analysis. Here we focus on the visualisation of the Pareto optimal points and the final solution selection process. We have found that the use of clustering algorithms and parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) provide the best way to represent the data and perform the necessary trade-offs between the peak fields and shunt impedance required to pick a final design.

At the Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) in Mainz, a new accelerator is currently under construction in order to deliver electron beams of up to 155 MeV to two experiments. The Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) will offer two modes of operation, one of which is an energy-recovering (ER) mode. As an ERL, MESA, with it’s high brightness electron beam, is a promising accelerator for supplying a Thomson back scattering based Gamma source. Furthermore, at MESA, the polarization of the electron beam can be set by the injector. The aim of this work is to provide a concept and comprehensive analysis of the merit and practical feasibility of a Thomson backscattering source at MESA under consideration of beam polarization and transversal effects. In this paper, an overview and results of our semi analytical approach to calculate various Thomson back scattering light source scenarios at MESA will be given. Furthermore we will discuss the benefits of using polarized electrons in combination with a polarized laser beam.

The accelerator system at the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory is used to generate terahertz transition radiation (THz-TR). Due to broad spectrum, it can be used as the light source for THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) to measure both the intensity and phase of the THz signal. This contribution presents the generation of the THz-TR produced from 10-20 MeV electron beams and the system preparation for THz TDS. The electron bunches, which are compressed to have a length of femtosecond scale at the experimental station, is used to generate the THz-TR using a 45°-tilted aluminum foil as a radiator. The radiation properties including angular distribution, polarization and radiation spectrum are measured in the accelerator hall and at the TDS station. The radiation spectral range covers up to 2.3 THz with the peak power of 0.5 - 1.25 MW is expected. The effects of electron bunch distribution, divergence of the beam and influence of optical components on the radiation properties were studied. The results show that the considered effects have a significant impact on the TR properties. The Information will be used in the TR characterization that is needed to be interpreted carefully.

S-band RF-guns are highly developed for production of low emittance relativistic electron bunches, but need powerful klystrons for driving. Here, we present the design and first experimental tests of a compact S-band gun, which can accelerate electrons up to 180 keV powered by only 10 kW from a compact rack-mountable solid-state amplifier. A pin-cathode is used to enhance the RF electric field on the cathode up to 100 MV/m as in large-scale S-band guns. An electron bunch is generated through photoemission off a flat copper surface on the pin excited by a UV laser pulse followed by a focusing solenoid producing a low emittance bunch with 0.1 mm mrad transverse emittance for up to 100 fC bunch charge. We are currently in the conditioning phase of the gun and first experiments show good agreement with simulations. The compact gun will serve three purposes: (i) it can be used directly for ultrafast electron diffraction; (ii) as an injector into a THz booster producing 0.3MeV to 2 MeV electron bunches for ultrafast electron diffraction; (iii) The system in (ii) serves as an injector into a THz linear accelerator producing a 20 MeV beam for the AXSIS X-ray source project.

Producing higher brightness beams at the cathode is one of the main focuses for future electron beam applications. For photocathodes operating close to their emission threshold, the cathode lattice temperature begins to dominate the minimum achievable intrinsic emittance. At UCLA, we are designing a radiofrequency (RF) test bed for measuring the temperature dependence of the mean transverse energy (MTE) and quantum efficiency for a number of candidate cathode materials. We intend to quantify the attainable brightness improvements at the cathode from cryogenic operation and establish a proof-of-principle cryogenic RF gun for future studies of a 1.6-cell cryogenic photoinjector for the UCLA ultra compact XFEL concept (UC-XFEL). The test bed will use a C-band 0.5-cell RF gun designed to operate down to 45 K, producing an on-axis accelerating field of 120 MV/m. The cryogenic system uses conduction cooling and a load-lock system is being designed for transport and storage of air-sensitive high brightness cathodes.

A Multipole Injection Kicker (MIK) was installed in a short straight section of the SOLEIL storage ring and successfully commissioned in 2021. A small horizontal orbit distortion in the micrometer range was achieved outperforming the standard bump-based injection scheme installed in a 12-m long straight section. Refined studies have been conducted to fully understand and further improve the performance of the device. Indeed, a novel generation of the MIK will be the key element for the injection scheme of the SOLEIL Upgrade. We report simulation studies and the latest MIK experimental performance. Both injected and stored beam-based measurements were performed using new types of diagnostics with turn-by-turn capability (Libera Brillance+ BPM, KALYPSO: 2x1D imaging). The residual perturbations on the beam positions and sizes were measured; the magnetic field of the MIK device was reconstructed. An unexpected kick was detected in the vertical plane and an active correction implemented to cancel the resulting perturbation.

The worldwide first in-vacuum elliptical undulator, IVUE32, is being developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. The 2.5 m long device with a period length of 3.2 cm and a minimum gap of about 7 mm is to be installed in the BESSY II storage ring. It will deliver radiation in the soft X-ray range to several beamlines. The proximity of the undulator structure to the electron beam makes the device susceptible to wakefield effects which can influence beam stability. A complete understanding of its impedance characteristics is required prior to installation and operation, as unforeseen heating of components could have catastrophic consequences. To understand and measure the IVU’s impedance characteristics a Goubau-Line test stand is being designed. A Goubau-line is a single wire transmission line for high frequency surface waves with a transverse electric field resembling that of a charged particle beam out to a certain radial distance. A concept optimized for bench testing IVUE32-components will be discussed, microwave simulations will be presented together with first measurements from a test stand prototype.

The production of low emittance positron beams for future linear and circular lepton colliders, like CLIC or FCC-ee, requires high-field damping wigglers. Just as compact free-electron lasers (FELs) require high-field but as well short-period undulators to emit high energetic, coherent photons. Using high-temperature superconductors (HTS) in the form of coated ReBCO tape superconductors allows higher magnetic field amplitudes at 4 K and larger operating margins as compared to low-temperature superconductors, like Nb-Ti. This contribution discusses the development work on superconducting vertical racetrack (VR) undulator coils, wound from coated ReBCO tape superconductors. The presented VR coils were modularly designed with a period length of 13 mm. Powering tests in liquid nitrogen of multiple vertical racetrack coils were performed at CERN. The results from the measurements are presented for three VR coils and compared with electromagnetic simulations.

Scaling the RF-accelerator concept to terahertz (THz) frequencies brings several compelling advantages, including compactness, intrinsic timing between the photoemission and driving field sources, and high field gradients associated with the short THz wavelength and high breakdown threshold. Recent demonstrations of such THz powered accelerators relied on two counter-propagating single-cycle THz pulses. However, to achieve high energy gains in the acceleration process high energy THz pulses are needed which in turn require complex optical setups. Here, we present on the development of a matchbox sized multi-layered accelerator designed to boost the 50 keV output of a DC electron gun to energies of ~400 keV that only requires a single THz pulse to be powered. An integrated tunable mirror inside the structure interferes the front of the driving THz pulse with its rear part such that the field in the interaction region is optimized for efficient acceleration. This reduces the complexity of the required optical setup. Such a compact booster accelerator is very promising as electron source in ultrafast electron diffraction experiments and as booster stage prior to THz based LINACs.

Emerging high power THz sources pave the road for THz- driven acceleration of ultra-short bunches, and enable their manipulation for diagnostic purposes. Due to the small feature sizes of THz-guiding devices new methods are necessary for their electromagnetic characterization. A new technique has recently been developed which characterizes THz waveguides with respect to their dispersion relations and attenuation. Here, the method is applied to circular waveguides, partially filled with polymer capillaries of different thicknesses, to find a suitable size for THz driven streaking at 287 GHz. Further, rough 3d-printed metallic waveguides are measured to study the effect of roughness on attenuation and phase constant. In general, additive manufacturing techniques show promise for advanced integrated designs of THz driven structures.

Dielectric loaded waveguides (DLW) powered by multicycle terahertz (THz) pulses have shown promising performance as compact linear accelerators due to higher breakdown fields at THz frequencies compared to conventional RF components. By changing the dielectric dimensions one can control phase and group velocities of the THz pulse inside the DLW. Since optimum waveguide dimensions are dependent on initial electron energy, THz pulse energy, and etc., it is worthwhile to determine optimum values for different conditions to maximize final kinetic energy. In this work, we present a combined analytical/numerical guide to determine the optimum DLW parameters for single on-axis electron acceleration. We also introduce normalized graphic representations to visualize optimum designs for different initial electron and THz pulse energies.

Ion beam produced in laser-driven ion acceleration by ultra-intense lasers has characteristics of high peak cur-rent and low emittance. These characteristics become an advantage to operate the request for the beam applica-tion. Therefore, we study how to control the parameters with the laser-plasma interaction. Here, we used 2D Particle-in-Cell code to simulate the laser-driven ion acceleration and investigated the results in terms of transverse emittance, beam current, and brightness. The laser spot size and target thickness were changed in the simulation. And, these qualitative results show that interaction target thickness is a major factor in controlling beam characteristics.

Beam-driven dielectric wakefield accelerators (DWA) have the potential to provide accelerating gradients in the GV/m range. The transverse dynamics in such devices need to be understood to avoid instabilities over long transport distances and facilitate beam matching to specific applications (e.g. FELs). This presentation details simulation studies of the magnitude of beam-breakup instability (BBU) in planar dielectric lined waveguides (DLWs). These are for DWA drive beams, with high charge and momentum that can be produced at current facilities. Using a series of perpendicular DLW segments has been proposed to control instabilities over larger distances. Using self-developed software, the beam dynamics of a drive beam within a DLW are simulated and the magnitude of beam losses along a DLW of varying lengths calculated and beam quality preservation investigated. Methods to reduce transverse instabilities have been explored, and the impact of these on the length of a possible DWA acceleration stage are investigated. An acceleration stage with m-scale length, consisting of multiple alternating planar DLWs, is suggested and preservation of beam quality along this distance is shown.

We have measured the THz near-field in order to inform the design of improved THz-frequency accelerating structures. THz-frequency accelerating structures could provide the accelerating gradients needed for next generation particle accelerators with compact, GV/m-scale devices. One of the most promising THz generation techniques for accelerator applications is optical rectification in lithium niobate using the tilted pulse front method. However, accelerator applications are limited by significant losses during transport of THz radiation from the generating nonlinear crystal to the acceleration structure. In addition, the spectral properties of high-field THz sources make it difficult to couple THz radiation into accelerating structures. A better understanding of the THz near-field source properties is necessary for the optimization of THz transport and coupling. We have developed a technique for detailed measurement of the THz near-fields and used it to reconstruct the full temporal 3D THz near-field close to the LN emission face. Analysis of the results from this measurement will inform designs of novel structures for use in THz particle acceleration.

We present progress and an experimental plan for multi-MeV relativistic energy gain in a dielectric laser-driven accelerator (DLA). Using a 780 nm, 100 fs pulse-front-tilted laser, we achieve interaction with 6 MeV electrons over a 4 mm long structure with 800 nm period. To compensate for resonant defocusing effects, the laser pulse is imprinted with a phase mask, applied by a Spatial Light Modulator, which uses alternating phase focusing (APF) to achieve stable beam transport. The DLA is mechanically mounted with a variable sized gap (600-1200 nm) in order to maximize transmission while maintaining high gradient within the channel. The combination of high interaction length and use of APF confines and accelerates the electrons by up to 3.5 MeV.

Our main goal is to describe and model the energy transfer from laser to particles, from the transparent to less transparent regime of laser-plasma interaction in the ultra-high intensity regime, and using the results obtained to optimize laser ion acceleration. We investigate the case of an ultra high intensity (1022 W/cm2) ultra short (20 fs) laser pulse interacting with a near-critical density plasma made of electrons and protons of density 5 nc (where nc = 1.1·1021 cm-3 is the critical density for a laser wavelength of 1 µm). Through 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we study the optimal target thickness for the maximum conversion efficiency of the laser energy to particles. Theoretical modelling of the predominant laser-plasma interaction mechanisms predicts the particle energy and conversion efficiency optimization. Our studies led to an optimization of the target thickness for maximizing electron and proton acceleration.

The Physics Beyond Colliders initiative aims to exploit the full scientific potential of the CERN accelerator complex and its scientific infrastructure for particle physics studies, complementary to current and future collider experiments. Several experiments have been proposed to fully utilize and further advance the beam options for the existing fixed target experiments present in the North and East Experimental Areas of the CERN SPS and PS accelerators. We report on progress with the RF-separated beam option for the AMBER experiment, following a recent workshop on this topic. In addition we cover the status of studies for ion beams for the NA60+ experiment, as well as of those for high intensity beams for Kaon physics and feebly interacting particle searches. With first beams available in 2021 after a CERN-wide long shutdown, several muon beam options were already tested for the NA64mu, MUonE and AMBER experiments.

A transverse gradient undulator (TGU) is a key component compensating for the relatively large energy spread of Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA)-generated electron beams for realizing a compact Free Electron Laser (FEL). A superconducting TGU with 40 periods has been fabricated at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). In this contribution, we report that the superconducting TGU has been commissioned with nominal operational parameters at an off-line test bench. An experimental set-up for mapping the magnetic field on a two-dimensional grid in the TGU gap has been employed for the magnetic characterization. We show the first preliminary results of these measurements showing the longitudinal quality, the transverse gradient and the transient behaviour of the superconducting TGU field.

Particle beams with highly asymmetric emittance ratios, or flat beams, are employed at accelerator facilities such as the AWA and foreseen at FACET-II. Flat beams have been used to drive wakefields in dielectric structures and are an ideal candidate for high-gradient wakefields in plasmas. The high aspect ratio produces a blowout region that is elliptical in cross section and this asymmetry in the ion column structure creates asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. The ellipticity of the plasma blowout decreases as the normalized peak current increases, and gradually approaches an axisymmetric column. An appropriate matching condition for the beam envelope inside the elliptical blowout is introduced. Simulations are performed to investigate the ellipticity of the resultant wakefield based on the initial drive beam parameters, and are compared to analytical calculations. The parameter space for two cases at the AWA and FACET facilities, with requirements for plasma profile and achievable fields, is presented.

The performance expected from the next generation of electron accelerators is driving research into photocathode technology as this fundamentally limits the achievable beam quality. The performance characteristics of a photocathode are most notably; normalised emittance, brightness and energy spread*. Ultra–thin Oxide films on metal substrates have been shown to lower the work function (WF) of the surface, enhancing commonly utilised metal photocathodes, potentially improving lifetime and performance characteristics**. We present the characterisation of two MgO/Cu photocathodes grown at Daresbury. The surface properties such as; surface roughness, elemental composition and WF, have been studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The photoemissive properties have been characterised with quantum efficiency (QE) measurements at 266 nm. Additionally, we measure the Transverse Energy Distribution Curves (TEDC) for these photocathodes under illumination at various wavelengths using ASTeC’s Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS) and extract the Mean Transverse Energy (MTE)***.

A high-gradient X-band (11.7-GHz) photoinjector developed by Euclid Techlabs, was recently commissioned at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA). The system comprises a 1+1/2-cell RF gun powered by short RF pulses generated as a train of high-charge bunches from the AWA accelerator passes through a slow-wave power extraction and transfer structure. The RF photoinjector was reliably operating with electric fields in excess of 300 MV/m on the photocathode surface free of breakdown and with an insignificant dark-current level. We report on the RF-gun setup, commissioning, and the associated beam generation via photoemission.

Rapid advances in superconducting magnets and related accelerator technology opens many unexplored possibilities for future synchrotron designs. We present an efficient method to probe the feasible parameter space of synchrotron lattice configurations. Using this method, we can converge on a suite of optimal solutions with multiple optimisation objectives. It is a general method that can be adapted to other lattice design problems with different constraints or optimisation objectives. In this method, we tackle the lattice design problem using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The problem is encoded by representing the components of each lattice as columns of a matrix. This new method is an improvement over the neural network based approach* in terms of computational resources. We evaluate the performance and limitations of this new method with benchmark results.

The study of beam dynamics in accelerators featuring main magnets with complex geometries such as Fixed Field Accelerators (FFAs) requires simulation codes allowing step-by-step particle tracking in complex magnetic fields, such as the Zgoubi ray-tracing code. To facilitate the use of Zgoubi and to allow readily processing the resulting tracking data, we developed a modern Python 3 interface, Zgoubidoo, using Zgoubi in the backend. In this work, the key features of Zgoubidoo are illustrated by detailing the main steps to obtain a non-scaling FFA accelerator from a scaling design. The results obtained are in excellent agreement with prior results, including the tune computation and orbit shifts. These results are enhanced by Zgoubidoo beam dynamics analysis and visualization tools, including the placement of lattice elements in a global coordinate system and the computation of linear step-by-step optics. The validation of Zgoubidoo on conventional scaling and non-scaling FFA designs paves the way for future uses in innovative FFA design studies.

Fixed Field Alternating Gradient Accelerators have been proposed for a wide range of challenges, including rapid acceleration in a muon collider, and large energy acceptance beam transport for medical applications. A disadvantage of these proposals is the highly nonlinear field profile required to keep the tune energy-independent, known as the scaling condition. It has been shown computationally that approximately constant tunes can be achieved with the addition of nonlinear fields which do not follow this scaling law. However the impacts of these nonlinearities are not well understood. We present a new framework for adding nonlinearities to Fixed Field Accelerators, seeking a constant normalised focusing strength over the full energy range, and verify the results by simulation using Zgoubi. As a model use case, we investigate the degree of tune compensation that can be achieved in a Fixed Field Accelerator for ion cancer therapy.

The intensity frontier has called for new initiatives in hadron accelerator design in order to accommodate space charge dominated beams. Octupoles are often used to damp beam instabilities caused by space charge, however the insertion of octupole magnets leads to a nonintegrable lattice which reduces the area of stable particle motion. One proposed solution is Quasi-Integrable optics (QIO), where the octupoles are inserted between sections of a specific lattice insertion called a T-insert. An octupole with a strength that scales as 1/beta3(s) is applied in the drift region, where the horizontal and vertical beta functions are equal, to create a time independent octupole field. This leads to a lattice with a time-independent Hamiltonian which is robust to small perturbations. IBEX is a Paul trap which allows the transverse dynamics of a collection of trapped particles to be studied, mimicking the propagation through multiple quadrupole lattice periods, whilst remaining stationary in the laboratory frame. In order to test QIO at the IBEX experiment, it has recently undergone an upgrade to allow for the creation of octupole fields. We present our design of the IBEX experiment upgrade along with simulation results of our proposed experiment to test QIO with space charge.

The ECR ion sources are widely used to produce high intensities of highly charged positive ions*. To increase their performance further, several techniques are employed. The addition of a lighter gas into the main plasma (so-called gas mixing) shows a substantial effect on the charge state distribution of highly charged ions. Although many theoretical models were used to explain this gas mixing effect, yet it is not fully understood. The low energy ion beam facility (LEIBF) at Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi, India, which comprises a 10 GHz all-permanent magnet NANOGAN ECR source placed on a high voltage platform (400kV) has been used to develop several plasmas for the physical understanding of ions production and their confinement in a strong magnetic field**. Further, the LEIBF allows us to extract ion beams from the plasma in the energy range of a few keV to tens of MeV for novel ion-matter interaction experiments. In this paper, the charge state distribution studies (relevant to gas mixing effect) of various atomic species at optimized ion source tuning parameters along with some interesting results on materials synthesis/modification using ion beams is presented.

The Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre’s synchrotron makes use of the sextupole driven RF-KO method near the third-order resonance in order to slowly extract the beam that is delivered to the patients. The horizontal beam response of a coasting beam was studied experimentally and with simulations at extraction conditions in order to deduce regions of interest for an optimal excitation signal spectrum. Two narrow frequency regions were found were the beam reacts coherently. With these information an RF signal was proposed for the resonant slow extraction.

With the higher stored energy envisioned for future heavy-ion runs in the LHC and the challenging fragmentation aspect of heavy-ion beams due to interaction with collimator material, the need arises for even more performing collimation systems. One promising solution is crystal channeling, which is used in the HL-LHC baseline and starts with Run III for heavy-ion collimation. To investigate an optimal configuration for the collimation system, a well-tested simulation setup is required. This work shows the simulations of channeling and other coherent effects in the SixTrack-FLUKA Coupling simulation framework and compares simulated loss patterns with data from previous beam tests.

The effects of hysteresis on the fields produced by magnetic lenses are not accounted for in TRIUMF’s models of the accelerators. Under certain conditions, such as quadrupoles with unipolar power supplies operating at low currents, these effects have introduced significant field errors with consequences upon tranverse tunes. To combat these uncertainties and make the fields more reproducible and stable, a technique new to TRIUMF has been implemented. This technique ramps the current cyclically about the desired setpoint to reach a reproducible field that is independent of its history. Results of magnetic measurements at TRIUMF using this technique are presented, as well as the expected improvements to the accuracy of the beam optics model, particularly for unipolar quadrupoles.

Beam optics matching is a daily routine in the operation of an X-ray free-electron laser facility. Usually, linear optics is employed to conduct the beam matching in the control room. However, the collective effects like space charge dominate the electron bunch in the low-energy region which decreases the accuracy of the existing tool. Therefore, we proposed a scheme to construct a surrogate model with nonlinear optics and collective effects to speed up the optics matching in the European XFEL injector section. This model also facilitates further research on beam dynamics for the space-charge dominated beam.

In order to study the remaining open questions concerning CP violation and neutrino mass hierarchy, as well as to search for physics beyond the Standard Model, future experiments require precise measurements of the neutrino interaction cross-sections in the GeV/c regime. The absence of a precise knowledge of the neutrino flux currently limits this measurement to a 10-20% uncertainty level. The ENUBET project is proposing a novel facility, capable of constraining the neutrino flux normalization through the precise monitoring of kaon decay products in an instrumented decay tunnel. The collaboration has conducted numerous studies using a beam-line with a central Kaon momentum of 8.5 GeV/c and a ±10% momentum spread. We present here the design of a new beam-line, broadening the range of Kaons to include momenta of 4, 6, and 8.5 GeV/c, thus allowing ENUBET to explore cross-sections over a much larger energy range. In this contribution, we discuss the status of this design, the optimization studies performed, the early results, and the expected performance in terms of kaon and neutrino rates. We also present the first estimations of the background expected to be seen by the experiment.

Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) is R&D facility to evaluate final focus technology for small beam required by ILC. The final focus beamline(ATF2) sets the goal to achieve 37 nm vertical beam size and 41 nm beam size had been demonstrated. Moreover, a significant intensity dependence on a nanometer beam size was observed and several studies of the wakefield had been conducted [*,**,***]. ATF2 is a proper beamline for wakefield studies with low emittance beam and nanometer resolution cavity BPMs and a nanometer beam size monitor. The simulation results were qualitatively cross-checked with experimental results and showed that the effects of some vacuum components and BPMs were significant. Further analysis of the wakefield will be done for flexible components (e.g. bellows). An upgrade of the ATF2 beamline is proposed by including minimization of the wakefield sources, to establish technologies for stable nanometer beam.

This work presents a design study of a 200 MeV electron linear accelerator consisting of an electron gun, bunchers, and accelerator structures. We aimed to design the linac with low emittance and low energy spread. A coasting beam from a thermionic electron gun is bunched using a series of buncher cavities: sub-harmonic buncher (SHB), a pre-buncher (PB), and a Buncher. The bunched beam is then accelerated up to 200 MeV with 4 cascaded accelerating structures. The SHB was designed with one-cell standing wave structure for improving the bunching efficiency. The two types of the 500 MHz SHB were considered: elliptical and coupled-cavity linac types. We also investigated constant-gradient and constant-impedance types of 3 GHz multi-cell traveling wave resonators for following buncher cavities and accelerating structures. Depending on the type, geometries of each traveling wave structure (TWS) cavity were determined, and then the electromagnetic fields were calculated. RF powers and phases of each cavity along this linac system were optimized using beam dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the beam distributions in the transverse direction are adjusted using solenoid magnets in the lowenergy section as well as quad triplets in the high-energy section.

Preservation of the transverse emittances across the CERN accelerator chain is an important requirement for beams produced for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS), high brightness LHC-type beams are stored on a long flat bottom for up to 1.2 seconds. During this storage time, direct space charge effects may lead to resonance crossing and subsequent growth of the transverse emittances. Previous studies showed an important emittance increase when the PS working point is moved near integer tune values. Subsequent simulation studies confirmed that this observation is caused by an interplay of space charge effects and the optics beatings induced by the Low Energy Quadrupoles (LEQ). A new optics configuration using these quadrupoles to reduce the optics beating and the emittance growth was developed and experimentally validated. The results of simulation and experimental studies are presented in this contribution.

The Vertical Excursion Fixed Field Alternating Gradient Accelerator (VFFA) concept offers a number of advantages over existing accelerator archetypes, as discussed in previous works. However, the VFFA has nonplanar orbits by design and unavoidable transverse coupling. Hence, current understanding of the dynamics of this machine is limited; this paper presents some in-depth study of its behaviour using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

Iron-dominated superconducting magnets are one of the most popular and most used design choices for superconducting magnetic quadrupoles for accelerator systems. While the iron yoke and pole tips are economic and effective in shaping the field, the large amount of iron also leads to certain drawbacks, namely, unwanted harmonics from the sextupole correctors nested inside of the quadrupole. Additional problems include the nonlinear field profile present in the high-field regime engendered by the presence of steel, and the mechanical and cryogenic design challenges of the entire iron yoke being part of the cold mass. The presented work discusses these effects and challenges by comparing an iron-dominated quadrupole model to an equivalent coil-dominated quadrupole model. The comparison of their respective magnetic harmonics, integrated strength, multipole effects, and mechanical challenges demonstrates that the coil-dominated design is a more favorable choice for select accelerator systems.

Positron beams would provide new and meaningful probes for the experimental program at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), including but not limited to future hadronic physics and dark matter experiments. Critical requirements involve generating positron beams with a high degree of spin polarization, sufficient intensity and a continuous-wave (CW) bunch train compatible with acceleration to 12 GeV at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). To address these requirements, a polarized positron injector based upon the bremsstrahlung of an intense CW spin polarized electron beam is considered*. First a polarized electron beam line provides >1 mA of polarized electrons at ~120 MeV to a high-power target for positron production. Next, a second beam line collects, shapes and aligns the spin of positrons for users. Finally, the positron beam is matched into the CEBAF acceptance for acceleration and transport to the end stations with energies up to 12 GeV. An optimized layout to provide positrons beams with intensity >100 nA (polarized) or intensity >3 µA (unpolarized) will be discussed in this poster.

The longitudinal and transverse emittance growth in hadron beams due to intra-beam scattering (IBS) and other heating sources deteriorate the luminosity in a collider. Hence, a strong hadron beam cooling is required to reduce and preserve the emittance. The cooling of high energy hadron beam is challenging. We propose a dual energy storage ring-based electron cooler that uses an electron beam to extract heat away from hadron beam in the cooler ring while the electron beam is cooled by synchrotron radiation damping in the high energy damping ring. In this paper, we present a design of a dual energy storage ring-based electron cooler. Finally, the cooling performance is simulated using Jefferson Lab Simulation Package for Electron Cooling (JSPEC) for proton beams at the top energy of 275 GeV for Electron-Ion Collider.

The beamline design of recirculating linacs requires special attention to avoid beam instabilities due to RF wakefields. A proposed high-energy, multi-pass energy recovery demonstration at CEBAF uses a low beam current. Stronger focusing at lower energies is necessary to avoid beam breakup(BBU) instabilities, even with this small beam current. The CEBAF linac optics optimization balances over-focusing at higher energies and beta excursions at lower energies. Using proper mathematical expressions, linac optics optimization can be achieved with evolutionary algorithms. Here, we present the optimization process of North Linac optics using multi-objective optimization.

Nb3Sn is a prospective material for future superconducting RF (SRF) accelerator cavities. The material can achieve higher quality factors, higher temperature operation and potentially higher accelerating gradients (Eacc 96 MV/m) compared to conventional niobium. In this work, we performed modeling of the Upgraded Injector Test Facility (UITF) at Jefferson Lab utilizing newly constructed Nb3Sn cavities. We studied the effects of the buncher cavity and varied the gun voltages from 200-500 keV. We have calibrated and optimized the SRF cavity gradients and phases for the Nb3Sn five-cell cavities energy gains with the framework of General Particle Tracer (GPT). Our calculations show the beam goes cleanly through the unit. There is full energy gain out of the second SRF cavity but not from the first SRF cavity due to non-relativistic phase shifts.

The compact STorage ring for Accelerator Research and Technology cSTART project will deliver a new KIT accelerator test facility for the application of novel acceleration techniques and diagnostics. The goal is to demonstrate storing an electron beam of a Laser Plasma Accelerator (LPA) in a compact circular accelerator for the first time. Before installing an LPA, the Far-Infrared Linac and Test Experiment (FLUTE) will serve as a full energy injector for the compact storage ring, providing stable bunches with a length down to a few femtoseconds. The transport of the bunches from FLUTE to the cSTART storage ring requires a transfer line which includes horizontal, vertical and coupled deflections which leads to coupling of the dynamics in the two transverse planes. In order to realize ultra-short bunch lengths at the end of the transport line, it relies on special optics which invokes high and negative dispersion. This contribution presents dynamic aperture studies based on six-dimensional tracking through the lattice of the transfer line.

In superconducting circular particle accelerators, controlling beam losses is of paramount importance for ensuring optimal machine performance and an efficient operation. To achieve the required level of understanding of the mechanisms underlying beam losses, models based on global diffusion processes have recently been studied and proposed to investigate the beam-halo dynamics. In these models, the building block of the analytical form of the diffusion coefficient is the stability-time estimate of the Nekhoroshev theorem. In this paper, the developed models are applied to data acquired during collimation scans at the CERN LHC. In these measurements, the collimators are moved in steps and the tail population is re-constructed from the observed losses. This allows an estimate of the diffusion coefficient. The results of the analyses performed are presented and discussed in detail.

The Recycler Ring (RR) at the Fermilab Accelerator Complex performs slip-stacking on 8 GeV protons, doubling the beam intensity delivered to the Main Injector (MI). At MI, the beam is accelerated to 120 GeV and delivered to the high energy neutrino experiments. Femilab’s Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) will require the Recycler to store 50% more beam. Simulations have shown that the space charge tune shift at this new intensity will lead to the excitation of multiple resonance lines. Specifically, this study looks at normal sextupole lines 3 Qx=76 and Qx+2Qy=74, plus skew sextupole lines 3 Qy=73 and 2 Qx+Qy=75. Dedicated normal and skew sextupoles have been installed in order to compensate for these resonance lines. By measuring and calculating the Resonance Driving Terms (RDT), this study shows how each of the resonance lines can be compensated independently. Furthermore, this study shows and discusses initial investigations into compensating multiple lines simultaneously.

In this paper, we build upon previous work of designing RF structures that support modes with tailored multipolar fields by applying the concept to negate the transverse multipoles in accelerating RF cavities caused by the incorporation of waveguide slots and tuning deformations. We outline a systematic method for designing structures that minimise these transverse multipoles and present analysis of simulations of two different minimisation designs.

Radia 3D magnetostatics code has been used for the design of insertion devices for light sources over more than two decades. The code uses the magnetization integral approach that is efficient for solving permanent magnet and hybrid magnet structures. The initial version of the Radia code was sequential, its core written in C++ and interface in the Mathematica language. This paper describes a new Python-interfaced parallel version of Radia and its applications. The parallelization of the code was implemented on C++ level, following a hybrid approach. Semi-analytical calculations of interaction matrix elements and resultant magnetic fields were parallelized using the Message Passing Interface, whereas the parallelization of the "relaxation" procedure (solving for magnetizations in volumes created by subdivision) was executed using a shared memory method based on C++ multithreading. The parallel performance results are encouraging, particularly for magnetic field calculation post relaxation where a ~600 speedup with respect to sequential execution was obtained. The new parallel Radia version facilitates designs of insertion devices and lattice magnets for novel particle accelerators.

Crab Cavities are a key component of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade, as they aim to minimize the luminosity reduction caused by the crossing angle. Two superconducting crab cavities were installed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN in 2018 to test their operation in a proton machine for the first time. An important point to consider is the increase in transverse emittance induced by noise in the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system. During the first experimental campaign in 2018, the measured emittance growth was found to be a factor of 4 lower than predicted by the available analytical models. In this report, the effects of transverse beam impedance in the presence of CC LLRF noise on transverse emittance growth are presented and the results of the second experimental campaign, which took place in the SPS in 2021, are discussed.

In the context of SOLEIL Upgrade, the 4th generation storage ring project of SOLEIL, several methods are pursued to extend the beam lifetime and limit the emittance growth by reducing the Touschek effect and intra-beam scattering. Betatron coupling is one of the potential techniques to achieve this objective as it can increase the beam volume by transforming a flat beam into a round beam. However, the effect of the coupling on the collective effects is not fully comprehended, but some studies have shown an improvement in transverse instability thresholds. It was, therefore, crucial to investigate the impact of coupling on beam instability for SOLEIL Upgrade. This work presents numerical studies on the impact of coupling on the transverse mode-coupling and the head-tail instabilities. The results showed that coupling could be not only beneficial, but also detrimental.

Precise understanding of the microbunching instability is mandatory for the successful implementation of a compression strategy for advanced FEL operation modes such as the EEHG seeding scheme, which a key ingredient of the FLASH2020+ upgrade project. Simulating these effects using particle-tracking codes can be quite computationally intensive as an increasingly large number of particles is needed to adequately capture the dynamics occurring at small length scales and reduce artifacts from numerical shot-noise. For design studies as well as dedicated analysis of the microbunching instability semi-Lagrangian codes can have desirable advantages over particle-tracking codes, in particular due to their inherently reduced noise levels. However, rectangular high-resolution grids easily become computationally expensive. To this end we developed SelaV1D, a one dimensional semi-Lagrangian Vlasov solver, which employs tree-based domain decomposition to allow for the simulation of entire exotic phase-space densities as they occur at FELs. In this contribution we present results of microbunching studies conducted for the FLASH2020+ upgrade using SelaV1D.

The luminosity requirements of TeV-class linear colliders demand use of intense charged beams at high repetition rates. Such features imply multi-bunch operation with long current trains accelerated over the km length scale. Consequently, particle beams are exposed to the mutual parasitic interaction due to the long-range wakefields excited by the leading bunches in the accelerating structures. Such perturbations to the motion induce transverse oscillations of the bunches, potentially leading to instabilities such as transverse beam break-up. Here we present a dedicated tracking code that studies the effects of long-range transverse wakefield interaction among different bunches in linear accelerators. Being described by means of an efficient matrix formalism, such effects can be included while preserving short computational times. As a reference case, we use our code to investigate the performance of a state-of-the-art linear collider currently under design and, in addition, we discuss possible mitigation techniques based on frequency detuning and damping.

SIRIUS is the new storage ring-based 4th generation synchrotron light source built and operated by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM). In ultralow emittance storage rings such as SIRIUS, the dominant contribution to the beam lifetime is due to large angle scattering between electrons within the same bunch, namely the Touschek effect. We used the strategy of storing two bunches simultaneously with different currents to measure their Touschek lifetime independently of other contributions, such as gas scattering. The measurements were carried out in different conditions of bunch current and RF voltage to compare the experimental results with those expected from theory and simulations for SIRIUS.

The CERN ion injectors, SPS and LEIR, operate in a strong space charge and intra-beam scattering regime, which can lead to degradation of their beam performance. To optimize machine performance requires thus to study the interplay of these two effects in combined space charge and intrabeam scattering tracking simulations. In this respect, the kinetic theory approach of intra-beam scattering has been implemented in pyORBIT and benchmarked against analytical models. First results of combined space charge and intra-beam scattering simulations for SPS and LEIR are presented in this contribution. The simulation results are compared with observations from beam measurements.

Following the upgrades of the LHC Injectors Upgrade Project (LIU), the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) at CERN successfully delivers beams with double brightness. An important contributing factor for this was the dynamic correction of the beta-beating induced by the injection chicane, which allowed stable operation closer to the half-integer resonance. Ideally, injection above the half-integer resonance could further improve the beam brightness. In this context, a series of studies were initiated in order to characterize the effects of space charge when crossing the half-integer resonance. In this contribution, the first results of these investigations are reported.

Beam dynamics studies are performed in the context of a C-Band hybrid photo-injector project developed by a collab- oration between UCLA/Sapienza/INFN-LNF/RadiaBeam. These studies aim to explain beam behaviour through the beam-slice evolution, using analytical and numerical approaches. An understanding of the emittance oscillations is obtained starting from the slice analysis, which allows correlation of the position of the emittance minima with the slope of the slices in the transverse phase space (TPS). At the end, a significant reduction in the normalized emittance is obtained by varying the transverse shape of the beam while assuming a longitudinal Gaussian distribution. Indeed, the emittance growth due to nonlinear space-charge fields has been found to occur immediately after moment of the beam emission from the cathode, giving insight into the optimum laser profile needed for minimizing the emittance.

Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) is a pump-probe experimental technique that aims to image the structural changes that happen in a target structure due to photo-excitation. Development of MeV UED capabilities is one of the main objectives at Sealab, a superconducting RF accelerator facility being commissioned in Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. In order to perform UED experiments, the optimization of temporal resolution is of the utmost importance. The composition of the SRF Photoinjector, currently the main beam-line in Sealab, offers superb flexibility to manipulate the longitudinal phase-space of the electron bunch. At the same time, the CW operation of the accelerator provides an enhanced beam stability compared to warm guns, together with MHz repetition rates. This work aims to show the capacity of the SRF Photoinjector in Sealab to reach the required temporal resolution and explain the development and current status of the necessary tools to perform UED experiments at the facility.

To achieve sufficient particle delay with respect to the optical path in order to enable high gain amplification, the design of the Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) experiment in the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) places the pickup (PU) and kicker (KU) undulators approximately 80 m apart. The arrival times at the KU of particles and the light they produce in the PU must be synchronized to an accuracy of less than an optical wavelength, which for this experiment is 780 nm. To test this synchronization, a planned demonstration of the stability of the bypass in CESR is presented where, in lieu of undulators, an interference pattern formed with radiation from two dipoles flanking the bypass is used. In addition to demonstrating stability, the fringe visibility of the pattern is related to the cooling ranges, a critical parameter needed for OSC. We present progress on this stabilization experiment including the design of a second-order isochronous bypass, as well as optimizations of the Dynamic Aperture (DA) and injection efficiency.

At present, one of diseases that kills many people worldwide is cancer. The FLASH radiotherapy (RT) is a promising cancer treatment under study. It involves the fast delivery of RT at much higher dose rates than those currently used in clinical practice. The very short time of exposure leads to the destruction of the cancer cells, while the nearby normal cells are less damaged as compared with conventional RT. This work focuses on study of FLASH-RT experiment using electron beams produced from the accelerator system at the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory. The structure and properties of our electron pulses with microbunches in picosecond time scale and macropulses in microsecond time scale match well to FLASH-RT requirement. To optimize the condition for experiment, the electron beam simulations are performed by varying energy, charge and bunch length. The 25 MeV electrons energy before hitting the window for 50 and 100 pC bunch length have a bunch length of 1.16 and 1.97 ps. The transverse rms beam sizes of 50 pC and 100 pC bunch charges have the differences between ASTRA and GEANT4 from 7.90 % to 34.0 %. The optimized electron beam properties from this study will be used as the guideline for further simulation and experiment preparation.

The matter-antimatter asymmetry might be understood by investigating the EDM (Electric Dipole Moment) of elementary charged particles. A permanent EDM of a subatomic particle violates time reversal and parity symmetry at the same time and would be, with the currently achievable experimental accuracy, an indication for further CP violation than established in the Standard Model. The JEDI-Collaboration (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) in Jülich has performed a direct EDM measurement for deuterons with the so called precurser experiments at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron). In order to understand the measured data and to disentangle an EDM signal from systematic effects, spin tracking simulations in an accurate simulation model of COSY are needed. Therefore a model of COSY was implemented using the software library Bmad. Systematic effects were considered by including element misalignments, effective dipole shortening and steerer kicks. These effects rotate the invariant spin axis additional to the EDM and have to be analyzed and understood. The most recent spin tracking results as well as the methods to find the invariant spin axis will be presented.

The Transverse Feedback system at the Canadian Light Source can identify, categorize, and mitigate against periodic instabilities that arise in the storage ring beam. By quickly opening and closing the feedback loop, previously mitigated instabilities will be allowed to grow briefly before being damped by the system. The resulting growth in the beam oscillation amplitude curve can be analyzed to determine growth/damp rates and modes of the coupled bunch oscillations. Further measurements can be collected via active excitement of modes rather than passive growth. These Grow/damp and Excite/Damp curves have been collected and analyzed for various storage ring beam properties, including beam energy, machine chromaticity, and in-vacuum insertion device gap widths.

The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research FAIR, in Darmstadt Germany, will be one of the largest accelerator laboratories worldwide. The Superconducting FRagment Separator (Super-FRS)* is one of its main components. The Super-FRS can produce, separate and deliver high-energy radioactive beams with intensities up to 1e11 ions/s, covering projectiles from protons up to uranium and it can be used as an independent experimental device. The Gas Electron Multiplier-based Time Projection Chambers (GEM-TPC) in twin configuration is a newly developed beam tracking detector capable of providing spatial resolution of less than 1 mm with a tracking efficiency close to 100% at 1 MHz counting rate. The GEM-TPC (HGB4) was tested at the FRagment Separator (FRS), with 238U beam at 850 MeV/u. A new clusterization method was developed, for the first time and used for an analysis. This method allowed to access to waveforms of each strip signal within a single trigger in an event-by-event basis. The procedures involved in this method will be shown in details.

We present an overview of the diagnostics screens stations - named SSTs - of the ThomX compact Compton source. ThomX is a compact light source based on Compton backscattering. It features a linac and a storage ring in which the electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. Each SST is composed of three screens, a YAG:Ce screen and an Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) screen for transverse measurements and a calibration target for magnification and resolution characterisation. The optical system is based on commercial lenses that have been reverse-engineered. An Arduino is used to control both the aperture and the focus remotely, while the magnification must be modified using an external motor. We report on the overall performance of the station as measured during the first steps of beam commissioning and on the optical system remote operations.

Transverse excitation of stored particle beams is required for a number of applications in accelerators. Using a time-varying, transverse electric field with a dedicated frequency spectrum, the amplitude and coherence of betatron oscillations can be increased in a controlled manner. This allows for determination of the betatron tune from turn-by-turn position measurements, control of transverse beam shapes, as well as extraction of stored beams. For studies of beam excitation, a custom signal generator is being developed. It is based on software-defined radio (SDR) which allows for configurable signal characteristics and tuneable spectra. This approach enables usage for multiple applications in beam diagnostics and control. To determine appropriate excitation spectra, studies of particle dynamics in presence of excitation are being carried out. Nonlinear fields are also incorporated to account for beam extraction conditions, which affects frequency spectra of beam motion due to detuning effects.

Room temperature terahertz (THz) detectors based on Field effect transistors (FETs) and Zero-bias Schottky diodes (SD) are prominent members for the temporal-spatial characterization of pulses down to the picosecond scale generated at particle accelerators. Comparative study of in house developed THz detectors both at higher and intermediate frequency (IF) is carried out using table top THz systems and commercially available sources. In this paper, we present high frequency and intermediate frequency (IF) response of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) FET and Zero-bias Schottky diode THz detectors. The IF results obtained are helpful for understanding and designing of optimized IF circuit with broader bandwidth.

The ARES linear accelerator at DESY aims to deliver stable and well-characterized electron bunches with durations down to the sub-fs level. Such bunches are highly sought after to study the injection into novel high-gradient accelerating structures, test diagnostics devices, or perform autonomous accelerator studies. For such applications, it is advantageous to have a complete and detailed knowledge of the beam properties. Tomographic methods have shown to be a key tool to reconstruct the phase space of beams. Based on these techniques, a novel diagnostics method is being developed to resolve the full 5-dimensional phase space (x,x’,y,y’,z) of bunches including their transverse and longitudinal distributions and correlations. In simulation studies, this method shows an excellent agreement between the reconstructed and the original distribution for all five planes. Here, the 5-dimensional phase space tomography method is presented using a showcase simulation study at ARES.

A prototype of a Beam Loss Monitor based on the detection of Cherenkov light in optical fibres is being developed to measure beam losses in the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. Several testing campaigns have been planned to benchmark the simulations of the system and test the electronics in the CLEAR facility at CERN. During the first campaigns, the emission of Cherenkov light inside optical fibres and the photodetector characterisation were studied. Fibre-based Beam Loss monitors continuously monitor beam losses over long distances. The localisation of the beam loss could be calculated from the timing of the signals generated by the photosensors coupled at both ends of the optical fibre. The experimental results of an optical fibre Beam Loss Monitor installed in the CLEAR facility are reported in this paper.

Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) diamond detectors have been tested during the Run 2 operation period (2015-2018) as fast beam loss monitors for the Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. However, the lack of raw data recorded during this operation period restrains our ability to perform a deep analysis of their signals. For this reason, a test campaign was carried out at the CLEAR beam test facility at CERN with the aim of studying the linearity and response time of the diamond detectors against losses from electron beams of different intensities. The signal build-up from multi-bunched electron beams was also analyzed. The conditions and procedures of the test campaign are explained, as well as the most significant results obtained.

At the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory (PCELL), we aim to produce a mid-infrared free-electron laser (MIR-FEL) for pump-probe experiments in the future. The electron beam is generated from a thermionic cathode radio-frequency (RF) gun with a 1.5-cell cavity before going to an alpha magnet. In this section, some part of the beam is filtered out by using energy slits. The selected part of the beam is then further accelerated by an RF linear accelerator (linac) to get higher energy. This work focuses on the measurement of energy spectrum of electron beam for producing mid-infrared free-electron laser (MIR-FEL). Since our bunch compressor (BC) for the MIR-FEL beamline is an achromat system, the longitudinal distributions of electron beam at the entrance and the exit of the BC are almost the same. Thus, we can measure the longitidinal properties of the beam before it travels to the BC. By using a dipole magnet and a Faraday cup with a slit, we can measure energy spectrum of electron beam before entering the BC. In this study, the ASTRA code is used to investigate the properties of electron beam as well as to design the measuring system. The design results including systematic error of the measuring system are presented and discussed in this contribution. The results from this work can be used as the guideline for the measuring system construction as well as the beam operation.

The linear accelerator system at the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory (PCELL) is used to produce electron beam with suitable properties for generating coherent teragertz (THz) radiation and mid-infrared free-electron laser (MIR FEL). Optimization of machine parameters to produce short electron bunches with low energy spread and low transverse emittance was focused in this study. We conducted ASTRA simulations including three-dimentional (3D) space charge algorithm and 3D field distributions for radio-frequency (RF) electron gun and all magnets to develop measuring systems. Electron beam energy and energy spread were investigated downstream the RF gun and the RF linac using an alpha magnet and a dipole spectrometer, respectively. The transverse beam emittance was studied using the quadrupole scan technique. By filtering proper portion of electrons before entering the linac, the beam with average energy of 20 MeV and energy spread of 0.1-1% can be achieved for a bunch charge of 100 pC. The systematic error is less than 10% for measuring average energy and energy spread while it is less than 31% for measuring transverse emittance when placing the screen of at least 1.0 m behind the scanning quadrupole magnet. The results of this study were used to develop the measuring setups in our system.

The Advanced Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE) at CERN uses 6 cm long proton bunches extracted from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at 400 GeV beam energy to drive high gradient plasma wakefields for the acceleration of electron bunches to 2 GeV within a 10 m length. Knowledge and control of the position of both copropagating beams is crucial for the operation of the experiment. Whilst the current electron beam position monitoring system at AWAKE can be used in the absence of the proton beam, the proton bunch signal dominates when both particle bunches are present simultaneously. A new technique based on the generation of Cherenkov diffraction radiation (ChDR) in a dielectric material placed in close proximity to the particle beam has been designed to exploit the large bunch length difference of the particle beams at AWAKE, 200 ps for protons versus a few ps for electrons, such that the electron signal dominates. Hence, this technique would allow for the position measurement of a short electron bunch in the presence of a more intense but longer proton bunch. The design considerations, numerical analysis and plans for tests at the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) facility are presented.

Proton therapy systems are used worldwide for patient treatment and fundamental research. The generation of secondary particles when the beam interacts with the beamline elements is a well-known issue. In particular, the energy degrader is the dominant source of secondary radiation. This poses new challenges for the concrete shielding of compact systems and beamline elements activation computation. We use a novel methodology to seamlessly simulate all the processes relevant to the activation evaluation. A realistic model of the system is developed using Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM), a Geant4-based particle tracking code that allows a single model to simulate primary and secondary particle tracking and all particle-matter interactions. The secondary particle fluxes extracted from the simulations are provided as input to FISPACT-II to compute the activation by solving the rate equations. This approach is applied to the Ion Beam Applications (IBA) Proteus®ONE (P1) system and the shielding of the proton therapy research centre of Charleroi, Belgium. Proton loss distributions are used to model the production of secondary neutrals inside the accelerator structure. Two models for the distribution of proton losses are compared for the computation of the clearance index at specific locations of the design. Results show that the variation in the accelerator loss models can be characterised as a systematic error.

KEK LUCX facility* is a linear accelerator devoted to the beam instrumentation R&Ds for present and future accelerator systems and colliders including ILC. According to the ILC TDR**, it is necessary to achieve RF-gun Laser-to-RF&RF-to-RF phase stability of 0.35°(RMS) and amplitude stability of 0.07%(RMS) with implementation of the Digital LLRF feedback based on commercially available FPGA board and digital trigger system. As the first step to achieve ILC stability level at KEK-LUCX facility, present Laser-to-RF&RF-to-RF phase and amplitude jitters were measured using time- and frequency-domain techniques. After that, jitter influence on beam parameters after RF-gun and main solenoid magnet was simulated with ASTRA tracking code*** and results were cross-checked during LUCX facility beam operation. Finally, stable digital trigger system and digital LLRF feedback based on SINAP EVG&EVR and RedPitaya SIGNALlab-250 modules were implemented. This report demonstrates the results of Laser-to-RF&RF-to-RF phase and amplitude jitter measurements cross-checked with ASTRA simulation and real beam parameters measurements before and after LUCX facility stabilization.

Low emittance electron beams are of high importance at facilities like the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) at SLAC. Emittance dilution effects due to off-axis beam transport for a TESLA-type cryomodule (CM) have been shown at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility. The results showed the correlation between the electron beam-induced cavity high-order modes (HOMs) and the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) measurements downstream the CM. Mitigation of emittance dilution can be achieved by reducing the HOM signals. Here, we present a couple of Neural Networks (NN) for bunch-by-bunch mean prediction and standard deviation prediction for BPMs located downstream the CM.

Understanding and mitigating particle losses in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is essential for both machine safety and efficient operation. Abnormal loss distributions are telltale signs of abnormal beam behaviour or incorrect machine configuration. By leveraging the advancements made in the field of Machine Learning, a novel data-driven method of detecting anomalous loss distributions during machine operation has been developed. A neural network anomaly detection model was trained to detect Unidentified Falling Object events using stable beam, Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) data acquired during the operation of the LHC. Data-driven models, such as the one presented, could lead to significant improvements in the autonomous labelling of abnormal loss distributions, ultimately bolstering the ever ongoing effort toward improving the understanding and mitigation of these events.

The research concerns the study of the plasma sources for plasma-based accelerators (PBAs) at the SPARC_LAB test-facility (LNF-INFN). The interest in compact accelerators, overcoming the gigantism of the conventional radio-frequency (RF) accelerators, is growing in High Energy Physics. The plasma-based accelerating gradients can attain the GV/m scale. At the SPARC_LAB test-facility, a plasma device is under development. It consists of a capillary in which one or more inlets inject neutral gas (Hydrogen), ionized by a high-voltage (HV) discharge. Electron density has been measured as a function of time through the Stark broadening profiles of the Balmer line.

Trapped magnetic flux in superconducting cavities can significantly increase surface resistance, and, thereby, limits the cavities’ performance. To reduce trapped flux in cavities, a better understanding of the fundamental mechanism of flux trapping is vital. We develop a new experimental design: measuring magnetic flux density at 15 points just above a niobium sheet of dimensions (100 x 60 x 3) mm with a time resolution of up to 2 ms and a flux resolution better than 0.5 µT. This setup allows us to control the temperature gradient and cooldown rate, both independently of each other, as well as the magnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We present data gathered on a large-grain sample as well as on a fine-grain sample. Our data suggests that not only the temperature gradient but also the cooldown rate affects trapped flux. Additionally, we detect a non-trivial relationship between trapped flux and magnitude of applied field.

New CH-DTL cavities designs of the planned Helmholtz Linear Accelerator (HELIAC) are developed in collaboration of HIM, GSI and IAP Frankfurt. The linac, operated in cw-mode with a final energy of 7.3 MeV/u, is intended for various experiments, in particular with heavy ions at energies close to the Coulomb barrier for research on SHE. Twelve sc CH cavities are foreseen, divided into four different cryostats. Each cavity will be equipped with dynamic bellow tuner. After successful beam tests with CH0, CH3 to CH11 are being designed. Based on the experience gained so far, optimization will be made, which will lead to both an increase in performance in terms of reducing the peak fields limiting superconductivity and a reduction in manufacturing costs and time. In order to optimize manufacturing, attention was paid to design many parts of the cavity, such as lids, spokes, tuner and helium shell, with the same geometrical dimensions. In addition, a tuner test rig was developed, which will be used to investigate the mechanical properties of the bellow tuner. For this purpose, different simulations were made in order to realize conditions as close as possible to reality in the test rig.

Annealings of niobium cavities in UHV or nitrogen atmospheres are crucial for the performance in the later cryogenic tests and operation. Recovery methods for imperfect annealing conditions have been discussed, and a more recent proposal, the so-called "nitric acid soak" has been studied here in detail. It shows surprising recovery potential, albeit the unclear origin of this improvement. We present our investigation on the several potential origins. For this, we used SEM, SIMS and XPS measurements of niobium samples to study the surface morphology and contaminations. We can reject the favored hypothesis on the origin of the improvement, and propose an alternative origin.

Magnetic flux trapped in the niobium bulk material of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities degrades their quality factor and the accelerating gradient. The sensitivity for flux trapping is mainly determined by the treatment and the geometry of the cavity as well as the niobium grain size and orientation. To potentially improve the flux expulsion characteristics of SRF cavities and hence the efficiency of future accelerator facilities, further studies of the trapping behavior are essential. For this purpose a magnetometric mapping system to monitor the magnetic flux along the outer cavity surface of 1.3 GHz TESLA-Type single-cell SRF cavities has been developed and is currently in the commissioning phase at DESY. Contrary to similar approaches, this system digitizes the sensor signals already inside of the cryostat to extensively reduce the number of required cable feedthroughs. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and consequently the measuring sensitivity can be enhanced by shorter analog signal lines, less thermal noise and the Mu-metal shielding of the cryostat. In this contribution test results gained by a prototype of the mapping system are presented.

Recent technological advances and material treatments have pushed Nb SRF cavities to their maximum RF performance. A novel approach for overcoming this limitation, which takes advantage of RF field only penetrates into the superconductor at a certain distance called London penetration depth, is nano-structuring multilayers with PEALD (plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition). SIS (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) multilayers provide magnetic screening of the bulk Nb cavity, increasing the field at which the vortex penetration starts, and higher quality factor. ALD is closely related to chemical vapor deposition and bases on sequential self-limit gas-solid surface reactions facilitating conformal coatings with sub-nm precision even on complex substrates such as the interior of a cavity. As a preliminary study for SIS SRF cavities, we investigated the AlN-NbTiN/NbN multilayers grown by PEALD. Different compositions, thicknesses, and post-deposition thermal treatments have been investigated. The characterization results of superconducting properties, elemental composition, crystallinity, and cross-section are shown in this contribution.

The Future Circular electron-positron Collider (FCC-ee) is planned to operate with beam energies from 45.6 to 182.5 GeV and beam currents from 5.4 to 1390 mA. The purpose is to study the properties of the Z-, W- and Higgs boson and the top and anti-top quarks in four operation points. The beam current of 147 mA of the W working point requires particular care to string damp HOMs. This paper proposes 2-cell 400 MHz SRF cavities with improved damping as an alternative to the baseline 4-cell cavities for this working point. The resulting impedance of the HOM-damped cavity is then calculated and compared with the impedance budget.

Thin polycrystalline Nb metal foils were treated in N2 gas atmospheres at elevated temperatures of 900 °C up to 1200 °C. A combination of transmission mode Quick X-ray absorption spectroscopy (QEXAFS) at the Nb-K-edge and X-ray diffraction (XRD) used in parallel were used to investigate changes in the atomic short and long-range structure of the bulk Nb-material in-situ. A dedicated high-vacuum heating cell with a base pressure of 10-6 mbar was used to perform the heat treatments under vacuum and nitrogen gas atmosphere. The treatments typically included (i) a preheating at 900 °C under high-vacuum, (ii) a treatment in 3 mbar nitrogen gas at the desired temperature and (iii) a cooldown to room temperature under vacuum conditions. The QEXAFS and XRD data were collected in parallel during the entire process with a time resolution of 4 s. While the samples treated at 900 °C show the typical N-uptake to the octahedral interstitial sites, the samples treated at higher temperatures show the growth of distinct niobium nitride phases. The results will be discussed in more details during the conference.

Recent findings in the superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) community have shown that introducing certain impurities into high-purity niobium can improve quality factors and accelerating gradients. Success has been found in nitrogen-doping, diffusion of the native oxide into the niobium surface, and thin films of alternate superconductors atop a niobium bulk cavity. We question why some impurities improve RF performance while others hinder it. The purpose of this study is to characterize the impurity profile of niobium with a low residual resistance ratio (RRR) and correlate these impurities with the RF performance of low RRR cavities so that the mechanism of recent impurity-based improvements can be better understood and improved upon. Additionally, we perform a low temperature bake on the low RRR cavity to evaluate how the intentional addition of oxygen to the RF layer affects performance. We have found that low RRR cavities experience low temperature-dependent BCS resistance behavior more prominently than their high RRR counterparts. The results of this study have the potential to unlock a new understanding on SRF materials.

Nb3Sn is the most promising alternative material for achieving superior performance in Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) cavities, compared to conventional bulk Nb cavities now used in accelerators. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an alternative to the vapor diffusion-based Nb3Sn growth technique predominantly used on bulk niobium cavities and may enable reaching superior RF performance at reduced cost. In collaboration with Cornell, Ultramet has developed CVD process capabilities and reactor designs to coat copper SRF cavities with thick and thin films of Nb and Nb3Sn. In this paper, we present our latest research efforts on CVD Nb3Sn-on-copper SRF cavities, including RF performance test results from two 1.3 GHz SRF cavities coated by Ultramet.

A new frontier in Superconducting RF (SRF) development is increasing the accessibility of SRF technology to small-scale accelerator operations which are used in various industrial or research applications. This is made possible by using commercial cryocoolers as a cooling source, which removes the need for expensive liquid cryogenics and their supporting infrastructure. Cornell University is currently developing a new cryomodule based on a conduction cooling scheme. This cryomodule will use two pulse tube cryocoolers in place of liquid cryogenics in order to cool the system. A new 1.3 GHz cavity has been designed with a set of four niobium rings welded at the equator and irises which allow for a direct thermal link between the cavity and cryocooler cold heads. The cavity will use two coaxial RF input couplers capable of delivering up to 100 kW total RF power for high-current beam operation. This coupler design was modified from the Cornell ERL injector couplers, including simplifications such as removing the cold RF window and most outer bellows, while retaining inner bellows for adjustable coupling.

Our goal is to develop new materials and protocols for the growth and preparation of thin-film and layered superconductors for next generation SRF cavities with higher performance for future accelerators. We are working primarily with Nb3Sn to achieve this goal, as well as other materials which aim to optimize the RF field penetration layer of the cavity. This contribution gives a general update on our most recent cavity test results. A deeper insight into RF loss distribution and dynamics during cavity testing is gained using a new global high-speed temperature mapping system (T-Map).

Niobium is the material of choice to build superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, which are fundamental building blocks of modern particle accelerators. These cavities require a cryogenic cool-down to ~2 - 4 K for optimum performance minimizing RF losses on the inner cavity surface. However, temperature-independent residual losses in SRF cavities cannot be prevented entirely. One of the significant contributor to residual losses is trapped magnetic flux. The flux trapping mechanism depends on different factors, such as surface preparations and cool-down conditions. We have developed a diagnostic magnetic field scanning system (MFSS) using Hall probes and anisotropic magneto-resistance sensors to study the spatial distribution of trapped flux in 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities. The first result from this newly commissioned system revealed that the trapped flux on the cavity surface might redistribute with increasing RF power. The MFSS was also able to capture significant magnetic field enhancement at specific cavity locations after a quench.

The injector linear accelerator (LINAC) for the CEPC requires a higher efficiency klystron with 80MW output power than S band 65MW pulsed klys-tron currently operating in LINAC of BEPCII to reduce energy consumption and cost. The efficiency is ex-pected to improve from the currently observed 42% to more than 55% and output power will be improved from 65MW to more than 80MW with same operation voltage. In this paper, BAC bunching method is ap-plied for klystron efficiency improvement. The optimi-zation of the gun and solenoid parameters is complet-ed with 2-D code DGUN and then 3-D code CST. The preliminary design of the cavity parameters is also completed in 1-D disk model based AJDISK code and then further checked by 2-D code EMSYS. Finally, new klystron prototype will be fabricated in Chinese com-pany after design parameters are determined.

The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab will measure the rate for neutrinoless-conversion of negative muons into electrons with never-before-seen precision. This experiment will use a pulsed 8 GeV proton beam with pulses separated by 1.7 µs. To suppress beam induced backgrounds to this process, a set of dipoles operating at 300 kHz and 4.4 MHz have been developed that will reduce the fraction of out-of-time protons at the level of 1E-10 or less. Selection of magnetic ferrite material for construction must be carefully considered given the high repetition rate and duty cycle that can lead to excess heating in conventional magnetic material. A model of the electromagnetic and thermal properties of candidate ferrite materials has been constructed. Magnetic permeability, inductance, and power loss were measured at the two operating frequencies in toroidal ferrite samples as well as in the ferrites from which prototype magnets were built. Additionally, the outgassing rates of the ferrite material was measured to determine vacuum compatibility. The outcome of this work is a detailed specification of the electrical and mechanical details of the ferrite material required for this application.

High-Gradient accelerating cavities are one of the main research lines in the development of compact linear colliders. However, the operation of such cavities is currently limited by non-linear effects that are intensified at high electric fields, such as dark currents and radiation emission or RF breakdowns. A new normal-conducting High Gradient S-band Backward Travelling Wave accelerating cavity for medical application (v=0.38c) designed and constructed at CERN is being tested at IFIC. In this paper, we present experimental measurements and simulation of such non-linear effects. The main goal of these studies is to establish the viability of using these techniques in linear accelerators, in order to improve our understanding in such effects. The main goal of these studies is to determine the viability of using this techniques in linear accelerators for hadrontherapy treatments in hospitals.

For an electron-positron collider like FCC-ee, the production of positrons plays a crucial role. One of the design options considered for the FCC-ee positron source employs a superconducting solenoid made of HTS coils as an adiabatic matching device. The solenoid, which is placed around the production target, is needed to capture positrons before they can be accelerated in a linear accelerator. A superconducting solenoid yields a higher peak field than a conventional-normal conducting magnetic flux concentrator, therefore increasing the achievable positron yield. In order to achieve an acceptable positron production, the considered target is made of tungsten-rhenium, which gives also a significant flux of un-wanted secondary particles, that in turn could generate a too large radiation load on the superconducting coils. In this study, we assess the feasibility of such a positron source by studying the heat load and long-term radiation damage in the superconducting matching device and surrounding structures. Results are presented for different geometric configurations of the superconducting matching device.

Accelerator Driven Systems are advanced systems for the use of Thorium as fuel, aiming to reduce nuclear waste through transmutation. The spallation target, which is responsible for producing neutrons, is one of the main parts of the ADS system. In this research, neutronic parameters of spallation targets consisting of several materials LBE, Mercury, Lead, Mercury on the cylindrical, box, and conic shapes using Monte Carlo codes (FLUKA, PHITS, MCNPX) was investigated. Energy Deposition and spallation neutron yield of spallation target with different shapes and dimensions have been calculated to optimization of the target. According to the results, the neutron yield values from MCNPX and PHITS are similar and it’s close to the experimental result. On the other hand, the error rate of the values in FLUKA is higher.

Translation of electron FLASH radiotherapy in clinical practice requires the use of high energy accelerators to treat deep tumours and Very High Electron Energy (VHEE) could represent a valid technique to achieve this goal. In this sce- nario, a VHEE FLASH linac is under study at the University La Sapienza of Rome (Italy) in collaboration with the Italian Institute for Nuclear Research (INFN) and the Curie Insti- tute (France). Here we present the preliminary results of a compact C-band system aiming to reach an high accelerating gradient and an high pulse current necessary to deliver high dose per pulse and ultra-high dose rate required for FLASH effect. We propose a system composed of a low energy high current injector linac followed by a modular section of high accelerating gradient structures. CST code is used to define the required LINAC’s RF parameters and beam dynamics simulations are performed using T-Step, ASTRA and GPT tracking codes.

Storage ring has been improved to achieve high brightness of x-ray light source by making beam size and beam emittance smaller and enlarging the beam intensity. To achieve requirements such as a small beam emittance, the magnets need to have a larger magnetic field gradient and complex function with small aperture size. Since the complex structure and small beam size accompany with large errors in beam dynamics by high order field distortion of the magnets, it is important to measure the harmonics of the magnet in order to measure and improve it. Traditional field measurement methods such as hall probe and rotating loop have difficulty in measuring the harmonics of a magnet with a small aperture due to restrictions that physical size of the hall sensor and loop-card respectively. We developed Single Stretched Wire (SSW) method for the magnetic field measurement method on a small aperture magnet, in particular harmonics of the magnet. The system consists of a thin wire, accurate actuator system, and voltmeter. We describe the development of the SSW system and the result of the performance test by using our system in this paper.

Currently, the storage ring vacuum chambers of ALBA are protected by 156 crotch absorbers made of copper and Glidcop. After more than 10 years of operation as a third-generation light source, the ALBA II project arose, aiming to transform this infrastructure into a fourth-generation synchrotron. This introduces new challenges in terms of the thermal and mechanical design of the future absorbers. The absorbers’ cooling channels consist of a set of 8-mm-diameter holes parallel to each other and drilled into the body of the absorbers. In each hole, there is a 6x1 mm stainless steel concentric inner tube coiled in spiral wires, whose aim is to enhance the heat transfer. The convective heat transfer coefficients used for the original design of the absorbers come from experimental correlations from the literature, and are applied as a global value for the whole system. In this work, Heat Transfer-Computational Fluid Dynamics (HT-CFD) studies of the convective heat transfer coefficients and pressure gradients in three different cooling channel geometries are carried out, aiming at leading the way of designing the cooling systems toward the CFD simulations rather than applying global experimental values. This information will be useful for the sizing of the new absorbers for the ALBA II project.

Proton therapy is a well established treatment method for ocular cancerous diseases. General-purpose multi-room systems which comprise eye-treatment beamlines must be thoroughly optimized to achieve the performances of fully dedicated systems in terms of depth-dose distal fall-off, lateral penumbra, and dose rate. For eye-treatment beamlines, the dose rate is one of the most critical clinical performances, as it directly defines the delivery time of a given treatment session. This delivery time must be kept as low as possible to reduce uncertainties due to undesired patient movement. We propose an alternative design of the Ion Beam Applications (IBA) Proteus Plus (P+) eye treatment beamline, which combines a beam-stopping device with the already existing scattering features of the beamline. The design is modelled with Beam Delivery SIMulation (BDSIM), a Geant4-based particle tracking and beam-matter interactions Monte-Carlo code, to demonstrate that it increases the maximum achievable dose rate by up to a factor §I{3} compared to the baseline configuration. An in-depth study of the system is performed and the resulting dosimetric properties are discussed in detail.

The Next Ion Medical Machine Study (NIMMS) is an umbrella R&D programme for CERN accelerator technologies targeting advanced accelerator options for proton and light ion therapy. In collaboration with the European program HITRIplus, one area of study is slow extraction which is required to deliver a uniform beam spill for radiotherapy treatment. Several techniques use the third-order resonance to extract hadrons; these include betatron core driven extraction and radiofrequency knock-out. Flexible simulations tools using these techniques were prepared and initially benchmarked with results from the literature that used the Proton-Ion Medical Machine Study (PIMMS) design. The limits of the current PIMMS design were then pushed to evaluate its compatibility to deliver >10x higher intensity ion beams, and using increased extraction rates.

IMPACT (Isotope and Muon Production with Advanced Cyclotron and Target Technologies) is a proposed initiative envisaged for the high-intensity proton accelerator facility (HIPA) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). As part of IMPACT, a radioisotope target station, TATTOOS (Targeted Alpha Tumour Therapy and Other Oncological Solutions) will allow the production of terbium radionuclides for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The proposed TATTOOS beamline and target will be located near the UCN (Ultra Cold Neutron source) target area, branching off from the main UCN beamline. In particular, the beamline is intended to operate at a beam intensity of 100 µA, requiring a continuous splitting of the main beam via an electrostatic splitter. Realistic beam loss simulations to verify safe operation have been performed and optimised using Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM), a Geant4 based tool enabling the simulation of beam transportation through magnets and particle passage through the accelerator. In this study, beam profiles, beam transmission and power deposits are generated and studied.

In proton therapy, high dose rates can reduce treatment delivery times, allowing for efficient mitigation of tumor motion and increased patient throughput. With cyclotrons, however, high dose rates are difficult to achieve for low-energies as, typically, the emittance after the degrader is matched in both transversal planes using circular collimators, which does not provide an optimal matching to the acceptance of the following beamline. Transmission can however be substantially improved by transporting maximum acceptable emittances in both orthogonal planes, but at the cost of gantry angle-dependent beam shapes at isocenter. Here we demonstrate that equal emittances in both planes can be recovered at the gantry entrance using a thin scattering foil, thus ensuring gantry angle-independent beam shapes at the isocenter. We demonstrate experimentally that low-energy beam transmission can be increased by a factor of 3 using this approach compared to the currently used beam optics, whilst gantry angle-independent beam shapes are preserved. We expect that this universal approach could also bring a similar transmission improvement in other cyclotron-based proton therapy facilities.

Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective treatment that can control the growth of cancer cells. There is a hypothesis suggests that secondary electrons with an energy of a few eV produced from RT play an important role on cancer’s DNA strand break. In this study, the Monte Carlo simulation of electron beam irradiation in phantom water is performed to investigate the production of low-energy electrons. Electron beams produced from an radio-frequency linear accelerator (RF linac) are used in this study. The accelerator can generate the electron beam with adjustable energy of up to 4 MeV and adjustable repetition rate of up to 200 Hz. With these properties, the electron dose can be varied. We used ASTRA software to simulate the electron beam dynamics in the accelerator and GEANT4 toolkit for studying interactions of electrons in water. The energy of electrons decreases from MeV scale to keV-eV scale as they travel in the water. From simulations, the dose distribution and depth in phantom water were obtained for the electron dose of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 Gy. Further study on effect of low-energy electron beam with these dose values on cancer DNAs will be performed with GEANT4-DNA simulation.

Delivery of heavy ion therapy currently utilises normal conducting synchrotrons. For the future generation of clini- cal facilities, the accelerator footprint must be reduced while adopting beam intensities above 1 × 1010 particles per spill for more efficient, effective treatment. The Next Ion Medical Machine Study (NIMMS) is investigating the feasibility of a compact (27 m circumference) superconducting synchrotron, based on 90° alternating-gradient, canted-cosine-theta mag- nets to meet these criteria. The understanding of the impact of the higher order multipole fields of these magnets on the beam dynamics of the ring is crucial for optimisation of the design and to assess its performance for treatment. We analyse the electromagnetic model of a curved superconducting magnet to extract its non-linear components. Preliminary as- sessment is performed using MADX/PTC. Further scope, involving cross-referencing with other particle tracking codes, is discussed.

A versatile air insulated high current medium energy 200 kV Ion Accelerator has been running successfully at Ion Beam Centre, Kurukshetra University, India for carrying out multifarious experiments in material science and surface physics. Ion beam induced structures on the surfaces of semiconductors have potential applications in photonics, magnetic devices, photovoltaics, and surface-wetting tailoring etc. In this regard, silicon carbide (SiC) is a fascinating wide-band gap semiconductor for high-temperature, high-power and high-frequency applications. In the present work, fabrication of self-organized ripple patterns is carried out on the SiC surfaces using 80 keV Ar+ ions for different fluences at oblique incidence of 500. Studies demonstrate that ripple wavelength and amplitude, ordering and homogeneity of these patterns vary linearly with argon ion fluence. The ripples tend to align themselves parallel to the projection of the ion beam direction. The evolution of such surface structures is explained with the help of existing formalisms of coupling between surface topography and preferential sputtering.

Electron beam irradiation is a process to modify or improve the properties of materials with less chemical residue. In natural rubber vulcanization, a proper electron absorbed dose is about 50-150 kGy. In this study, the experimental station is designed to investigate the deposition of the electron beam in natural rubber. Electron beams generated from an RF linac are used in this study. This accelerator can generate the beam with energies in the range of 1-4 MeV and an adjustable repetition rate of up to 200 Hz. We can optimize these parameters to maximize the throughput and uniformity of electron dose in the vulcanization. The simulation results from GEANT4 were used to narrow down the appropriate parameters in the experiment. In the early stage of the study, water was used as a sample instead of natural rubber. The dose distribution was obtained by placing a B3 film dosimeter under a water chamber. The water depth was varied from 0.5 to 2.0 cm. The simulation results provide the dose distribution to compare with the experimental results. In a further study, the beam irradiation in natural rubber with these optimal parameters and vulcanization tests will be performed.

The local radiation shielding is designed for the electron linear accelerator beam dump at the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory (PCELL) with the aim to control the annual ambient dose equivalent during the operation. The study of radiation generation and design of radiation shielding is conducted based on the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit GEANT4. The study results include an annual ambient dose equivalent map and design of local shielding for the first bam dump downstream the linac section. With this design, the leaking radiation outside the accelerator hall is completely blocked and the average annual ambient dose equivalent on the rooftop of the hall is within the IAEA safety limit for the supervised area. The shielding model will then be used as a guideline for the construction in the near future.

Neutron sources are of great utility for various applications, especially in the fields of nuclear medicine, nuclear energy and imaging. At SAMEER, we have designed a linear electron accelerator based neutron source via photo-neutron generation. The accelerator is a 15 MeV linac with both photon and electron mode and is capable of delivering high beam current to achieve beam power of 1 to 2 kW. Efforts are in place to achieve further higher beam powers. 15 MeV electrons are incident on a bremsstrahlung target followed by a secondary target to achieve neutrons. To further optimize and enhance the neutron yield, backing material is provided. In this paper, we present the simulation of (e, g) and (g, n) processes using the Monte Carlo code FLUKA. The optimization of Tungsten as the convertor target whereas of the Beryllium as the neutron target is discussed in detail. We have explored various backing materials in order to optimize the total neutron yield as well as the thermal neutron yield. The simulation results have been considered for the finalisation of all material parameters for the set-up of this neutron source activity.
