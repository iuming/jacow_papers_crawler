ANSTO currently operates the Australian Synchrotron, a 3 GeV, 3rd generation light source that begun user operations in 2007. The Australian synchrotron is now halfway through its expected life span and we have begun planning the next light source facility that will eventually replace it. This paper describes the conceptual design of an entirely new light source facility for Australia, which makes use of the latest advances in compact acceleration technology and 4th generation lattices.

SIRIUS is a Synchrotron Light Source Facility based on a 3 GeV electron storage ring with 518 m circumfer-ence and 250 pm.rad emittance. The facility was built and is operated by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), located in the CNPEM campus, in Campinas, Brazil. The accelerator commissioning and operation has been split into 2 phases: Phase0, corresponding to the initial accelerator commissioning with 6 beamlines, has been completed, and the project is now in preparation for Phase1, with full accelerator design performance and 14 beamlines in operation. We report on the status of SIRI-US last year operation and ongoing activities towards achieving completion of Phase1.

The Canadian Light Source (CLS) has been in operation for users since 2005 and recently commissioned the 22nd photon beamline. In 2021 the CLS commenced top-up operations at 220 mA, which has been a big success for the user experiments. The storage ring is now RF power limited and will require a second RF cavity to realise the design goal of 500 mA. The 250 MeV electron injector complex for the CLS booster synchrotron ring dates back to the original linac from 1962 and the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory. This paper will give an overview of the present status of the accelerator systems for user operations and the operational improvement plans for a second RF cavity in the storage ring and a new linac.

Previous CDR studies for the SOLEIL Upgrade project have converged towards a lattice alternating 7BA and 4BA HOA type cells providing a low natural horizontal emittance value in the 80 pm.rad range at an energy of 2.75 GeV. This lattice adapts to the current tunnel geometry as well as to preserve as much as possible the present beamline positions. The TDR lattice is an evolution of the CDR one including longer short straight sections, better relative magnet positioning, and the replacement quadrupole triplets by quadruplets for improving flexibility of optics matching in straight section. The SOLEIL upgrade TDR lattice is then composed of 20 HOA cells with a two-fold symmetry, and provides 20 straight sections having four different lengths of 3.0, 4.2, 8.0, and 8.2 m. This paper reports the linear and the non-linear beam dynamic optimization based on intense MOGA investigations, mainly to improve the energy acceptance required to keep a large enough Touschek beam lifetime. Some future directions for performance improvement are discussed.

SOLEIL is both a 2.75 GeV third generation synchrotron light source and a research laboratory at the forefront of experimental techniques dedicated to matter analysis down to the atomic scale, as well as a service platform open to all scientific and industrial communities. We present the performance of the accelerators delivering extremely stable photon beams to 29 beamlines. We report on the commissioning of a superbend magnet replacing a standard 1.71T dipole with a 2.84 T narrow peak permanent magnet-based dipole. It required local modification of the lattice to compensate linear and nonlinear optics distortions introduced by the new magnet field. The latest measurements made with a Multipole Injection Kicker are also reported. Work on the NEG test bench and its dedicated front-end for a 10 mm inner diameter vacuum pipe and other major R&D areas are also addressed in the frame of the SOLEIL upgrade.

A new optics correction application (Fit and Improvement of Linear Optics, FILO) was designed and set in place for the ESRF-EBS storage ring. The widely used software LOCO* is not available at ESRF and despite a few trials to set it in operation, it has been decided to write a new code. The application is flexible, may be used via the control system simulators and is adapted to a user friendly operation thanks to a wizard mode. Some features of LOCO are copied over, some others are yet to be implemented. The measurement of on and off-energy response matrices using slow or fast steerers is integrated in the same application. Results obtained with this application are presented together with an overview of the future developments.

Despite the several fruitful upgrades undergone, the present injector complex of the ESRF-EBS has a rather large horizontal natural emittance at extraction of >60nmrad. Several light sources (SLS, ALBA, SIRIUS) have adopted booster injectors fitting in the same tunnel as the main SR. The study of such an injector is shown in this paper for the ESRF-EBS. The proposed solution is based on a DBA lattice structure with 5 quadrupole families and 2 sextupole families. The possibility to install this long booster on the internal wall of the ESRF storage ring tunnel is assessed and the adequate distances are analyzed. The possibility to keep the existing injector is also considered in order to use this additional ring as an accumulator ring. Injection and extraction schemes are described.

Following the measurements done at MAX-IV * we try to exploit for the ESRF-EBS Storage Ring (SR) off-energy response matrix measurement for the optimization of Touschek lifetime. The measurements performed with fast AC steerers on- and off-energy are analyzed and fitted producing an effective model including quadrupole and sextupole errors. Several alternatives to extrapolate sextupoles strengths for correction are compared in terms of lifetime. For the time being none of the corrections could produce better lifetime than the existing empirically optimized set of sextupoles.

The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility - Extremely Brilliant Source (ESRF-EBS) is a facility upgrade allowing its scientific users to take advantage of the first high-energy 4th generation light source. In December 2018, after 30 years of operation, the beam stopped for a 12-month shutdown to dismantle the old storage ring and to install the new X-ray source. On 25 August 2020, the user programme was restarted with beam parameters very close to nominal values. This paper reports on the present operation performance of the source, highlighting the ongoing and planned development.

Since 2020 a detailed discussion about a BESSY~II successor is ongoing at HZB and its user community in order to define the science and layout of the new facility. Still free locations close to BESSY~II have triggered a discussion about a greenfield project, but in-house upgrade solutions have also been investigated. As an additional boundary condition, BESSY~III has to meet the requirement of the Physikalische Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) for radiation sources for metrology applications and bending magnet sources for tender X-rays. A Conceptional Design Report is in preparation. Here, we give a status report including a first parameter space, technical specifications and a first candidate for the linear lattice.

Seeding of free-electron lasers (FELs) with external laser pulses triggers the microbunching process such that the spectrotemporal properties of coherently emitted FEL radiation are under better control compared to self-amplified spontaneous emission. High-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) based on the interaction of electrons with a single laser pulse is routinely applied at a few FELs, and echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) with a twofold laser-electron interaction has been demonstrated. Both schemes can be adopted in storage rings for the coherent emission of ultrashort radiation pulses. Coherent harmonic generation (CHG) is the counterpart to HGHG without FEL gain. It has been employed at several storage rings and presently provides ultrashort pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet regime at the 1.5-GeV electron storage ring DELTA operated by the TU Dortmund University. EEHG, which allows to reach higher harmonics of the seed wavelength, has not yet been implemented at any storage ring but is pursued at DELTA as an upgrade plan. The paper presents the layout of the envisaged EEHG facility, and it reviews simulation studies and the technical progress towards EEHG seeding at DELTA.

At the synchrotron light source DELTA operated by the TU Dortmund University, the short-pulse facility employs the seeding scheme coherent harmonic generation (CHG) and provides ultrashort pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet and terahertz regime. Here, the interaction of laser pulses with the stored electron bunches results in a modulation of the longitudinal electron density which gives rise to coherent emission at harmonics of the laser wavelength. The spectral and temporal properties of such coherent short pulses can be manipulated by the seed laser properties and chicane strength. CHG spectra at several harmonics of the 800 nm seed laser were recorded using an image-intensified CCD (iCCD) camera and a newly installed XUV spectrometer. Numerical simulations to calculate the spectral phase properties of the seed laser from the observed spectra were carried out.

Novel High Repetition Rate CW SRF Linac-Based Multispectral Photon Source
1427

We discuss a design of a CW SRF linac-based photon facility for the generation of MIR-THz and VUV pulses at high repetition rates of up to 1 MHz. The MIR-THz sources would cover the frequency range from 0.1 to 30 THz with the pulse energies of a few 100 µJ. The use of the CW SRF linac and the radiation source architecture will allow for high flexibility in the pulse repetition rate. Conventional superradiant THz sources, driven by electron bunches shorter than the radiation wavelength, would cover the wavelength range from 0.1 THz to about 2.5 THz. A different approach is developed to extend the operation of the superradiant undulators well beyond the few THz. For this, a longitudinally modulated electron bunch would be used to achieve significant bunching factors at higher frequencies. The proposed VUV FEL would use the HGHG FEL scheme. It will allow the construction of a unique, fully coherent, high repetition rate source operated with about 30 µJ pulse energy at the first harmonic in the design wavelength range. An FEL oscillator, operating at a wavelength 3-5 times longer than the HGHG system, can generate the seed required for the high repetition rate HGHG scheme.

PETRA IV will be a diffraction-limited 6 GeV synchrotron light source with an emittance of 20 pm rad at DESY Hamburg. The TDR phase is nearing completion, and the lattice design is being finalised. The lattice will be based on the six-bend achromat cell with extensive use of damping wigglers. The key challenges of the lattice design are finding the balance between emittance minimisation and non-linear beam dynamics performance, and adapting the lattice to a collider-type tunnel geometry of the PETRA facility, with the long straight sections and low degree of superperiodicity. We present the lattice design and the beam physics aspects, focusing on the beam dynamics performance and optimisation, and the projected beam parameters taking collective effects and lattice imperfections into account.

PETRA IV can benefit from the fine control of the girders that carry the storage ring elements to achieve the design beam performance. Based on the corrector magnet strength pattern it is desired to realign girders to stay within the alignment tolerances. In the current PETRA III configuration, the girders in the Max von Laue Hall are equipped for remote alignment, however, those have not been moved since their initial installation and the alignment system is currently not connected to the control system. In preparation for PETRA IV, a movement test of one of the PETRA III girders should confirm the ability to safely and precisely remote control the equipment based on an optics model that describes the effect of the girder movement on the orbit. This paper studies the feasibility of this test and prepares an initial mock-up experiment to be performed on a spare girder.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming widespread paradigms in control of complex processes. Operation of accelerator facilities is not an exception, with a number of advances having happened over the last years. In the domain of intelligent control of accelerator facilities, the research has mostly been focused on feasibility demonstration of ML-based agents, or application of ML-based agents to a well-defined problem such as parameter tuning. The main challenge on the way to a more holistic AI-based operation, in our opinion, is of engineering nature and is related to the need of significant reduction of the amount of human intervention. The areas where such intervention is still significant are: training and tuning of ML models; scheduling and orchestrating of multiple intelligent agents; data stream handling; configuration management; and software testing and verification requiring advanced simulation environment. We have developed a software framework which attempts to address all these issues. The design and implementation of this system will be presented, together with application examples for the PETRA III storage ring.

Collimation Strategy for the Low-Emittance PETRA IV Storage Ring
1445

The beam-intensity losses in the proposed PETRA IV electron storage ring that will replace DESY’s synchrotron light source PETRA III will be dominated by the Touschek effect due to the high bunch density. The beam lifetime will only be in the range of 5 h in the timing mode (80 high-intensity bunches) leading to a maximum power loss of ~170 mW along the storage ring (excluding injection losses). To avoid the demagnetization of the permanent-magnet undulators and combined-function magnets, this radiation-sensitive hardware has to be shielded against losses as well as possible. Such shielding elongates the lifetime of the hardware and consequently reduces the time and the resources that are spent on maintenance once PETRA IV is operational. This contribution presents options for collimator locations, e.g., at the dispersion bump in the achromat cell, to reduce the exposure to losses from the Touschek effect and the injection process. This contribution also quantifies the risk of damaging the installed collimation system in case of hardware failure, e.g., RF cavity or quadrupole failure, since the beam with an emittance of 20 pm could damage collimators if there is no emittance blow-up.

The study of long-term orbit stability in the PETRA III light source plays an important role for the design of its upgrade to PETRA IV. The PETRA III tunnel is made of individual segments that move against each other. Here, the long-term drifts of the tunnel ground that are mostly introduced by temperature variations, are of the highest concern for the PETRA IV alignment tolerances and orbit stability. This paper studies the evolution of the beam orbit and corrector magnet currents over several years and correlates tunnel movement to RMS orbit drifts.

At DESY the Synchrotron Light Source PETRA III offers scientists outstanding opportunities for experiments with hard X-rays of exceptionally high brilliance since 2009. The light source is operated mainly in two operation modes with 480 and 40 bunches at a beam energy of 6 GeV. With the completion of the last milestone of the extension project in summer 2021 that brought the new dipole beamline P66 into operation, 2022 is the first year where almost 5000 hours of user run time could be scheduled. This paper will review the statistics of availability and failures over the years and provides a detailed description of the operation in 2021. Additionally, an outlook for the next runs is given.

In a light Source, unused synchrotron radiation is being distributed along the walls of the chambers. Due to the small conductance of the chambers, vacuum pumping is based on the distributed concept, and then non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating is extensively used. The vacuum chambers are made of copper alloys tube, and cooling circuits are welded to the chamber to remove the heat load from the radiation generated. Filler metal is used to create a brazed joint between the water cooling pipe and the vacuum chamber body. The thermal conductivity of the fillers is less than the vacuum chamber body. Moreover, the water velocity in the cooling pipe must be taken into account in thermal calculations. In this paper, we study and investigate the effects of the filler metal and the cooling water velocity in cooling the chambers.

Currently, the Free electron laser user facility FLASH at DESY is undergoing a significant upgrade involving the complete transformation of one of its beamlines to allow external seeding. With the Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) seeding method, we aim for the generation of fully coherent XUV and soft X-ray pulses at wavelengths down to 4 nm. The generated FEL radiation is sensitive to various electron beam properties, e.g., its energy profile imprinted either deliberately or by collective effects such as Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR). In dedicated particle tracking simulations, one usually makes certain assumptions concerning the beam properties and the collective effects to simplify implementation and analysis. Here, we estimate the influence of some of the common assumptions made in EEHG simulations on the properties of the output FEL radiation, using the example of FLASH and its proposed seeding beamline. We conclude that the inherent properties of the FLASH1 beam, namely the negatively chirped energy profile, has dominant effect on the spectral intensity profile of the radiators output compare to that of the CSR induced chirp.

ALBA is working on the upgrade project that shall transform the actual storage ring, in operation since 2012, into a 4th generation light source, in which the soft X-rays part of the spectrum shall be diffraction limited. The project has been officially launched in 2021 and a White Paper presenting the main concepts of the upgrade has been published in Spring 2022. The storage ring upgrade is based on a 6BA lattice which has to comply with several constraints imposed by the decision of maintaining the same circumference (269 m), the same number of cells (16), the same beam energy (3 GeV), and as many of the source points as possible unperturbed. The lattice optimization has achieved an emittance of 140 pm.rad, which is a factor 30 smaller than that of the existing ring, but with an array compactness that presents technological challenges for the magnets, vacuum, diagnostics, RF systems and injection elements designs that are being investigated through an intensive R&D program.

A collaboration agreement between the HZB, DESY and ALBA institutions was signed on 2021 in order to test the 3rd harmonic normal conducting, HOM damped, active cavity designed and prototyped by ALBA*. The test will involve low power characterization of the fundamental mode, bead pull measurements to fully determine the HOM characteristics, a full high power conditioning to validate the power capability of the cavity, and finally, the installation of the cavity in the BESSY II storage ring in order to test the cavity in real conditions with beam. In this paper the low power, bead pull and conditioning results will be presented. The cavity has been installed at BESSY II on May 2022 to be tested after the summer shutdown.

DESY is planning the upgrade of PETRA III to a fourth generation light source, providing high brightness, quasi diffraction limited hard X-ray photons. The project is underpinned by the construction of a new storage ring PETRA IV, based on a 20 pm accelerator lattice using a hybrid 6-bend achromat concept. We review here the status of the machine project, the latest development in the different technical subsystems, the status of the engineering integration and the plans for the implementation of the new ring in the existing PETRA III tunnel.

The SPS Radiation Monitoring System (SPSRMS) has been designed to measure the ionizing radiation which are generated from the high-energy electron 1.2 GeV. SPSRMS design shall be performed to assure of the adequate performance system in order to prevent the radiation exposure of workers and general public in the synchrotron facility. The research purpose is to evaluate the frequency of failure of real-time radiation monitoring system design that might be happened from the abnormal case which is unable to transfer the important radiation dose continuously. An Event Tree Analysis (ETA) had been approached to evaluate the safety reliability of the SPSRMS which is a method of deducing possibilities and outcomes in a chronological order. This method has been determined the probability of possible negative outcomes that can cause harm and result from the chosen initiating event. The scenario results showed that reliability was increased from 99.71%±19.57% to 99.80%±19.58% (95% confidential level) after adding redundancy in all the devices. The reliability assessment results of SPSRMS are presented.

Fill Pattern for Reducing Transient Beam Loading and Ion-Trapping in the Diamond-II Storage Ring

The Diamond-II upgrade will replace the existing Diamond storage ring with a multibend achromat lattice providing higher brightness to the users by reducing the emittance and increasing the beam energy. The new storage ring will require a harmonic cavity that lengthens the bunches to increase the Touschek lifetime as well as mitigate instabilities and suppress the emittance blow up from intrabeam scattering. It is expected that the ring will have to operate with gaps in the fill pattern for ion-clearing, but that will lead to transient beam loading resulting in reduced bunch lengthening. The length and occurrence of the gaps therefore have to be determined as a trade-off between the requirements for transient beam loading and ion-trapping. This paper presents simulations of both effects for the Diamond-II storage ring to find an optimal fill pattern.

Particle losses in a storage ring are unavoidable and it is very important to capture them and protect the machine from any possible damage. For this purpose, 6 collimators have been introduced in the Diamond-II storage ring lattice. This paper describes the main layout of the collimators with their corresponding impact and performance.

The Diamond-II project includes a replacement of the existing double-bend achromat storage ring with a modified hybrid 6-bend achromat, doubling the number of straight sections and increasing the photon beam brightness by up to two orders of magnitude*. The design and performance characterisation of the new storage ring has continued to progress, including a switch to an aperture-sharing injection scheme, freezing the magnet layout, studying the impact of IDs, developing a commissioning procedure and investigating collective effects. In this paper we present an overview of these studies, including final performance estimates.

When defining the magnet specifications, a key consideration is that the hardware should be flexible enough to allow some contingency for future tuning requirements or for alternative lattice solutions to be implemented. To define the required tunability of the magnets, we have investigated two lattice solutions for the Diamond-II storage ring upgrade, one with reduced beta functions at the straight sections for improved matching to the photon beam and one with an ultra-low emittance of 87 pm with IDs. In this paper, the linear and nonlinear beam dynamic issues as well as the photon beam brightness for these two options will be presented and discussed.

Emittance Feedback for the Diamond-II Storage Ring Using Resonant Excitation
1498

In the Diamond Light Source storage ring, the vertical emittance is kept at 8 pm rad during operation to maintain the source brightness for the users. This is achieved by a feedback which modifies the skew quadrupole strengths, but has disadvantages such as the introduction of betatron coupling and vertical dispersion. For the proposed Diamond-II upgrade, the storage ring will have a much smaller horizontal emittance, meaning a significantly larger coupling would be required to reach the target vertical emittance, negatively affecting the off-axis injection process. To solve this problem, a feedback using the transverse multibunch feedback striplines to drive the beam at a synchrotron sideband is planned. By driving the beam resonantly in this way, the emittance can be increased without modification of the optics. This paper describes simulations of the effects of linear and non-linear optics on the excitation as well as the impact of the machine impedance for the Diamond-II storage ring.

SPEAR3, commissioned in 2004, is a third generation light source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The low emittance lattice with an emittance of 10 nm had been operated for over a decade until the recent commission of the new lower emittance lattice with 7 nm emittance. The new lattice, based on the same double-bend achromat lattice, has pushed toward the design limit of such type of lattice in SPEAR3. In this paper, we will elaborate our commissioning experience for the new lattice in SPEAR3.

We propose an optimization algorithm, Safe Robust Conjugate Direction Search (RCDS-S), which can perform accelerator tuning while keeping the machine performance within a designated safe envelope. The algorithm builds probability models of the objective function using Lipschitz continuity of the function as well as characteristics of the drifts and applies to the selection of trial solutions to ensure the machine operates safely during tuning. The algorithm can run during normal user operation constantly, or periodically, to compensate for the performance drifts. Simulation and online tests have been done to validate the performance of the algorithm.

A new injector called NEWGAIN will be added to the SPIRAL2 Linear Accelerator (LINAC), in parallel with the existing one. It will be mainly composed of an ion source and a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) connected to the superconductive LINAC of SPIRAL2. The new RFQ will accelerate at 88.05 MHz particles with charge-over-mass ratio (Q/A) between 1/3 and 1/7, from 10 keV/u up to 590 keV/u. It consists of a 4-vane resonant cavity with a total length of 7 m. It is a CW machine that has to show stable operation, provide the request availability, have the minimum losses in order to provide the highest current to the superconductive LINAC and show the best quality/cost ratio. This paper will present the preliminary RF design and the thermomechanical study for this RFQ.

The RF system of the ThomX storage ring consists in a 500 MHz single cell copper cavity of the ELETTRA type, powered with a 50 kW CW solid state amplifier, and the associated Low-Level RF feedback and control loops. The low operating energy of 50-100 MeV makes the impedances of the cavity higher order modes (HOMs) particularly critical for the beam stability. Their parasitic effects on the beam can be cured by HOM frequency shifting techniques, based on a fine temperature tuning and a dedicated adjustable plunger. A cavity temperature stability of ± 0.1 °C within a range from 30 up to 70 °C is achieved by a precise control of its water-cooling temperature. On the other hand, the tuning of the cavity fundamental mode is achieved by changing its axial length by means of a mechanical tuner. In order to insure a fine control of the HOM frequencies, a good knowledge of their characteristics is mandatory. The main parameters of the fundamental and of the HOMs up to 2.2 GHz versus temperature have been measured at low power using a vector network analyzer (VNA).

Neutron research in Europe is mainly based on various nuclear reactors that will be successively decommissioned over the next years. This means that despite the commissioning of the European Spallation Source ESS, many neutron research centres, especially in the medium flux regime, will disappear. In response to this situation, the Jülich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS) has begun the development of a scalable, compact, accelerator-based High Brilliance neutron Source (HBS). A total of three different neutron target stations are planned, which can be operated with a 100 mA proton beam of up to 70 MeV and a duty cycle of up to 6%. The driver Linac consists of an Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source followed by a LEBT section, a 2.5 MeV double Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and 35 normal conducting (NC) Crossbar H-Mode (CH) cavities. The development of the cavities is carried out by the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) at the Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. Due to the high beam current, all cavities as well as the associated tuners and couplers have to be optimised for operation under high thermal load to ensure safe operation. In collaboration with the GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research as the ideal test facility for high power tests, two cavities and the associated hardware are being designed and will be tested. The design and latest status of both cavities will be presented in this paper.

The demand for neutrons of various types for research is growing day by day worldwide. To meet the growing demand the Jülich High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) is in development. It is based on a high power linear proton accelerator with an end energy of 70 MeV and a proton beam current of 100 mA. After the injector and the MEBT is the main part of the accelerator, which consists of about 36 CH-type cavities. The design of the CH-type cavities will be optimized in terms of required power, required cooling and reliability and the recent results will be presented in this paper.

Because of strong mechanical vibrations of the electrodes and its sensitivity to changes of thermal load, the operational stability of the existing 4-rod RFQ at the High Charge State Injector (HLI) at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, could not be ensured for all planned operating states. To resolve this issue and ensure stable injection into the HLI, a new RFQ-prototype, optimized in terms of vibration suppression and cooling efficiency, was designed at the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) of Goethe University Frankfurt. To test the performance of this prototype and demonstrate the operational stability in terms of mechanical vibration as well as thermal load, high power tests with more than 25’kW/m were performed at GSI. After initial conditioning, detailed vibrational measurements during high power RF operation using a laser Doppler vibrometer were performed, which were then compared to previously conducted simulations using ANSYS. Ultimately, the ability for stable operation up to high power levels with an efficient vibration suppression and moderate heating have clearly been demonstrated.

Emerging high power THz sources pave the road for THz- driven acceleration of ultra-short bunches, and enable their manipulation for diagnostic purposes. Due to the small feature sizes of THz-guiding devices new methods are necessary for their electromagnetic characterization. A new technique has recently been developed which characterizes THz waveguides with respect to their dispersion relations and attenuation. Here, the method is applied to circular waveguides, partially filled with polymer capillaries of different thicknesses, to find a suitable size for THz driven streaking at 287 GHz. Further, rough 3d-printed metallic waveguides are measured to study the effect of roughness on attenuation and phase constant. In general, additive manufacturing techniques show promise for advanced integrated designs of THz driven structures.

High Current Injector (HCI) is an upcoming heavy ion accelerator facility at Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi, INDIA and it will serve as an alternate injector to the existing Superconducting Linear Accelerator. HCI is designed to achieve the maximum energy gain of 1.8 MeV/u for the ions, including the Noble gasses and metallic ions, having A/q less than equal to 6. It consists of an 18 GHz High Temperature Superconducting Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source, Multi-harmonic Buncher, Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), Spiral Buncher and six interdigital H-mode Drift Tube Linac (IH-DTL) cavities operating at 97 MHz resonant frequency. The RFQ accelerates the ions from 8 keV/u to 180 keV/u energy and the six DTL cavities are used to achieve the maximum energy gain of 1.8 MeV/u. Recently, the bunched beam of N5+ was successfully accelerated through RFQ and six IH-DTL cavities and we achieved the designed energy, which is an important milestone of this project. These results validate the design parameters of all RF cavities, accelerating to achieve the designed energy goal of 1.8 MeV/u. Here, present status and future plans of the project shall be presented.

The muon g-2/EDM experiment is under preparation at Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC), and the muon linear accelerator for the experiment is being developed. A Disk-and-Washer (DAW) cavity will be used for the medium-velocity part of the accelerator, and muons will be accelerated from v/c=ß=0.3 to 0.7 with the operating frequency of 1.296 GHz. Machining, brazing, and low-power measurements of a prototype cell reflecting the design of the first tank of DAW were performed to identify fabrication problems. Several problems were identified, such as displacement of washers during brazing, and some measures will be taken in the actual tank fabrication. In this paper, the results of the prototype cell fabrication will be reported.

The Canadian Light Source, at the University of Saskatchewan, is a 3rd generation synchrotron light source located in the city of Saskatoon, Canada. The facility comprises a 250 MeV LINAC, a full energy booster and a 2.9 GeV storage ring. The radiofrequency system in the booster consist of two 5-cell cavities feed with a single SSPA. The analogue LLRF for the booster has been recently replaced by a digital LLRF based in the ALBA design with a Picodigitizer, a stand-alone commercial solution provided by Nutaq. Also, the firmware of the new DLLRF is configurable to allow operation with a superconducting cavity feed with one amplifier, thus providing the possibility to replace the CLS SR LLRF as well. The main hardware components, the basic firmware functionalities and the commissioning measurements of the new DLLRF for the CLS booster will be presented in this paper.

ALBA has designed a normal conducting active 1.5 GHz HOM damped cavity for the active third harmonic RF system for the ALBA Storage Ring (SR), which also will serve for the upgraded ALBA II. The third harmonic cavity at ALBA will be used to increase the bunch length in order to improve the beam lifetime and increase the beam stability thresholds. A prototype has been constructed by the company AVS in collaboration with VITZRO. This paper presents the design of the cavity, the constructed prototype, the Acceptance Tests measurements, and the future plans.

Two new undulator lines have been installed as part of the Linac Coherent Light Source upgrade (LCLSII) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. One undulator line, composed of 21 horizontally polarizing undulator segments, is dedicated to producing Soft X-Rays (SXR). The other line, composed of 32 vertically polarizing undulator segments, is dedicated to producing Hard X-Rays (HXR). The devices were installed, and the control system was deployed in 2019. Commissioning culminated with the achievement of first light from the HXR undulator in the Summer of 2020 and from the SXR undulator in the Fall of 2020. Since then, both undulator lines have been successfully providing x-Rays to user experiments with very limited downtime. In this paper, we first describe the strategies utilized to simplify the deployment, commissioning, and maintenance of the control system. Such strategies include scripts for automated components calibration and monitoring, a modular software structure, and debugging manuals for accelerator operators. Then, we discuss lessons learned which could be applicable to similar projects in the future.

In this proceeding we present start-to-end simulations of the LCLS-II-HE free electron laser. The HE project will extend the LCLS-II superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) linac from 4 GeV to 8 GeV in order to produce hard x-rays from the eponymous hard x-ray undulators (26 mm period). At the same time, soft x-ray performance is preserved (and extended into the tender regime) by using longer period undulators (56 mm period) than were originally built for LCLS-II (39 mm period). Here we use high-fidelity numerical particle simulations to study the performance of several SASE beamline configurations, and compare the resulting x-ray energy, power, duration, and transverse properties. Using the LCLS-II normal-conducting gun, we find that the x-ray pulse energy drops off rapidly above ~15 keV, while using the lower emittance beam from a proposed SRF gun, we improve the cutoff to ~20 keV.

One of the primary limitations on the achievable accelerating gradient in normal-conducting accelerator cavities is the occurrence of vacuum arcs, also known as RF breakdowns. A recent study on experimental data from the CLIC XBOX2 test stand at CERN proposes the use of supervised machine learning methods for predicting RF breakdowns. As RF breakdowns occur relatively infrequently during operation, the majority of the data was instead comprised of non-breakdown pulses. This phenomenon is known in the field of machine learning as class imbalance and is problematic for the training of the models. This paper proposes the use of data augmentation methods to generate synthetic data to counteract this problem. Different data augmentation methods like random transformations and pattern mixing are applied to the experimental data from the XBOX2 test stand, and their efficiency is compared.

The control system of the accelerators at CERN stores and analyses more than 200 million dumps of high resolution data recordings every year in the Post Mortem (PM) system. A continuous increase in the complexity of the Large Hadron Collider’s (LHC) systems and the desire to collect more accurate data requires continuous improvement of the PM system. Recently, the PM system has been modernized ahead of the third operational Run of the LHC. The upgraded system implements well known data engineering principles such as horizontal scaling, stateless services and readiness for extensions. This paper recalls the purpose of the PM service and its current use cases. It presents its modernized architecture, reviews the current performance and limitations of the system, and draws perspectives for the next steps in its evolution.

A cold copper distributed coupling accelerator, with a high accelerating gradient at cryogenic temperatures (~77 K), is proposed as a baseline structure for the next generation of linear colliders. This novel technology improves accelerator performance and allows more degrees of freedom for optimization of individual cavities. It has been suggested that C-band accelerating structures at 5.712 GHz may allow to maintain high efficiency, achieve high accelerating gradient, and be suitable beam dynamics with wakefield damping and detuning of the cavities. The optimization of the cavity shape was performed and we computed quality factor, shunt impedance, and beam kick factor for each of the proposed cavity geometries using CST microwave studio. Next, we proposed a configuration for higher order mode (HOM) suppression that includes waveguide slots running parallel to the axis of the accelerator. This presentation will report details of the parametric study of performance of the HOM suppression waveguide, and the dependence of HOM Q-factors and kick-factors on the cavity’s and HOM waveguide’s geometries.

This poster will report the results of high gradient testing of the benchmark C-band RF cavity. Modern applications such as X-ray sources require accelerators with optimized cost of construction and operation, naturally calling for high-gradient acceleration. At LANL we commissioned a test stand (CERF-NM) powered by a 50 MW, 5.712 GHz Canon klystron. The test stand is capable of conditioning accelerating cavities for operation at surface electric fields in excess of 300 MV/m. CERF-NM is the first high gradient C-band test facility in the United States. An important milestone for this test stand is to demonstrate conditioning and high gradient testing of the most basic high gradient RF cavity with a geometry that has been extensively studied at other frequencies, such as X-band. The cavity is the three-cell structure with the highest gradient in the central cell and two coupling cells, and the ratio of the radius of the coupling iris to the wavelength a/\lamda=0.105. This presentation will report achieved gradients, breakdown probabilities, and other characteristics measured during the high power operation of this cavity.

This work presents the results of high gradient testing of the two C-band (5.712 GHz) normal conducting ß=0.5 accelerating cavities. The first cavity was made of copper and second was made of copper-silver alloy with 0.08% silver concentration. The tests were conducted at the C-Band Engineering Research Facility of New Mexico (CERF-NM) located at Los Alamos National Laboratory Both cavities achieved gradients in excess of 200 MV/m and surface electric fields in excess of 300 MV/m. The breakdown rates were mapped as functions of the gradient and peak surface fields. The gradients and peak surface fields observed in the copper-silver cavity were about 20% higher than those in the pure copper cavity with the same breakdown rate. It was concluded that the dominant breakdown mechanism in these cavities was not the pulse heating but the breakdown due to very high surface electric fields.

The Elettra 2.0 low emittance light source project aims to a substantial increase of the brilliance and coherence fraction of the source improving, at the same time, the storage ring stability and reliability. The Radio Frequency (RF) system plays a pivotal role in the beam quality, stability and reliability for the user operation. This paper will cover the design and the implemented strategy to meet these features for the Elettra 2.0 RF system. Starting point of the new RF design is the final choice of the RF frequency, 500 MHz, and the available room, 1260 mm, to install the accelerating cavities. Thanks to the 500 MHz frequency choice, some components of the new RF system for Elettra 2.0 are already installed and set into operation in the current Elettra storage ring. Their features and performance’s optimization can therefore start well in advance with respect to the foreseen operation the new Elettra 2.0 storage ring.

The spoke cavities section of the European Spallation Source (ESS) Linac will be powered by 26 Radio Frequency Power Stations (RFPSs). Each RFPS delivers 400 kW of Radio Frequency (RF) power at 352.21 MHz in pulsed mode at a repetition rate up to 14 Hz and a 5 % duty cycle, thanks to a twin tetrodes RF power sources integration. This equipment belongs to the Italian In-Kind Contributions (IKCs) to ESS. Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A (Elettra) is responsible for the development, manufacturing and commissioning of the RFPSs and is managing the RFPS manufacturing contract awarded to European Science Solutions s.r.l (ESS-It). So far, 24 units have been delivered and, by mid 2022, the entire contribution, plus a complete spare unit, will be delivered to ESS. The overall performance of the RFPSs, the lessons learned, and the optimizations adopted along the manufacturing process and the difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed along the way are presented in this contribution.
