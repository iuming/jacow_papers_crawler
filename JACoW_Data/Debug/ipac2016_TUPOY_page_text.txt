The commissioning process of the MedAustron accelerator has delivered the configurations providing the requested beam parameters in the irradiation room, and at the same time it identified the critical points where a performance drift can appear. The strategy for beam quality assurance has therefore two components: testing the specific parameters of the beam delivered to the irradiation room, and testing for any drifts that might appear at the critical points. We present here the monitoring strategy, the observed limitations, the tools employed and the long-term statistics of the beam quality assurance for proton clinical beams.

The Advanced Orbit Code (AOC) facilitates design studies of critical systems and processes in medical and industrial accelerators. Examples include: i) injection into and extraction from cyclotrons, ii) central region, beam-capture and longitudinal beam dynamics studies in synchro-cyclotrons, iii) studies of resonance crossings, iv) stripping extraction, v) beam simulation from the ion source to the extraction, vi) space charge effects, vii) beam transmission studies in gantries or viii) calculation of Twiss-functions. The main features of the code and some applications are discussed.

Protons provide superior radiotherapy benefits to patients, but immense size and cost of the system limits it to only few centers worldwide. Proton acceleration on μm scale via high intensity laser is promising to reduce size and costs of proton therapy, but associated beamlines are still big and massive. Also, in contrast to conventionally accelerated quasi-continuous mono-energetic pencil beams, laser-driven beams have distinct beam properties, i.e. ultra-intense pico-sec bunches with large energy spread and large divergences, and with low repetition rate. With new lasers with petawatt power, protons with therapy related energies could be achieved, however, the beam properties make it challenging to adapt them directly for medical applications. We will present our compact beamline solution including energy selection and divergence control, and a new beam scanning and dose delivery system with specialized 3D treatment planning system for laser-driven proton beams. The beamline is based on high field iron-less pulsed magnets and about three times smaller than the conventional systems*, and can provide high quality clinical treatment plans**.

The Marburg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre (MIT), located in Marburg, Germany, is in clinical operation since 2015. MIT is designed for precision cancer treatment using beams of protons or carbon nuclei, employing the raster scanning technique. The accelerator facility consists of a linac-synchrotron combination, developed by Siemens Healthcare/Danfysik, that was in a state of permanent stand-by upon purchase. With support from its Heidelberg-based sister facility HIT, the MIT operation company (MIT Betriebs GmbH) recommissioned the machine in only 13 months, reaching clinical standards of beam quality delivered to all four beam outlets. With the first medical treatment in October 2015, MIT became the third operational hadron beam therapy centre in Europe offering both proton and carbon beams.

In Indonesia there are only three hospitals, which using cyclotrons for cancer detection (PET scans). These three hospitals are located in one place: Jakarta. With 1.4 percent of the Indonesian population are developing tumor/cancer, compared to the number of hospitals, which have advanced PET technology from cyclotrons, it will be a major task for the government to empower the production and overseas collaboration in the cyclotron industry.

Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center (GHMC) is a compact heavy ion treatment facility* and have experienced 5 years of successful treatment operation. GHMC has 3 treatment room using broad beam (wobbling) irradiation system and 1 experimental irradiation room for the research and development of a spot-scanning irradiation. During the study toward the treatment, several improvements were done in both accelerator and irradiation system. For accelerators, slow extraction from a synchrotron using a transverse rf field is tested**. Compared with conventional extraction system of rf acceleration, ripples of the beam spill (peak to bottom ratio) is reduced from almost 100% to 60%; the deviation of the beam center position and the deviation of the beam size (1σ) are reduced to the order of 0.1 mm. For irradiation system, regularly operation for biological experiments has started form June 2014. In order to shorten the experiment time, 2-dimensional optimization of the irradiation planning was carried out. After the optimization, the irradiation time was reduced by 30% with keeping the dose uniformity within ±2.5%.

In response to the need of alternatives to the exhausted research reactors supplying Mo-99/Tc-99m, we are developing a compact X-band electron linear accelerator (linac). As an initial step, beam dynamics simulations were performed and electron beams of 35 MeV and 9.1 kW were obtained. We expect that sixteen linacs having these beam parameters can cover the demand of Tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals in Japan. On the other hand, we found that the combination of X-band RF and high beam power can give rise to instability of beam loading. We will therefore adjust and optimize the beam power while keeping Mo-99 production efficiency as high as possible.

The majority of the radiotherapy are performed with linacs producing a uniformly intense electron-beam or X-ray beam of different energies. The linacs have the strong attraction of compactness, efficiency, reliability, moderate cost, and well-known technology. We developed and constructed the 6 MeV C-band linac which consists of a thermionic electron gun, a standing-wave accelerating column with the length of 450 mm, a 2.5 MW magnetron, a beam transport system, a beam collimation and monitoring system, and auxiliary systems of vacuum system, water cooling system etc. For the medical application, the gantry system is required to be rotated around the patient and to deliver the beam to the tumor from the linac. We design the gantry mounting our developed C-band linac isocentrically. In addition, the beam bending system and beam collimation are discussed to optimize the gantry space and to improve the beam performance. In this paper, we describe the designed radiotherapy machine including the gantry, a treatment couch and a control console, and present the study results.

Recently, there is a need of X-ray inspection system around the world to combat terrorism, drug and weapons smuggling, illegal immigration, and trade fraud. A compact standing wave (SW) linear accelerator (linac) for container X-ray inspection system has been produced at Radiation Technology eXcellence (RTX) to meet this growing need. The RF accelerating structure uses standing wave side-coupled structure fed by a 5 MW e2v magnetron with frequency of 2856 MHz. The electrons are accelerated from DC gun with energy of 25 keV to the final energy of 6 or 9 MeV at the X-ray target and generate X-ray with the dose rate of 8 Gy/min at 1 m after X-ray target. In this paper, we describe the design and optimization of side-coupled RF structure operating at π/2 mode. The beam dynamic of particle along the RF structure is also included in this paper by using ASTRA code.

Paul Scherrer Institute extends its proton therapy facility PROSCAN by a third gantry. It is delivered by Varian Medical Systems (VMS) as part of a joint research project. Gantry 3 is equipped with a cone beam CT and allows 360 degrees of rotation while occupying a 10.5 m diameter. The integration of a gantry into the existing PSI-system typically being designed for a complete Varian system is a challenging project, since also the certification is to be maintained. Especially the interfaces between the PROSCAN-control system and the one of Gantry 3 have been a major development. Gantry 3 is designed to deliver proton beam of up to 8 nA with an accuracy better than a mm, while having a high level of over-current protection. This comprises a new current monitoring unit, several levels of interlock controllers and a beam energy dependent intensity compensation concept. One challenge concerns the specified layer switching time of 200 ms, required to reduce the treatment time to enable for repainting. After technical commissioning, acceptance tests and hand over, the clinical commissioning is foreseen in the second half of 2016 with the first patient treatment in December 2016.

Linear accelerator technology has been widely utilized for cancer treatment in hospital. This radiotherapy utilizes an accelerated electron beam to create the x-ray beam. The idea to fabricate the prototype of medical electron linac with low cost for domestic use in Thailand was proposed and the budget has been granted. In the first phase, the electron beam energy of the machine will be 6 MeV or equivalent to x-ray energy of 6 MV. The electron gun is a diode type for the simple and low cost fabrication. The design and simulation study of diode gun will be presented together with an analysis of an electron beam in this gun. The S-Band 6 MeV side-coupled RF cavity has been designed to be the accelerating structure of the machine. The electromagnetic fields of the structure have been studied. The electron behaviour when they traverse this cavity will be studied using a particle tracking code. Progression of the project is also presented.

The x-ray target in medical electron linear accelerator is an important part in the production of x-ray photon beam. X-ray dose rate is depended on materials and thickness of the target. For the low cost 6 MeV prototype of medical linac in Thailand, this study gives the optimized x-ray target in which the dose rate can be maximized. MCNP simulations were performed during an optimization for a high x-ray dose rate at 1 meter away from the target. Progression of the project is also presented.

CERN-MEDICIS uses the scattered (ca. 90%) 1.4 GeV, 2 uA protons delivered by the PS Booster to the ISOLDE target, which would normally end up in the beam dump. After irradiation, the MEDICIS target is transported back to an offline isotope mass separator, where the produced isotopes are mass separated, and are then collected. The required medical radioisotopes are later chemically separated in the class A laboratory. The radioisotopes are transported to partner hospitals for processing and preparation for medical use, imaging or therapy. Production of the isotopes is affected by the designs of the ISOLDE and MEDICIS targets. The MEDICIS target unit is a configurable unit, allowing for variations in target material as well as ion source for the production of selected medical radioisotopes. The energy deposition on both targets is simulated using the Monte Carlo code FLUKA, along with the in-beam production of some medical isotopes of interest. Diffusion and effusion efficiencies are then applied to estimate their production.

The code was developed in 1962 by Johannes Ranft and the name stands for FLUktuierende Kaskade (Fluctuating Cascade). The code was developede for high-energy physics and it can track 60 different particles from 1keV to thousands of TeV. It can be applied to accelerator design, shielding design, dosimetry, space radiation and hadron therapy. For particle therapy, FLUKA uses various physical models, all implemented in the PEANUT (Pre-Equilibrium Approach to Nuclear Thermalization) framework. The investigation was made for three different facilities : the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, the Christie Hospital and the OpenMeD facility at CERN. We calculated the secondary dose distributed to the patient, in case of Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, and to the workers in case of the Christie Hospital and OpenMeD, and to investigate whether the shielding methods meet the existing radiation protection requirements and that the doses to the staff are kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).

Neutron spallation is an efficient process for producing intense neutron fluxes that can be exploited in Accelerator Driven Subcritical Reactors (ADSRs) for energy production and the transmutation of nuclear waste. In order to assess the feasibility of spallation driven fission and transmutation we have simulated proton induced neutron production using GEANT4, initially benchmarking our simulations against published experimental neutron spectra produced from a thick lead target bombarded with 0.5 and 1.5 GeV protons. The Bertini and INCL models available in GEANT4, coupled with the high precision (HP) neutron model, are found to adequately reproduce the published experimental data. Given the confidence in the GEANT4 simulations provided by this benchmarking we have then proceeded to simulate neutron production as a function of target geometry and thence to some preliminary studies of neutron production in an ADSR with a geometry similar to that of the proposed Belgian MYRRHA project. This paper presents the results of our GEANT4 benchmarking and simulations.

The radioisotope Technetium-99m (99mTc) is used in 85\% of all nuclear medicine procedures. 99mTc is produced from its precursor Molybdenum-99 (99Mo), which until recently was produced in only five research reactors worldwide. Recently a number of accelerator-based methods have been proposed to fill this gap and to diversify this supply chain. In the paper we present our base compact (4 m) 10 mA 3.5 MeV accelerator design, to generate low-energy neutrons via fusion. In this design we increase neutron capture with a novel moderator assembly to shift the neutron spectrum into the epithermal resonance region of the 98Mo capture cross-section to create 99Mo. In this paper we examine Li(p, n) reactions for neutron production. Specifically focused on a numerical studies for an optimised target design capable of handling the heat load.

We characterise the neutron flux and energy spectra produced by protons on a lead target. This may enable studies of the neutronics of an ADSR, to be separated from the higher energy spallation processes, in order to explore te potential of ADSR as a better alternative for energy production, safety and waste transmutation. We consider a range of proton energies, and show how the numbers of neutrons produced can be fitted by some simple functions of the proton energy, as can the spatial and energy distributions. These calculations were performed in both MCNPX and Geant4 and we compare and benchmark the low energy neutron spectra obtained by MCNPX code and a Monte Carlo Code Geant4 against each other. Discrepancies were found for the low energy neutron spectrum, but by using different models as calculation options for low energy neutrons in Geant4, this disagreement has been significantly reduced.

A non-scaling fixed field alternating gradient (nsFFAG) accelerator is being designed for helium ion therapy. This facility will consist of 2 nested superconducting rings, treating with helium ions (He2+) and image with hydrogen ions (H2+). Compared to protons, ions deliver a more conformal dose with a significant reduction in range straggling and beam broadening. Carbon ions are currently used and there are no current facilities providing helium therapy. We are investigating the feasibility of an FFAG approach for helium therapy, which has never been previously considered. We investigate emittance and demonstrate that the machine meets isochronicity requirements for fixed frequency RF.

A low energy Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerator has been designed for the production of radioisotopes. Tracking studies have been conducted using the OPAL code, including the effects of space charge. Radioisotopes have a wide range of uses in medicine, and recent disruption to the supply chain has seen a renewed effort to find alternative isotopes and production methods. The design features separate sector magnets with non-scaling, non-linear field gradients but without the counter bends commonly found in FFAG's. The machine is isochronous at the level of 0.3% up to at least 28 MeV and hence able to operate in Continuous Wave (CW) mode. Both protons and helium ions can be used with this design and it has been demonstrated that proton beams with currents of up to 20 mA can be accelerated. An interesting option for the production of radioisotopes is the use of a thin internal target. We have shown that this design has large acceptance, ideal for allowing the beam to be recirculated through the target many times, the lost energy being restored on each cycle. In this way, the production of Technetium-99m, for example, can take place at the optimum energy.

Currently there is an increasing interest in dielectric wall accelerators. These work by slowing the speed of an EM wave to match the velocity of a particle beam, allowing wave-beam interactions, accelerating the beam. However conventional dielectric materials have limited interaction regions, so wave-beam energy transfer is minimal. In this paper we consider Artificial Materials (AMs), as slow wave structures, in the presence of charged particle beams to engineer Inverse-Cherenkov acceleration. AMs are periodic constructs whose properties depend on their subwavelength geometry rather than their material composition, and can be engineered to give an arbitrary dispersion relation. We show that Metamaterials, one example of an AM, can mediate an Inverse-Cherenkov interaction, but break down in high power environments due to high absorption. We consider AMs with low constitutive parameters and show they can exhibit low absorption whilst maintaining the ability to have a user defined dispersion relation, and mediate a wavebeam interaction leading to Inverse-Cherenkov acceleration.

Conventional proton cyclotrons are practically limited by relativistic effects to energies around 250 MeV, sufficient to conduct proton therapy of adults but not for full-body proton tomography. We present an adaptation of the cyclinac scheme for proton imaging, in which a c.250 MeV cyclotron used for treatment feeds a linac that delivers a lower imaging current at up to 350 MeV. Our ProBE cavity design envisages a gradient sufficient to obtain 100 MeV acceleration in 3 metres after focusing is included, suitable for inclusion in the layouts of existing proton therapy centres such as the UK centre under construction at Christie Hospital. In this paper, we present the results of design studies on the linac optics and RF cavity parameters. We detail particle transmission studies and tracking simulation studies.

Funding: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 675265.
The Optimization of Medical Accelerators (OMA) is the aim of a new European Training Network. OMA joins universities, research centers and clinical facilities with industry partners to address the challenges in: treatment facility design and optimization; numerical simulations for the development of advanced treatment schemes; and beam imaging and treatment monitoring. Projects include: compact accelerators for proton beam energy boosting and gantry design; strategies for improving Monte Carlo codes for medical applications and treatment planning; and advanced diagnostics for online beam monitoring. The latter involves RF-based measurements of ultra-low charges and new encoding methodologies for ultra-fast 3D surface scanning. This contribution presents an overview of the network's research program and highlights the various challenges across the three scientific work packages. It also summarizes the network-wide training program consisting of schools, topical workshops and conferences that will be open to the wider medical and accelerator communities.

Dielectric laser-driven accelerators (DLAs) based on gratings confine an electromagnetic field induced by a drive laser into a narrow vacuum channel where electrons travel and are accelerated. This can provide an alternative acceleration technology compared to conventional rf cavity accelerators. Due to the achievable high acceleration gradient of up to several GV/m this could pave the way for future ultra-short and low costμaccelerators. This contribution presents detailed beam dynamics simulations for multi-period double grating structures. Using the computer code VSim and realistic beam distributions, the achievable acceleration gradient and final beam quality in terms of emittance and energy spread are discussed. The results are then used for an overall optimization of the accelerating structure.

The GEM*STAR Consortium of four companies, two universities, and two US national laboratories has formed Mu*STAR, a new company, to fund and build a profitable pilot plant to demonstrate the advantages of subcritical molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactors driven by superconducting RF proton linacs. The GEM*STAR multipurpose reactor design features new accelerator power capabilities, an internal spallation neutron target, and high temperature molten salt fuel with continuous purging of volatile radioactive fission products such that the reactor contains less than a critical mass and almost a million times fewer volatile radioactive fission products than conventional reactors. GEM*STAR is a reactor that without redesign will burn spent nuclear fuel (SNF), natural uranium, thorium, or surplus weapons material. It will operate without the need for a critical core, fuel enrichment, or reprocessing, making it an excellent design overall, and a strong candidate for export. We describe the design and plans for funding a pilot plant that could profitably dispose of excess weapons-grade plutonium.

Funding: This work has been supported through KOMAC operation fund of KAERI by Ministry of Science ICT and Future Planning of Korean Government.
The 20-MeV proton-beams with a fluence of 1012 cm-2 were irradiated on ZnO nanorods. The effects of proton-beam irradiation on ZnO nanorods are investigated by using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. After irradiation, new and modified NMR resonance lines are observed in 1H NMR spectra. The diffusion and thermal stability of each proton species are investigated from the lab- and rotating-frame spin-lattice relaxation data depending on temperature. Understanding the properties of thermally stable hydrogen species created by the beam irradiation may promise many possible applications, since the hydrogen stable up to high temperature only meets the device working conditions.

This research focuses on modification of an elec-tron linear accelerator system for irradiation of natural rubber latex and polymeric materials at the Plasma and Beam Physics Research Facility, Chiang Mai Universi-ty, Thailand. This is in order to study the change of material properties due to electron beam irradiation. The main accelerator system consists of a DC thermi-onic electron gun and a short standing-wave linac. This system will be able to produce electron beams with variable energy in the range of 0.5 to 4 MeV. The linac macro pulse frequency is adjustable within the range of 20 to 1000 Hz. The macro pulse duration is 4 μs. The electron pulse current can be varied from 10 to 100 mA. This lead to the electron dose of about 0.44 to 4.4 Gy-m2/min. In this paper, overview of the accelera-tor and the irradiation system is presented. Results of low-level RF measurements of the accelerating struc-ture are also reported and discussed.

Electron diffraction on VELA at Daresbury Laboratory was first demonstrated in 2014. Since then, we have studied the machine parameter optimisation for single-shot diffraction patterns from single-crystal gold and silicon samples at bunch charges down to 60 fC. We present bunch length measurements for electron diffraction setups determined with a transverse deflecting cavity. We also discuss the current limitations of VELA for electron diffraction and the improvements to be made.

To improve public security and prevent the diversion of radioactive material for Radiation Dispersion Devices, RadiaBeam is developing an inexpensive, portable, easy-to-manufacture linac structure to allow effective capture of a ~13 keV electron beam injected from a conventional electron gun and acceleration to a final energy of ~ 1 MeV. The bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by the electron beam on a high-Z converter at the end of the linac will match the penetration and dose rate of a typical ~100 Ci or more Ir-192 source. The tubular Disk-and-Ring structure under development consists of metal and dielectric elements that reduce or even eliminate multi-cell, multi-step brazing. This may allow significant simplification of the fabrication process to enable inexpensive mass-production required for replacement of the ~55,000 radionuclide sources in the US

Accelerator-Driven system (ADS) is considered the fu-ture nuclear reactor. In principle, it is safer and creates less waste than the conventional nuclear reactor, and provides the transmutation function that converts spent fuel into short-lived elements. However, to fully realize this system, a huge proton accelerator (typically, 1 GeV beam energy and over 10 MW beam power) with ex-tremely high operational stability is necessary. This paper discusses how the currently available technology can be applied for nuclear transmutation.

Operation of high-power SRF particle accelerators at two US national laboratories allows us to consider a less-expensive nuclear reactor that operates without the need for a critical core, fuel enrichment, or reprocessing. A multipurpose reactor design that takes advantage of this new accelerator capability includes an internal spallation neutron target and high-temperature molten-salt fuel with continuous purging of volatile radioactive fission products. The reactor contains less than a critical mass and almost a million times fewer volatile radioactive fission products than conventional reactors like those at Fukushima. We describe GEMSTAR , a reactor that without redesign will burn spent nuclear fuel, natural uranium, thorium, or surplus weapons material. A first application is to burn 34 tonnes of excess weapons grade plutonium as an important step in nuclear disarmament under the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement **. The process heat generated by this W-Pu can be used for the Fischer-Tropsch conversion of natural gas and renewable carbon into 42 billion gallons of low-CO2-footprint, drop-in, synthetic diesel fuel for the DOD.

One important issue identified by the 2014 comprehensive nuclear fuel cycle Evaluation & Screening report* that was chartered by the US Department of Energy was the impact of the electricity required to operate the accelerator on the overall efficiency of an Accelerator Driven System (ADS).The objective of this paper is to contribute some understanding regarding that issue. Then, by looking at several options of existing and projected accelerator technologies for ADS, we evaluate the impact of the technology choice on the efficiency of a conventional ADS facility, in view of investigating the limitations and where there is room for improvement.

When designing a high power accelerator for an ADSR, it is important to optimize the beam parameters to be compatible with the steady state character of the reactor operation and to define an adequate and safe startup procedure. In this study we investigate the impact of the beam time structure on the kinetic behavior of the sub-critical core and derive a general relationship between the time evolution of the neutron population and the proton beam.

Monochromatic gamma-ray beam in MeV energy region is suitable for non-destructive inspection of high density and massive objects because of its high penetrability. A specific nuclide can be detected by the process of Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence (NRF). A non-destructive inspection of Special Nuclear Materials hidden in a container cargo using NRF is proposed by Bertozzi*. Non-destructive detection of Pu inside of a spent nuclear fuel rod is also proposed for management of radioactive wastes, nuclear material accounting and safeguards**. We have developed 2D NRF imaging by using quasi-monochromatic gamma-ray beam in MeV energy region generated by Laser Compton Backscattering (LCS) method*** and proposed to develop an NRF-CT image in the ELI-NP where a high intensity LCS beam can be available in near future. To demonstrate and finalize the measurement system of the NRF-CT imaging by using LCS gamma-ray beam, we have started a study on NRF-CT imaging at the new LCS beamline in UVSOR. The LCS beamline can generate 5.4 MeV LCS gamma-rays with a flux of 1×107 photons/s. We have measured the 5.291 MeV NRF gamma-rays from a lead target in this beamline and tried to take a NRF-CT image.

Advanced maintenance for aging industrial and societal infrastructures such as chemical plant and bridge are strongly needed recently. For the purpose, we are developing, applying and upgrading the 950 keV/3.95 MeV X-band linac X-ray sources for the on-site inspection. Less than 1 MeV accelerators are available for on-site inspection and less than 3.95 MeV accelerators are allowable for only bridge on-site inspection. These systems can visualize in seconds inner states of infrastructures, such as crack of concrete, iron-reinforced rod/wire and other imperfections. By using the 950 keV system, we conducted the first inspection of the real bridge and evaluated degradation of pre-stressed concrete wires. We also demonstrated first on-site use of the 3.95 MeV system in Japan in 2015. We are also performing structural analysis to evaluate the degradation of strength. For more precise evaluation, we are going to carry out a partial angle CT to reconstruct a two-dimensional inner structure. We are going to present the results and strategy of degradation evaluation of the industrial and societal infrastructures by the 950 keV / 3.95 MeV X-ray sources.

An L-Band 7.7-9.8 MeV CW relatively inexpensive microtron with a warm accelerating cavity for multi-purpose applications in nuclear medicine and radiation industry is proposed. The microtron with a photo-neutron converter is intended to serve as an intense source of photo-neutrons with yield up to 4·1012 n/s for nuclear medicine or/and producing of short lived isotopes, as a source of gamma-radiation with dose rates up to 130 kR/min·m with a heavy bremsstrahlung target, and as a source of the electron beam with total energy of 9.8 MeV at the average current up to 4.4 mA for various radiation treatments.

The number of research infrastructures which are being built with significant amount of In-Kind Contributions (IKCs) from partners and stakeholders is on the increase. One of the main advantages of the utilization of IKCs in big science projects is to enable numerous partners with technological and scientific know-how participate directly in such projects. Thus, IKCs promote capacity building in technology and knowledge transfer of these partners. However, management and execution of IKCs are particularly challenging. The 2nd In-Kind Contributions Workshop (IKCW 2015) was organized by the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Europe (FAIR) with the aim of sharing experiences on the procurement and management of large-scale international science projects through IKCs. This paper focuses on the analysis of the issues pertaining to how to best implement and execute IKCs from the initial phase of assignment until full delivery for both accelerator and experiments. Discussions held during IKCW 2015 are used to highlight these points further. The goal of this paper is to present the reader with a synopsis of the challenges and opportunities faced in procurement through IKCs.

Electropolishing is one of the best methods of Nb surface finishing of the superconducting cavity to obtain high accelerating gradient. Mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid is generally used in the electropolishing of Nb. But this solution is very dangerous and because the corrosion of the metal occurs by hydrofluoric acid, all equipment must be made of high density polyethylene or fluorocarbon resin. This causes the expensive cost of electropolishing instrument. In addition, this solution produces sulfur compound on the Nb surface in the electropolishing reaction. This sulfur compound can be field emission sources on the inner surface of cavity and degrades acceleration performance. In this poster, we report noble electropolishing method using periodic reverse current and sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction produces no sulfur content and the equipment is less expensive because the instrument can be made of usual plastic material. As the result of experiments with Nb-coupon samples, we found that the surface roughness is equivalent to the conventional electropolishing method.
