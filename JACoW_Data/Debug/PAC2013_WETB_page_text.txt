RHIC has reached new record luminosity and proton beam polarizations at the collisions energy of 510 and 200 GeV. Depolarizing effects during acceleration and storage can lead to polarization profiles and therefore reduced average polarization at the collision points. The presentation will introduce the concept of depolarizing resonances and methods to overcome them during beam acceleration, measuring techniques for the proton beam polarization and techniques to maintain the beam polarization during an extended store.
