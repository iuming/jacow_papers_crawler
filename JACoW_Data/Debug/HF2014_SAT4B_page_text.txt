Circular electron-positron collider (CEPC) is a 120GeV storage ring-based collder. Due to the small beam size and high sigle bunch population, the collective effects may bring new challenges to the physical design of the machine. A thorough evaluation of the coupling impedance is necessary in controlling the total impedance of the ring, which can accordingly prevent the occurrence of the beam instability. The primary studies on the impedance and collective effects in CEPC are presented.
