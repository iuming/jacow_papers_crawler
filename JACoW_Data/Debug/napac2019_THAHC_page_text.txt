I will present the results of my PhD project, centred on the experimental study of the radiation sources raised by the excitation of propagating Surface Plasmons (SPs) on solid targets irradiated by highly intense, short laser pulses. This work, originally aiming at the investigation of how to enhance the laser-target coupling with micro-structured periodic targets, encourages both the development of a suitable theory for SPs in such a non-linear regime, and the possibility to exchange ideas and applications between classical plasmonics and the domain of relativistic laser-plasma acceleration*. Our experiments show that the SP excitation is correlated to the acceleration of dense electron bunches of few MeV of energies along the surface of the laser-irradiated target**, and to the emission in the same direction of high order harmonics of the laser frequency***. Both emissions can be optimized by an appropriate tuning of the laser-target parameters (incidence angle, target profile and density). In addition, 2D Particle-In-Cell simulations reveal a spatio-temporal correlation between accelerated electrons and harmonics that gives insight on the generation mechanism of the XUV beam.

The proposed integrated program of the Future Circular Collider(FCC) takes a huge step beyond LEP and LHC. The FCC consists, in a first stage, of an energy- and luminosity-frontier electron-positron collider, which will operate at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies from about 90 to 365 GeV, and serve as electroweak factory. The second stage of the FCC will be a 100 TeV proton collider based on novel high-field magnets. A similar project is being proposed in China. In parallel to the development of future colliders, also the field of publications is undergoing profound changes. Physical Review Accelerators and Beams (PRAB) was founded in 1997 as a pioneering all-electronic diamond open-access journal, far ahead of its time. For many years PRAB was the fastest growing journal in the Physical Review family. Authors, editors and referees are highly internationalized. In this paper, on the occasion of the acceptance of the 2019 USPAS Prize for Achievement in Accelerator Science and Technology, I sketch the history, status, and challenges of FCC and PRAB.

Ultrashort pulse lasers enable resonant excitation of plasma waves, efficiently driving structures that can accelerate particles at rates of in the range of a GeV per centimeter. Guiding of such lasers in plasma structures formed by laser heating, capillary discharges and most recently by combining these two techniques has extended the depth of interaction from millimeter to tens of centimeter scale. This has enabled generation of narrow energy spread beams initially at the 0.1 GeV scale through recent results up to 7.8 GeV. Experiments have combined two stages at low energies and staging at multi-GeV energies is being prepared, laying the foundation for future systems to extend the reach of high energy particle physics. At the GeV energy scale, compact electron beams are being used to develop novel compact photon sources including free electron lasers, and MeV photons from Thomson scattering. These have the potential to bring the power of large scientific light sources, including reduced dose and increased resolution, to applications from nuclear nonproliferation to medicine.

Particle-in-Cell Simulations of Plasma Production in C100 SRF Cavity for in Situ Cleaning

Particle-in-cell simulations provide insight into the parameters of the plasma that can be used to remove impurities from superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity walls in situ. Surface contamination of the vessel walls can severely impact the achievable field strength. Therefore, efficient and effective cleaning of the cavity surfaces is necessary to maintain optimal acceleration gradients. In situ cleaning techniques involve generating plasma discharges that remove the impurities through chemical and mechanical processes*. The benefits of these techniques are to reduce the field emission and increase stability for devices with complex geometries without the need for disassembly. Theoretical methods have emerged to increase the effectiveness of the plasma discharge cleaning; however, there is an inherent risk when attempting new methods experimentally. We have performed particle-in-cell simulations of the C100 cavity including ionization, recombination, and scattering interactions to explore the parameters of the plasma generated via EM signal. These properties provide an insight into the plasma generation and its predicted effectiveness at removing impurities.
