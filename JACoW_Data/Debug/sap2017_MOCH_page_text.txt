Phase space gymnastics is a highly evolved accelerator physics technique based on the finest properties of the phase space. As modern accelerators become increasingly demanding, these techniques are finding a sharp increase in their applications. Here we intend only to introduce this topic to bring attention t

A 2×4-cell superconducting linac module for the THz-FEL facility has been developed at the China Academy of Engineering Physics, which is expected to provide 6~8 MeV quasi-CW electron beams with an average current of 1~5 mA. The module consists of two 4-cell cavities, two power couplers, two tuners and the cyromodule. The main components are tested before the module assembly. The cavity test includes microwave measurement at room temperature and vertical test at 2 K. The conditioning and test of the couplers are also finished. The performances of the main components and the whole module are present-ed in this paper. The horizontal test indicated that the effective field gradients of both cavities have reached 10 MV/m, which have satisfied our designed goal.

We had mainly carried on the debugging and commissioning of CYCIAE-100 for Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility (BRIF) in 2016. The installation and commissioning of south extraction system in the remaining works, the south proton beam lines and part of experimental target stations had been completed, meanwhile, the installation of partial shields for the fort section also had been finished in the large experimental hall, and they had been put into physical experiment for the first time. The debugging work of CYCIAE-100 went well, the maximum internal target beam was 1073uA, and the maximum external target beam had reached 45uA. It ws the first time that the CYCIAE-100 had provided proton beam 500 hours in 2016 for the physics experiment of single event effect, measurement of proton effective dose, white light neutron, and proton radiography.
