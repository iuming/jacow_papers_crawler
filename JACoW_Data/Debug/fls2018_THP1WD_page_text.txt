Normal conducting RF gun as well as DC gun and superconducting RF gun are the potential technologies for generation of high-brightness beam for the CW XFELs. This talk will firstly review the three gun technologies in term of beam performances, advantages and disadvantages. LCLS-II has chosen normal conducting RF gun for the CW photoinjector. We will then update LCLS-II injector design, construction, and commissioning which is expected to start in March 2018.

LCLS-II is a new xFEL facility under construction at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a superconducting electron linac designed to operate up to §I{1.2}{MW} of beam power. This generates more serious beam hazards than the typical sub-kW linac operation of the existing xFEL facility, Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). SLAC uses a set of safety controls termed the Beam Containment System (BCS) to limit beam power and losses to prevent excessive radiation in occupied areas. The high beam power hazards of LCLS-II necessitate the development of new BCS devices and a larger scale deployment than previously done at LCLS. We present the new radiation hazards introduced by LCLS-II and the design development for the BCS.

The Advanced Photon Source (APS) linac is mainly used to accelerate electron beams generated by a thermionic RF gun for APS storage ring operation. In 2014, a high-gradient S-band Photo-Cathode Gun (PCG) was installed at the front end of the linac, expanding the linac's capability to include high brightness photo-electron beams. In 2017, the interleaving operation of the thermionic and PC gun beams in the linac during the storage ring top-up operation was successfully commissioned. The interleaving operation enabled the PCG beam's availability to year-round. For the R&D towards future light sources, a new beam line at the Linac Extension Area (LEA) is being designed and constructed to support advanced accelerator technology and beam physics experiments. In this paper, we report our photo-cathode injector design, present the experimental measurements of beam properties at the APS linac, and compare the results with numerical simulations. Optimization for the first experiment at LEA using the high brightness photo-cathode electron beam is discussed, as well as an outlook for future potential experiments at LEA.
