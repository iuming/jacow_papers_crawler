PXIE is the front-end test stand of the proposed PIP-II initiative i.e. the first step towards a CW-compatible, pulsed H− superconducting RF linac upgrade to Fermilab’s injection complex. The test stand for this machine will be built step-wise; the Ion Source and Low-Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) are currently in place, with the RFQ and MEBT due for installation 2015. The initial LEBT configuration under investigation in this paper is comprised of a D-Pace Filament-driven H− source and a single downstream solenoid, accompanied by a number of beam-diagnostic tools. The emittance studies expounded are performed via two methods: a position-angle phase-space sweep using an Allison-type emittance scanner; a solenoid corrector-induced transverse beam shift, impinging the bunch on an isolated, biased diaphragm. A detailed comparison of the two results is outlined.

The long range plan for Fermilab calls for large proton beam intensities in excess of 2 MW for use in the neutrino program. Measuring the transverse profiles of these high intensity beams is challenging and generally relies on non-invasive techniques. One such technique involves measuring the deflection of a beam of electrons with a trajectory perpendicular to the proton beam. A device such as this is already in use at the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL and a similar device will be installed shortly in the Fermilab Main Injector. The Main Injector device is discussed in detail and some test results and simulations are shown.

ASTA is a facility at Fermilab that, once completed, will consist of a photoinjector with two superconducting capture cavities, at least one superconducting ILC-style cryomodule, and a small ring for studying non-linear, integrable beam optics. This paper discusses the layout for the optical transport system that will provide THz radiation to a Martin-Puplett interferometer for bunch length measurements as well as optical radiation to an externally located streak camera, also for bunch length measurements. It will be able to accept radiation from two synchrotron radiation ports in the bunch compressor, a diffraction/transition radiation screen downstream of the compressor, and a transition radiation screen after the spectrometer magnet for measurements of energy-time correlations.

The latest generation of IPM's installed in the Fermilab Main Injector and Recycler incorporate a 1 kG permanent magnet, a newly designed high-gain, rad-tolerant preamp, and a control grid to moderate the charge that is allowed to arrive on the anode pick-up strips. The control grid is intended to select a single Booster batch measurement per turn. Initially it is being used to allow for a faster turn-on of a single, high-intensity cycle in either machine. The expectation is that this will extend the Micro Channel Plate lifetime, which is the high-cost consumable in the measurement system. We discuss the new design and data acquired with this system.

To cope with the demands of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) for high current operation at the GSI Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator UNILAC non intercepting methods for transverse beam profile measurement are required. In addition to intercepting diagnostics like Secondary Electron Emission Grid (SEM-Grid) or scintillating screens, the Beam Induced Fluorescence (BIF) Monitor, an optical measurement device based on the observation of fluorescent light emitted by excited nitrogen molecules, was brought to routine operation. Starting with the first installations in 2008 and consequent improvements, successively six monitors were set up in the UNILAC and in the transfer line (TK) towards the synchrotron SIS18. BIF is used as a standard diagnostic tool to observe the ion beam at kinetic energies between 1.4 and 11.4 MeV/u. Beside the standard operation mode where the gas pressure is varied, further detailed investigations were conducted. The BIF setups were tested with various beam parameters. Different settings of camera, optics and image intensification were applied to improve the image quality for data analysis. In parallel, the light yield from different setups was compared for various ions, charge states, beam energies and particle numbers.

The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) poses new challenges for standard beam instrumentation like precise beam imaging over a wide range of beam parameters, radiation hardness, etc. A new, fully FAIR-conformal system for standard scintillating screen based beam diagnostics was developed at GSI. To cover a wide range of foreseen applications, a new technical solution was required for the upcoming FAIR High Energy Beam Transport lines and Rings. The newly developed system including digital image acquisition, remote controllable optical system and mechanical design, was set up and commissioned with beam. CUPID (Control Unit for Profile and Image Data) is based on the CERN Front-End Software Architecture (FESA) to control beam diagnostic devices. The FESA class for the digital GigE camera (IDS uEye UI-5240SE-M, CMOS type) acquires the images and pre-processes the optical data as required by the geometry of the setup (rotation, stretching). The performance of the system reaches more than 15 frames per second with one connected client. If desired, the raw image data can be written to a file for offline analysis. Additionally, dedicated FESA classes access industrial Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for a reliable slow control solution using the CERN IEPLC library. Camera control, timing, as well as power supply and reset options for up to eight digital cameras are realized by the in-house developed Camera Power Supply controller CPS8. We report on first results with the novel system during routine beam operation. In addition, we describe first operating experiences with new radiation-hard camera (Thermo Fischer Scientific, CCIR MegaRAD3) installed at the SIS18 extraction point with high radiation level.

At the heavy ion LINAC at GSI, a novel scheme of non-invasive Bunch Shape Monitor has been tested with several ions beam at 11.4 MeV/u and beam current in the range from 80 μA to 1000 μA. Caused by the beam impact on the residual gas, secondary electrons are liberated. These electrons are accelerated by an electrostatic field, transported through a sophisticated electrostatic energy analyzer and an rf-deflector, acting as a time-to-space converter. Finally a MCP amplifies the electrons and the electron distribution is detected by a CCD camera. For the applied beam settings this Bunch Shape Monitor is able to obtain longitudinal profiles down to of 250 ps RMS width with an RMS resolution of 34 ps, corresponding to 0.5° of the 36 MHz acceleration frequency. Systematic parameter studies, for the device were performed to demonstrate the applicability and to determine the achievable resolution. The background contribution, as orginated by x-rays, are investigated.

Due to its good spatial resolution, the YAG:Ce screen monitor is often used for small beam profile measurement in the Linac and beam transport line. We constructed a high-resolution YAG:Ce screen monitor at KEK-ATF2 for the observation of small size beams a. We tested two types of screens, one is powder YAG:Ce and the other is single crystal YAG:Ce. Both screens have 50μm thickness. To escape from strong COTR, we applied delayed timing of the gate for the CCD camera. A microscope having a spatial resolution of 6μm was set outside of a vacuum chamber to observe the scintillation light from the YAG:Ce screen. The results of the difference between the two screens, the camera performance with delayed gate, and the optical performance of the microscope will be presented in this session.

During the shutdown in summer 2012, we installed three BSMs (Bunch Shape Monitors) at the upstream of the ACS (Annular Coupled Structure Linac) section in order to perform longitudinal matching. ACS cavities were installed in summer 2013 to upgrade the Linac energy from 181 MeV to 400 MeV. Prior to the ACS installation, BSMs were installed and the beam commissioning of the BSMs has been conducted after the summer shutdown in 2012. During the BSM measurements, a problem of the degradation in vacuum conditions was found. One reason for this problem is the dark current resulting in the desorption of absorbed gas molecules. And another reason is the outgas released from materials when the high voltage and RF power are supplied for the electro-static lens and RF deflector, respectively. In order to solve this problem, BSMs were dismounted from the beam line and the off-line baking operations with outgas analysis had been performed to avoid the degradation of the vacuum. As the result of the gas analysis, we found that the outgas contains some heavy hydrocarbons. After these heavy hydrocarbon gaseous were removed and the vacuum level improved for about one order, we completed off-line baking. We will install all three BSMs in at the upstream of the ACS again with the additional vacuum pumps. This paper describes the vacuum degradation of the BSMs, how to conduct the baking operation for BSMs and its results. The improved set-ups of the vacuum are also introduced.

A new spectrometer system has been developed at ANKA for near-field single-shot Electro-Optical (EO) bunch profile measurements with a frame rate of 5 Mfps. The frame rate of commercial line detectors is limited to several tens of kHz, unsuitable for measuring fast dynamic changes of the bunch conditions. The new system aims to realize continuous data acquisition and over long observation periods without dead time. InGaAs or Si linear array pixel sensors are used to detect the near IR and visible spectrum radiation. The detector signals are fed via wire-bonding connections to the GOTTHARD ASIC, a charge-sensitive amplifier with analog outputs. The front-end board is also equipped with an array of fast ADCs. The digital samples are then acquired by an FPGA-based readout card and transmitted to an external DAQ system via a high-speed PCI-Express data link. The DAQ system uses high-end Graphics Processors Units (GPUs) to perform a real-time analysis of the beam conditions. In this paper we present the concept, the first prototype and the low-noise layout techniques used for fast linear detectors.

The 1L harp is the last beam diagnostic preceding LANSCE’s 1L Target, the neutron source of LANSCE’s Lujan Center, and consists of two orthogonal planes of stationary sense wires for monitoring the beam distribution prior to its arrival at the target. A new data acquisition system has been developed for the 1L harp that features a National Instruments CompactRIO contained within a BiRIO chassis hosting electronic circuits for signal conditioning and a new feature for sense wire integrity monitoring. Hardware design, software architecture, and preliminary data acquisition results will be described.

Diffraction radiation (DR), which is closely related to transition radiation, is emitted when an electron passes near an edge or interface between two media with different dielectric constants. Theoretical and experimental investigation of DR is widely performing for a non-intercepting electron beam diagnostic. We have developed an electron bunch length and a beam position monitor using a coherent diffraction radiation (CDR), which is in the range of sub-millimeter wavelength. The frequency spectrum of CDR depends on a form factor expressed as the Fourier transform of the longitudinal particle distribution. We have measured the spatial intensity distribution of CDR emitted from the metallic edge with a terahertz camera. Total intensity passing through band pass filters (BPFs) was decreased as the transmission frequency of BPFs is increased up to 6 THz. The result indicates that the bunch length is few hundreds of femtosecond. A detailed data analysis is now performing. On the other hand, we have measured the intensity distribution of CDR emitted from the metallic rectangular slit. Bow-tie intensity distribution, aligned along the perpendicular direction to the slit edge, was measured with the terahertz camera. Moreover, when the electron beam did not pass through the center of the slit, an asymmetrical intensity distribution appeared. This asymmetry is due to the pre-wave zone effect. In short, we can found the beam position to the slit by measuring the asymmetry. In this conference, we will present the experimental results.

The Target Imaging System (TIS) shows the size and position of the proton beam by using a luminescent Cr:Al2O3 coating on the SNS target. The proton beam hitting the coating creates light which is transferred through mirrors and optical fibers to a digital camera outside the high radiation area. The TIS is used during operations to verify that the beam is in the right location and does not exceed the maximum proton beam peak density. This paper describes our operational experience with the TIS and the results of studies on the linearity, uniformity, and luminescence decay of the coating. In the future, tubes with material samples might be placed in front of the target for irradiation studies. The simulations of placing tubes in the front of target coating and its effect on the beam width and position measurements are also discussed.

The PAL-XFEL is an X-ray free electron laser under construnction at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. In the PAL-XFEL, the electron beam can make coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) due to the microbunching instability in the compressed electron beam. In order to obtain transverse beam profiles without the COTR problem, we are developing scintillating screen monitors (with the geometric suppress method) and wire scanners. In this paper, we report test results at the test facility and progress in the development of the screen monitor and the wire scanner for the PAL-XFEL.

As a follow-up study to the initial design of FRIB Loss Monitor Ring (previously named Halo Monitor Ring [1]), we present recent results of coupling studies between the FRIB CW beam and the Loss Monitor Ring (LMR). While a ~33 kHz low-pass filter was proposed to attenuate high-frequency AC-coupled signals [1,2], the LMR current signal may still contain low frequency signals induced by the un-intercepted beam, for example, by the 50μs beam notch that repeats every 10ms. We use CST Microwave Studio to simulate the AC response of a Gaussian source signal and benchmarked it to analytical model. A circuit model for beam-notch-induced AC signal is deduced and should put a ~33pA (peak) bipolar pulse on the LMR at 100Hz repetition rate. Although its amplitude falls into our tolerable region, we could consider an extended background integration to eliminate this effect.

We will use beam loss monitors for protection of the hardware of SuperKEKB against the unexpected sudden beam loss. The sensors are ion chambers and PIN photo-diodes. The loss monitor system gives an important trigger for the beam abort system. We can optimize the threshold of the abort trigger by checking the beam information at each abort moment. This paper explains the overall system of the SuperKEKB beam loss monitors including the damping ring.

Fiber monitors are an attractive beam loss diagnostics tool. They are based on the detection of the electromagnetic shower produced by the main beam losses. Cherenkov radiation is produced by the electromagnetic shower charged particles within the multimode fibers attached to the vacuum chamber. It is consequently converted to an electrical signal containing the information about the position and intensity of the beam losses. Therefore, a system based on the fibers installed alongside the whole accelerator together with the signal detection system forms a continuous, real-time Fiber Beam Loss Monitor (FBLM). In this context, the FBLM is a very useful tool for the commissioning and beam alignment. In this article we report on the development of the real-time display system for the FBLM at PHIL (PHotoInjector at LAL, Orsay, France) as a prototype of the beam loss monitor for the ThomX project, the compact Compton based X-ray source under construction in Orsay

The S-DALINAC is the superconducting linear accelerator of the Institut für Kernphysik at Technische Universität Darmstadt. It delivers an electron beam with energies up to 130 MeV. In order to get a short-time response about occurring beam losses and their locations a new system was tested and installed. The setup is based on beam loss monitors of Bergoz company using two pin-diodes to record primary electrons as well as secondary radiation in a coincidence set-up. The readout is done using a self-developed system of a supply unit including differential line-drivers and fast counting cards compatible to our EPICS-based control system. We will report on the installation of the whole system and its first commissioning as well as on the future use of the system for experiments on threshold currents for transverse beam break up.

The Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) detectors close to the interaction points (IP) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are currently located outside the cryostat, far from the superconducting coils of the magnets. In addition to their sensitivity to lost beam particles, they also detect particles coming from the experimental collisions, which do not contribute significantly to the heat deposition in the superconducting coils. In the future, with beams of higher energy and brightness resulting in higher luminosity, distinguishing between these interaction products and dangerous quench-provoking beam losses from the primary proton beams will be challenging. The system can be optimised by locating beam loss monitors as close as possible to the superconducting coils, inside the cold mass of the magnets in superfluid helium at 1.9 K. The dose then measured by such Cryogenic Beam Loss Monitors (CryoBLMs) would more precisely correspond to the real dose deposited in the coil. The candidates under investigation for such detectors are based on silicon and diamond, several of which have now been installed inside the magnets in the LHC tunnel. This contribution will present the mechanical and electrical designs of these systems, as well as the results of their qualification testing.
