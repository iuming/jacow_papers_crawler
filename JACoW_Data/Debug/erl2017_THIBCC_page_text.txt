The main linac prototype cryomodule (MLC) is a key component for the Cornell-BNL ERL Test Accelerator (CBETA) project, which is a 4-turn FFAG ERL under construction at Cornell University. After the success of the initial MLC test, the MLC has been moved into the final location for the initial beam test into the MLC. The levels of microphonic in the MLC cavities without fast tuner compensation were measured at the initial and the final location, confirming that these should not limit the CBETA requirement of a nominal energy gain of 36 MeV per pass. Nevertheless, a further reduction of microphonics is desirable for improved energy stability and reduced RF power demand. The cryogenic gas line to the MLC was optimized to reduce vibrations. A piezoelectric-driven fast tuner is installed on each MLC cavity, and its usefulness in compensating cavity microphonics was studied. Here we report details from these tests and summarize results.

The Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA), currently under construction at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, requires a newly designed digital low-level radio frequency (LLRF) system. Challenging requirements have to be fulfilled to ensure high beam quality and beam parameter stability. First, the layout with two recirculations and the requirements will be shown from an LLRF point of view. Afterwards, different options for the control system are presented. This includes the generator-driven system, the self-excited loop and classical PID controller as well as more sophisticated solutions.
