Lawrence Livermore National Lab is developing an intense, high-brightness fast neutron source to create high resolution neutron radiographs and images. An intense source (1011 n/s/sr at 0 degrees) of fast neutrons (10 MeV) allows: penetrating very thick, dense objects; maintaining high scintillator response efficiency; and remaining below the air activation threshold for (n,p) reactions. Fast neutrons will be produced using a pulsed 7 MeV, 300 microamp average-current commercial ion accelerator that will deliver deuterons to a 3 atmosphere deuterium gas cell. To achieve high resolution, a small (1.5 mm diameter) beam spot size will be used, and to reduce scattering from lower energy neutrons, a transmission gas cell will be used to produce a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam. Because of the high power density of such a tightly focused, modest-energy ion beam, the gas target is a major engineering challenge that combines a 'windowless' rotating aperture, a rotary valve to meter cross-flowing high pressure gases, a novel gas beam stop, and recirculating gas compressor systems. A summary of the progress of the system design and building effort shall be presented.

The potential of particle therapy due to focused dose deposition in the Bragg peak has not yet been fully realized due to inaccuracies in range verification. We report correlation of the Bragg peak location with target structure, by overlaying thermoacoustic localization of the Bragg peak onto a standard ultrasound image. Pulsed delivery of 50 MeV protons was accomplished by a fast chopper installed between the ion source and the inflector of the 88" cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. 2 Gy were delivered in 2 μs by a beam with peak current of 2 μA. Thermoacoustic emissions were detected by a clinical ultrasound array, which also generated a grayscale ultrasound image. Data was collected in a room temperature water bath and gelatin phantom with a cavity designed to mimic the intestine, where gas pockets can displace the Bragg peak. Experiments were performed with the cavity both empty and filled with olive oil. In the waterbath overlays of the Bragg peak agreed with Monte Carlo simulations to within 800±170 μm. Agreement within 1.3 ± 0.2 mm was achieved in the gelatin phantom, for which stopping power was estimated to first order from CT scans.

An important challenge in the development of practical X-ray sources based on Inverse Compton Scattering is the implementation of a reliable, increased-repetition-rate operation cycle. To this end, we report the first demonstration of an actively re-amplified CO2 laser intra-cavity ICS source, which matches the electron linac pulse structure at 40 MHz repetition rate. Multi-bunch interaction with 5- and 15-pulse trains was demonstrated, and near linear photon yield gain from multi-pulse interaction was demonstrated. The system shows noticeably higher operational reliability than several contemporary single shot systems, as well as a great potential for future scalability.
