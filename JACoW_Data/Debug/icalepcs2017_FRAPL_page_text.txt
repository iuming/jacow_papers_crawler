The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a global project to build a multi-purpose radio telescope that will play a major role in answering key questions in modern astrophysics and cosmology. It will be one of a small number of cornerstone observatories around the world that will provide astrophysicists and cosmologists with a transformational view of the Universe. Two major goals of the SKA is to study the history and role of neutral Hydrogen in the Universe from the dark ages to the present-day, and to employ pulsars as probes of fundamental physics. Since 2008, the global radio astronomy community has been engaged in the development of the SKA and is now nearing the end of the 'Pre-Construction' phase. This talk will give an overview of the current status of the SKA and the plans for construction, focusing on the computing and software aspects of the project.

Funding: DKIST is a facility of the National Solar Observatory funded by the National Science Foundation under a cooperative agreement with the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.
The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is currently under construction on the summit of Haleakala on the island of Maui. When completed in late 2019 it will be the largest optical solar telescope in the world with a 4m clear aperture and a suite of state of the art instruments that will enable our Sun to be studied in unprecedented detail. In this paper we describe the current state of testing, commissioning and calibration of the telescope and how that is supported by the DKIST control system.

At the SPring-8 site, the X-ray free electron laser facility, SACLA, and the third generation light source, SPring-8 storage ring, is operated. The SACLA generate brilliant coherent X-ray beams with wavelength of below 0.1nm and the SPring-8 provides brilliant X-ray to large number of experimental users. On the SPring-8 upgrade project we have a plan to use the linac of SACLA for a full-energy injector. For this purpose, two accelerators should be controlled seamlessly and the SACLA has to operate as to generate X-ray laser and injector for the SPring-8 simultaneously. We start the design of control system to meet those requirements. We redesign all of a control framework such as Database, Messaging System and Equipment Control include with NoSQL database, MQTT and EtherCAT. In this paper, we will report the design of control system for SACLA/SPring-8 together with status of the SPring-8 upgrade project.

Diagnostics and Instrumentation Challenges at LCLS-II

LCLS-II is the new superconducting linac-based hard x-ray free electron laser at SLAC and poses a significant new challenge for diagnostics and instrumentation over the present LCLS-I copper linac facility. LCLS-II operates in CW mode with a bunch repetition rate of 1 MHz compared to the pulsed 120 Hz operation at LCLS-I. Tuning and optimization of the beam requires single bunch measurement of beam parameters at up to the full beam rate. We rely on FPGA-based embedded controls and data processing to handle this high bandwidth of data. The presentation will give an overview of the major global systems including the timing and machine protection systems as well as detailing the individual diagnostics for beam position, bunch length, beam size and FEL output required for tuning the machine.

The ELI Beamlines facility is a Petawatt laser facility in the final construction and commissioning phase in Prague, Czech Republic. End 2017, a first experiment will be performed. In the end, four lasers will be used to control beamlines in six experimental halls. The central control system connects and controls more than 40 complex subsystems (lasers, beam transport, beamlines, experiments, facility systems, safety systems), with high demands on network, synchronisation, data acquisition, and data processing. It relies on a network based on more than 15.000 fibres, which is used for standard technology control (PowerLink over fibre and standard Ethernet), timing (WhiteRabbit) and dedicated high-throughput data acquisition. Technology control is implemented on standard industrial platforms (B&R) in combination with uTCA for more demanding applications. The data acquisition system is interconnected via Infiniband, with an option to integrate OmniPath. Most control hardware installations are completed, and many subsystems are already successfully in operation. An overview and status will be given.

The Laser MegaJoule Facility: Control System Status Report
2007

The Laser MegaJoule (LMJ) is a 176-beam laser facility, located at the CEA CESTA Laboratory near Bordeaux (France). It is designed to deliver about 1.4 MJ of energy to targets, for high energy density physics experiments, including fusion experiments. The first 8-beams bundle was operated in October 2014 and a new bundle was commissioned in October 2016. The next two bundles are on their way. There are three steps for the validation of a new bundle and its integration to the existing control system. The first step is to verify the ability of every command control subsystems to drive the new bundle using a secondary independent supervisory. It is performed from a dedicated integration control room. The second is to switch the bundle to the main operations control room supervisory. At this stage, we perform the global system tests to validate the commissioning of the new bundle. In this paper we focus on the switch of a new bundle from the integration control room to the main operations control room. We have to connect all equipment controllers of the bundle to the operations network and update the Facility Configuration Management.

After 20 years of operation, the ESRF has embarked upon an extremely challenging project - the Extremely Brilliant Source (ESRF - EBS) . The goal of this project is to construct a 4th generation light source storage ring inside the existing 844m long tunnel. The EBS will increase the brilliance and coherence by a factor of 100 with respect to the present ESRF storage ring. A major challenge is to keep the present ring operating 24x7 while designing and pre-constructing all the elements of the new ring. This is the first time a 4th generation light source will be constructing inside an existing tunnel. This paper concentrates on the control system aspects. The control system is 100% TANGO based. The paper will list the main challenges of the new storage ring like the Hot Swap Powersupply, the new timing system, how reliable operation was maintained while modernizing the injector control system and preparing the new storage ring control system, the new historical database, and how extensive use was made of software simulators achieve this.
