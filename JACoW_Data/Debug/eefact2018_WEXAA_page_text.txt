High precision experiments in charmonium sector require beam energy calibration. VEPP-4M storage ring with energy measurement by resonant depolarization (RD) method provided high precision mass measurement of J/ψ- and ψ(2S)- mesons with KEDR detector with accuracy 2×10-6. This narrow resonances can be used for calibration of energy scale of other accelerators such as BEPC-II or future Super Charm-Tau Factories equipped with Compton backscattering (CBS) energy measurement system.

Polarization Issues at CEPC

We study a possibility of obtaining transversely polarized electron-positron beams at the CEPC collider. At the beam energy of 45 GeV, this requires the use of the special wigglers to speed up the radiative self-polarization process. A numerical estimation of the depolarizing effect of the collider field errors is made, taking into account the modulation of the spin precession frequency by synchrotron oscillations. In addition, we consider an alternative possibility of obtaining polarization by accelerating the polarized particles in the booster and then injecting them into the main ring. This option saves time spent on the polarization process, and is also crucial for obtaining longitudinal polarization.

Systematic Errors Between Beam Energy and Spin Tune at FCC-ee

The goal of beam energy calibration is to define central mass energy at the interaction point (IP). The most accurate method is resonant depolarization technique with relative error of 1 ppm in single beam energy calibration. The whole procedure consists of measurement of spin precession frequency, and calculations of beam energy averaged over circumference, beam energy at IP and central mass energy. The talk is discussing errors introduced on each step of central mass energy determination.

Different schemes for getting the longitudinal polarization at FCC-ee are considered. Depolarization rates for rings with spin rotators are evaluated and methods of acceleration of polarized beams in a booster synchrotron are proposed.
