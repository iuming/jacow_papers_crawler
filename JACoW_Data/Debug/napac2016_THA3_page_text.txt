Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) is the centerpiece of Fermilab's plan for upgrading the accelerator complex to establish the leading facility in the world for particle physics research based on intense proton beams. PIP-II has been developed to provide 1.2 MW of proton beam power at the start of operations of the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE), while simultaneously providing a platform for eventual extension of LBNE beam power to >2 MW and enabling future initiatives in rare processes research based on high duty factor/higher beam power operations. PIP-II is based on the construction of a new 800 MeV superconducting linac, augmented by improvements to the existing Booster, Recycler, and Main Injector complex. PIP-II is currently in the development stage with an R&D program underway targeting the front end and superconducting RF acceleration technologies. This paper will describe the status of the PIP-II conceptual development, the associated technology R&D programs, and the strategy for project implementation.

The ESS accelerator construction has started and the tunnel and RF gallery will be handed over to the accelerator division in 2016 with the installation of the cryoplant starting later in the year. Beam should be delivered in June 2019 at 570 MeV and 1.5 MW with full 5 MW capability being available in 2023. The project is a highly contributed project with more than 50% of the total budget being contributed IK by more than 25 IK partners. The talk will review the project status reflecting the IK nature of the project with the many partners contributions and with some focus on the cryogenics systems.

The ability to transport a high current proton beam in a ring is ultimately limited by space charge effects. Two novel ways to overcome this limit in a proton ring are by adding low energy, externally matched electron beams (electron lens, e-lens), and by taking advantage of residual gas ionization induced neutralization to create an electron column (e-column). Theory predicts that an appropriately confined electrons can completely compensate the space charge through neutralization, both transversely and longitudinally. In this report, we will discuss the current status of the Fermilab's e-lens experiment for the space charge compensation. In addition, we will show how the IOTA e-column compensates space charge with the WARP simulations. The dynamics of proton beams inside of the e-column isunderstood by changing the magnetic field of a solenoid, the voltage on the electrodes, and the vacuum pressure, and by looking for electron accumulation, as well as by considering various beam dynamics in the IOTA ring.
