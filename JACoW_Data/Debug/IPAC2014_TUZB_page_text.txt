Permanent magnet based accelerator magnets may offer a viable alternative to their conventional electromagnetic pairs for many applications, especially where strong gradients and low power consumption is needed. As an example, the development of future light sources based on ultimate storage ring needs to be done in an important energy saving context aiming at a significant reduction of operational costs. After more than two decades of continuous developments in the field of permanent insertion devices, a knowledge capital on different issues such as aging effects has been gained. This technology seems ready to jump into the design and construction of advanced accelerator magnets. This talk reviews the status of the permanent magnet technology and the perspectives for its implementations in standard lattice magnets, highlighting both the advantages and the challenges as compared to electromagnetic magnets.

The enthusiasm that followed the discovery of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) and the hope that they could replace Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS) was damped by low current-carrying capacity, short piece lengths, and fragility of the brittle oxide materials. Development of applications was mainly on devices less demanding of conductor performance. However, with continuing development, progress was made with the cuprate superconductors, and long lengths of BSCCO 2223 and REBCO tape conductors are now commercially available. Progress has also been made in the development of BSSCO 2212 round wire, where implementation of a new production process has led to a breakthrough in performance. Though still at the research level, attainments in material synthesis and theoretical understanding of iron-based materials may lead to their development into practical superconductors, featuring high upper critical field and low anisotropy. A review of the potential of HTS as applied to accelerators is presented, with a focus on using the presently available materials and on the perceived needs for further development.
