Circular electron-positron collider (CEPC) is a dedi-cated project proposed by China to research the Higgs boson. The collider ring provides e+ e− collision at two interaction points (IP). The luminosity for the Higgs mode at the beam energy of 120GeV is 3*1034 cm-2s-1 at each IP while the synchrotron radiation (SR) power per beam is 30MW. Furthermore, CEPC is compatible with W and Z experiments, for which the beam energies are 80 GeV and 45.5 GeV respectively. The luminosity at the Z mode is higher than 1.7*1035 cm-2s-1 per IP. Top-up operation is available during the data taking of high energy physics. Super Proton-Proton Collider (SPPC) is envisioned to be an extremely powerful machine, with centre mass energy of 75 TeV, a nominal luminosity of 1.0*1035 cm-2s-1 per IP, and an integrated luminosity of 30 ab-1 assuming 2 interaction points and ten years of running. The status of CEPC and SPPC will be introduced in detail in this paper.
