Future electron-ion colliders collide high-intensity ion beams with high current electron beams. The electron beams take advantage of synchrotron radiation to damp emittances but the ion beams must be cooled via a beam cooling mechanism, including electron cooling. The ion energies are typically a few hundreds of GeV per nucleon, for an electron-ion collider envisioned to be built in US. At this energy, DC coolers powered by electrostatic accelerators, are not useful. The ERL, in principle, can provide the high current and brightness to cool these high-brightness ion beams. The beam quality requirements are much different from previous ERLs designs used for FELs. The cooling bunch must be much longer than in an FEL and the relative energy spread must be very small. Incoherent cooling can be enhanced with magnetized beams, but the magnetization must be maintained throughout the ERL. An alternate cooling mechanism, the so-called Coherent Electron Cooling, is, in principle, stronger and can be done with non-magnetized beams. We will present several applications of ERLs to high energy electron cooling and describe the technical challenges that must be overcome to build such an ERL.

We will present the various applications by using cERL accelerator. For exapmple, the development of the production of high power IR-FEL and THz radiation in cERL will be presented. Also the irradiation of high current electron beam of cERL for RI production and so on will be presented.

The Novosibirsk free electron laser facility (NovoFEL) operates in the spectral range from 5 to 240 micrometer. High power, narrow linewidth and frequency tunability enable a wide variety of experiments. NovoFEL has eleven user stations open to local and external users. In this paper, we survey selected experiments in photonics performed recently at the facility, such as ellipsometry, holography, surface plasmon polaritons study, pump-probe spectroscopy, and the investigation of the Talbot effect. Additionally, this paper will focus on another field of terahertz (THz) photonics, the transformation of (FEL) radiation into modes different from a Gaussian. Optical elements for intense THz waves differ from classical optical elements. Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) become beneficial for beam manipulation. For instance, in biological experiments a uniform irradiation of substances might be necessary; beams with radial polarization may be required in experiments on the generation of plasmons on wires; pencil-like or "nondiffractive" Bessel beams could be applied to radioscopy of extended objects, etc. A brief overview of THz beam transformations with DOEs will be given.
All experiments were carried out using equipment of the Siberian Center for Synchrotron and Terahertz Radiation. The authors are grateful to the NovoFEL team for continuous support of the experiments.

ERL as a Versatile SRF Test Facility

In order to use an ERL as a test facility for SRF equipment, it must have sufficient flexibility built in to allow tests at different acceleration voltages and frequencies. With help of a DC photo-cathode, operation at diverse frequencies is possible even if the injector buncher/booster is operating at a fixed frequency. To this end, the laser should pulse at a subharmonic n of this frequency. Possible test frequencies in the ERL are then any harmonic of this subharmonic, which allows for tests at many frequencies. With n=33, we could reach all usual frequencies up to 1.3 GHz. To reach this flexibility it is equally required to adapt the path length in the ERL by approximately ±λ/2 of the smallest envisaged test frequency, so typically some 50 cm, for example with adjustable girders. For a multi-turn ERL, the fields in the return arc magnets must be individually controllable to allow for different accelerating voltages in the SRF device under test. Once these conditions are satisfied, an ERL allows for tests of SRF equipment with large beam powers but relatively little power consumption.
