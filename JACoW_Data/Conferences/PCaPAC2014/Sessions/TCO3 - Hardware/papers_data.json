        "actions are distributed to front-end controllers (FEC) with absolute execution timestamps. The execution time must be both precise to the nanosecond and scheduled faster than a microsecond",
        "requiring a hardware solution. Although the actions are scheduled at the FEC out of order",
        "they must be executed in sorted order. The typical hardware approaches to implementing a priority queue (CAMs",
        "shift-registers",
        "etc.) work well in ASIC designs",
        "but must be implemented in expensive FPGA core logic. Conversely",
        "the typical software approaches (heaps",
        "calendar queues",
        "etc.) are either too slow or too memory intensive. We present an approach which exploits the time-ordered nature of our problem to sort in constant-time using only a few memory blocks.",

        "a test framework that executes tests automatically. TestBed is a PXI chassis which contains an embedded controller running the control system on Scientific Linux and a DAQ board capable of generating and acquiring analog and digital signals. TestBed provides an easy-to-use framework written in Python and allows for the quick development and execution of automatic test scripts. From a hardware perspective",
