        "Web2cToolkit is a collection of Web services. It enables scientists",
        "operators or service technicians to supervise and operate accelerators and beam lines through the World Wide Web. In addition",
        "it provides users with a platform for communication and the logging of data and actions. Recently a novel service",
        "especially designed for mobile devices",
        "has been added. Besides the standard mouse-based interaction it provides a touch- and voice-based user interface. Web2cToolkit is currently undergoing an extensive renovation and upgrading process. Real WYSIWYG-editors are now available to generate and configure synoptic and history displays",
        "and an interface based on 3D-motion and gesture recognition has been implemented. Also the multi-language support and the security of the communication between Web client and server have been improved substantially. The paper reports the complete status of this work and outlines upcoming development.",

        "The cryogenic systems at DESY are controlled by the process control system EPICS. New cryogenic plants and new test facilities for the European XFEL are currently beginning their routine operations. Other components of the XFEL are under construction or currently in the commissioning phase. Diagnostic analysis of events in the system is getting more difficult due to the complex environment. Current post mortem analysis is typically carried out by retrieving archived data and plotting the results in a trend plot. The disadvantage of this approach is that you only see those channels which are configured as potential candidates for a good analysis. Channels which might actually explain the root cause of the event stay out of sight. We have developed mechanisms to play back the archived data directly into the data stream of the operator console. This way the data get displayed into the synoptic displays in the same manner the operator is used to. This way the analysis of events is eased. Within a given time period it is possible to run forward or backward with a time-slider. First results will be shown."
