        "its uniquely flexible schema design",
        "robust programming interface",
        "and support for multiple concurrent versions has permitted it to evolve into a more broadly useful operational and control system tool. The CED played a critical role before and during the 2013 startup and commissioning of CEBAF following its 18-month long shutdown and upgrade. Information in the CED about hardware components and their relations to one-another facilitated a thorough Hot Checkout process involving more than 18",
        "000 system checks. New software relies on the CED to generate EDM screens for operators on-demand thereby ensuring that the information on those screens is correct and up-to-date. The CED also continues to fulfill its original mission of supporting model-driven accelerator setup. Using the new ced2elegant and eDT (elegant Download Tool)",
