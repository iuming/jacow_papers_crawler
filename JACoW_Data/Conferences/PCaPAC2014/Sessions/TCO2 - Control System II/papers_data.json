        "The SPring-8 storage ring was inaugurated 17 years ago in 1997. The storage ring is an 8-GeV synchrotron that functions as a third-generation light source",
        "providing brilliant X-ray beams to a large number of experimental users from all over the world. In recent years",
        "discussions have been held on the necessity of upgrading the current ring to create a diffraction-limited storage ring at the same location. Now",
        "a plan to upgrade the storage ring",
        "called SPring-8-II",
        "has been launched. First",
        "new beam optics capable of storing beams of 6 GeV was designed using a five-bend magnet system to obtain smaller electron beam emittance that would produce coherent X-rays that are brighter than those produced by the current ring. The design of a control system that would meet the performance requirements of the new ring has also started. Equipment control devices are based on factory automation technologies such as PLC and VME",
        "whereas digital data handling with high bandwidths is realized using telecommunication technologies such as xTCA. In this paper",
        "we report on the conceptual design of the control system for SPring-8-II on the basis of the conceptual design report proposed by RIKEN.",

        "we are aiming at the simultaneous top-up operation for the four independent storage rings including two light sources. The high availability and reliability of control system is strongly required for the long-term stable beam operation under such complex operation schemes. In this presentation",
