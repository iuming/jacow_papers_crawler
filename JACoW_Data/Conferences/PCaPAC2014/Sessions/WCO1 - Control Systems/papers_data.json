        "With the FAIR complex",
        "the control systems at GSI will face new scalability challenges due to significant amount of new hardware coming with the new facility. Although",
        "the old systems have proven themselves as sustainable and reliable",
        "they are based on technologies",
        "which have become obsolete years ago. During the FAIR construction time and the associated shutdown GSI will replace multiple components of the control system. The success in the integration of CERNs FESA and LSA frameworks had moved GSI to extend the cooperation with the controls middleware and especially Remote Device Access (RDA) and Java API for Parameter Control (JAPC) frameworks. However",
        "the current version of RDA is based on CORBA technology",
        "which itself",
        "can be considered obsolete. Consequently",
        "it will be replaced by a newer version (RDA3)",
        "which will be based on ZeroMQ",
        "and will offer a new improved API based on the experience from previous usage. The collaboration between GSI and CERN shows that new RDA is capable to comply with requirements of both environments. In this paper we present general architecture of the new RDA and depict its integration in the GSI control system.",

        "a number of software tools have been developed",
        "mostly in the form of Tango devices and protocol bridges. This approach allows us to keep using legacy machine physics programs when integrating the new Tango based controllers and to carry out the upgrade gradually with less impact on the machine operation schedule."
