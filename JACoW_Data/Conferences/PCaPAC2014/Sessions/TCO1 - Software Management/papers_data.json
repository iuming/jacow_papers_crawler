        "The settings management system LSA (LHC Software Architecture) was originally developed for the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). For FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) a renovation of the GSI control system was necessary. When it was decided in 2008 to use the LSA system for settings management for FAIR",
        "the middle management of the two institutes agreed on a collaborative development. This paper highlights the insights gained during the collaboration",
        "from three different perspectives: organizational aspects of the collaboration",
        "like roles that have been established",
        "planned procedures",
        "the preparation of a formal contract and social aspects to keep people working as a team across institutes. It also shows technical benefits and drawbacks that arise from the collaboration for both institutes as well as challenges that are encountered during development. Furthermore",
        "it provides an insight into aspects of the collaboration which were easy to establish and which still take time.",

        "to log and track the faults occurring during the operations and follow up actions on the faults logged etc. Overall",
        "the need was for a system to easily manage the number of jobs related to planning the day to day operations of a national facility. The paper describes such a web based system developed and in use regular use and found extremely useful.",
