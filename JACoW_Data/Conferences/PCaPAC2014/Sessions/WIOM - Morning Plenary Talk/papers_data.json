        "For the subject I would like to speak about the current transformation of the computing landscape. The advent of Virtualization have made possible highly scaleable and affordable distributed computing systems such as those offered by Cloud providers",
        "public or private. This poses new challenges and problems to do with latency in accessing the data",
        "SLAs",
        "privacy and security issues. At the same time the explosion of data has generated the emergence of new computing paradigms such as MapReduce and Hadoop and the need for new computing storage hierarchies for HPC and distributed computing. Embedded and real-time systems are also affected from these new trends."
