The majority of the I/O devices are standard devices used in process control. The de facto standard for distributed I/O in process controls in Germany is Profibus. So it is obvious to use this bus also for cryogenic controls. Subsequently we developed also special electronics to attach temperature and level readouts to this field bus. Special diagnostic tools are available and permanently attached to the bus. Condition monitoring tools provide diagnostics which enable preventative maintenance planning. Specific tools were developed in Control System Studio (CSS) which is -the- standard tool for configuration",

The new system has the advantage to make automatic and synchronized measurements as a function of gap and/or phase of an ID. The automatic gap and phase control is a real-time communication based on EPICS system and the eight servomotors of the measurement system are controlled using a Delta Tau GeoBrick PMAC-2.

New cryogenic plants and new test facilities for the European XFEL are currently beginning their routine operations. Other components of the XFEL are under construction or currently in the commissioning phase. Diagnostic analysis of events in the system is getting more difficult due to the complex environment. Current post mortem analysis is typically carried out by retrieving archived data and plotting the results in a trend plot. The disadvantage of this approach is that you only see those channels which are configured as potential candidates for a good analysis. Channels which might actually explain the root cause of the event stay out of sight. We have developed mechanisms to play back the archived data directly into the data stream of the operator console. This way the data get displayed into the synoptic displays in the same manner the operator is used to. This way the analysis of events is eased. Within a given time period it is possible to run forward or backward with a time-slider. First results will be shown."

        "We report the data acquisition system (DAQ) for user experiments at SACLA (the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Free Electron Laser). The system provides standardized experimental framework to various XFEL users since March 2012. It is required to store shot-by-shot information synchronized with the XFEL beam of 60Hz at the maximum repetition rate. The data throughput goes up to 6 Gbps with TOF waveforms and/or images (e.g. X-ray diffraction images) from experiments. The data are stored to the hierarchical storage system capable of more than 6 PByte at the last stage. The DAQ system incorporates with prompt data processing performed by a 14 TFlops PC cluster as well as on-line monitoring. In 2014",
        "SACLA will introduce the third beamline to increase the capacity of experiments. On the DAQ side",
        "it is a challenge to operate multiple experiments simultaneously. The control and data stream will be duplicated and separated for beamlines. A new central server to manage each beamline condition in one place will help increase the efficiency of setup procedure and reduce risks of mishandling between beamlines.",

The design of a control system that would meet the performance requirements of the new ring has also started. Equipment control devices are based on factory automation technologies such as PLC and VME",

        "The cryogenic systems at DESY are controlled by the process control system EPICS. New cryogenic plants and new test facilities for the European XFEL are currently beginning their routine operations. Other components of the XFEL are under construction or currently in the commissioning phase. Diagnostic analysis of events in the system is getting more difficult due to the complex environment. Current post mortem analysis is typically carried out by retrieving archived data and plotting the results in a trend plot. The disadvantage of this approach is that you only see those channels which are configured as potential candidates for a good analysis. Channels which might actually explain the root cause of the event stay out of sight. We have developed mechanisms to play back the archived data directly into the data stream of the operator console. This way the data get displayed into the synoptic displays in the same manner the operator is used to. This way the analysis of events is eased. Within a given time period it is possible to run forward or backward with a time-slider. First results will be shown."
