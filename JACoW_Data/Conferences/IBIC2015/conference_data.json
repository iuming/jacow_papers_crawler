In this contribution we present a technique that allows achieving few 10 fs time-resolution in experiments operating at cw repetition rates of up to 100 kHz by employing high repetition rate data acquisition. The method employs a fs-level arrival time monitor based on electro-optic sampling* ** of residual pulses from a coherent diffraction radiator and a fast THz detector allowing for pulse to pulse detection of arrival time and pump intensity. The monitor can operate at high repetition rates cw (presently up to a few 100 kHz) and low electron bunch charges (sub pC). The prototype device has been tested at the quasi CW SRF accelerator (ELBE) by performing an ultra-fast THz driven magnetization dynamics experiment***. Our method has high potential to provide few fs level timing on next generation large scale X-ray photon sources based on high repetition rate electron accelerators such as LCLSII. A demonstrator aiming at operation up to 4.7 MHz is under development for the European X-FEL. reference for this paper to",

The pulsing system consists of a low energy single gap gridded buncher and two high energy choppers. Buncher and choppers need to be set in phase and amplitude for maximum efficiency. The LINAC encompasses twelve lead tin-plated Split Loop Resonators (SLR). Each SLR",

The first one utilises a U-bend at the end of the LINAC. One special wide Beam Profile Monitor (BPM) is installed after the 90 degrees magnet. The technique allows to set up correct phase by observing the displacement of beam profile versus phase shift of the last phase locked resonator. The determination of beam pulse characteristics are based on X-ray detection produced by beam striking a Ta target. In this paper the HIAF set up for pulsed beam diagnostics with sub nanosecond time resolution is described. The system has demonstrated simplicity of operation and high reliability."

This proved invaluable in correlating the dependence of the Storage Ring RF phase with humidity. The device is based on Arduino technology and consists entirely of substitutable parts allowing for easy repair and maintenance by people of any degree of technical skill. The project aim is to deploy several of these devices throughout the facility to enhance the understanding of environmental effects on beam properties and equipment."

Gas cell monitors are noninvasive but only yield intensity information and suffer from residual ionisation at high repetition rates. The technique described here uses the scattering of a beam of low-energy electrons as they are scanned across the photon beam to measure the transverse intensity profile of the photon beam. Two different geometries are compared. One is where a finely focused electron beam is scanned transversely across the photon beam to measure the transverse profile. The second is where the electrons are bent onto the axis of the photon beam and are scattered by the counter propagating beam of photons. Here the electron beam is kept larger in diameter than the photon beam so that the photon pulse intensity can be measured by the scattering."

The delay in the feedback loop is changed stepwise triggered by external pulses.

Three prototypes were tested: 1) A feedback system based on high-resolution stripline BPMs was used to stabilise the beam orbit in the beamline region c. 50m upstream of the final focus. 2) Information from this system was used in a feed-forward mode to stabilise the beam locally at the final focus. 3) A final-focus local feedback system utilising cavity BPMs was deployed. In all three cases the degree of beam stabilisation was observed in high-precision cavity BPMs at the ATF2 interaction point. Latest results are reported on stabilising the beam position to approximately 50nm."

This system calculates the beam position through the output voltage of BPMs. Output signals of BPMs pass through a 500 MHz and 50ohm front-end for noise filtering and also gain control purposes. Then the signal is digitized based on under sampling method by a 130MHz ADC for further analysis in FPGA. Safe dynamic range of 0dBm to -90 dBm can be covered by this electronic system with white noise measured to be around -110dBm.

These scanners cannot provide continuous bunch-by-bunch measurements and the expected future increase of the beam brightness will lead to an accelerated sublimation of the wire.

In November 2014 subsystem tests and conditioning of the Solaris linac were started. A 300 MeV electron beam at the end of the linac was observed for the first time in February 2015 after which the machine was shut down for 2.5 months to complete transfer line and storage ring installation. In May the commissioning of the linac together with the transfer line and storage ring began. The beam was soon observed on the YAG screen monitor",

In this contribution we present a technique that allows achieving few 10 fs time-resolution in experiments operating at cw repetition rates of up to 100 kHz by employing high repetition rate data acquisition. The method employs a fs-level arrival time monitor based on electro-optic sampling* ** of residual pulses from a coherent diffraction radiator and a fast THz detector allowing for pulse to pulse detection of arrival time and pump intensity. The monitor can operate at high repetition rates cw (presently up to a few 100 kHz) and low electron bunch charges (sub pC). The prototype device has been tested at the quasi CW SRF accelerator (ELBE) by performing an ultra-fast THz driven magnetization dynamics experiment***. Our method has high potential to provide few fs level timing on next generation large scale X-ray photon sources based on high repetition rate electron accelerators such as LCLSII. A demonstrator aiming at operation up to 4.7 MHz is under development for the European X-FEL. reference for this paper to",

The pulsing system consists of a low energy single gap gridded buncher and two high energy choppers. Buncher and choppers need to be set in phase and amplitude for maximum efficiency. The LINAC encompasses twelve lead tin-plated Split Loop Resonators (SLR). Each SLR",

One special wide Beam Profile Monitor (BPM) is installed after the 90 degrees magnet. The technique allows to set up correct phase by observing the displacement of beam profile versus phase shift of the last phase locked resonator. The determination of beam pulse characteristics are based on X-ray detection produced by beam striking a Ta target. In this paper the HIAF set up for pulsed beam diagnostics with sub nanosecond time resolution is described. The system has demonstrated simplicity of operation and high reliability."

The readout rate of the required spectrometer detector system limited the acquisition rate to a few Hz and thus did not allow us to study the evolution of the longitudinal bunch shape on a turn-by-turn basis.

It closely links research into lasers and accelerators to develop advanced particle sources, new accelerating schemes, and in particular beyond state-of-the-art beam diagnostics. This contribution summarizes the research achievements in optical diagnostics of this 4 year research and training initiative. It presents the achievable resolution of a laser-based velocimeter to measure the velocity of neutral particle beams, results from the measurement of bunch shape using electro-optical crystals with tens of fs resolution, experimental data using a laser wire scanner, and discusses the resolution limits in energy measurements using Compton backscattering at a synchrotron light source. Finally, it also provides a summary of events that have been organized by the LA3NET consortium. reference for this paper to",

The technique described here uses the scattering of a beam of low-energy electrons as they are scanned across the photon beam to measure the transverse intensity profile of the photon beam. Two different geometries are compared. One is where a finely focused electron beam is scanned transversely across the photon beam to measure the transverse profile. The second is where the electrons are bent onto the axis of the photon beam and are scattered by the counter propagating beam of photons. Here the electron beam is kept larger in diameter than the photon beam so that the photon pulse intensity can be measured by the scattering."

We have been developing so called intra-bunch feedback system and in operation during injection flat bottom since last year. But recent beam intensity upgrade push us to improve further the system",
        "namely feedback during acceleration. The revolution frequency changes about 2% and the synchronous phase varies 0 - 26 degree during acceleration from 3 to 30 GeV in the MR. The delay in the feedback loop is changed stepwise triggered by external pulses. We are examining quick trigger timing determination by matching the bunch shape in the controller (\"iGp12\") to the one from the exciter (kicker) and estimating differences of slice markers in time. This method is time saving",
        "which is important because of a limited machine tuning time. We will report present status of the feedback during acceleration."

        "Ultra-low latency beam-based digital feedbacks have been developed by the Feedback On Nanosecond Timescales (FONT) Group and tested at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2) at KEK in a programme aimed at beam stabilisation at the nanometre level at the ATF2 final focus. Three prototypes were tested: 1) A feedback system based on high-resolution stripline BPMs was used to stabilise the beam orbit in the beamline region c. 50m upstream of the final focus. 2) Information from this system was used in a feed-forward mode to stabilise the beam locally at the final focus. 3) A final-focus local feedback system utilising cavity BPMs was deployed. In all three cases the degree of beam stabilisation was observed in high-precision cavity BPMs at the ATF2 interaction point. Latest results are reported on stabilising the beam position to approximately 50nm."

These scanners cannot provide continuous bunch-by-bunch measurements and the expected future increase of the beam brightness will lead to an accelerated sublimation of the wire. A novel Ionization Profile Monitor is being constructed to cope with these challenges. The readout of this device will be based on a hybrid silicon pixel detector with a Timepix3 chip. Pixel detectors are sensitive to single electrons therefore eliminating the need for traditional Multi-Channel Plates",
        "which suffer from ageing phenomena. The early digitization of the signal will reduce the susceptibility of the readout system to electromagnetic interference",

        "high sensitivity is very desirable so that measurements can be made with a small amount of beam or small duty cycle beam. This high sensitivity requirement makes photo multiplier tubes (PMT) the preferred detector. Low dark current PMTs have maximum quantum efficiency in the visible wavelength range. We describe a converter where Cherenkov radiation (CR) is used to generate visible photons from electrons and positrons that are present due to wire-beam interaction. Also described is an optical system that collects and couples the CR into an optical fiber that delivers the visible photons to the PMT outside of the accelerator area",

        "Solaris is a third generation light source recently constructed at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. The installation of the 600 MeV S-band linear accelerator with thermionic RF gun and transfer line as well as the 1.5 GeV storage ring is now complete. In November 2014 subsystem tests and conditioning of the Solaris linac were started. A 300 MeV electron beam at the end of the linac was observed for the first time in February 2015 after which the machine was shut down for 2.5 months to complete transfer line and storage ring installation. In May the commissioning of the linac together with the transfer line and storage ring began. The beam was soon observed on the YAG screen monitor",
        "installed at the injection straight in the storage ring. The beam current measured with the fast current transformer in the transfer line was 8 mA over 180 ns",
        "at 360 MeV. The commissioning of the machine is still in progress and preliminary results of Solaris are presented.",

        "the transverse beam profile of 3 GeV beam having the power of 1 MW is measured by a multi-wire profile monitor (MWPM) placed at the proton beam window (PBW) being the separator between vacuum and helium area at the target station. The profile monitor is crucial because the beam peak current density should be kept as low as possible to mitigate the damage at the mercury target vessel due to the pitting erosion caused by the high power proton beam. Simple beam expantion at the target is useless because it simply increases the heat load and the radiation dose at the entrance of the target. To mitigate damage",
        "a beam flattening system using non-linear optics with octupole magnets has been developed. It was confirmed the beam shape was controlled as designed using calculations. In order to obtain a 2D profile",
        "we have begun using the profile monitor by observing the infrared from the target by imaging a capillary tube. At JSNS the life time of the PBW is important. To improve the lifetime of the PBW",
        "we measure the gas production rate by using a beam dump."
