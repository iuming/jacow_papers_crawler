        "The ANU Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) comprises a 15 MV electrostatic accelerator (NEC 14UD) followed by a superconducting LINAC booster. The pulsing system consists of a low energy single gap gridded buncher and two high energy choppers. Buncher and choppers need to be set in phase and amplitude for maximum efficiency. The LINAC encompasses twelve lead tin-plated Split Loop Resonators (SLR). Each SLR",
        "as well as the superbuncher and time energy lens",
        "needs to be individually tuned in phase and amplitude for correct operation. The HIAF pulsing system is based on a few techniques. The first one utilises a U-bend at the end of the LINAC. One special wide Beam Profile Monitor (BPM) is installed after the 90 degrees magnet. The technique allows to set up correct phase by observing the displacement of beam profile versus phase shift of the last phase locked resonator. The determination of beam pulse characteristics are based on X-ray detection produced by beam striking a Ta target. In this paper the HIAF set up for pulsed beam diagnostics with sub nanosecond time resolution is described. The system has demonstrated simplicity of operation and high reliability."

This proved invaluable in correlating the dependence of the Storage Ring RF phase with humidity. The device is based on Arduino technology and consists entirely of substitutable parts allowing for easy repair and maintenance by people of any degree of technical skill. The project aim is to deploy several of these devices throughout the facility to enhance the understanding of environmental effects on beam properties and equipment."

The boards are installed in an industrial Windows 7 PC. Trigger generation runs stand-alone in an FPGA making it independent of operating system timing and ensuring stable phase relation between individual channels. FPGA control is possible via C and LabVIEW APIs. The ELBE control system is built with Siemens PLCs and WinCC HMI. A LabVIEW application will offer a GUI for local and remote control via OPC.

The setup is adjustable to match the initial photons' energy and can be used for diagnosing electrons' passage through undulators.

It presents the achievable resolution of a laser-based velocimeter to measure the velocity of neutral particle beams, results from the measurement of bunch shape using electro-optical crystals with tens of fs resolution, experimental data using a laser wire scanner, and discusses the resolution limits in energy measurements using Compton backscattering at a synchrotron light source.
