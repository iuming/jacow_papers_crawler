        "Solaris is a third generation light source recently constructed at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. The installation of the 600 MeV S-band linear accelerator with thermionic RF gun and transfer line as well as the 1.5 GeV storage ring is now complete. In November 2014 subsystem tests and conditioning of the Solaris linac were started. A 300 MeV electron beam at the end of the linac was observed for the first time in February 2015 after which the machine was shut down for 2.5 months to complete transfer line and storage ring installation. In May the commissioning of the linac together with the transfer line and storage ring began. The beam was soon observed on the YAG screen monitor",
        "installed at the injection straight in the storage ring. The beam current measured with the fast current transformer in the transfer line was 8 mA over 180 ns",
        "at 360 MeV. The commissioning of the machine is still in progress and preliminary results of Solaris are presented.",

        "At the Japanese Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS) using a mercury target",
        "the transverse beam profile of 3 GeV beam having the power of 1 MW is measured by a multi-wire profile monitor (MWPM) placed at the proton beam window (PBW) being the separator between vacuum and helium area at the target station. The profile monitor is crucial because the beam peak current density should be kept as low as possible to mitigate the damage at the mercury target vessel due to the pitting erosion caused by the high power proton beam. Simple beam expantion at the target is useless because it simply increases the heat load and the radiation dose at the entrance of the target. To mitigate damage",
        "a beam flattening system using non-linear optics with octupole magnets has been developed. It was confirmed the beam shape was controlled as designed using calculations. In order to obtain a 2D profile",
        "we have begun using the profile monitor by observing the infrared from the target by imaging a capillary tube. At JSNS the life time of the PBW is important. To improve the lifetime of the PBW",
        "we measure the gas production rate by using a beam dump."
