        "Understanding and controlling beam halo is important for high-intensity hadron accelerators",
        "for high-brightness electron linacs",
        "and for low-emittance light sources. This can only be achieved by developing suitable diagnostics. The main challenge faced by such instrumentation is the high dynamic range needed to observe the halo in the presence of an intense core. In addition",
        "measurements must often be made non-invasively. This talk summarizes the one-day workshop on Beam Halo Monitoring that was held at SLAC on September 19 last year",
        "immediately following IBIC 2014 in Monterey. Workshop presentations described invasive techniques using wires",
        "screens",
        "or crystal collimators",
        "and non-invasive measurements with gas or scattered electrons. Talks on optical methods showed the close links between observing halo and astronomical problems like observing the solar corona or directly observing a planet orbiting another star."
