        "The TPS is a newly constructed 3-GeV third-generation synchrotron light source featuring ultra-high photon brightness with extremely low emittance. After some hardware improvement especially demagnetization of chamber are completed",
        "the commissioning of the beam in the booster ring began on December 12 and attained 3-GeV energy on December 16. The storage ring obtained its first stored beam and delivered synchrotron light on December 31. This report summarizes the role of beam diagnostic for hardware improvement and parameter tuning during TPS successful commissioning."

        "The Spallation Neutron Source",
        "a neutron scattering user facility based on a 1.4MW proton accelerator",
        "has been in operation since 2006. The accelerator beam diagnostics were designed",
        "in large degree",
        "with commissioning unknowns in mind. Today we face new challenges to support stable 1MW beam power operations and accelerator upgrade for even higher power. The beam instrumentation problems span a range from mitigating obsolescence of many electronics to developing new techniques for measuring beam parameters important for high power operation. This report describes several examples of the ongoing work: development of new electronics for Beam Position Monitor (BPM) and Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) systems to replace the aging designs; development of large dynamic range and high precision beam phase space characterization tools to facilitate the model based accelerator tuning."
