        "A 30 GeV proton beam accelerated in the J-PARC Main Ring (MR) is slowly extracted by the third integer resonant extraction and delivered to the hadron experimental hall. Slow extraction from the MR has unique characteristics that can be used to obtain a low beam loss rate. Devices with electrostatic septum (ESSs) and magnetic septa are placed in the long straight section with zero dispersion. The separatrix for the resonance is independent of the momentum at the septa when the horizontal chromaticity is set to zero. The resulting beam has a large step size and small angular spread",

        "a dynamic bump scheme has been applied to reduce the beam loss further. We have attained 50 kW operation at 5.2s cycle in the latest physics run. A suppression of instability during debunch process is also essential as well as low beam loss tunings. In this paper",
        "a current status and future plans toward a higher beam power for the slow extraction are reported. Preliminary results for a 8 GeV slow extraction test for the muon to electron conversion search experiment (COMET) will be also briefly presented.",

The installation of seven additional superconducting cavities in the existing free space of the linear accelerator will increase the beam energy to 1.3 GeV. More than 95% of the installed ring and transport systems are presently capable of 1.3 GeV operation. Combination of the new beam energy and increasing the average beam current by ~50% will double the accelerator power capability to 2.8 MW. The Mercury spallation neutron target will be upgraded to a capacity of 2.0 MW beam power.",
