        "Acceleration of a 1mA Continuous Wave (CW) deuteron (A/Q=2) beam at SARAF has been accomplished for the first time. A 5.3 mA pulsed deuteron beam has been accelerated as well. These achievements cap a series of major modifications to the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) 4-rods structure which included the incorporation of a new end flange",
        "introduction of an additional RF power coupler and",
        "most recently",
        "installation of a new set of rod electrodes. The new rod modulation has been designed to enable deuteron beam acceleration at a lower inter-electrode voltage",
        "to a slightly reduced final energy of 1.27 MeV/u and with stringent constraints on the extant of beam tails in the longitudinal phase space. This report will focus primarily on the installation and testing of the new rods. The successful conditioning campaign to 200 kW",
        "~10% above than the working point for deuteron operation",
        "will be described. Beam commissioning with proton and deuteron beams will also be detailed. Results of beam measurements will be presented",
        "including the characterization of the output beam in the transverse and longitudinal phase space. Finally",
        "future possible improvements are discussed.",
