        "and operation of high-power linacs are discussed. The inconsistencies between the basic beam physics principles used in the design and the operation practices are considered. The missing components of the beam physics tools for the design and operations are examined",
        "especially for negative hydrogen ions linacs. The diagnostics and online models necessary for tuning and characterization of existing states of the linac are discussed.",
