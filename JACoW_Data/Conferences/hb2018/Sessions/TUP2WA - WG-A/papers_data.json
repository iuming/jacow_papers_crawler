        "a testbed for advanced beam-physics concepts and technologies that is currently being commissioned at Fermilab. Our recent efforts are centered on the development of an integrated design that is prepared for final engineering and fabrication. The paper also presents a comparison of theoretical calculations and numerical simulations of the pickup-undulator radiation and its interaction with electrons in the kicker-undulator.",
