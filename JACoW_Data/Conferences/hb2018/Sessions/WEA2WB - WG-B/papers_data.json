        "Machine errors and interaction of ion beam with the stripper are known sources of possible beam losses in ion linacs. Our studies show that contaminant ion beams extracted from Electron Cyclotron Resonance ion source and accelerated together with main beam thanks to similar charge-to-mass ratio can produce substantial losses after the stripping due to modified charge-to-mass ratio. The contaminant beams must be well separated and collimated at low energies to avoid losses in the high energy section of the linac. An additional mechanism for beam losses is charge-exchange reactions in the residual gas near the charge selection slits. A set of collimators have been developed to intercept both contaminant ions and main beam halo in the example of Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB)."
