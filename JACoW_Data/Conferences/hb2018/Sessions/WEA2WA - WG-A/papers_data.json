        "the injector complex will be significantly upgraded during the second Long Shutdown (LS2). All non-LHC beams are expected to benefit from these upgrades. In this paper",

        "as well as the prediction of the impact of envisaged hardware modifications. A first discussion on the effect of space charge on the observed instability is also being presented.",
