        "The Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) presently under construction",
        "extends and supersedes GSI's existing infrastructure. Its core challenges include the precise control of highest proton and uranium ion beam intensities",
        "the required extreme high vacuum conditions",
        "machine protection and activation issues while providing a high degree of multi-user mode of operation with facility reconfiguration on time-scales of a few times per week. Being based on best-practices at other laboratories",
        "this contribution outlines the applicable hardware and beam commissioning strategies",
        "as well as concepts",
        "beam-based and other accelerator systems that are being tested at the existing facility in view of the prospective FAIR operation.",

RCS is now providing 500 kW beams to the materials and life science experimental facility (MLF) and its beam power will be increased step by step toward the design value of 1 MW. MR has been operated with the beam power of 500 kW at maximum for the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment (T2K). An upgrade plan of MR for the beam power of 1.3 MW for the T2K experiment is promoted with a faster cycling scheme.",
