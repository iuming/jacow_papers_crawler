        "In the design of high-intensity linear accelerators one of the generally adopted criteria is not to exceed a zero-current phase advance per focusing period of 90 degrees in order to avoid the space charge driven envelope instability",
        "or a coinciding fourth order space charge resonance. Recently it was claimed that in certain structures",
        "predominantly applicable to super-conducting linac lattices - such a constraint is not always necessary in the longitudinal plane (I. Hofmann and O. Boine-Frankenheim",
        "Phys. Rev. Lett. 118",
        "2017). This applies primarily to such focusing structures",
        "where the transverse focusing period only induces a weak space charge dependent modulation in the longitudinal plane",
        "and a different periodicity is applicable to the longitudinal plane. Hence the longitudinal 90 degree stopband is practically absent",
        "and phase advances significantly above 90 degrees should be possible in such structures",
        "with a corresponding additional design freedom. As a consequence",
        "we suggest that the 90 degree rule should no longer be taken as standard criterion in the longitudinal plane of linac design.",

        "the IFMIF accelerators have been designed to have much higher beam power and beam current than the existing accelerators",
        "so space charge effect is very strong. This raises big concerns about beam loss and beam transport stability",
        "thus detailed high-intensity beam dynamics study of the IFMIF-like accelerators is indispensable. This research aims to perform source to target simulation of the IFMIF-like accelerator. The simulation has been carried out by two different kinds of simulation codes because the IFMIF accelerator has distinctive features.

        "The superconducting linac is composed of short independent cavities",
        "and the cavity occupies only a small portion (1/4 to 1/6) of the machine compared with the normal conducting one. When phase advance per period is greater than 60 degrees",
        "the smooth approximation is no longer valid and the longitudinal motion has to be described by time dependent system. With the help of Poincare map",
        "the single particle nonlinear time dependent longitudinal motion is investigated. The study shows that when phase advance per period is less than 60 degrees",
        "the system can be well described by smooth approximation",
        "that means there is a clear boundary (separatrix) between stable and unstable area; when phase advance is greater than 60 degrees",
        "the system shows a quite different dynamic structures and the phase acceptance is decreased significantly compared with the smooth approximation theory predicated",
        "especially when phase advance per period is greater than 90 degrees. The results show that even for low current ma-chine",
        "the zero current phase advance should be kept less than 90 degrees to make sure there is no particle loss because of the shrink of the longitudinal acceptance.",
