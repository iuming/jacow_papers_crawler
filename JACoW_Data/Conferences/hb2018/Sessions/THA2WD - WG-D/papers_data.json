        "improvements in the LHC and an increased beam brightness from the injectors",
        "leading to a peak luminosity that exceeds the LHC design luminosity by more than a factor two. This contribution will give an overview of run 2",
        "the main challenges encountered and it will address the measures applied to deal with and make use of the increased beam brightness. Finally potential areas where further performance improvement can be a realized will be identified.",

        "large nonlinear magnetic field errors and large beam sizes produce low beam lifetimes. A variety of beam dynamics effects such as IBS",

        "one has to commission high-brightness high-current electron accelerator and achieve beam parameters suitable for cooling. This will be followed by commissioning of bunched electron beam cooling",
