In J-PARC, the pitting erosion on the mercury target vessel for the spallation neutron source is one of a pivotal issue to operate with the high power of the beam operation. Since the erosion is proportional to the 4th power of the beam current density, the minimization of the peak current density is required. To achieve low current density, the beam-flattening system by nonlinear beam optics using octupole magnets in J-PARC. By the present system, the peak density was successfully reduced by 30% compared to the ordinary linear optics.
