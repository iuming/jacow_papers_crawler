        "For high intensity CW beam",
        "beam loading effect is a major issue for the stability operation of the linac. The steady state and transient perturbations of the accelerating voltage by the beam current causes significant differences between the design lattice to the actual operated parameters for the SC cavities. The errors accumulated along the linac",
        "lead to undesirable beam behaviour",
        "and cause beam losses finally. In this paper the beam loading effects of the SC cavities for Injector-I have been analyzed for 10 mA proton beam and presented.",
