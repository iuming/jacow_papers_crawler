      "abstract": "The transverse mode coupling instability occurs in individual bunches when two transverse oscillation modes couple at high intensity. Simulations predict an instability threshold in the LHC at a single bunch intensity of 3*1011 protons. The TMCI threshold can be inferred by measuring the tune shift as a function of intensity. This measurement was performed in the LHC for different machine impedances and bunch intensities. The impedance was changed by varying the primary and secondary collimators gaps to increase their contribution to the resistive wall impedance. The experiment also allowed to assess the validity of the LHC impedance model in the single bunch case.
