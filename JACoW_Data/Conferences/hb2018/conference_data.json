            "beam halo formation and particle loss. A series of dedicated machine experiments has been performed over the past decade in order to study these effects in the particular regime of long-term beam storage (105-106 turns) as required for certain applications. This paper gives an overview of the present understanding of the underlying beam dynamics mechanisms. In particular it focuses on the space charge induced periodic resonance crossing",
            "which has been identified as the main mechanism causing beam degradation in this regime. The challenges in further progressing with the understanding",
            "the modelling and the mitigation of these space charge effects and the resulting beam degradation are discussed. Furthermore",
            "an outlook for possible future directions of studies is presented.",

            "The SNS uses charge exchange injection to minimize losses during the accumulation of the accelerated beam in the ring. A stripper foil implements this by removing the electrons from the high intensity H− beam coming from the linac. At a beam power of 1.2 MW",
            "the foil lasts for many weeks",
            "sometimes months. However",
            "given the upgrade to 2.8 MW",
            "it is important to know the current temperature of stripper foil in order to estimate its lifetime for the new beam power and beam size. In this paper",

Our studies show that contaminant ion beams extracted from Electron Cyclotron Resonance ion source and accelerated together with main beam thanks to similar charge-to-mass ratio can produce substantial losses after the stripping due to modified charge-to-mass ratio. The contaminant beams must be well separated and collimated at low energies to avoid losses in the high energy section of the linac. An additional mechanism for beam losses is charge-exchange reactions in the residual gas near the charge selection slits.

The transverse feedback adapts automatically to a factor 3 change in the beam revolution period and to any change of the machine tune. It includes an excitation source that combines up to 9 selectable harmonics of the revolution frequency with a selectable amplitude for each. The excitation may be dipolar or quadrupolar. Future possible upgrades will be presented including a setup to tackle half-integer tune values and a digital processing using a fixed clock frequency instead of the revolution frequency clock.",

A partial contribution to this effect is suspected to be an important mismatch between the dispersion function in the transfer line from the PS Booster (PSB) and the ring itself. This mismatch will be unacceptable in view of the beam parameters requested by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project with high longitudinal emittance and momentum spread. To deliver the requested beam parameters the PSB-to-PS transfer line will be upgraded and the optics in the line changed to improve the matching from all the four PSB rings. A re-matching campaign from the PSB ring 3 has been carried out to evaluate the impact of the present optics mismatch as a source of emittance growth both in simulations and measurements.",

            "At injection into the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) a significant horizontal emittance blow-up of the present high brightness beams for the LHC is observed. A partial contribution to this effect is suspected to be an important mismatch between the dispersion function in the transfer line from the PS Booster (PSB) and the ring itself. This mismatch will be unacceptable in view of the beam parameters requested by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project with high longitudinal emittance and momentum spread. To deliver the requested beam parameters the PSB-to-PS transfer line will be upgraded and the optics in the line changed to improve the matching from all the four PSB rings. A re-matching campaign from the PSB ring 3 has been carried out to evaluate the impact of the present optics mismatch as a source of emittance growth both in simulations and measurements.",

A partial contribution to this effect is suspected to be an important mismatch between the dispersion function in the transfer line from the PS Booster (PSB) and the ring itself. This mismatch will be unacceptable in view of the beam parameters requested by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project with high longitudinal emittance and momentum spread. To deliver the requested beam parameters the PSB-to-PS transfer line will be upgraded and the optics in the line changed to improve the matching from all the four PSB rings.

          "abstract": "Fast transverse instability was observed in Recycler proton storage ring (RR). The instability develops within 100 turns and may lead to beam loss. The fast rise suggested that the instability is driven by electron cloud. That was later supported by microwave transmission measurements. In difference to RR the instability was not observed in similar conditions in Main Injector (MI). RR is based on combined function dipoles while MI uses pure dipoles. This difference plays a key role in instability development. The instability dynamics was studied experimentally and with numerical simulations. An analytical model predicts that electrons are trapped in RR dipoles. Numerical simulations show that up to 1% of particles can be trapped. The cloud build-up is exponential with its density limited by space charge. That results in the cloud intensity orders of magnitude greater than in MI. A growth rate of about 30 turns and mode frequency of 0.4 MHz are consistent for observations and PEI simulations. The high intensity batch can be stabilized by low intensity clearing bunch injected behind batch which destroys the trapped electron cloud and prevents its multi-turn accumulation.

A series of dedicated machine experiments has been performed over the past decade in order to study these effects in the particular regime of long-term beam storage (105-106 turns) as required for certain applications. This paper gives an overview of the present understanding of the underlying beam dynamics mechanisms. In particular it focuses on the space charge induced periodic resonance crossing",

      "abstract": "The transverse mode coupling instability occurs in individual bunches when two transverse oscillation modes couple at high intensity. Simulations predict an instability threshold in the LHC at a single bunch intensity of 3*1011 protons. The TMCI threshold can be inferred by measuring the tune shift as a function of intensity. This measurement was performed in the LHC for different machine impedances and bunch intensities. The impedance was changed by varying the primary and secondary collimators gaps to increase their contribution to the resistive wall impedance. The experiment also allowed to assess the validity of the LHC impedance model in the single bunch case.

        "The LANSCE Accelerator facility currently utilizes four 800 MeV H− beams and one 100 MeV proton beam. Multi-beam operation requires careful control of accelerator tune to minimize beam losses. The most powerful 80 kW H− beam is accumulated in the Proton Storage Ring and is extracted to the Lujan Neutron Scattering Center facility for production of moderated neutrons with meV-keV energy. Another H− beam is delivered to the Weapon Neutron Research facility to create un-moderated neutrons in the keV - MeV energy range. The third H− beam is shared between the Proton Radiography Facility and the Ultra-Cold Neutron facility. The 23 kW proton beam is used for isotope production in the fields of medicine",

Our studies show that contaminant ion beams extracted from Electron Cyclotron Resonance ion source and accelerated together with main beam thanks to similar charge-to-mass ratio can produce substantial losses after the stripping due to modified charge-to-mass ratio. The contaminant beams must be well separated and collimated at low energies to avoid losses in the high energy section of the linac. An additional mechanism for beam losses is charge-exchange reactions in the residual gas near the charge selection slits. A set of collimators have been developed to intercept both contaminant ions and main beam halo in the example of Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB)."

The transverse feedback adapts automatically to a factor 3 change in the beam revolution period and to any change of the machine tune. It includes an excitation source that combines up to 9 selectable harmonics of the revolution frequency with a selectable amplitude for each. The excitation may be dipolar or quadrupolar. Future possible upgrades will be presented including a setup to tackle half-integer tune values and a digital processing using a fixed clock frequency instead of the revolution frequency clock.",

A partial contribution to this effect is suspected to be an important mismatch between the dispersion function in the transfer line from the PS Booster (PSB) and the ring itself. This mismatch will be unacceptable in view of the beam parameters requested by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project with high longitudinal emittance and momentum spread. To deliver the requested beam parameters the PSB-to-PS transfer line will be upgraded and the optics in the line changed to improve the matching from all the four PSB rings. A re-matching campaign from the PSB ring 3 has been carried out to evaluate the impact of the present optics mismatch as a source of emittance growth both in simulations and measurements.",

A partial contribution to this effect is suspected to be an important mismatch between the dispersion function in the transfer line from the PS Booster (PSB) and the ring itself. This mismatch will be unacceptable in view of the beam parameters requested by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project with high longitudinal emittance and momentum spread. To deliver the requested beam parameters the PSB-to-PS transfer line will be upgraded and the optics in the line changed to improve the matching from all the four PSB rings. A re-matching campaign from the PSB ring 3 has been carried out to evaluate the impact of the present optics mismatch as a source of emittance growth both in simulations and measurements.",

A partial contribution to this effect is suspected to be an important mismatch between the dispersion function in the transfer line from the PS Booster (PSB) and the ring itself. This mismatch will be unacceptable in view of the beam parameters requested by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project with high longitudinal emittance and momentum spread. To deliver the requested beam parameters the PSB-to-PS transfer line will be upgraded and the optics in the line changed to improve the matching from all the four PSB rings. A re-matching campaign from the PSB ring 3 has been carried out to evaluate the impact of the present optics mismatch as a source of emittance growth both in simulations and measurements.",

This mismatch will be unacceptable in view of the beam parameters requested by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project with high longitudinal emittance and momentum spread. To deliver the requested beam parameters the PSB-to-PS transfer line will be upgraded and the optics in the line changed to improve the matching from all the four PSB rings.

        "or a coinciding fourth order space charge resonance. Recently it was claimed that in certain structures",

        "Phys. Rev. Lett. 118",
        "2017). This applies primarily to such focusing structures",
        "where the transverse focusing period only induces a weak space charge dependent modulation in the longitudinal plane",
        "and a different periodicity is applicable to the longitudinal plane. Hence the longitudinal 90 degree stopband is practically absent",
        "and phase advances significantly above 90 degrees should be possible in such structures",
        "with a corresponding additional design freedom. As a consequence",
        "we suggest that the 90 degree rule should no longer be taken as standard criterion in the longitudinal plane of linac design.",

      "abstract": "Fast transverse instability was observed in Recycler proton storage ring (RR). The instability develops within 100 turns and may lead to beam loss. The fast rise suggested that the instability is driven by electron cloud. That was later supported by microwave transmission measurements. In difference to RR the instability was not observed in similar conditions in Main Injector (MI). RR is based on combined function dipoles while MI uses pure dipoles. This difference plays a key role in instability development. The instability dynamics was studied experimentally and with numerical simulations. An analytical model predicts that electrons are trapped in RR dipoles. Numerical simulations show that up to 1% of particles can be trapped. The cloud build-up is exponential with its density limited by space charge. That results in the cloud intensity orders of magnitude greater than in MI. A growth rate of about 30 turns and mode frequency of 0.4 MHz are consistent for observations and PEI simulations. The high intensity batch can be stabilized by low intensity clearing bunch injected behind batch which destroys the trapped electron cloud and prevents its multi-turn accumulation.
