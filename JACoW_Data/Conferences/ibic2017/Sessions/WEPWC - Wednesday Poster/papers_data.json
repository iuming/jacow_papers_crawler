        "Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs) based on optical fibres have been under development for many years as an alternative solution to commonly used methods",
        "such as ionisation chambers. Optical BLMs (oBLMs) maintain standard BLM functionality but can also be used for machine and personal protection. They can be implemented over the entire beam line providing excellent position and time resolution",
        "while being insensitive to radiation induced damage. This contribution describes how oBLMs can also assist in the characterisation of RF cavities during commissioning and operation. It first presents the design principle of highly compact monitors and the underpinning theory for particle loss detection",
        "before discussing data obtained in experimental tests at the electron accelerator CLARA. It then shows how a 4-channel oBLM can be applied for efficient cavity monitoring. Finally",
        "the results are put into a broader context underlying the application potential in accelerators and light sources."

        "The strategy for machine protection and quench prevention of the super-conducting elements of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is heavily reliant on its beam loss monitoring system. This is one of the most complex and large-scale beam instrumentation systems deployed anywhere in the world. In order to augment the system's dependability and verify the correct connection of each of the approximately 4000 detectors distributed around the 27 km LHC ring to its assigned channel in the electronic system",
        "a mobile irradiation instrument has been designed and built. This instrument can be easily and safely transported along the LHC tunnel and imitate a localised beam loss at each BLM detector. This paper describes the concept of the instrument",

        "the safety measures included and recent upgrades. Possible future improvements of the device are also considered."

Thus we developed new scintillation type BLM to detect the beam loss at spot area on the vacuum chamber inside the magnet. The new BLM has separating structure a photomultiplier (PMT) from a plastic scintillator and connecting with optical fibres. Because small plastic scintillator is installed on the vacuum chamber directly",

This facility is designed to use both In-flight Fragment (IF) and Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) techniques in order to provide a wide variety of RI beams for nuclear physics experiment. One of the biggest challenges in operating such a high beam power facility (~400 kW) is to monitor beam loss accurately and to execute the machine protection system reasonably quickly whenever necessary.
