It then presents specific research outcomes from investigations into applying detector technologies originally developed for high energy physics experiments (such as VELO",

        "impedance of which is measured. The narrow-band sine-wave signals provide better signal-to-noise ratio. Use of fast correctors to the beam excitation eliminates the systematic error caused by hysteresis. The systematic error caused by orbit drift is also suppressed because the measured signal is not affected by the orbit motion outside the excitation frequency range. The measurement technique is described and the result of experimental testing carried out at NSLS-II is presented."

Two electron lenses have been used to reduce the incoherent beam-beam tune spread to allow a larger proton bunch intensity and therefore a higher luminosity. Beam transfer function was used to determine the beam-beam incoherent tune spread. In this article",
        "we carry out numeric simulations to compare the tune spreads derived from tune histogram and the beam transfer function. Then we present the experimental beam transfer function measurements and extract the tune spreads due to beam-beam interaction and electron lens. Experimental results show that the electron lens reduced the beam-beam tune spread."

Preliminary measurements show that the improved model results in significant (>10%) modifications to beam moments",
