        "Low-energetic ion and antimatter beams are very at-tractive for a number of fundamental studies. The diagnostics of such beams",
        "however",
        "is a challenge due to low currents down to only a few thousands of parti-cles per second and significant fraction of energy loss in matter at keV beam energies. On the example of the ELENA storage ring which is being commissioned at CERN this year",
        "this paper summarizes the essential beam diagnostics required to fully characterize low energy",
        "low intensity ion beams. THis includes beam-profile monitors based on scintillating screens and secondary electron emission",
        "sensitive Faraday cups for absolute intensity measurements",
        "and capacitive pickups for beam position monitoring as basic diagnostics. More advanced diagnostics options in-clude gas based beam profile monitors and ultra-sensitive beam current transformers using SQUID technology.",

It has the highest thermal conductivity of an material at room temperature - thus it can handle the heat load from high power beams. Recent advances in synthetic fabrication have made large area (5x5 sq mm or larger) beam imaging devices possible. Such devices can have a spatial resolution better than 50 nm",
