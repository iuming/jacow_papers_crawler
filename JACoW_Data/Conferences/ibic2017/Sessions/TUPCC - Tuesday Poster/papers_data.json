        "The longitudinal current profile and slice emittance are important bunch parameters for the operation of an X-ray free-electron laser. At the European XFEL",
        "dedicated diagnostic sections equipped with transverse deflecting RF structures (TDS) have been installed for the control and optimisation of these parameters. Travelling-wave TDS in combination with fast kicker magnets and off-axis screens allow for the study of individual bunches without affecting the other bunches in the super-conducting linear accelerator which can generate bunch trains of up to 2700 bunches at 4.5 MHz within 600 microsecond RF pulses at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The measurement of the slice emittance is realised in a static F0D0 lattice equipped with four individual screen stations. Variations of the longitudinal bunch profile or slice emittance along the bunch train may lead to degraded FEL performance for parts of the train which reduces the effective available number of bunches for FEL operation. By gradually adjusting the timing",
        "individual bunches along the bunch train can be measured in order to optimise the overall beam parameters for all bunches in the train."

        "the same 3 GHz optical links are used to transmit reference signals at 2.856GHz (half c-band frequency) to the c-band LINACs",
        "combined with a frequency doubler-amplifier at the link end. A novel zero AM/PM-conversion frequency-doubler and an amplitude-/phase-controlled power amplifier have been implemented in a compact 1HU 19inch unit. Key design concepts and measurement results will be presented. It will be shown that this inexpensive doubler-amplifier system adds only insignificant jitter and drift to the transmitted reference signals. As the same actively stabilized 3GHz links can be used for s- and c- band RF stations",
        "development of a more expensive 6GHz fiber-optic link could be avoided. A higher quantity of the same link type can thus be manufactured and the number of spares is reduced as only one link type is utilized for the SwissFEL injector and LINAC RF reference signals."

One of the key issues of its operation is the measurement of bunch arrival time which is important for the synchronization of a bunch and seeded laser. The measurement utilized a newly designed beam arrival time monitor (BAM) which contains two cavities at a different frequency. Thus a new way",
