This work presents a generic simulation tool which combines the features of existing codes in order to provide a common standard for IPM simulations. The modular structure of the application allows for exchanging the computational modules depending on the use case and makes it extensible to new use cases. By this means simulations of Beam Induced Fluorescence monitors based on supersonic gas jets have been realized. The application and all involved methods have been tested and benchmarked against existing results. The code is well documented and includes a graphical user interface. It is publicly available as a git repository and as a Python package."
