        "and low repetition rate. The project AVA (Accelerators Validating Antimatter physics) is an Innovative Training Network within the H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. It enables an interdisciplinary and cross-sector program on antimatter research across 3 scientific work packages. These cover facility design and optimization",
        "advanced beam diagnostics and novel low energy antimatter experiments. This contribution presents the AVA R&D into beam profile",
        "position and intensity measurements",
        "as well as detector tests which will provide an order of magnitude improvement in the resolution and sensitivity in closely related areas. It also summarizes the interdisciplinary training program that AVA will provide to its 15 Fellows",
        "as well as to the wider antimatter and accelerator communities."
