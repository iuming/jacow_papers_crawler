        "Beam instrumentations have always been using results from neighbor communities. Over the last 10 years",
        "a number of beam instruments and systems have successfully adopted optical solutions",
        "pushing performances from ps to fs",
        "exploiting optical set-ups or photonic components. In a positive loop",
        "new ideas and original solutions have been bouncing back and forth from electronics to optical and from copper coax to optical fibers. Next step is moving to photonic integrated circuits",
        "i.e. from single function photonic components to complete on-chip optical systems which are now becoming available",
        "or will shortly be. This tutorial covers recent advances in integrated optics",
        "that may have great impact on future beam accelerator diagnostic instruments and systems. Topics include: High sensitivity and high resolution integrated balanced cross-correlators for sub-femtosecond timing distribution",
        "integrated femtosecond lasers",
        "frequency combs and optical signal synthesis",
        "optically assisted analog-to-digital conversion for high-speed and high-resolution down-conversion and sampling."

        "In this talk an overview of the beam instrumentation of the advanced wake field experiment (AWAKE) hosted at CERN will be given. The AWAKE project is a proof-of-principle experiment",
        "which aims at accelerating a witness electron bunch in a plasma wake excited by a proton bunch coming from the LHC pre-accelerator",
        "the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). Various numerical simulations showed that the charge density within a relatively long (ns-scale) SPS proton bunch experiences a self-modulation instability (SMI) propagating in a plasma and tends to be radially (not longitudinally",
        "no micro-bunches in a common sense) modulated with the plasma oscillation period (on the order of 3-10 ps in AWAKE case). The experimental observation and quantitative analysis of a proton bunch radial density modulation would be an experimental proof of the effective plasma wake excitation. This talk is focused mainly on the various diagnostics that include: Rb vapor density diagnostics",
        "optical transition radiation (OTR) and microwave coherent transition radiation (CTR) setups to measure the SMI frequency",
        "proton beam halo diagnostic to verify the defocused part of a bunch.",

Improvements will enhance fs-time accuracy",

Several linear arrays with up to 1024 pixel and smaller pixel pitch were submitted for production. The development of a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) sensor will further improve the time resolution. Detector data is transmitted in the DAQ framework to external GPU-based clusters and processed in real-time at 7 Gbytes/s with a few μs latency. For beam dynamics studies we also develop KAPTURE capable to analyze terahertz detector pulses at GHz-repetition rates. These developments open new windows in beam diagnostics of modern accelerators."
