        "A flexible digital signal processing platform based on FPGA technology has been developed for vertical intra-bunch beam stability studies at the CERN SPS. This system is unique in that samples at a very high rate (4GSa/s) in order to measure and control motion within the 1.7ns proton beam bunch. The core of the system is an FPGA-based digital signal processor. Being programmable",
        "it enables fast development of control algorithms. The processor",
        "together with its supporting components forms a complete platform for demonstration studies of beam instability measurement and control. This system is capable of operation as either a stand-alone arbitrary waveform generator for driven mode instability studies",
        "a closed-loop feedback control system for stability control and as a diagnostic instrument for measurement of beam motion. Recent measurements have shown the system is effective at damping single-bunch and bunch train intra-bunch instabilities with growth times of 200 turns. This paper summarizes the system design",
        "provides some operational highlights",
        "describes the upgrades performed to date and concludes with a description of the next generation processor now in development."

        "SLAC is replacing the first km of its 3-km linac with a CW superconducting linac at 1.3 GHz for the LCLS-II x-ray FEL. A laser will drive a normal-conducting 186-MHz CW photocathode gun with arbitrary pulse separation at up to 1 MHz. In addition to the standard SASE x-ray beam",
        "users will continue to have access to special operating modes such as seeded beams or double pulses with selectable separation and wavelength separation. The accelerator will begin operation with an average power of 240 kW",
        "later rising to 1 MW. The existing 120-Hz LCLS-I copper linac will operate simultaneously in the third km. A pulsed beam \"spreader\" can direct each pulse from each linac into one of two new undulators",
        "for hard and soft x rays",
        "or into a dump. This talk will discuss the extensive measurements and feedbacks along the 4-km path that are in preparation to monitor and maintain beam quality and FEL performance through this wide parameter range.",
