        "Over the years SNS has been optimizing the amount of errant beam pulses in the accelerator. The errant beam pulses can damage the superconducting cavities and thus lower the uptime of the accelerator. This talk will present the effort that has been made to lower the amount of errant beam pulses with new diagnostics",
        "analysis of processes that cause errant beam",
        "and the resulting lessons learned."

It is based on the information from two harmonic frequencies of Flourier Transformation of longitudinal charge distribution. We select 500MHz and 3GHz as working frequency and the system consists of power splitters",
        "band-pass filters and a mixer. Raw data are acquired by a digital oscilloscope and analyzed by MATLAB code. The system has been calibrated by Streak Camera in single-bunch experiment environment with bunch charge from 0.23nC to 6.05nC. The paper also shows bunch length synchronous oscillation phenomenon during injection period."

        "the second generation of CCCs is based on the possibility of detailed simulation of superconducting magnetic shielding properties",

        "and on superior commercially available SQUID systems. In 2014",
