        "SuperKEKB is an electron-position collider realizes a new luminosity frontier. The target luminosity is 8x1035 cm-2 s-1. The initial beam commissioning started in February 2016 and operated until June 2016. Low Emittance Tuning (LET) is an important issue in the beam commissioning. The Beam-Based Calibration (BBC) scheme for Beam-Position-Monitor (BPM) has been applied in order to establish reliable beam measurement system. In the BBC",
        "a response model among beam position",
        "charge and output signals of the BPM electrodes are introduced to calibrate the relative gain of each electrodes. The gains are adjusted by least squares fitting so that the model reproduces the measured BPM signals. The Beam-Based Alignment (BBA) is also performed to determine the magnetic center of each quadrupole magnet. Using the BBC",
        "the performance of the BPM system and optics correction has been successfully improved. After the series of the optics tuning and the BPM calibration",
        "the vertical emittance of about 10 pm is achieved in the positron ring. This paper presents what we experienced during the beam commissioning focusing on the beam optics measurement and the BBC scheme for the BPM system."

        "The European XFEL has a transverse Intra Bunch Train Feedback (IBFB) that is able to measure and correct the beam position of each bunch individually by means of cavity beam position monitors (CBPMs) and stripline kicker magnets. The IBFB core system is located between the collimator and the beam distribution kicker system",
        "using two vertical and two horizontal kickers as well as eight nearby CBPMs for an ultra-fast feedback loop. Moreover",
        "it receives data from all undulator BPMs via longer fiber optic cables",
        "thus allowing to correct small beam trajectory perturbations that may occur between the IBFB core systems and the undulators located some 100m downstream. After first lasing has been observed in 5/2017",
        "the IBFB is presently being commissioned with beam. This paper will report on the final design of the IBFB system",
        "FPGA-based data transfer and signal processing concept",
