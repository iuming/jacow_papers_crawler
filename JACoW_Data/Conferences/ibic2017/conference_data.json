            "Stable operation of a modern high current storage rings requires attention to the sources of coupling impedance. Methods ranging from EM modeling to bench and beam measurements are routinely used to characterize accelerator components. The beam-based method presented here complements existing approaches",
            "and allows precise measurements and identification of narrowband resonances in structures such as RF cavities or in-vacuum undulators. We combine the well-established approach of characterizing eigenvalues of coupled-bunch instabilities with modern high-throughput data acquisition tools and automatic analysis methods. By sequentially exciting low-amplitude oscillation of individual modes below the instability threshold and observing open-loop damping",

Travelling-wave TDS in combination with fast kicker magnets and off-axis screens allow for the study of individual bunches without affecting the other bunches in the super-conducting linear accelerator which can generate bunch trains of up to 2700 bunches at 4.5 MHz within 600 microsecond RF pulses at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The measurement of the slice emittance is realised in a static F0D0 lattice equipped with four individual screen stations. Variations of the longitudinal bunch profile or slice emittance along the bunch train may lead to degraded FEL performance for parts of the train which reduces the effective available number of bunches for FEL operation. By gradually adjusting the timing",

The system implementation and initial orbit measurements with the H− beam used for ELENA commissioning will be presented",
            "as well as future upgrades for trajectory and longitudinal Schottky measurements."

By this means simulations of Beam Induced Fluorescence monitors based on supersonic gas jets have been realized. The application and all involved methods have been tested and benchmarked against existing results. The code is well documented and includes a graphical user interface.

The transverse profile of the beam is monitored via detecting the ionization products produced by the collision of proton with residual gas in the vacuum pipe. High voltage electrodes are used for producing guide electrical field and MCP for amplify the signal. The screen and CCD system are used for position detection. An ionization profile monitor is designed and manufactured. It has been installed on the ADS injector I. The signal intensity of ionization products matches the theory's expectation.

Monitoring and characterization of channeled beams in the high energy accelerators environment ideally requires in-vacuum and radiation hard detectors. For this purpose the Cherenkov detector for proton Flux Measurement (CpFM) was designed and developed. It features a fused silica bar in the beam pipe vacuum which intercepts charged particles and generates Cherenkov light. In this contribution the SE-CpFM (Slow Extraction CpFM) detector is described in detail. It has been installed in early 2016 in the TT20 extraction line of SPS to study the feasibility of the crystal-assisted extraction from the SPS. Before the installation the detector has been fully characterized in 2015",

            "Resonant Spin Depolarization is a high precision technique for beam energy measurement employed in the Diamond Light Source storage ring. The relation between spin tune and beam energy can be used to determine the energy of a transversely polarized beam. Vertical oscillations excite the beam at frequencies that match the fractional part of the spin tune and the beam loss rate is used to monitor the beam depolarization. However",
            "the standard procedure of these measurements is intrusive and not compatible with user operation of a light source. The Advanced Resonant Spin Depolarization (AdReSD) project aims to extend and improve the method with the goal of making the measurements compatible with the user operation",

It was determined that the missteered electron beam can damage the vacuum chamber and in-vacuum components within 20 us.

We consider our experience with the commissioning and operation of the scaled down MPS system used for the LEReC gun test beamline and discuss the work on the MPS designed for the commissioning of the full LEReC accelerator.

        "Head-on beam-beam compensation had been successfully implemented routinely in the 2015 polarized proton operation in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Two electron lenses have been used to reduce the incoherent beam-beam tune spread to allow a larger proton bunch intensity and therefore a higher luminosity. Beam transfer function was used to determine the beam-beam incoherent tune spread. In this article",
        "we carry out numeric simulations to compare the tune spreads derived from tune histogram and the beam transfer function. Then we present the experimental beam transfer function measurements and extract the tune spreads due to beam-beam interaction and electron lens. Experimental results show that the electron lens reduced the beam-beam tune spread."

        "This paper presents the development of an upgrade to the beam position interlock system for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The beam orbit at the beam dump kicker is continuously monitored by 16 beam position monitors that are part of the machine protection system. In case of unacceptable orbit movement the system has to trigger the beam abort immediately to prevent damage to the machine. An upgrade of the present system is underway with the aim of handling a larger dynamic range of bunch intensities",
        "and coping with different bunch time structures (both the standard bunch spacing of 25 ns and special doublet bunches spaced by 5 ns). The proposed architecture combines the analogue signals from opposite pickup electrodes on a single read-out channel",
        "and stretches it with a delay-line based comb-filter. The resulting signal",
        "covering a dynamic range of 60 dB",
        "is digitised at 3.2 GSPS and processed inside a Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to extract a position value. Different signal processing techniques are compared on simulated ideal beam signals",
        "and preliminary results of a prototype installation is presented."

Travelling-wave TDS in combination with fast kicker magnets and off-axis screens allow for the study of individual bunches without affecting the other bunches in the super-conducting linear accelerator which can generate bunch trains of up to 2700 bunches at 4.5 MHz within 600 microsecond RF pulses at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The measurement of the slice emittance is realised in a static F0D0 lattice equipped with four individual screen stations. Variations of the longitudinal bunch profile or slice emittance along the bunch train may lead to degraded FEL performance for parts of the train which reduces the effective available number of bunches for FEL operation. By gradually adjusting the timing",

A precise orbit correction is necessary in order to reduce the beam loss. Beam position monitor (BPM) is a vital element providing accurate measurements of the beam positions for the control of closed orbit distortion (COD). Currently an apparent dependence of COD RMS on the beam intensity is observed (about 30 μ m). In order to understand the nature of the phenomenon",

This system is unique in that samples at a very high rate (4GSa/s) in order to measure and control motion within the 1.7ns proton beam bunch. The core of the system is an FPGA-based digital signal processor. Being programmable",

        "diamond has remarkable properties for radiation beam monitoring",
        "especially in high flux environments. It's response has a phenomenal linearity to incident flux - over 11 orders of magnitude. It has the highest thermal conductivity of an material at room temperature - thus it can handle the heat load from high power beams. Recent advances in synthetic fabrication have made large area (5x5 sq mm or larger) beam imaging devices possible. Such devices can have a spatial resolution better than 50 nm",
        "and a sub ns response time. Diamond x-ray beam position monitors are now commercially available",
        "and beam position monitors for proton and hadron therapy beams are under development. A 1k pixel transparent beam imaging camera was recently demonstrated as well. This talk will plot the development pathway that led to these devices and showcase what the future holds.",

It will be the only instrument capable of non-invasive beam size measurement throughout the LHC acceleration cycle with high intensity physics beams. A prototype BGV monitor has been installed in the LHC since 2016. Particles emerging from beam-gas interactions are recorded by 2 planes of scintillating fibre detectors. Based on vertex reconstruction of the detected tracks",

A dedicated computer farm performs track reconstruction and event analysis on-line so that real-time beam profile measurements can be provided. Data taken in 2016 and 2017 will be presented that demonstrate the power of the method."

By this means simulations of Beam Induced Fluorescence monitors based on supersonic gas jets have been realized. The application and all involved methods have been tested and benchmarked against existing results. The code is well documented and includes a graphical user interface.

Monitoring and characterization of channeled beams in the high energy accelerators environment ideally requires in-vacuum and radiation hard detectors. For this purpose the Cherenkov detector for proton Flux Measurement (CpFM) was designed and developed. It features a fused silica bar in the beam pipe vacuum which intercepts charged particles and generates Cherenkov light. In this contribution the SE-CpFM (Slow Extraction CpFM) detector is described in detail. It has been installed in early 2016 in the TT20 extraction line of SPS to study the feasibility of the crystal-assisted extraction from the SPS. Before the installation the detector has been fully characterized in 2015",

The Transmutation Physics Experimental Facility (TEF-P) aimed at obtaining experimental data for the accuracy improvement of neutronics evaluation of MA-loaded ADS. The critical assembly installed in TEF-P operates below 500 W to prevent the excessive radio activation of assembly. For the separation of low power beam from J-PARC intense proton accelerator",

The laser charge exchange method (LCE) is originally developed to measure the proton beam profile and can be applied to the beam separation device for TEF-P. The LCE device consists of bright Nd:YAG-laser and laser transport system with beam position controllers. To demonstrate the charge exchange of the negative proton beam",

The high power in the beam and potentially in cavity field emission necessitate integrating losses over 500 ms but responding within 0.1 ms. A capacitor for integration and a comparator for the threshold give a simple and robust approach over a wide dynamic range. We plan both long loss monitors covering regions of typically 100 m and point monitors. In regions with two or more beamlines",

        "Resonant Spin Depolarization is a high precision technique for beam energy measurement employed in the Diamond Light Source storage ring. The relation between spin tune and beam energy can be used to determine the energy of a transversely polarized beam. Vertical oscillations excite the beam at frequencies that match the fractional part of the spin tune and the beam loss rate is used to monitor the beam depolarization. However",
        "the standard procedure of these measurements is intrusive and not compatible with user operation of a light source. The Advanced Resonant Spin Depolarization (AdReSD) project aims to extend and improve the method with the goal of making the measurements compatible with the user operation",

        "we are investigating the beam loss monitors that will be used to detect beam depolarization. The material",

It was determined that the missteered electron beam can damage the vacuum chamber and in-vacuum components within 20 us. We protect our accelerator against such a catastrophic scenario by a dedicated machine protection system (MPS). In this paper we describe the current status of the LEReC MPS work. We consider our experience with the commissioning and operation of the scaled down MPS system used for the LEReC gun test beamline and discuss the work on the MPS designed for the commissioning of the full LEReC accelerator.
