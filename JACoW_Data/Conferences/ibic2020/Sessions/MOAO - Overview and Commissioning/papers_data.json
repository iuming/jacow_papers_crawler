The experiment requires a variety of advanced beam diagnostics to characterize the self-modulated proton bunch at the picosecond time scale. These include optical transition radiation and a streak camera for short and long time scale detailed imaging of self-modulation and hosing",

EBS has been successfully commissioned in less than three month and reached the targeted parameters for user mode. The success of the EBS commissioning also depended on the performances and the reliability of the beam instrumentation used to monitor the beam. In this paper a summary of the EBS commissioning is presented with a special focus on the beam instrumentation performances."
