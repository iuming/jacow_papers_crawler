        "Bunch length and temporal profile diagnostics is of primary importance for accelerator facilities. It provides a huge variety of applications",
        "ranging from the optimization of the accelerators’ performances to the delivery of light bursts of controlled duration for experiments. During the last years",
        "efforts have been made in demonstrating the beneficial aspects of exploiting Coherent Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation for bunch length characterizations",
        "as its non-intercepting nature",
        "the directionality",
        "the tunability",
        "the high resolution and the high signal-to-noise level. This technique has been compared to others based on more standard mechanisms of polarization radiation as Coherent Transition and Diffraction Radiation. Bunch length measurements have also been benchmarked with more conventional techniques as the use of RF-deflectors and time-domain measurements of Optical Transition Radiation. In conclusion we report on diagnostic solutions already adopted or foreseen in the next future for the SOLARIS facility",
        "both for the LINAC injector and the storage ring."

        "Lasers are increasingly used at electron accelerator facilities both to produce high brightness beams and to modify the properties of the bunches to optimize FEL performance at the LCLS. We describe techniques for controlling and measuring the position",
        "intensity and spatial profile of the laser at the cathode. These measurements must be performed on a bunch by bunch basis in order to monitor stability and pulse to pulse jitter at 120 Hz in our copper linac and up to 1 MHz in the new superconducting linac for LCLS-II. Additionally",
        "IR laser beams are overlapped with the electron beam within a wiggler to modulate the energy of the electron bunch to increase the slice energy spread and offset microbunching instabilities that degrade the FEL performance. We describe the critical laser parameters for such laser heaters and the techniques for controlling the spatial and temporal overlap of laser and electron beams. Moreover diagnostics such as cross-correlation measurements are performed to verify the cathode drive laser pulse length. Finally",
        "we give an overview of laser measurements applied to novel bunch compression schemes for producing attosecond bunches at the XLEAP experiment."

        "longitudinal bunch profile characterization with femtosecond resolution is essential for a successful operation and control of the accelerator as well as a wide field of photon experiments. The high electron beam energies of hard X-ray FELs enable non-invasive longitudinal form factor monitoring down to a few micrometers utilizing coherent diffraction radiation spectroscopy. For this purpose",
        "a 4-staged grating spectrometer has been recently installed at European XFEL. Here",
        "current profiles are reconstructed with femtosecond time resolution based on phase retrieval algorithms which are in excellent agreement to results obtained with a transverse deflecting structure. The fast pyroelectric detectors allow",
        "for the first time",
        "to measure the current profile of all bunches inside the bunch train with repetition rates of up to 2.2 MHz. The low latency electronic readout of the 120 channels of the spectrometer provides high potential for fast compression feedbacks and machine learning applications."
