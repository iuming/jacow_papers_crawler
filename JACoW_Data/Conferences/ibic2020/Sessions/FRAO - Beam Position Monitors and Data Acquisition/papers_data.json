        "With the technology improvements of analog-to-digital converters in terms of sampling rate and achievable resolution",
        "direct digitization of beam signals is of growing interest in the field of beam diagnostics. The selection of a state-of-the-art analog-to-digital converter for such a task imposes a trade-off between sampling frequency and resolution. Understanding the dependency of the system performance on these features is fundamental. This paper presents an analysis and design methodology for such architectures. Analytical tools are used to guide the designer and to estimate the system performance as a function of the analog-to-digital converter performance. These estimations are then validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. As an example of this methodology an analysis for the next-generation electronics of the Large Hadron Collider beam position monitoring system is presented. The analytical model and the results obtained are discussed",
        "along with comparisons to beam measurements obtained at the Large Hadron Collider."

        "we have developed the new system (BEPM) measuring simultaneously not only the beam position but also the beam energy by measuring the time of flight of the beam. This system has the great advantage that can handle time-chopped beam by synchronizing the measurement system with the beam-chopping signal. At the beginning of the commissioning",
        "the beam was chopped to 3% duty to make the SRILAC cavity protected from the beam loss. Even though the beam intensity was 15 enA",
        "the beam position and energy were accurately measured. We measure the beam position to an accuracy of ±0.1 mm and the beam energy to that of several 10-4. Here",
        "we present details concerning the BEPM system and commissioning results."
