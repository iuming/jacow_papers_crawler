ibic2020,,MOAO01,Beam Diagnostics in the Advanced Plasma Wakefield Experiment AWAKE,A.-M. Bachmann; P. Muggli; MPI; Muenchen; Germany; In AWAKE a self-modulated proton bunch drives wakefields in a plasma. Recent experiments successfully demonstrated many aspects of the self-modulation of the drive bunch as well as acceleration of test electrons [*; **; ***]. Next experiments will focus on producing a multi-GeV accelerated electron bunch with low emittance and low energy spread. The experiment requires a variety of advanced beam diagnostics to characterize the self-modulated proton bunch at the picosecond time scale. These include optical transition radiation and a streak camera for short and long time scale detailed imaging of self-modulation and hosing; coherent transition radiation for modulation frequency measurements in the 100-300 GHz frequency range and multiple fluorescent screens for core and halo measurements. An overview of these diagnostics will be given.; *E. Adli et al.; Phys. Rev. Lett.; Vol. 122; 054802 (2019).  **M. Turner et al.; Phys. Rev. Lett.; Vol. 122; 054801 (2019). ***E.

Beam position monitor (BPM) is often used for high-precision bunch charge measurement due to its superior performance. In this paper; the pros and cons of different types of BPM for measurement of bunch charge in storage ring and free electron laser (FEL) will be discussed. The related simulations; beam experiment and signal processing methods are also mentioned. The beam experiments results show that the relative bunch charge resolution of the Button BPM can reach 0.02％ in SSRF; 0.073％ and 0.021％ of the SBPM and CBPM in SXFEL; respectively. Besides; based on the method of beam experiments; we systematically studied the position dependence of BPM pickup and related compensation algorithms for high-precision bunch charge measurement.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

The new lattice enables a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in horizontal beam emittance and a factor of two increase in beam current. The result is an electron beam of very high energy- and power-densities. Initial predictions suggest virtually any material struck by the undiluted electron beam will be damaged. Two experimental beam abort studies have been conducted on collimator test pieces in the present APS SR to inform the design of a fully-functional machine protection system for APS 4GSR operations at 200 mA. A comprehensive suite of diagnostics were employed during the studies The diagnostics used in these experiments are not new; but employed in different ways to obtain unique data sets. With these data sets now in hand; we are developing new numerical tools to guide collimator design.,,Your browser cannot play the video. Consider download from Link Address.

Despite ionization chambers are reference detectors in dose monitoring; no real-time beam monitor based on ionization chambers exists for such ultra high dose rates. In this study; we present the response of an ionization chamber to ultra high dose rates. Simulations were performed to compute the current measured by a chamber using a 1D transport model. The transport equations included recombination*; electron capture [**; ***] and electric field change due to space charge****. Simulations were compared to measurements performed using a 800 µm gap; 1 cm2 active surface ionization chamber irradiated by 5 MeV electron pulses up to 4 Gy/µs; and varying high voltage from 400 V/mm up to 1200 V/mm. Despite high recombination rates; the signal produced by the electrons moving in the chamber was proportional to the dose rate up to ~100 ns. Preliminary results suggest that a real-time dose measurement can be done by considering only the signal induced by the electrons. This opens the development for a real-time dose rate monitor based on ionization chambers.; *J. W. Boag et al 1996 Phys. Med. Biol. 41 885  **F. Di Martino et al 2005 Med. Phys. Vol.32; No 7  ***K.

Recently it was found that fast near-band-edge luminescence in ZnO ceramics can be significantly enhanced by introducing In3+ and Ga3+ impurities**. Due to this property; doped ZnO is of great interest for fast counting applications; in particular for beam diagnostics application at future FAIR facility***. In this contribution; we present the results of swift heavy ion induced luminescence measurements of ZnO(In) ceramics performed at GSI. Samples were irradiated with 4.8 MeV/u 48Ca and 197Au ions up to fluences of 5·10+12 and 2·10+11 ion/cm2 respectively. Iono-luminescence spectra were monitored on-line as a function of fluence. ZnO(In) and ZnO(Ga) ceramics demonstrate several orders of magnitude higher radiation hardness than plastic scintillators. This investigation is part of a larger research program for beam intensity; spill structure and beam profile measurements with ZnO fast scintillators.; * Klingshirn et al.; Phys. Stat. Solidi B; Vol.247; No.6; (2010); 1424-1447  ** Rodnyi et al.; IEEE T.Nucl. Sci.

For the establishing such kind of beamlines on High Energy Photon Source (HEPS); a new time-correlated single photon counting system has been implemented on the storage ring of Beijing Electron-Positron Collider II (BEPCII); which is used to monitor the purity. The system could track the purity deterioration process. The possible reason of impurity growth is analysed; the measurement results confirmed that Touschek scattering and pre-accelerators of the storage ring are the main mechanisms of impurity growth. A bunch cleaning technique based on a sinusoidal signal mixed a pseudo-square wave has been verified which could improve the purity to the level of 10-7. This paper mainly describes the experiment details and measurement results of purity measurement and improvement.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/tupp01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/tupp01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/tupp01_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-TUPP01,
ibic2020,,TUPP04,Simulated Beam Loss Events in the FRIB Linac,R. Shane; S. Cogan; S.M. Lidia; FRIB; East Lansing; Michigan; USA; Beam loss is an ever-present issue in accelerators and can lead to degraded beam quality; activation; and machine damage. It is crucial to be able to pinpoint the source of beam loss so that the cause can be addressed. Towards this end; beam loss studies were performed at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) in which beam spills were simulated at various locations within the accelerator. Beam spills were achieved by adjusting the magnetic fields or turning off selected RF cavities. This defocused or moved the beam such that particles impacted the walls; apertures; and other surfaces in the beam transport volume; creating measurable radiation. Losses were monitored on a suite of detectors including neutron detectors; pressurized ion chambers; and halo monitor rings. These data were used in conjunction with calculated beam profiles and statistical analyses in order to correlate loss detection patterns with beam spill location.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/tupp04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/tupp04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/tupp04_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-TUPP04,

In addition; they must work in a variety of several-bunch mode operations. However; as bunch current in the storage ring increased; influence of bunch filling patterns on XBPM performance increased year by year. We have performed a systematic evaluation of the influence of the filling patterns. We found that the cause of the influence is suppression of the XBPM current signal due to the space charge effect; and that it can be quantified by observing the behavior of the current signal while changing the voltage of a photoelectron collection electrode*. We have designed and manufactured new blade-type detector heads in inclined configuration for the purpose of mitigation the space charge effect**. It has been demonstrated that the influence of filling patterns is reduced to a few um. We also report that; as a result of a series of efforts against existing XBPMs for all ID beamlines; the influence has been reduced to about 5 um RMS.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/tupp06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/tupp06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/tupp06_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-TUPP06,37
ibic2020,,TUPP08,BPM Low ß Calibration Test Stand,MSU; East Lansing; Michigan; USA; FRIB; East Lansing; Michigan; USA; Capacitive pickups such as beam position monitors (BPMs); are sensitive to the electric field distribution produced by the beam. For relativistic fields; the fields are flattened therefore they well represent the longitudinal bunch shape. However; for non-relativistic beam; ß<0.1; the field at the pickups can extend past the bunch which affects the measurements from the BPM. This effect from non-relativistic fields is currently accounted for with theory and simulations; however a test stand is also desired that can replicate the field distribution and the bunch velocity. To accomplish this a test stand using a helical transmission line was designed and constructed which propagates with phase velocity of ~0.03c. Presented are measurements of the phase velocity; dispersion; and impedance of the helical transmission line and compared to simulations and theory. Also demonstrated is the ability for the helical transmission line to propagate pulses with minimal deformation and the fields from the helix well represent a particle bunch.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/tupp08_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/tupp08.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/tupp08_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-TUPP08,

The system uses standard rackmount servers and commodity ethernet switches for the front-end; which is a very low cost compared to standard platforms such as VME and uTCA. We use our own client-server protocol for GigE communication between the server and our custom in-house FPGA based digitizers. This allows for a lot of flexibility such that a single server can serve multiple different front-end systems (BPMs; current monitors; BLMs; etc). At PIP2IT; we have configured a system utilizing a single rackmount server and a 10-gigabit switch communicating with two VME crates housing digitizers for the BPM system. Each digitizer card is connected directly to the switch. The VME crates are just used for power and cooling.

A common strategy consists in probing the near-field of the bunch using femtosecond laser pulses. These two last decades; such electro-optic detection schemes have evolved to compact and reliable techniques. However; serious limitations have been limiting the time-resolution; when long recording lengths are needed. This has been recognized as a fundamental bottleneck and even coined the term ""Fourier limit"". We present here a novel electro-optic sampling strategy that is theoretically capable to overcome this limit and achieve femtosecond resolution for any recording length. This new approach is based on the mathematical concept of information diversity. We present first results of DEOS (Diversity Electro-Optic Sampling) obtained both in table-top experiments; as well as at the European XFEL. This technique opens the way to electric field shape characterization with femtosecond resolution in new situations; including longitudinal bunch profile monitoring; studies of microbunching instabilities; and THz pulses generated at free-electron lasers.",,https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03782,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/tupp15_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/tupp15.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/tupp15_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-TUPP15,

In the cases of the TESLA-type superconducting rf cavities currently used in the European X-ray Free-electron Laser (FEL) and the under construction Linac Coherent Light Source upgrade (LCLS-II); off-axis beam transport may result in emittance dilution due to transverse long-range and short-range wakefields (SRW)*. To investigate such effects; experiments were performed at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility with its unique two-cavity configuration after the photocathode rf gun. We used optical transition radiation (OTR) imaging with a UV-visible synchroscan streak camera to display sub-micropulse y-t effects in the 41-MeV beam. The head-tail transverse kicks within the 11-ps-long micropulses were observed at the 100-micron level for steering off-axis in one cavity and several 100 microns for two cavities. Since the SRW kick angles go inversely with energy; these results may inform the commissioning plans of the LCLS-II injector where beam will be injected at ~1 MeV into a cryomodule.; * W.K.H.

The discrete changes of integrated counts in the CMOS image region of interest are ascribed to single electron steps at ~3500 cts per electron. Circulations of a single electron at 375 MeV and at 425 MeV were demonstrated in the 12-bit digital FLIR USB3 camera images. The Hamamatsu C5680 streak camera operating at the 12th harmonic of the fundamental revolution frequency at 9.77 MHz was used to measure the zero-current bunch length from 0.5 nC circulating charge down to 10s of electrons or <10 aC. The latter cases were performed with 6-ps temporal resolution for the first time anywhere; to our knowledge. We report a preliminary effective bunch length of 276 ± 36 ps for 57 electrons (9.1 aC) stored based on a fit to a single Gaussian peak.

For measurements of RF bunched beams; however; they typically use narrowband filters to measure one harmonic of the beam current to reduce noise and simplify the signal processing. If several harmonics are measured simultaneously; the longitudinal bunch shape; in principle; may also be measured. This can be accomplished by recording the waveforms from the BPMs with an oversampling measurement scheme before the narrowband analysis is applied. In order to reconstruct the bunch shape; the measured spectra should be corrected for non-relativistic effects; cable attenuation and filtering; and the geometry and impedance of the BPM pick up. These corrections are discussed as well as the procedure for calibrating the BPM system for measuring multiple harmonics. Measurements are presented that were taken in the medium energy beam transport line and the first linac section at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams and are compared to simulations and measurements with a fast Faraday cup.

In order to investigate the ChR properties; an experiment has been carried out at the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI (University of Mainz; Germany). The beam size was 370 um in horizontal and 6.5 um in vertical direction. A 200 um thick fused silica was used as radiator. The beam images were recorded with a standard CMOS camera and an objective lens. While the detector was at a fixed observation angle (much larger than 46.77 degrees - the Cherenkov angle for a fused silica); the radiator could be rotated with respect to the beam direction such that the ChR angular distribution was measured as a function of the radiator orientation.

One of the facilities used for such tests is the Proton Irradiation Facility (IRRAD) at CERN. In order to properly control the 24 GeV/c proton beam; Beam Profile Monitor (BPM) devices are used. The current BPMs are fabricated as standard flexible PCBs featuring a matrix of metallic sensing pads. When exposed to the beam; secondary electrons are emitted from each pad; thus generating a charge proportional to the particle flux. The charge is measured individually for each pad using a dedicated readout system; and so the beam shape; position and intensity are obtained. The beam profile determination with this technique requires thus the usage of non-invasive and radiation tolerant sensing elements.

The high electron beam energies of hard X-ray FELs enable non-invasive longitudinal form factor monitoring down to a few micrometers utilizing coherent diffraction radiation spectroscopy. For this purpose; a 4-staged grating spectrometer has been recently installed at European XFEL. Here; current profiles are reconstructed with femtosecond time resolution based on phase retrieval algorithms which are in excellent agreement to results obtained with a transverse deflecting structure. The fast pyroelectric detectors allow; for the first time; to measure the current profile of all bunches inside the bunch train with repetition rates of up to 2.2 MHz. The low latency electronic readout of the 120 channels of the spectrometer provides high potential for fast compression feedbacks and machine learning applications.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/weao04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/weao04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/weao04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-WEAO04,

The projected; micropulse time profile was fit to a single Gaussian peak with σ = 11.5 ± 0.5 ps for 500 pC/micropulse and with a 200-micropulse synchronous sum; in agreement with the upstream bunch-length measurement at a non-energy-dispersive location.

Therefore only the repetition rate of the two lasers can be synchronized leading to jitter and drift on the picosecond scale. GaAs-based field-effect transistors (FETs) allow for simultaneous detection of the amplitude and timing of picosecond-scale THz and NIR pulses*. They cover the whole THz band and beyond up to the MIR (0.1 - 22 THz) with the exception of the GaAs Reststrahlen band*. Large-area FETs feature a high damage threshold (>65 kW) and large linearity range*. Antenna-coupled FETs show a noise equivalent power (NEP) of 250 pW/√Hz at 600 GHz**. FET based THz detectors can be used both for THz beam on a single pulse level; as well as for the beam diagnosis. For further optimization of the detector for the needs of beam diagnosis with low incident intensity; a more precise modeling of the FET is developed. Therefore; the incoupling of THz to the rectifying element is investigated.

The measurement of bunch arrival time is one of the key issues to optimize system performance. This is because the FEL facility relies on the synchronization of electron bunch and seeded lasers. Currently; there are mainly two methods to measure the bunch arrival time: the electro-optical sampling method and the RF cavity-based method. Considering the latter one has a simpler system and lower cost; the method has been adopted by SXFEL. The previous results show that the measurement uncertainty of bunch arrival time has achieved to be 45 fs; which can be further optimized. For SHINE; the bunch arrival time resolution is required to be better than 25 fs@100pC; and 200 fs@10 pC. The RF cavity-based method will also be applied.

Compared with longitudinal Gaussian distribution; Driver laser pulse with longitudinal flattop structure can produce electron bunch with lower emittance. This paper presents electron beam structure and emittance under different driver laser structure; specifically; laser pulse temporal shaping method for producing Gaussian beam and flattop beam are presented. The advantage and disadvantage of the two method are also discussed. Flattop beam produced from BBO stacking is more benefit for producing electron beam with lower emittance; but significantly increase the microbunch effect.

The experiments show that the RF phase modulation method can effectively explore the robustness and stability of beam transverse profile measurement systems over the range of 20.0-22.5 kHz; which is close to the first-harmonic of the synchrotron frequency. It is concluded that when the modulation amplitude of the external phase perturbation is less than 0.04 rad; this optical system can be capable of maintaining reliable and stable working status.

Processing of these BBQ signals is often perturbed by 50Hz noise harmonics present in the beam. This causes the tune measurement algorithm; currently based on peak detection; to provide incorrect tune estimates during the acceleration cycle with values that clearly oscillate between neighbouring harmonics. The LHC tune feedback cannot be used to its full extent in these conditions as it relies on stable and reliable tune estimates. In this work we present two alternative tune measurement algorithms; designed to mitigate this problem by ignoring small frequency bands around the 50Hz harmonics and estimating the tune from spectra with gaps. One is based on Gaussian Processes and the other is based on a weighted moving average. We compare the tune estimates of the new and present algorithms and put forward a proposal that can be implemented during the renovation of the BBQ system for the next physics run of the LHC.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/wepp27_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/wepp27.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/wepp27_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-WEPP27,162

To measure energy gain of electrons in the THz structure we propose applying a voltage (up to 400 kV) to the structure respecting the cathode and anode. Electrons become preliminary accelerated at the entrance that makes design of the structure simpler; because velocity of particles is near to be constant and almost equals the speed of light.

Diamond quad detectors were previously used for electron beam halo measurements at KEK*. Diamond is the radiation hard material which can be used to measure the flux of passing particles based on a particle-induced conductivity effect. However; the quad detectors have metallic contacts for charge collection. Their performance degrades over time due to the deterioration of the contacts under electron impact. We recently demonstrated a diamond electrodeless x-ray flux monitor based on a microwave measurement of the change in the resonator coupling and eigen frequency**. We propose similar measurements with a diamond put in a resonator that intercepts the halo. Without electrodes; such a device is more radiation resistant. By measuring the change in RF properties of the resonator; one can infer the beam halo parameters. In a similar manner to traditional beam halo monitors; the diamond plate can be scanned across the beam to map its transverse distribution.; * S.Liu et al.; Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A832 (2016) 231-242.  ** S.Antipov et al.; Proceeding of,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/wepp38_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/wepp38.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/wepp38_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-WEPP38,197

This source size stability is presently on the few-percent level; which is still 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than already demonstrated stability of source position/angle (slow/fast orbit feedbacks) and current (top-off injection). Until now; source size stabilization has been achieved through corrections based on a combination of static predetermined physics models and lengthy calibration measurements (feed-forward tables); periodically repeated to counteract drift in the accelerator and instrumentation. We now demonstrate for the first time [PRL 123 194801 (2019)]; how application of machine learning allows for a physics- and model-independent stabilization of source size relying only on previously existing instrumentation in ALS. Such feed-forward correction based on neural networks that can be continuously online-retrained achieves source size stability as low as 0.2 microns rms (0.4%) which results in overall source stability approaching the sub-percent noise floor of the most sensitive experiments.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

Double-slit interferometry gives the highest sensitivity among the three methods.

A bunch-by-bunch 3D positions and charge measurement system had been built at SSRF for this purpose and the performance is not good enough for beam impedance analyze due to cross talk between bunches.

In addition; the far-field COTR interferometric images obtained on the same shot provide beam-size limits plus divergence and pointing information at the sub-mrad level when compared to an analytical model** with a recent revision. The integrated image intensities can be used to estimate the microbunching fraction and relatable to the LPA process.

Through an innovative plasma-chemistry etching production process*; thin metal micro-strips only 1-2μm thick are aligned. Because of the very thin nature of the strips; the MMD is nearly transparent; and can be used in-situ for measuring; tuning and imaging the beam online. Metal structure of sensors guaranties high radiation tolerance (about 100MGy) providing their stable response to the beam particles (by the secondary electron emission) independent upon the accumulated fluence. The spatial resolution of the MMD is determined by the strips pitch constituting from 5 to 100µm in currently manufactured samples*. The data were obtained with MMDs read out by the low noise X-DAS system** providing integration time from 1 to 500ms; and the ability to process signals in real time. The scope of MMD & X-DAS is scientific and applied research using beams: in control systems of accelerators and synchrotron radiation sources. New possibilities are discussed for equipment requiring high spatial resolution and radiation hardness.; * V.M. Pugatch et al.

The RMS-R3 is built out of the eight Metal-Foil Detectors (MFD) placed at 2 m from IP-8 around the beam pipe in a backward hemisphere. The system is designed for monitoring beams interaction rate (relative luminosity) and background at the LHCb nominal instantaneous luminosity of p-p collisions 5 times increased in RUN3. The feasibility of monitoring of relative contribution from the beams luminous region (IP-8) and collimators is illustrated by the data accumulated with a similar RMS during RUN1 and RUN2 campaigns. An advantageous feature of the MFD; its high radiation tolerance of a GGy level; originates from the principle of its operation due to secondary electron emission from a surface of a metal sensor resulting in a positive charge in it which is readout by charge integrator. Simple structure of the detector modules; low operating voltage (about 20 volts); commercially available DAQ boards further improve their figure of merit. The RMS-R3 perfect linear response in a dynamical range of 1:100000 is demonstrated in tests with r/a source and X-rays.,Funding: National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/thpp02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/thpp02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/thpp02_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-THPP02,

Even though the properties of such cathodes have been studied in the past decades; the emission process is still not fully modeled. One of the parameters that has not been directly quantified in experiment is the lengthening of electron bunches in Cs2Te with respect to the incident UV laser pulse length - often referred to as cathode response time - due to photon penetration depth variations and scattering processes. Especially for applications such as novel accelerator technologies; ultrafast electron diffraction and free electron lasers with ever higher demands on short bunch durations; the minimum attainable bunch length from the electron gun is a decisive quantity.

Beam position measurement system is based on digital technology; it is difficult to design and home-made. Emittance measurement of storage is relied on the accuracy measurement of beam profile; of which the resolution is sub-micron level; x ray KB mirror imaging system can meet such high resolution requirement and a good choice. bunch by bunch feedback systems are used to restrin the beam instabilities.

ibic2020,,THPP32,Feasibility Study of a Non-Rad Camera for the SNS* Ring Injection Dump Imaging System,W. Blokland; A. Rakhman; ORNL; Oak Ridge; Tennessee; USA; The Proton Power Upgrade (PPU) increases the the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator power from 1.4 MW to 2.8 MW and calls for a modification of the Ring Injection Dump beam line. The charge exchange injection technique to accumulate proton beam in the SNS ring results in multiple beam spots on the ring injection dump window. To properly setup the new injection beam line; the size and locations of the beam spots must be measured. We plan to use a camera to look at a fluorescent coating made of Chromium Oxide doped Aluminum Oxide. To simplify the optical path; we want to place the camera in the tunnel. While radhard cameras are available; they typically are more expensive and have worse performance. To study the feasibility of non-radhard cameras; we measured the radiation in the tunnel in unshielded and shielded locations. We compare the radiation measurements with results from a CERN HiRadMat study and tested the cameras during full power beam to show that the non-radhard camera is an option for the Ring Injection Dump Imaging System.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/thpp32_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/thpp32.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/thpp32_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-THPP32,

The scattered waves and the transmitted radiation form an interference pattern; which is modulated by the spatial coherence of the radiation and by the scattering properties of the nanoparticles. The superposition of many such interference patterns results in a speckle pattern; from which the spatial coherence of the radiation and thus the transverse beam profile can be determined. In this contribution we present approaches for simulating the HNFS patterns from hard X-ray radiation and compare then with data from experiments at the ALBA synchrotron.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/thpp33_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/thpp33.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/thpp33_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-THPP33,272

And the transverse beam profile parameters are closely related to the beam tuning and optimization of the cyclotron. Machine Vision is a branch of computer science that has really grown over the last 20 years. In order to improve the precision and efficiency of beam profile measurement; machine vision techniques have been developed for the analysis and processing of the beam profile images. A new calibration method has been designed for the calibration of the imaging system. Moreover; a new image noise reduction algorithm has been developed to improve the image quality; and then to improve the accuracy of the beam profile parameters measurement. And image restoration algorithm has also been adopted to eliminate the effects of defocusing blur. The experiment results show that the calibration of the imaging system enables the system can provide quantitative information for beam diagnosis. The image noise reduction and restoration algorithm greatly improve the accuracy of beam profile parameters measurement.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/thpp34_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/thpp34.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/thpp34_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-THPP34,276

Screens; observed by zoom lenses and optical cameras; can be used to monitor the transverse beam profile at various points. An issue with the implementation of this system is that after adjusting the zoom one needs to recalibrate the the optical system; measuring the resolution of the optical system and deducing the transformation from pixel space observed on the camera to geometrical space in the laboratory. To calibrate and measure the resolution limit of the cameras a USAF 1951 resolution chart that can be moved into or out of the screen position is used. We will report on and demonstrate the use of open source computer vision libraries to compute this calibration; and the affine transformation between the camera image plane and the screens can be deduced. We will also comment on how consumer available Canon EF mount lenses may be used as a remote controllable optical system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/talks/thpp35_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/papers/thpp35.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2020/posters/thpp35_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2020-THPP35,281

The selection of a state-of-the-art analog-to-digital converter for such a task imposes a trade-off between sampling frequency and resolution. Understanding the dependency of the system performance on these features is fundamental. This paper presents an analysis and design methodology for such architectures. Analytical tools are used to guide the designer and to estimate the system performance as a function of the analog-to-digital converter performance. These estimations are then validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. As an example of this methodology an analysis for the next-generation electronics of the Large Hadron Collider beam position monitoring system is presented. The analytical model and the results obtained are discussed; along with comparisons to beam measurements obtained at the Large Hadron Collider.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

These RILAC upgrade aims at promoting super-heavy element searches and the radioactive isotope (RI) production for medical use. When we accelerate the beam by the SRILAC; we must definitely reduce the beam loss under 1 W/m. To constantly monitor the beam nondestructively; we have developed the new system (BEPM) measuring simultaneously not only the beam position but also the beam energy by measuring the time of flight of the beam. This system has the great advantage that can handle time-chopped beam by synchronizing the measurement system with the beam-chopping signal. At the beginning of the commissioning; the beam was chopped to 3% duty to make the SRILAC cavity protected from the beam loss. Even though the beam intensity was 15 enA; the beam position and energy were accurately measured. We measure the beam position to an accuracy of ±0.1 mm and the beam energy to that of several 10-4.
