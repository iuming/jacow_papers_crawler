The initial focus of the effort is processing C100 cavities by injecting RF power into the HOM coupler ports. We will then start investigating processing of C50 cavities by introducing RF into the fundamental power coupler. The plan is to start processing cryomodules in the CEBAF tunnel in the mid-term future",

        "For PIP-II project Fermilab is developing 650 MHz couplers to deliver up to 50 kW CW RF power to the superconducting low-beta (LB650) and high-beta (HB650) cavities. To meet project requirements two different designs of the couplers were proposed",
        "one is conventional design with copper plated stainless steel walls. In second design (EM-shielded) a copper screen is used to shield stainless steel wall from electromagnetic field. For prototyping we built two couplers of each type and tested them at 50kW with full reflection at different reflection phases. In each test the assembly of two couplers were processed with DC bias up to +5 kV",
        "starting with short pulses and ramping power up to 100 kW. Final run for 2 hours in CW mode at 50 kW to reach equilibrium temperature regime and qualify couplers. One pair of couplers was also processed without DC bias. Finally",
        "all four couplers demonstrated full requirements and were qualified. Based on test results the conventional coupler with some modification was chosen as a baseline design. Modified version of coupler is now ordered for prototype of HB650 cryomodule. In paper we will discuss details of coupler processing and results"
