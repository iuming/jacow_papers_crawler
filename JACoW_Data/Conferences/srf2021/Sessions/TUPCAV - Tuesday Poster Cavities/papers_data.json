        "Vertical Electro-Polishing (VEP) of elliptical cavities using rotating Ninja cathodes (Marui Company patented technology) has continually been improved since 2012 and successfully applied for 1300MHz multicell ILC-type resonators. The goal of the presented study is to apply this technology to 704 MHz ESS-type resonators with both better Q0 and accelerating gradients in mind. We intend to demonstrate the superiority of VEP compared to standard Buffer Chemical Polishing (BCP)",
        "for possible applications such as MYRRHA accelerator. We describe here the promising results achieved on β=0.86 single-cell cavity after 200 µm uniform removal. The cavity quenched at 27 MV/m without any heat treatment. The surface resistance achieved was less than 5nΩ at 1.8K. Substantial performance improvement is expected after heat treatment of the cavity and additional 20 µm VEP sequence. A cathode for 5-Cell ESS cavity is concomitantly under design stage."

The cryomodule includes six 5-cell elliptical SRF cavities with accelerating voltage up to 20 MV and low heat dissipation (Q0 > 3.3 · 10zEhNZeHn). Characterization of performance of fully integrated jacketed cavities with high power coupler and tuner is crucial for the project. Such a characterization of jacketed cavity requires a horizontal test cryostat. The Fermilab Spoke Test Cryostat (STC) has been upgraded to accommodate testing of 650 MHz cavities. Commissioning of upgraded STC has been reported at SRF’19 conference. In this paper we present results of testing of the prototype HB650 cavity in upgraded STC facility.

        "beam loading is a great concern due to the high beam current together with abortion gap",
        "especially for harmonic cavities due to higher operational frequency. There were attempts to use feedback/feedforward control",
        "using multiple cavities with counter-phasing. A straightforward way to lower beam loading effect is to design a cavity with low R/Q. In this paper",
        "we show such a design for the 3rd harmonic cavity for BNL EIC ESR."
