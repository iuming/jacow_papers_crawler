        "INFN-LASA is currently involved in the production of PIP-II low-beta cavity prototypes. The main challenge of this activity is to develop a state-of-the art surface treatment recipe on such cavity geometry",
        "to achieve the high-Q target required for cavity operation in the linac. This paper reports the status of cavity treatments development and the first cold test results of a single-cell cavity. This cavity has undergone a baseline treatment based on Electropolishing as bulk removal step. Being this test successful",
        "a strategy for pushing the cavities towards higher performances is here proposed."
