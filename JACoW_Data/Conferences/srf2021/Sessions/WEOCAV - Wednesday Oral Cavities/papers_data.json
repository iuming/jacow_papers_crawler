Two RF dipole crab cavity used for the compensation of the horizontal crossing angle were recently manufactured and integrated into Titanium Helium tank and RF ancillaries necessary for the beam operation. The two cavities will be integrated into a cryomodule in collaboration with UK-STFC and tested with proton beams in the SPS in 2023. This paper will highlight the RF measurements during the important manufacturing steps",

        "The Standing Wave TESLA Niobium-based structure is limited to a gradient of about 50 MV/m by the critical RF magnetic field. To break through this barrier",
        "we explore the option of Niobium-based traveling wave (TW) structures. Optimization of TW structures was done taking into account experimentally known limiting electric and magnetic fields. It is shown that a TW structure can have an accelerating gradient above 70 MeV/m that is about 1.5 times higher than contemporary standing wave structures with the same critical magnetic field. The other benefit of TW structures shown is R/Q about 2 times higher than TESLA structure that reduces 2 times the dynamic heat load. A method is proposed how to make TW structures multipactor-free. Some design proposals can be realized to facilitate fabrication. Further increase of the real-estate gradient (equivalent to 80 MV/m active gradient) is also possible by increasing the length of the accelerating structure because of higher group velocity and cell-to-cell coupling. Realization of this work opens paths to ILC energy upgrades beyond 1 TeV to 3 TeV in competition with CLIC. The paper will discuss corresponding opportunities and challenges."

The SCL consists in four cryomodules. The first two identical cryomodules host 6 half-wave resonator (HWR) low beta cavities (β= 0.09) at 176 MHz. The last two identical cryomodules will host 7 HWR high-beta cavities (β = 0.18) at 176 MHz. The low-beta prototypes was qualified in 2019. Low-beta series manufacturing is on-going. The high-beta prototype was first tested in 2019 but failed. A new prototype was tested in the end of 2020. This contribution will present the results of the tests for low- and high-beta SARAF cavities",
