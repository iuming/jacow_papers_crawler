        "The consistent production of high-purity niobium cavities for superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) applications is crucial for enabling improvements in accelerator performance. Recent work has shown that dislocations and grain boundaries trap magnetic flux which dissipates energy and degrades cavity performance. We hypothesize that the current heating rate used in production is too slow and therefore facilitates recovery rather than recrystallization. Recovery",
        "unlike recrystallization",
        "does not reduce the number of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) that are strongly correlated to trapped magnetic flux. Using excess high-purity niobium saved from the production of a cavity",
        "the material was divided into two groups and rolled to ~30% reduction with half rolled parallel to the original rolling direction",
        "and the other half rolled perpendicular. To examine the effect of heating rate",
        "samples were encapsulated in quartz tubes and placed into either a preheated furnace or a cold furnace to allow for heat treatments at different rates. Then using ex-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping",
        "the extent of recrystallization was determined."

Cornell University has recently developed a high-speed temperature mapping system that can examine cavity quench mechanisms in never before achieved ways. Here we present high-speed temperature map results of Nb3Sn cavities and examine the quench mechanism and dynamic heating. We show an initial multipacting quench and sudden temperature jumps at multiple locations on the cavity."

        "two recent developments have called the efficacy of the existing EP process into question. Since the introduction of nitrogen doping the surface quality of some cavities has been very poor. Also",
        "EP performed at colder than standard temperatures leads to an increase in the cavity performance. To understand these questions",
        "we perform a multivariate study on the EP process using niobium test samples electropolished at different temperatures and potentials. We find that electropolishing at lower potentials leads to rough surface features such as pitting and grain etching. Some of the surface features show similarities to features seen in niobium cavities. The effect of electropolishing temperature is not clear based on the results of this study."
