        "medium field Q-slope (MFQS)",
        "high field Q-slope (HFQS). However",
        "these does not explain both in a way unified. Here",
        "a new model by multiple Josephson junctions on weakly linked grain boundaries or dislocations is proposed for the unified explanation. This model suggests two kind of junctions: ceramic like one and weak superconductor one. If plotted the field vs. RF power dissipation",
        "an increase of RF loss is remarkably observed in proportional to the cube of fields",
        "on both BCP’ed and EP’ed cavity (MFQS). An exponential RF dissipation is often observed at high fields for BCP’ed cavity (HFQS). If supposed the number of J-junctions linearly increases with the fields (this is explained by the flux quantum penetration condition)",
        "these behaviors are easily explained. In addition",
        "this model has a potential to explain the anti-Q slope behavior observed in Nitrogen doped or mid-temperature baked cavity. In this paper",
        "this model will be explained",
        "then several data analysis results will be presented."

The ingot is 260 mm in diameter and sliced by a multi wire saw to 2.8 thickness. 5 specimens were cut off from one sliced disk. 3 disks were set in same phase to obtain same grain distribution. 3 specimens each of 5 grain patterns 5",
        "15 in total were used for the tensile test. The tensile test stand using a cryostat and liquid He was manufactured by ourselves. The measured tensile strength varied 379 to 808 MPa. The average value is 611 MPa. The tensile strength at room temperature is 84 MPa. The strength becomes high at low temperature like a fine grain niobium. The specimen includes a grain boundary",
        "and causes the variation of strength. The different result was obtained in same grain patterns. The relationship between crystal orientation and strength is discussed."
