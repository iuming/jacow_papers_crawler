        "We address the nonlinear dynamics of penetration of vortices in a superconductor subject to a periodic magnetic field H(t)=H0\\sinω t parallel to the surface. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for a gapped superconductor were simulated numerically to calculate the frequency and temperature dependencies of the field onset Hp(T",
        "ω) of vortex penetration at T≈ Tc. It is shown that Hp(T",
        "ω) can exceed the dc superheating field Hs at which the Meissner state becomes unstable. Here Hp(T",
        "ω) increases with ω and approaches √{2}Hs(T) at ωτ≥ 1",

        "ω) and cause additional power dissipation. Ultimately",

        "This study focused on the flux trapping of the superconducting cavity by measuring changes in the spatial magnetic field distribution for the Nb single-cell cavity using the magnetic field and temperature mapping system. The different external magnetic fields were applied when the cavity was vertically tested. The differences of magnetic field distribution were compared before and after flux trapping caused by quenches. The magnetic field mapping measured the magnetic field",
