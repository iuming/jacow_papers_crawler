        "Improvements in both the cooling power of 4 K crycoolers and the deposition of Nb3Sn films have spurred research and development efforts towards the operation of Nb3Sn-coated SRF cavities cooled by conduction with commercial cryocoolers. Different types of SRF cavities with frequencies between 650 MHz and 2.6 GHz and different conduction cooling schemes have been tested at different laboratories",
        "demonstrating accelerating gradients up to ~10 MV/m. This contribution provides an overview of these and future efforts along with possible cryostat designs under evaluation for conduction-cooled SRF cavities.",

        "Reducing surface roughness and attaining stoichiometry of Nb3Sn superconducting films are required to push their superheating field to the theoretical limit in SRF cavities. As such",
        "we explore direct electrochemical processes that minimize involving foreign elements to deposit high-quality Sn",
        "Nb",
        "and NbxSn films on Nb and Cu surfaces. These films are then thermally annealed to Nb3Sn. We find that smooth Sn pre-depositions via electroplating on Nb surfaces significantly reduce the average roughness of resultant Nb3Sn to 65 nm",
        "with a dramatic reduction in power intensity at medium special frequencies. Structural and superconducting properties demonstrate a Nb3Sn A15 phase with a stoichiometry of 25 at% Sn. This process is being scaled-up to a 3.9 GHz cavity. Moreover",
        "preliminary results on electroplating on Cu surface show that Nb plating undergoes a slow growth rate while subsequent Sn plating on the plated Nb surface can be controlled with varied thickness. The Nb plating process is currently being optimized."
