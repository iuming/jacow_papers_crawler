The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made from pure niobium sheets which operate at 4.5 K. We succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the required Q0 of 1E+9 with a wide margin. Installation of the cryomodule and He refrigerator system was completed by the end of FY2018",

FRIB is the first linac to deploy a large number of HWRs (220) and the first heavy ion linac to operate at 2 K.
