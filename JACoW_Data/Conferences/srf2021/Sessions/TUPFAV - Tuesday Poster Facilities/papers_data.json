        "To overcome the nuclear waste problem",
        "the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been developing an accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS) since the late 1980s. In the JAEA-ADS proposal",
        "an 800 MWth subcritical reactor is driven by a 30 MW cw proton linear accelerator (linac). The biggest challenges for the ADS machines are the high reliability and availability required for their operations. To this end",
        "the present JAEA-ADS linac was redesigned by adopting the current developments in Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) technology. Additionally",
        "we developed a robust lattice to control the beam loss and implemented a fault-tolerance scheme for the fast recovery of SRF cavity failures. This work presents the latest results of the R&D of the JAEA-ADS superconducting linac."

        "non-negligible discrepancy was observed between the results obtained from two different methods: one is using external Q value (Qext) of pickup ports",
        "and the other is using loaded Q value (QL) of the cavities. The discrepancy comes from inaccuracy of power measurement in high power RF system and uncertainty of the Qext or QL values. In order to solve the discrepancy by improving the accuracy of the calibration for each individual cavity",
        "we investigated a method by measuring synchrotron frequency fs of stored beam. With this method",
        "Vc calibration can be performed without affected by inaccuracy of high-power measurement or uncertainty of the Qext or QL values. The fs measurement studies were carried out in SuperKEKB. With these studies",
        "Vc calibration was obtained with a high accuracy of about 1%. The results are applied to the SuperKEKB operation."

Some important design details and materials choices of the facility will be briefly discussed together with the range of operational parameters. First results on different substrates and geometries are discussed in terms of surface finishing and polishing rate uniformity."
