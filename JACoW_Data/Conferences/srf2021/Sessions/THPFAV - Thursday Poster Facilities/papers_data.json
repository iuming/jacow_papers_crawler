During the course of this campaign cutting-edge results for cavity Q0 and gradient in continuous wave operation were achieved. A summary of all test results will be presented",

        "The LHC RF cryomodule \"Asia\" suffered an accidental influx of about 0.5 l of tunnel air during the leak checks of the pumping manifolds. The resulting risk of particle contamination was difficult to assess",
        "and could not be excluded with certainty. If one or more cavities were contaminated",
        "a severe impact on beam operations in the LHC machine was to be expected. In order to minimize the risks",
        "the Asia cryomodule has been replaced with a spare unit. Subsequently",
        "the cryomodule was tested in the SM18 test facility without intermediate venting",
        "and showed high levels of radiation due to field emission above 1.8 MV in one of the cavities. The other cavities were less strongly affected",
        "but clear signs of contamination were observed. The helium processing technique was used to improve the performance of the SRF cavity with respect to field emission. This paper will discuss the results of the above-mentioned test."
