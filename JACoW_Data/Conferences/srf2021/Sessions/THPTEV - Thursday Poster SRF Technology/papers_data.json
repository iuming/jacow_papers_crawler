Pneumatic tuner control is via solenoid valves connecting the tuner to a helium gas supply manifold and a gas return line. For precise compensation of cavity detuning over a small range",
        "the control voltage for the solenoid valves must be calibrated. Some valves have hysteresis in the gas flow rate as a function of control voltage",
        "such that their response may be nonlinear and not repeatable–this makes the control algorithm challenging. To improve the system performance",
        "a new pneumatic tuner control system was developed which regulates the position of one stepper motor instead of the two solenoid valves."

        "and sputtering from a stoichiometric target. Nb3Sn films produced by magnetron sputtering in our previous experiments have achieved DC superconducting critical temperature up to 17.93 K and RF superconducting transition at 17.2 K. A magnetron sputtering system with two identical cylindrical cathodes that can be used to sputter Nb3Sn films on cavities has been designed and is under development now. We report on the design and the current progress on the development of the system."

        "was subjected to sequential testing and treatment with in-situ low temperature baking at various temperatures. We find that increasing the bake duration causes (i) an increase in the onset of HFQS until it is absent up to quench (ii) a non-monotonic relationship with the quench field (iii) an evolution of the RBCS toward a non-equilibrium behavior that drives anti-Q slope. Our data is qualitatively explained by assuming an O diffusion model and suggests that the mitigation of HFQS that arises from 120°C in-situ LTB is mediated by the diffusion of O from the native oxide which prevents the precipitation of proximity-coupled Nb nano-hydrides",
        "in turn enabling higher quench fields. The decrease in quench field for cavities in which O has been diffused >90 nm from the RF surface may be due to a reduction of the field limit in the SS bilayer structure. We also suggest that the evolution of the RBCS occurs due to the absence of proximity coupled inclusions",
