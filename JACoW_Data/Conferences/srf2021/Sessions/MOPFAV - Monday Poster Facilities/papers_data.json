        "Since 2011 a research and development program is carried out at DESY to study the feasibility of a possible Continuous-Wave (CW) upgrade of the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL). Cryo-Module Test Bench (CMTB) is a test facility at DESY used to perform tests with accelerating modules equipped with TESLA-type superconducting cavities. In this proceeding",
        "the most recent tests at CMTB on module XM50.1 are presented. For the European XFEL upgrade",
        "a key-importance question to answer is the cryomodules’ heat load when driven in CW. Therefore",
        "tests at accelerating gradients up to 19 MV/m per cavity at 2K were carried to determine the cavities’ dissipated power. Operating at QLs > 107 is also challenging for the LLRF: the narrow RF bandwidths involved require active online detuning disturbances rejection techniques. Therefore a new detuning estimator was developed. The estimator is also capable of working as a quench/multipacting detector. Tests on XM50.1 show that it is possible to estimate detuning disturbances with a sub-hertz precision and to catch multipacting events. Finally",
        "the maximum achieved gradients with the module and after RF conditioning are presented.",

        "A novel vertical test facility has been developed at the STFC Daresbury Laboratory. The VTF is designed to test 3 jacketed SRF cavities in a horizontal configuration in a single cool-down run at 2 K. Cavities were tested at low power levels for HOMs and passband modes",
        "and Q vs E field measurements at high power levels. The specification requires an unloaded Q of 5·109 at a field gradient of 19.9 MV/m. The cavities are cooled with superfluid helium filled into their individual helium jackets. This reduces the liquid helium consumption by more than 70% in comparison with the conventional facilities operational elsewhere. The facility will be used to conduct a 2-year program to qualify 84 high-beta SRF cavities for the European Spallation Source as part of the UK’s in-kind contribution. This paper reports on the commissioning program",
        "along with a detailed discussion of the RF and cryogenic operations and performance of the facility."
