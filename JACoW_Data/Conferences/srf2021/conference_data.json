            "The consistent production of high-purity niobium cavities for superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) applications is crucial for enabling improvements in accelerator performance. Recent work has shown that dislocations and grain boundaries trap magnetic flux which dissipates energy and degrades cavity performance. We hypothesize that the current heating rate used in production is too slow and therefore facilitates recovery rather than recrystallization. Recovery",
            "unlike recrystallization",
            "does not reduce the number of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) that are strongly correlated to trapped magnetic flux. Using excess high-purity niobium saved from the production of a cavity",
            "the material was divided into two groups and rolled to ~30% reduction with half rolled parallel to the original rolling direction",
            "and the other half rolled perpendicular. To examine the effect of heating rate",
            "samples were encapsulated in quartz tubes and placed into either a preheated furnace or a cold furnace to allow for heat treatments at different rates. Then using ex-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping",
            "the extent of recrystallization was determined."

Determining the cause of the premature field limitation is the topic of ongoing research. Cornell University has recently developed a high-speed temperature mapping system that can examine cavity quench mechanisms in never before achieved ways. Here we present high-speed temperature map results of Nb3Sn cavities and examine the quench mechanism and dynamic heating. We show an initial multipacting quench and sudden temperature jumps at multiple locations on the cavity."

            "Superconducting (SC) thin film coatings on Cu substrates are already widely used as an alternative to bulk Nb SRF structures. Using Cu allows improved thermal stability compared to Nb due to having a greater thermal conductivity. Niobium thin film coatings also reduce the amount of Nb required to produce a cavity. The performance of thin film Nb cavities is not as good as bulk Nb cavities. The H2020 ARIES WP15 collaboration studied the impact of substrate polishing and the effect produced on Nb thin film depositions. Multiple samples were produced from Cu and polished with various techniques. The polished Cu substrates were then coated with a Nb film at partner institutions. These samples were characterised with surface characterisation techniques for film morphology and structure. The SC properties were studied with 2 DC techniques",
            "a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and a magnetic field penetration (MFP) facility. The results conclude that both chemical polishing and electropolishing produce the best DC properties in the MFP facility. A comparison between the VSM and the MFP facility can be made for 10 micron thick samples",

            "Fermilab conducted testing of three 3.9 GHz cryomodules for the LCLS-II project that will operate in continuous wave mode. A fast/fine tuning component was added to the LCLS-II 3.9 GHz tuner design due to the cavity bandwidth of 130 Hz which consists of two encapsulated piezos. Several cavities faced problems with fast-tuner operations after cooldown to 2 K and tuning the cavities to 3.9 GHz in cryomodule 2. All the piezo actuators were in working conditions but the slow tuner ranges required to stretch some of the cavities to the operational 3.9 GHz frequency were too small to deliver the required preload on the piezos. This behavior can be attributed to several factors: setting the initial warm cavity frequency during production too high",
            "pressure tests of the warm cryomodule could have changed cavity frequency; and the small bending and twisting of the cavity-tuner system during the cooldown and warmup of the cavities. A decision was made to inelastically retune the warm cavities to decrease the unrestrained frequency by 200-300 kHz",
            "this was done via the slow tuner. The results for this retuning method of three 3.9GHz cryomodules will be discussed."

The high accelerating gradient cavities in pulsed SRF linacs will experience large (~1000’s of Hz) detuning caused by Lorentz force detuning (LFD). The piezo actuators that will be used to compensate large LFD must operate at a nominal voltage of 120V to 150V to deliver the required stroke to the cavity. In this high voltage range",
            "the piezo is expected to warm up drastically due to its location in an insulating vacuum environment. Overheating of the piezo will significantly decrease the longevity of the actuator. A collaboration between FNAL and Physik Instrumente (PI) developed a novel piezo actuator design that mitigates piezo overheating. The design consists of using a metal foam in contact with the piezoelectric ceramic stack for heat removal. The second solution used lithium niobite as an alternative material. A comparison of the temperature stability will be presented and discussed. This study characterizes the dielectric properties for both materials. The results obtained are in the temperature range of 10 K to 300 K."

We propose a method to measure Q0 in situ for an SRF resonator installed in its cryogenic module and connected with a RF feed source via a fixed RF coupler.

Such a signal can be synthesized as a beat-wave composed of two frequencies that are close to the resonant frequency. Analyzing the envelope of the reflected signal",

            "and Q vs E field measurements at high power levels. The specification requires an unloaded Q of 5·109 at a field gradient of 19.9 MV/m. The cavities are cooled with superfluid helium filled into their individual helium jackets. This reduces the liquid helium consumption by more than 70% in comparison with the conventional facilities operational elsewhere. The facility will be used to conduct a 2-year program to qualify 84 high-beta SRF cavities for the European Spallation Source as part of the UK’s in-kind contribution. This paper reports on the commissioning program",

We propose a 2-steps mechanical process that allows us to easily get rid of the thick damage layer on the sheets before cavity forming. The process has been established on samples and extended to large disks ready for 1.3 GHz half-cell forming. The polished sheets will be then sent to KEK for half-cell forming and subsequent surface and material analysis before proceeding to half-cell welding. Former studies on the sample demonstrated that damages induced by forming can successfully be removed by recrystallization and less than 10 µm final chemistry."

Exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of an SRF cavity, this proposal aims at overcoming a major limit faced by state-of-the-art laser trapping techniques. The goal of the proposal is to establish a foundation to enable observation of quantum phenomena of an isolated mechanical oscillator interacting with microwave fields. An experiment supported by LDRD funding at JLab has started to address R&D issues relevant to these new research directions using existing SRF facilities at JLab. The success of this experiment would establish its groundbreaking relevance to quantum information science and technology, which may lead to applications in precision force measurement sensors, quantum memories, and alternative quantum computing implementations with promises for superior coherence characteristics and scalability well beyond the start-of-the-art. In this contribution, we will introduce the proposal and basic consideration of the experiment.",

            "SIMS analyses for ’N-doped’ materials are becoming increasingly important. A major hurdle to acquiring quantitative SIMS results for these materials is the uncertainty of instrument calibration due to changes in sample height either from sample topography or from the sample holder itself. The CAMECA sample holder design allows for many types of samples to be analyzed. However",
            "the cost is that the holder faceplate can bend",
            "introducing uncertainty into the SIMS results. Here we designed and created an improved sample holder which is reinforced to prevent faceplate deflection and thereby reduce uncertainty. Simulations show that the new design significantly reduces deflection from 10 µm to 5 nm. Measurements show a reduction of calibration (RSF) uncertainty from this source from 4.1% to 0.95%. Grain orientation has long been suspected to affect RSF determination as well. A bicrystal implant standard consisting of [111] and [001] grains were repeatedly rotated 15° in between analyses. It was observed that 20% of the analyses performed on [111] grains exhibited anomalously high RSF values likely due to the changing of the grain normal with respect to the primary Cs+ beam."

Visual inspection of samples known to have experienced surface contamination were found to have inconsistent nitride coverage after nitrogen doping. EBSD analysis suggest that nitride suppression tends to be most prevalent when deviating from the [111] and [001] zone axes. XPS suggested that tin was present as a contaminant on the surface with SIMS mass spectra also confirming its presence. SIMS depth profiles show a depletion of nitrogen content as well as an increase in car-bon content for contaminated samples. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-SRF2021-",

One of the generally considered reasons for the RF windows failure is the multipactor effect on dielectric surface. The multipactor may be responsible for excessive heating of dielectric and discharge of charges that accumulated in ceramic due to secondary emission. In this study the comprehensive self-consistent PIC simulations with space charge effect were performed in order to better understand the dynamic of one-side multipactor development and floating potential on dielectric induced by the emission. The important correlations between the multipactor parameters at saturation and the secondary emission properties of dielectric and the applied RF field parameters were found and are reported in the paper.",

Characterization of performance of fully integrated jacketed cavities with high power coupler and tuner is crucial for the project. Such a characterization of jacketed cavity requires a horizontal test cryostat. The Fermilab Spoke Test Cryostat (STC) has been upgraded to accommodate testing of 650 MHz cavities.

Two RF dipole crab cavity used for the compensation of the horizontal crossing angle were recently manufactured and integrated into Titanium Helium tank and RF ancillaries necessary for the beam operation. The two cavities will be integrated into a cryomodule in collaboration with UK-STFC and tested with proton beams in the SPS in 2023. This paper will highlight the RF measurements during the important manufacturing steps",

            "we explore the option of Niobium-based traveling wave (TW) structures. Optimization of TW structures was done taking into account experimentally known limiting electric and magnetic fields. It is shown that a TW structure can have an accelerating gradient above 70 MeV/m that is about 1.5 times higher than contemporary standing wave structures with the same critical magnetic field. The other benefit of TW structures shown is R/Q about 2 times higher than TESLA structure that reduces 2 times the dynamic heat load. A method is proposed how to make TW structures multipactor-free. Some design proposals can be realized to facilitate fabrication. Further increase of the real-estate gradient (equivalent to 80 MV/m active gradient) is also possible by increasing the length of the accelerating structure because of higher group velocity and cell-to-cell coupling. Realization of this work opens paths to ILC energy upgrades beyond 1 TeV to 3 TeV in competition with CLIC. The paper will discuss corresponding opportunities and challenges."

            "the helium gas based system was continued",

The old flow control valves which operated with DC voltages were replaced with valves operating in pulsed mode and controlled by varying the duty cycle of the input pulses. The above mentioned limitations were overcome by using this PWM based technique and this enabled phase locking at higher gradients. This paper presents our operational experience with all the different tuning systems and their comparison."

Irradiation can induce vacancy-2H complexes [**] and in this study",
            "the effects of 9MeV electrons on Nb samples and cavity up to fluences of 1.8x1021e/m2 are investigated. The size and density changes of micro-hydrides before and after irradiation was measured by cryo-laser confocal microscopy and a new analytic technique based on computer vision has been used. A strong reduction in hydrides size was found after irradiation and the hydrides formation temperature was shifted to lower values suggesting a reduction in both the activation energy barrier and the critical radius. We conclude that electron irradiation can indeed prevent the formation of large hydrides in H-loaded Nb bulk sample. 1.3GHz Nb cavity has also been submitted to electron irradiation treatment in stationary mode and Q vs E curves and T-map measurements before and after irradiations recorded the changes induced by radiation on cavity performance.",

Recent work has shown that dislocations and grain boundaries trap magnetic flux which dissipates energy and degrades cavity performance. We hypothesize that the current heating rate used in production is too slow and therefore facilitates recovery rather than recrystallization. Recovery",

Using Cu allows improved thermal stability compared to Nb due to having a greater thermal conductivity. Niobium thin film coatings also reduce the amount of Nb required to produce a cavity. The performance of thin film Nb cavities is not as good as bulk Nb cavities. The H2020 ARIES WP15 collaboration studied the impact of substrate polishing and the effect produced on Nb thin film depositions. Multiple samples were produced from Cu and polished with various techniques. The polished Cu substrates were then coated with a Nb film at partner institutions. These samples were characterised with surface characterisation techniques for film morphology and structure. The SC properties were studied with 2 DC techniques",

A fast/fine tuning component was added to the LCLS-II 3.9 GHz tuner design due to the cavity bandwidth of 130 Hz which consists of two encapsulated piezos. Several cavities faced problems with fast-tuner operations after cooldown to 2 K and tuning the cavities to 3.9 GHz in cryomodule 2. All the piezo actuators were in working conditions but the slow tuner ranges required to stretch some of the cavities to the operational 3.9 GHz frequency were too small to deliver the required preload on the piezos. This behavior can be attributed to several factors: setting the initial warm cavity frequency during production too high",
        "pressure tests of the warm cryomodule could have changed cavity frequency; and the small bending and twisting of the cavity-tuner system during the cooldown and warmup of the cavities. A decision was made to inelastically retune the warm cavities to decrease the unrestrained frequency by 200-300 kHz",

The high accelerating gradient cavities in pulsed SRF linacs will experience large (~1000’s of Hz) detuning caused by Lorentz force detuning (LFD). The piezo actuators that will be used to compensate large LFD must operate at a nominal voltage of 120V to 150V to deliver the required stroke to the cavity. In this high voltage range",

A collaboration between FNAL and Physik Instrumente (PI) developed a novel piezo actuator design that mitigates piezo overheating. The design consists of using a metal foam in contact with the piezoelectric ceramic stack for heat removal. The second solution used lithium niobite as an alternative material. A comparison of the temperature stability will be presented and discussed. This study characterizes the dielectric properties for both materials.

These SIS structures show continued sharp interfaces with total average roughness under 2 nm. The Hfp enhancement of the films will be examined with a 3rd harmonic magnetometry. The system is being designed and built in a continuing collaboration with CEA Saclay. It can measure 25 to 50 mm samples on a temperature controlled stage. This contribution presents an overview of the design of the 3rd harmonic magnetometer and the material properties assessment of standalone films and multilayer nanostructures.",

We propose a method to measure Q0 in situ for an SRF resonator installed in its cryogenic module and connected with a RF feed source via a fixed RF coupler. The method exploits measurements of a response for an SRF resonator fed by an amplitude-modulated signal. Such a signal can be synthesized as a beat-wave composed of two frequencies that are close to the resonant frequency. Analyzing the envelope of the reflected signal",

We also develop the methodology to carry out measurements of Q0 at the nominal cavity operating voltage.

        "Medium grain (MG) niobium disc which is directly sliced from forged ingot is newly investigated for the cavity material. An effective cost reduction can be achieved using MG niobium since rolling process which is necessary for typical niobium sheet can be skipped during MG niobium production. Grain size of MD niobium is 200-300 um which is much smaller than large grain (LG) niobium directly sliced from melted niobium ingot. Hence",
        "the formability of MG niobium is expected to be much better than LG niobium. KEK has started fabrication of cavity using MG niobium. In this talk",
        "characteristic of MG niobium during fabrication will be reported."

Therefore a new detuning estimator was developed. The estimator is also capable of working as a quench/multipacting detector. Tests on XM50.1 show that it is possible to estimate detuning disturbances with a sub-hertz precision and to catch multipacting events. Finally",

We propose a 2-steps mechanical process that allows us to easily get rid of the thick damage layer on the sheets before cavity forming.

The polished sheets will be then sent to KEK for half-cell forming and subsequent surface and material analysis before proceeding to half-cell welding. Former studies on the sample demonstrated that damages induced by forming can successfully be removed by recrystallization and less than 10 µm final chemistry."

Exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of an SRF cavity, this proposal aims at overcoming a major limit faced by state-of-the-art laser trapping techniques. The goal of the proposal is to establish a foundation to enable observation of quantum phenomena of an isolated mechanical oscillator interacting with microwave fields. An experiment supported by LDRD funding at JLab has started to address R&D issues relevant to these new research directions using existing SRF facilities at JLab. The success of this experiment would establish its groundbreaking relevance to quantum information science and technology, which may lead to applications in precision force measurement sensors, quantum memories, and alternative quantum computing implementations with promises for superior coherence characteristics and scalability well beyond the start-of-the-art. In this contribution, we will introduce the proposal and basic consideration of the experiment.",

        "SIMS analyses for ’N-doped’ materials are becoming increasingly important. A major hurdle to acquiring quantitative SIMS results for these materials is the uncertainty of instrument calibration due to changes in sample height either from sample topography or from the sample holder itself. The CAMECA sample holder design allows for many types of samples to be analyzed. However",
        "the cost is that the holder faceplate can bend",
        "introducing uncertainty into the SIMS results. Here we designed and created an improved sample holder which is reinforced to prevent faceplate deflection and thereby reduce uncertainty. Simulations show that the new design significantly reduces deflection from 10 µm to 5 nm. Measurements show a reduction of calibration (RSF) uncertainty from this source from 4.1% to 0.95%. Grain orientation has long been suspected to affect RSF determination as well. A bicrystal implant standard consisting of [111] and [001] grains were repeatedly rotated 15° in between analyses. It was observed that 20% of the analyses performed on [111] grains exhibited anomalously high RSF values likely due to the changing of the grain normal with respect to the primary Cs+ beam."

      "abstract": "Detection of surface contamination for SRF material is difficult due to the miniscule quantities and near atomic resolution needed. Visual inspection of samples known to have experienced surface contamination were found to have inconsistent nitride coverage after nitrogen doping. EBSD analysis suggest that nitride suppression tends to be most prevalent when deviating from the [111] and [001] zone axes. XPS suggested that tin was present as a contaminant on the surface with SIMS mass spectra also confirming its presence. SIMS depth profiles show a depletion of nitrogen content as well as an increase in car-bon content for contaminated samples. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-SRF2021-",

      "abstract": "Breakdown of dielectric RF windows is an important issue for particle accelerators and high-power RF sources. One of the generally considered reasons for the RF windows failure is the multipactor effect on dielectric surface. The multipactor may be responsible for excessive heating of dielectric and discharge of charges that accumulated in ceramic due to secondary emission. In this study the comprehensive self-consistent PIC simulations with space charge effect were performed in order to better understand the dynamic of one-side multipactor development and floating potential on dielectric induced by the emission. The important correlations between the multipactor parameters at saturation and the secondary emission properties of dielectric and the applied RF field parameters were found and are reported in the paper.",

The cryomodule includes six 5-cell elliptical SRF cavities with accelerating voltage up to 20 MV and low heat dissipation (Q0 > 3.3 · 10zEhNZeHn). Characterization of performance of fully integrated jacketed cavities with high power coupler and tuner is crucial for the project. Such a characterization of jacketed cavity requires a horizontal test cryostat. The Fermilab Spoke Test Cryostat (STC) has been upgraded to accommodate testing of 650 MHz cavities. Commissioning of upgraded STC has been reported at SRF’19 conference. In this paper we present results of testing of the prototype HB650 cavity in upgraded STC facility.

        "Jefferson Lab began a plasma processing program starting in the spring of 2019. Plasma processing is a common technique for removing hydrocarbons from surfaces",
        "which increases the work function and reduces the secondary emission coefficient. Unlike helium processing which relies on ion bombardment of the field emitters",
        "plasma processing uses free oxygen produced in the plasma to break down the hydrocarbons on the surface of the cavity. The residuals of the hydrocarbons in the form of water",
        "carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are removed from the cryomodule as part of the process gas flow. The initial focus of the effort is processing C100 cavities by injecting RF power into the HOM coupler ports. We will then start investigating processing of C50 cavities by introducing RF into the fundamental power coupler. The plan is to start processing cryomodules in the CEBAF tunnel in the mid-term future",
        "with a goal of improving the operational gradients and the energy margin of the linacs. This work will describe the systems and methods used at JLAB for processing cavities using an argon oxygen gas mixture. Before and after plasma processing results will also be presented."

The beam commissioning of SRILAC was successfully performed in January 2020. Frequency tuning during cold operation is performed by compressing the beam port of the cavity with stainless wires and decreasing the length of each beam gap",

        "we explore the option of Niobium-based traveling wave (TW) structures. Optimization of TW structures was done taking into account experimentally known limiting electric and magnetic fields. It is shown that a TW structure can have an accelerating gradient above 70 MeV/m that is about 1.5 times higher than contemporary standing wave structures with the same critical magnetic field. The other benefit of TW structures shown is R/Q about 2 times higher than TESLA structure that reduces 2 times the dynamic heat load. A method is proposed how to make TW structures multipactor-free. Some design proposals can be realized to facilitate fabrication. Further increase of the real-estate gradient (equivalent to 80 MV/m active gradient) is also possible by increasing the length of the accelerating structure because of higher group velocity and cell-to-cell coupling. Realization of this work opens paths to ILC energy upgrades beyond 1 TeV to 3 TeV in competition with CLIC. The paper will discuss corresponding opportunities and challenges."

We find that increasing the bake duration causes (i) an increase in the onset of HFQS until it is absent up to quench (ii) a non-monotonic relationship with the quench field (iii) an evolution of the RBCS toward a non-equilibrium behavior that drives anti-Q slope. Our data is qualitatively explained by assuming an O diffusion model and suggests that the mitigation of HFQS that arises from 120°C in-situ LTB is mediated by the diffusion of O from the native oxide which prevents the precipitation of proximity-coupled Nb nano-hydrides",

Doping and heat treatments can mitigate such effect and the most accredited theory is based on the presence of proximity-coupled niobium hydrides [*]. Irradiation can induce vacancy-2H complexes [**] and in this study",
        "the effects of 9MeV electrons on Nb samples and cavity up to fluences of 1.8x1021e/m2 are investigated. The size and density changes of micro-hydrides before and after irradiation was measured by cryo-laser confocal microscopy and a new analytic technique based on computer vision has been used. A strong reduction in hydrides size was found after irradiation and the hydrides formation temperature was shifted to lower values suggesting a reduction in both the activation energy barrier and the critical radius. We conclude that electron irradiation can indeed prevent the formation of large hydrides in H-loaded Nb bulk sample. 1.3GHz Nb cavity has also been submitted to electron irradiation treatment in stationary mode and Q vs E curves and T-map measurements before and after irradiations recorded the changes induced by radiation on cavity performance.",

        "\"Bulk niobium (Nb) has been the material of choice for superconducting RF (SRF) cavities but for further improvement in cavity RF performance",
        "one may have to turn to films of Nb and to other superconducting materials deposited on copper as thermal and mechanical support. Other materials known as A15",
        "such as Nb3Sn or V3Si and B1 such as NbTiN and NbN are much easier to synthesise in thin films rather than being made as bulk cavity. The potential benefits of using materials other than Nb would be a higher Tc",
        "a potentially higher critical held Hc",
        "leading to potentially significant cryogenics cost reduction if the cavity operation temperature is 4.2 K or higher. We report on optimising deposition parameters and effect of substrate treatment prior to deposition for successful synthesising of Nb and the alternative superconducting thin film with high superconducting properties (Tc and Hsh) on flat substrates and QPR samples in single layer. The DC and RF SC properties have been tested using PPMS and QPR measurements. This work is part of the H2020 ARIES collaboration. We further report on preparation of RF cavities employing these alternative material for future cavity production.\""

        "We are exploring an original approach to improve the performance of bulk Niobium RF cavities through surface engineering with ALD superconducting multilayer capable of screening efficiently the magnetic fields and therefore inhibiting vortices penetration in Niobium cavities. As a first step for the multilayer",

        "resist to thermal treatments and reduce significantly the presence of the niobium native oxide on the surface. Low SEY material such as TiN was also deposited on top of the insulator film to reduce multipacting phenomena. RF test on ALD coated cavities shows already a slight improvement of the superconducting performances. In parallel we started synthesizing superconducting NbTiN alloys by ALD. I will present preliminary results on the superconducting properties of NbTiN films grown on AlN by ALD with various compositions on Nbiobium.",
