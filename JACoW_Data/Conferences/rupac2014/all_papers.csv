The 2 MeV cooler is also well suited in the start up phase of the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at FAIR in Darmstadt. It can be used for beam cooling at injection energy and for testing new features of the high energy electron cooler for HESR. The COSY cooler is designed on the classic scheme of low energy coolers like cooler CSRm; CSRe; LEIR that was produced in BINP before. The electron beam is transported inside the longitudinal magnetic field along whole trajectory from an electron gun to a collector. The 2 MeV electron cooler was installed in the COSY ring in the spring 2013. Electron beam commissioning and first studies using proton and deuteron beams were carried out. Electron cooling of proton beam up to 1662 MeV kinetic energy was demonstrated. Maximum electron beam energy achieved so far amounted to 1.25 MeV. Voltage up to 1.4 MV was demonstrated. The cooler was operated with electron current up to 0.5 A.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2014/talks/tuca01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2014/papers/tuca01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2014/posters/tuca01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2014-TUCA01,14

Kuznetsov Plasma Physics Reports; 2014; Vol. 40; No. 8; pp. 611–622.,,The process of electron trapping by a wake wave excited by a laser pulse in a plasma channel in the case where the electron bunches are injected into the vicinity of the maximum of the wakefield potential at a velocity lower than the wave phase velocity is investigated analytically and numerically*. The mechanism for the formation of a compact electron bunch in the trapping region when only the electrons of the injected bunch that are trapped in the focusing phase mainly undergo the subsequent acceleration in the wake field is analyzed. The influence of the spatial dimensions of the injected bunch and its energy spread on the length of the trapped electron bunch and the fraction of trapped electrons is studied.

A Lagrange function for this motion is constructed and the Lagrange equation describing longitudinal envelopes of the bunch is derived. The obtained equation describes longitudinal envelopes of a bunch of charged particles. It is advantageous to the well-known equations of envelopes; primarily; in being simple. Additional advantages are as follows. First; the solutions of equation determine not only the longitudinal size of a bunch; but also the width of its energy spectrum. Second; the equation has been derived without any restrictions imposed on the bunch length (phase space dimension); so that the model is nonlinear and; hence; more general. Third; the equation takes into account the acceleration of a bunch.

Superconductivity allow to solve at once some problems concerned with a low rate of energy gain; high length; higher capacity losses and higher cost of the proton linear accelerator subsequently. One of the traditional aims of such facilities is receiving of the beam energy about 240 MeV with possibility of fluently regulation in range from 150 to 240 MeV that responds to irradiate the tumors located at different depth. The possibility of beam energy variation by means of RF field phase in last resonators and number of the resonator turn-off becomes the major advantage of the proton SC linac.

Two matching parts placed on the linear accelerator structure were used. The data of the transverse phase space parameters depending on the focusing structure of the isotope complex transport line were calculated at the point before the dipole of isotope line rejection.

Synchro-cyclotron many years works for obtaining the protons with the energy 680 MeV and with the intensity of extracted beam 2.5 mkA. For the solution of medical problems the required energy of protons comprises not more than 250 MeV and depends on the depth of the tumor arrangement inside a patient. For determining the required energy of protons the information about the mean free path of protons in the correspondence for the position of Bragg's peak in each case is used. Necessary energy of protons is obtained by means of degrader system providing a retarding the extracted beam of protons with 680 MeV to 250 MeV and less. In this case the utilized for medical purposes intensity of beam does not exceed 50 nA. The proposed cyclotron F250 will make it possible to strongly decrease the electric power of magnet and to avoid the need of beam degradation from 680 MeV to 250 MeV.

Using the horizontal type of klystrons will significantly reduce construction costs of XFEL tunnel; but due to the large weights and dimensions of the pulse transformers and klystrons requires far more complicated mechanism to connect the klystrons and the pulse transformers inside the tunnel. It was proposed to make these connections by using flexible HV cable. BINP has developed an intermediate oil tank; connection module (CM); which on one side is connected to the cathode of klystron and on the other side has a HV connector for the connection to the pulse transformer. The connection module mechanically consists of two assemblies. The first is the oil tank that has inside an insulated filament transformer and measurement system. The second is the high frequency power supply unit (HFPS) what can be up to 20 meters away from the oil tank.

The reduction of radium by photonuclear transmutation by bombarding Ra-226 with high-energy photons from a medical linac has been investigated. A linac dose of 2800 Gy produced about 50 mCi of Ra-225; which decays to Ac-225; and can then be used for ‘Targeted Alpha Therapy’ (TAT) of cancer. This result; while consistent with theoretical calculations; is far too low to be of practical use. The increasing application of Ac-225 for cancer therapy indicates the potential need for its increased production and availability. This presentation investigates the production of Ac-225 in commercial quantities; which could potentially reduce obsolete radioactive material; and displace the need for expensive importation of Ac-225 from the USA in the years ahead. Scaled up production of Ac-225 could be achieved by the use of a high current cyclotron or high-power linac.

At the present time 47 hospital-based multi-cabin proton and 7 ion (mainly; carbon ions are used) centers are operating in the world. About the same number of centers are under construction. It is a common feeling that the hadron therapy is a very effective and often choiceless method of the radiation therapy. The main physicotechnical; already established solutions of the multi-cabin clinical centers construction are discussed; including the used accelerators; the radiation units types; the used environment; IT; etc. In this report the current problems and trends of hardware and technologies development for this treatment method are presented; including proposals to use new types of accelerators; to create one-cabin centers (one accelerator – one treatment unit); procedures how to solve economical problems of this rather expensive treatment method and so on. The 45-ys history of the proton therapy in Russia is briefly recounted; the great contribution of Russian investigators to the problem; and also the existing situation with the implementation of this radiation treatment method into the public health care in our country.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2014/talks/weca03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2014/papers/weca03.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2014/posters/weca03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2014-WECA03,

The JINR-IBA collaboration has developed and constructed the C235-V3 cyclotron for Dimitrovgrad hospital center of the proton therapy. Proton transmission in C235-V3 from radius 0.3m to 1.03 m is 72% without beam cutting diaphragms; the extraction efficiency is 62%. The main advantage of this cyclotron in comparison with serial commercial cyclotrons of IBA is related to higher current of the extracted beam. The cancer treatment is realized in JINR on the phasotron proton beam. More than 1000 patients were treated there. A project of the demonstration center of the proton therapy is discussed on base of a superconducting 250 MeV synchrocyclotron. The superconducting synchrocyclotron is planned to install instead of phasotron in Medical Technical Complex of DLNP. The project of the medical carbon synchrotron together with superconducting gantry was developed in JINR. The basis of this medical accelerator is the superconducting JINR synchrotron – Nuclotron.

To realize this task pylons with the holes on its end walls are used in many cases. During applying this technique in case of cavities with low number of periods it was mentioned that the best value of the field flatness was obtained in case of zero gap between end walls of the resonator and the pylon. It means that each pylon has got the electrical contact with one of the end walls of the resonator. For such cavity geometry magnetic field distribution differs from the classical H – resonator: it transforms in one common magnetic flux like in split-coaxial cavities. The analysis of such structures was performed for two types of H-mode resonators: Cross bar H-mode (CH) resonators with working frequency 324MHz and Interdigital H-mode (IH) resonators with working frequency 162MHz. All types of resonators work on the pi-mode and have 9 accelerating gaps.

The main goal was to get the uniform accelerating field distribution and to optimize effective shunt impedance. The initial model of the 324 MHz cavity consists of 7 equidistant RF gaps with the period length 46.26 mm. To optimize its electrodynamic characteristics the design contains pylons. Solution of the tuning task consists of several steps. Firstly it was chosen the optimal relation between the holding rod length and the pylon's height. Then the most significant improvement on the E-field distribution was introduced by optimizing the gap between end walls of the resonator and the pylon. The final adjustment of the field distribution and the tuning to the working frequency was performed by means of the holes in the pylon. Correct geometry increases effective shunt impedance from 55 MOhm/m to 80 MOhm/m and improves the field flatness to the 97%.

The aim of this abstract is to present some recent achievements in the field of chemical element imaging of biological samples using ion beam micro-analysis. In the present work the potential of high-resolution RBS for detection of trace elements in an organic compound was tested. The main advantage of using RBS is that relative and absolute concentrations of present elements can be determined with very high accuracy. This study revealed the accumulation sites of micro- and macronutrients in seeds. Two selected examples of PIXE microanalysis in ecophysiology are presented. Studies of heavy metal distributions in seeds showed different filtration mechanisms of Zn/Pb and Fe/Mn; both enabling plants to cope with metals present in the environment.*; * A. Lagutin.

Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute; Moscow; Russia; The accuracy of dose calculations is of fundamental importance in treatment planning of radiation therapy. The dose distributions must be calculated and verified by an accurate algorithm. The Monte Carlo simulation (statistical method; based on random sampling) of radiation transport is the only method that makes it possible to perform high-precision dose calculations in the case of a complex geometry. The main bottleneck for the application of this method in practical planning of radiation therapy is the lack of a general virtual source model of the accelerator radiation source. There are several approaches that have been described in the literature*. The goal of this work is to build a source model; based on histogram distributions; to represent the 6 MV photon beams from the Cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery system** for Monte Carlo treatment planning dose calculations. The transport of particles in treatment head of Cyberknife was simulated. Energy; radial and angular distributions were calculated. Source model was created on the base of the cumulative histograms. This approach provides producing an unlimited number of particles for the next dosimetric planning. Results of source modelling were verified in comparison with full-scale simulation without model. Good agreement was shown with calculations using the source model of the linear accelerator treatment head.; *Chetty I.J. et al. Report of the AAPM Task Group No. 105// Med.

It depends greatly on horizontal emittance of an electron beam. That's why all modern SR light sources have designed emittance of several nanometers. A horizontal emittance of Siberia-2 now equals to 98 nm. It can be decreased by two ways. First way is to find another working point (betatron tunes) with lower emittance. Maximal possible current values of existing power supplies must be taken into account. Injection efficiency may become worse because of smaller dynamic aperture due to stronger sextupoles. Second way is to rebuild magnetic structure keeping the same betatron tunes. Advantages of this method are good injection efficiency and proved energy ramping process. Modification of the magnetic structure may be done at high energy with more stable electron beam. But the second way is not allowed to reach as lower emittance level as in the first way. Theoretical and practical aspects of these two ways are described in the report. Magnetic structures with dispersion-free straight sections and smooth horizontal dispersion function are presented.

For example; in heavy ions accelerators phase difference between high frequency accelerating voltage and first harmonics of beam signal has to be measured. In this case phase measurement is complicated due to fast changing of signals frequency and amplitude. This task can be easy solved if both signals are converted in digital form and processed in FPGA. Fast phase difference meter for frequency range 0.2-6 MHz is described in this paper. The device provides phase difference measurements with measurement time ~17 microseconds and error less than 1 Degree. Signals frequency can be changed with speed up to 20 MHz/sec; signal amplitude can be changed with speed up to 40 dB/sec. A key procedure of phase meter operation is forming of two orthogonal signals on base of reference signal. During quadrature detecting the signal integration for the time equaled the integer number of signal periods is performed. It allows effectively suppress high signal harmonics. Analog electronics contains programmable gain amplifier with gain range 22-50 dB and can work in wide range of signal amplitude.

The monitor operation is based on detection of the Cherenkov radiation generated in optical fiber by means of relativistic particles created in electromagnetic shower after highly relativistic beam particles (electrons or positrons) hit the vacuum pipe. The main advantage of the distributed monitor compared to local ones is that a long optical fiber section can be used instead of a large number of local beam loss monitors. In our experiments the Cherenkov light was detected by photomultiplier tube (PMT). Timing of PMT signal gives the location of the beam loss. In the experiment with 20 m long optical fiber we achieved 3 m spatial resolution. To improve spatial resolution optimization and selection process of optical fiber and PMT are needed and according to our theoretical estimations 0.5 m spatial resolution can be achieved.

PIC code SUMA* used for computer simulation of ionization and knock on processes and there influence on deuteron beam parameters. When deuteron and ionized particles space charge self-field forces become the same order of magnitude as external one; virtual cathode may occurs. It is happens because of injected from ion source deuterons cannot overcome their own space charge potential wall and move in transverse direction. However; electrons; produced by ionization; are trapped within the deuteron beam space charge potential wall and decrease it significantly. Thus; space charge neutralization of deuteron beams by electrons; may considerably increase target current and; as a result; output neutron flow. Moreover; own longitudinal electric field rise near the target leads to reduction of accelerating electrode – target potential wall; which was made to prevent knock on emission from the target. As a result; additional knocked on electrons may appear in the region and should be taken into account. The data obtained were compared with experimental results.; * A.N. Didenko; V.I.

The investigations have been undertaken with the use of code KARAT** for the two-dimensional time-dependant regime. The limiting currents of each component for the real geometry of acceleration gap have been determined. The differences between the values of these currents and those determined with the use of the Child-Langmuir equation have been demonstrated. The analysis of dynamics of plasma emitter in the gap has been performed by the example of accelerating voltage of 120 kV and pulse duration of 1.2 mks. It has been shown that the value of the current incoming in the gap from the ions source can differ strongly from the current value at the target. For increasing of this value the partitioning of acceleration gap with the use of conductive grid which is transparent for beam and has several geometric configurations has been proposed. The ring configuration of the emitter has been considered for the same purposes. The calculations have shown that the combination of these two methods described above can allow transporting deuterons current from the anode grid to the target without losses.; * E.P.Bogolubov; V.I.Ryzhkov; D.I.Yurkov. Conference ""PNG and Technologies on Their Basis""; 2013; p.14.  ** V.P.Tarakanov.
