        "put into operation in 2006",
        "according to its specifications - spectrum",
        "charge and energy of accelerated ions",
        "has the high scientific",
        "technological and educational potential. The highest possible universality both by spectrum of accelerated ions and acceleration energy and regimes was built in DC-60 heavy ion accelerator designing. The new interdisciplinary research complex based on cyclotron DC-60 makes it possible to create a highly-developed scientific-technological and educational environment in the new capital of Kazakhstan. DC-60 accelerator is a dual cyclotron",
        "which is capable of charged particles acceleration up to kinetic energies in MeV/nucleon",
        "expressed in the following relation: E = 60(zi/A)2",
        "where zi - accelerated ion charge",
        "A - atomic weight of ion. Relation (zi/A) in formula must be within the following limits: (zi/A)2 = (1/6 – 1/12)",
        "that impose constraints on charge of accelerated ions. Thus",
        "range of ions accelerated on DC-60 cyclotron is 6Li to 132Xe",
        "variation of ion energy is over the range 0.33 to 1.75 MeV/nucleon. Some results of our work carrying out on the base of DC-60 cyclotron in the field of production",

        "physics of solid state",
        "nuclear and atomic physics",
        "production of track membranes etc are given in the article. Also it will be reported about modern trends of accelerators development in Kazakhstan."
