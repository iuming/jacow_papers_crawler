      "abstract": "In this paper dynamics of processes in accelerator driven system (ADS) is considered. ADS reactor operates at subcritical level and the necessary neutron supply comes from the interaction of a charged particles beam with a heavy atom nucleus (spallation reaction). Mathematical model of dynamics of subcritical reactor controlled by linear accelerator is presented. Calculation results of transient processes in the reactor core taking into account fuel feedback. The reactor power level control is carried out through the regulation of linac current impulses frequency.",

      "abstract": "During last couple decades in Russia an interest in the electron-beam sterilization technology has been significantly renewed. The electron beam irradiation occurs at electron energies in the range from 3 up to 10 MeV with dose of 30 kGy. A special research interest is an exploring the possibility to reduce electron energy and dose characteristics upon foods irradiation.",
