        "The 2 MeV electron cooling system for COSY-Julich was proposed to further boost the luminosity in presence of strong heating effects of high-density internal targets. The 2 MeV cooler is also well suited in the start up phase of the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at FAIR in Darmstadt. It can be used for beam cooling at injection energy and for testing new features of the high energy electron cooler for HESR. The COSY cooler is designed on the classic scheme of low energy coolers like cooler CSRm",
        "CSRe",
        "LEIR that was produced in BINP before. The electron beam is transported inside the longitudinal magnetic field along whole trajectory from an electron gun to a collector. The 2 MeV electron cooler was installed in the COSY ring in the spring 2013. Electron beam commissioning and first studies using proton and deuteron beams were carried out. Electron cooling of proton beam up to 1662 MeV kinetic energy was demonstrated. Maximum electron beam energy achieved so far amounted to 1.25 MeV. Voltage up to 1.4 MV was demonstrated. The cooler was operated with electron current up to 0.5 A."

The conditions of transverse compression of the plasma bunch under the action of the rotating field and buffer gas are studied.

Mechanisms of the action of the rotating field and buffer gas on the process of positron clouds storage are presented."
