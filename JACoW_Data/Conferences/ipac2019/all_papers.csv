These novel developments are at the interface of laser; plasma and accelerator physics and may potentially lead to much more compact and economical accelerator facilities. While primarily focusing on the ability to accelerate charged particles with much larger gradients than traditional RF; these new techniques have yet to demonstrate comparable performances to RF in terms of both beam parameters or reproducibility. To guide the developments beyond the necessary basic R&D and concept validations; a common understanding and definition of required performance and beam parameters for an operational user facility is now needed. These innovative user facilities can include ""table-top"" light sources; medical accelerators; industrial accelerators or even high-energy colliders.

The RCS delivered a 500 kW beam (4.2·1013 particles per pulse (ppp)) to the Material and Life science experimental Facility (MLF) in April of 2018; The design power of 1 MW will be delivered in the next few years. Construction of a second target station (2TS) of the MLF with beam power upgraded to 1.5 MW is now under discussion. The MR delivers proton beam to a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment; T2K; by fast extraction (FX) and to the hadron experimental facility by slow extraction (SX). For the FX; the maximum beam power is 475 kW and 2.5·1014 ppp; the world highest ppp in synchrotrons; and for the SX 51 kW and 5.5·1013 ppp with an extremely high extraction efficiency of 99.5 %.

ipac2019,,MOYPLM3,Progress with the High Luminosity LHC Project at CERN,L. Rossi; O.S. Brüning; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project aims at upgrading the LHC by increasing the peak luminosity by a factor five; to allow to collect 3000 fb-1 for ATLAS and CMS experiments; each; which is ten times more than what is foreseen in the LHC. The upgrade is based on multiple factors. One factor is doubling the beam current; also thanks to the injector upgrade (LIU) project; and another one is operation in levelling mode. The most critical upgrade is the deploying of a stronger inner quadrupole triplet in the low-beta insertions with more than twice-larger aperture w.r.t. present LHC triplet; thanks to the use of Nb3Sn superconductor; a world first for accelerators; with almost 12 T peak field in the coils. The novel concept of ATS optics allows to utilise the increased aperture efficiently by generating β* values 3 to 4 times below the nominal values of the LHC. We will make use of compact crab cavities for hadrons (also a novelty in accelerators) to allow almost head-on collisions despite the larger crossing angle. We are developing new collimator insertions in the dispersion suppressor region to handle the losses in the cold part of the machine (the beam halo stores 30 MJ) thanks to the use of a few 11 T dipoles based on Nb3Sn technology. We also aim at reducing drastically the impedance contribution of collimators by utilizing new materials and coating techniques. Many other technologies are developed for HL-LHC like new SC links of 100 kA: HL-LHC is critical as a technology turning point for HEP colliders as it is for Physics reach. The technologies developed for HL-LHC; namely (but not only) the high field superconducting magnets; are critical for the post-LHC hadron collider; like a High Energy LHC or the 100 km Future Circular Collider,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/moyplm3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/moyplm3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/moyplm3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOYPLM3,17

Colliding Zr-96 with Zr-96 and Ru-96 with Ru-96 create the same QGP but in a different magnetic field due to the different charges of the Zr (Z=40) and Ru (Z=44) ions. Since the charge difference is only 10%; the experimental program requires exacting store conditions for both ions. These systematic error concerns presented new challenges for the Collider; including frequent reconfiguration of the Collider for the different ion species; and maintaining level amounts of instantaneous and integrated luminosity between two species. Moreover; making beams of Zr-96 and Ru-96 is challenging since the natural abundances of these isotopes are low.

The Low Emittance Muon Accelerator (LEMMA) concept *; ** presents in this paper an upgraded layout of a positron driven muon source. The positron beam; stored in a ring with high energy acceptance and low emittance; is extracted and driven in a push-pull configuration to a multi-target system; to produce muon pairs at threshold on the target’s electrons. This solution alleviates the issues related to the power deposited and the integrated Peak Energy Density Deposition on the targets. Muons produced in the multi-target system will then be accumulated in many parallel rings before acceleration and injection in the collider. A special multi-target line lattice has been designed to cope with the focusing of both the positron and muon beams.

This factorization is not possible for stationary charges. Contrastingly; it becomes increasingly accurate for ultra-relativistic particle beams. We give a general analysis; show how to develop the corrections in terms of integrals of F and derivatives of G.

The ALTO facility is powered by a 50 MeV/10μA linear electron accelerator dedicated to the production of radioactive beams. The production mode is based on the photo-fission process of a thick UCx target heated up to 2000°C and using the ISOL technique. For the ionization of the released fission fragments; three ion source types can be coupled to the target: Febiad ion source; surface ion source; and laser ion source. The facility can deliver the radioactive ions beams to six different experimental set-ups. The mono-charged RIB exiting from the source must be separated using a magnetic dipole in order to select a nucleus before its transmission through electrostatic devices up to the experimental set-ups. This paper is focus on the separator which was build and exploited with success since 40 years. We propose to revisit this dipole with a precise field-map calculation and particles transport simulations.

The cavities will be assembled into one cryomodule in one of the straights of the storage ring.

However; the micro-bunching instability resulting from self-interaction of the bunch with its own radiation field limits stable operation with constant intensity of CSR emission to a particular threshold current. Above this threshold; the longitudinal charge distribution and thus the emitted radiation vary rapidly and continuously. Therefore; a fast and adaptive feedback system is the appropriate approach to stabilize the dynamics and to overcome the limitations given by the instability. In this contribution; we discuss first efforts towards a longitudinal feedback design that acts on the RF system of the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator) and aims for stabilization of the emitted THz radiation. Our approach is based on methods of adaptive control that were developed in the field of reinforcement learning and have seen great success in other fields of research over the past decade.

The longitudinal dynamics of this phenomenon can be simulated by solving the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation; where the CSR self-interaction can be added as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian. This contribution particularly focuses on the comprehension of synchrotron motion in the micro-bunching instability and how it relates to the formation of the occurring micro-structures. Therefore; we adopt the perspective of a single particle and comment on its implications for collective motion.

Such a blowup is a potential obstacle to achieving and maintaining a high luminosity; therefore it needs to be carefully studied. In this paper; we present a general overview of simulation results on the FCC-ee beam-beam blowup with realistic machine errors.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW019,112

BERLinPro is a small demonstrator for ERL technology and applications. Due to the low energy of 50; resp. 32MeV; space charge plays a dominant role in the beam dynamics. Micro-bunching; due to unavoidable shot noise from the cathode in combination with space charge; is seen in the merger as well as in the recirculator. Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) can amplify this bunching; as well as micro-bunching can enhance CSR losses. With the release of OPAL 2.0** in May 2018; for the first time; an open source; highly parallel tracking code is available; that is capable of numerically calculating both effects; space charge and CSR; simultaneously.

This type of optimization is usually done by hand and relies on the experience of operators. The nature of this task is repetitive though highly complex. Besides optimizing the beam quality at the experiments this task is often accompanied by secondary objectives or requirements such as keeping the beam losses below an acceptable threshold. In the past years Deep Learning algorithms have experienced a rapid development and gave rise to various advanced software implementations which allow for straightforward usage of corresponding techniques; such as automatic differentiation and gradient backpropagation. We investigate the applicability and performance of these techniques in the field of transfer line optics optimization; specifically for the HADES beamline at GSI; in form of gradient-based differentiable simulators. We test our setup on results obtained from MADX simulations and compare our findings to different gradient-free optimization methods.

The benifits of this method are twofold. It allows to utilize sextupole for chromaticty correction at lower energy and also mitigate the beam instability at higher energy because of introducing higher chromaticity.

With harmonic cavities (HCs); the ’flat potential condition’ can be achieved; lengthening the bunch by a factor of ~5. However; the effective rf voltage seen by the beam becomes sensitive to both positions and distributions of all bunches; as the beam-induced voltage of both HCs and fundamental cavities (FCs) contribute. In addition; when there are empty buckets; the transient beam loading induces considerable variations of the rf voltage impacting the beam performance*.

It has been operated for more than 20 years. The emittance of HiSOR is 400 nm; which is larger by one or more orders of magnitude than typical modern synchrotron light sources. Therefore; as the future plan of the facility; a new low emittance storage ring is desired. Several designs have been examined. In the newest version; we have selected the lattice structure similar to ASTRID 2 compact light source in Aarhus University; Denmark. The design goal is the energy of around 500 MeV; the circumference shorter than 50 m and the emittance smaller than 10 nm with straight sections for undulators more than 4.

Spherical aberration introduces the largest distortion which is unavoidable in the case of static cylindrically symmetric electromagnetic fields on the basis of Scherzer’s theorem. In order to reduce the spherical aberrations; different models have been designed which are composed of three symmetrical lens and one asymmetrical lens.

This was observed in tracking for LEP and the Future Circular e+e- Collider (FCC-ee). Synchrotron radiation in the quadrupoles modulates the particle energy at the double betatron frequency. Energy modulation varies transverse focusing strength at the same frequency and creates a parametric resonance of the betatron oscillations with unusual properties. It occurs at arbitrary betatron frequency and the magnitude of the parameter modulation of the betatron oscillation depends on the oscillation amplitude. Equilibrium between the radiation damping and the resonant excitation gives the boundary of the stable motion.

It is very natural and more self-consistent to consider the longitudinal impedance in the beam-beam simulation.

During this RF manipulation two SPS batches; controlled by two independent RF systems; are going to be interleaved on an intermediate energy plateau; reducing the bunch spacing from 100 to 50 ns. However; there are limitations how close the frequencies of two RF systems can approach each other; resulting in a hole in the longitudinal bunch particle distribution due to the offset in energy of the recaptured bunches. After filamentation; these bunches should be further accelerated to the SPS top energy; before extraction to the LHC. Macro-particle simulations have shown that Landau damping is lost for the bunches with the smallest longitudinal emittances in the batch; causing un-damped oscillations of the bunch core after recapture. The standard application of an additional; fourth harmonic RF system; successfully used in proton operation; was not able to damp the oscillations at top energy; while it was necessary to switch it on from the moment of recapture.

In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project; the performance of the already existing HOM damping scheme for these standing wave modes must be improved.

The upgrade of the SPS includes but is not limited to: the relocation of the beam dumping system; upgrade of the RF system; replacement of the electrostatic septa and impedance reduction. These major upgrades present an opportunity to perform additional impedance reduction in areas not normally modified due to the large amount of work being performed across the accelerator complex. In this paper; we look at the impedance minimization in the sections near the large aperture quadrupoles of the extraction regions in the CERN SPS. By optimizing the locations of existing equipment and the introduction of a new; more impedance optimised type of bellows; significant reductions in the beam-coupling impedance can be achieved.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw077_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw077.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw077_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW077,277

Their thresholds can be accurately obtained from macro-particle simulations using the detailed impedance model containing many different contributions. This method; however; is very difficult to apply for synchrotrons with a large number of bunches; as it is the case for the Future Circular hadron-hadron Collider (FCC-hh) with up to 10400 circulating bunches per beam. In this paper the semi-analytical approach is used for calculations of the instability thresholds during the acceleration cycle of the FCC-hh. As the result; we define requirements for the HOM damping that would be sufficient to prevent development of longitudinal CBI in the presence of weak synchrotron radiation damping.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw083_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw083.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw083_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW083,297
ipac2019,,MOPGW084,Beam Loading Compensation for the Future Circular Hadron-Hadron Collider (FCC-hh),I. Karpov; P. Baudrenghien; CERN; Meyrin; Switzerland; The power consumption of the rf system can be minimised by optimising the cavity detuning and the loaded quality factor. In high-current accelerators; the presence of gaps in the filling results in a modulation of the cavity voltage along the ring (transient beam loading) and as a consequence a spread in the bunch parameters. In addition longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities can appear; caused by the cavity impedance at the fundamental. Both issues can be mitigated by using an rf feedback around the amplifier and cavity; a technique used in many high intensity machines including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Compared to the LHC machine; the energy increase and the radiation loss for the Future Circular hadron-hadron Collider (FCC-hh) will be larger; resulting in a synchronous phase deviating significantly from 180 degrees. The solutions adopted for the LHC must therefore be revisited.

ipac2019,,MOPGW088,"A Two-Mode Model to Study the Effect of Space Charge on TMCI in the ""Long-Bunch"" Regime",CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Using a two-mode approach for the Transverse Mode-Coupling Instability (TMCI) in the ’short-bunch’ regime (where the mode-coupling takes place between the modes 0 and -1; such as in the CERN LHC); both a reactive damper (ReaD) and Space Charge (SC) are expected to be beneficial: the ReaD would shift the mode 0 up while SC would shift the mode -1 down; but in both cases the coupling (and related instability) would occur at higher intensities. However; the situation is more involved in the ’long-bunch’ regime (where the mode-coupling takes place between higher-order modes; such as in the CERN SPS). As the ReaD modifies only the (main) mode 0 and not the others; it is expected to have no effect for the main mode-coupling. As concerns SC; it modifies all the modes except the mode 0; and the result has been a subject of discussion for two decades. A two-mode approach is discussed in detail in this contribution for the case of a single bunch interacting with a broad-band resonator impedance in the ’long-bunch’ regime.

In this contribution we propose a method to control and correct misalignments during the process of the beam optics design. These misalignments would result from overlapping fringe fields of different field maps. The 3D field maps are obtained from the software for electromagnetic calculations OPERA. The full 3D map is saved in the tracking coordinate system and a ROOT (An Object Oriented Data Analysis Framework) ntuple is then created for analysis. The trajectory of the reference particle is calculated by means of OPAL - open source code developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). The transverse magnetic field profiles allow possible misalignments to be precisely determined and the corresponding corrections to be calculated. Moreover; the multipole content in discrete locations along the lattice can be controlled by performing a polynomial fit; which calculates the magnetic field harmonics with respect to the reference track. This method was used at PSI for a design of a model of the magnetic lattice for a superconducting gantry for proton therapy with a large momentum acceptance.,,*An Object Oriented Data Analysis Framework - http://root.cern.ch reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw090_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw090.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw090_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW090,324

Two contributions to these losses are investigated in this paper. The first losses occur during the PS-to-SPS bunch-to-bucket transfer; since the bunch rotation in the PS creates halo particles and the bunch does not completely fit into the SPS RF-bucket. The effect of longitudinal shaving in the PS on the beam transmission was recently tested. At high intensities; further capture losses are caused by beam loading in the traveling wave RF system of the SPS; which is partially compensated by the LLRF system; in particular by one-turn delay feedback. While the feedforward system reduces the capture losses; it also increases the losses along the flat bottom due to the RF noise.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw091_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw091.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw091_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW091,327

Especially in the early-commissioning phase this can render procedures successfully used in the commissioning of existing third-generation light sources ill-suited for the application to these new machines. In this contribution we discuss an iterative approach to the early trajectory correction; based on the well-known pseudo-inversion of a trajectory-response matrix. Measuring this matrix during early commissioning can be cumbersome; so that an algorithm working with the model response matrix of the lattice is desirable. We discuss the stability of the iteration in the presence of lattice errors; resulting in differences between the actual and the model response matrix.

Calculations based on linear transfer matrix formalism show that longitudinal stability exists for both SR mode and ERL mode in two energy storage rings.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw104_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw104.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw104_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW104,364

In modern ring-based accelerators; optics corrections are determined from repetitive measurements which help identify systematic and random quadrupole errors in presence of various measurement noises. This process is a multivariate nonlinear regression problem driven by either a completed lattice model or a Jacobian matrix. Starting from the Bayes’ theorem; ’likelihood functions’ and ’prior probability’ distributions are extracted from a complete linear optics model. Under some assumptions; the least square algorithm and then the Jacobian matrix approach can be re-derived. The coherence of the correction algorithm is ensured through specifying a self-consistent regularization coefficient to prevent overfitting. Optimal weights for different correction objectives are obtained based on their measurement noise level. A new technique has been developed to resolve degenerated quadrupole errors when observed at a few select BPMs. A necessary condition of being distinguishable is that their optics response vectors seen at these specific BPMs should be near-orthogonal.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw114_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw114.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw114_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW114,390

The emittance can be further reduced to around 200 pm rad with damping wigglers. Various design concepts used in modern 4th-generation light sources; such as adopting longitudinal gradient dipoles and anti-bend scheme; are incorporated into the design as well.

While SR in the far field has been well characterized; the near-field SR and its impacts on self-consistent electron beam dynamics remain an ongoing topic. Since it is difficult to experimentally characterize the near fields; it is desirable to develop accurate and efficient numerical methods for the design of these light sources. Here; we investigate a novel method; originally proposed by Shintake and which potentially has both high efficiency and accuracy. We focus on the field calculation of this method and show that the original idea has missed the important terms of fields due to electron acceleration and therefore only applies to a linear motion. To correct this limitation we developed a modified algorithm that gives consistent fields with direct calculations using the Liénard-Wiechert equation. Some basic signatures of the near-field SR fields are also drawn for a cyclotron motion by using this modified approach.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopgw116_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopgw116.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopgw116_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPGW116,397

Minimization of the impedance is an essential part of the vacuum chamber design for any new accelerator project. The impedance can be estimated experimentally by measuring beam dynamics effects caused by the beam-impedance interaction. Experience obtained at many accelerator facilities shows the beam-based measurements are often different from the pre-computed impedance budgets; the discrepancy of a factor of two or even more is not unusual.

This is the first time that beam dynamics have been kept under precise control while the beam crosses a half-integer resonance.

The electron beam from a low-emittance RF gun is accelerated by an S-band linac up to 6 GeV. A damping ring at 1.54 GeV is required for emittance cooling of the positron beam. The intermediate energy step from the exit of the S-band linac at 6 GeV to the 20 GeV injection energy of the top-up booster can be provided by the modified Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS); serving as a pre-booster ring (PBR). An alternative option to reach 20 GeV energy would be to extend the S-band linac with a C- or X-band linac. An overall cost optimisation will determine the choice of the final configuration. Beam loss and emittance dilution in the linac due to space charge effects; wakefields; and misalignment of accelerator components can be mitigated by RF phasing and orbit steering. Start-to-end simulations examine the beam transport through the linac up to either 6 GeV or 20 GeV. The results indicate large design margins.

To obtain an enough luminosity; eg. 1.0·10+34 cm-2sec-1; the beam is focused down to nano-meter size with a high aspect ratio. This super flat beam is useful to improve the luminosity and to compensate the beam-beam effect; eg. Beamstrahlung. In a conventional design; the super-flat beam is produced by radiation damping in a storage ring. We propose to produce this super-flat beam with phase-space rotation techniques. We employ both Round to Flat Beam Transformation and Transverse to Longitudinal Emittance eXchange; the super flat beam can be generated by controlling the space-charge effect which spoiled the performance.

A dedicated threshold scan in the vicinity of 350 GeV is envisioned with a total integrated luminosity of 100 fb-1.

The correction is performed using correctors distributed along the accelerator; based on the beam position monitor (BPM) readout from the preceding bunch train; with a train repetition frequency of 50 Hz.

The optimisation of the number N of correctors; the algorithm’s gain and the corrector step size is described; and the impact of a number of BPMs and correctors becoming unavailable is addressed.

For the FCC-ee at 62.5 GeV beam energy; we optimize the IP optics and beam parameters; considering these two different assumptions for the vertical emittance. We derive the maximum achievable luminosity as a function of collision energy spread for either case.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopmp035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopmp035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopmp035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPMP035,516

In preparation for the final design to be employed in the LHC; a series of tests were conducted on prototype crab cavities installed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. This paper summarizes the machine protection requirements and observations during the first tests of crab cavities with proton beams in the SPS.

By overcoming current limits of conventional accelerators and pushing particles to larger and larger energies; the availability of strong and tunable focusing optics is mandatory also because plasma-accelerated beams usually have large angular divergences. In this regard; active-plasma lenses represent a compact and affordable tool to generate radially symmetric magnetic fields several orders of magnitude larger than conventional quadrupoles and solenoids. However; it has been recently proved that the focusing can be highly nonlinear and induce a dramatic emittance growth. Here; we present experimental results showing how these nonlinearities can be minimized and lensing improved.

The initial phase space of the muon beam is extremely large. In general; two types of muon collection methods have been used in the world. One is to put the muon production target in a superconducting solenoid; and low-energy muons are collected from the back of the target; then transported through a bent solenoid. In this way; a high-intensity muon beam can be collected; but the energy spread is wide and the beam polarization is low. For most muSR applications a surface muon beam with narrow energy bite and high polarization is required. Most muSR facilities are built with collecting magnets by the side of the target; in this way only a small fraction of muons with low emittance are collected and transported downstream. In this work we outline a muon collection method based on superconducting solenoid. Instead of using bent solenoids; a matching section with a dipole magnet is used to select muons with a certain momentum and match to downstream beamliines. A high-quality muon beam can be achieved with a high intensity and polarization. Such a method can be adapted to the MUSIC; Mu2e; and COMET muon beamlines after their dedicate experiments and convert the beamlines into a high quality muSR facility.,Funding: This work is supported by the Science Foundation of The Chinese Academy of Sciences and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11875281),reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/moprb026_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/moprb026.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/moprb026_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPRB026,630

Several heavy-ion runs have been performed since the start-up of the LHC. These runs are challenging for collimation; despite lower intensities; because of the degraded cleaning observed compared to protons. This is due to the differences of the interaction mechanisms in the collimators. Ions experience fragmentation and electromagnetic dissociation that result in a substantial flux of off-rigidity particles that escape the collimation system. In this paper; the collimation system performance and the experience gained during the 2018 Pb ion run are presented.

Especially the dynamics of the excited matter can be probed with the help of X-ray pulses at a free electron laser facility; e.g. SwissFEL; to deepen our understanding of a wide range of phenomena. Due to its high research potential; various means of THz generation have been proposed and demonstrated. We investigate preliminarily here its generation based on a relativistic electron bunch and a photonic band gap crystal (PBG) made of dielectric rods. The PBG provides additional degrees of freedom for the THz pulse tuning. Additionally; the unwanted radiation parts can be damped by the structure in order to minimize the deleterious beam dynamics effects.

This paper provides an another approach to alleviating the heavy beam loading effects on machine operation. Different from the direct RF feedback technique; this approach need not add additional feedback loop to the existed RF feedback system. Applying a proper angle rotation to the I-Q error signals of the cavity voltage; before entering the existed feedback loop; is the only action required in this approach.

In 2018; the LHC accelerated and stored partially stripped 208-Pb-81+ ions for the first time. The collimation system efficiency recorded during this test was found to be prohibitively low. The worst losses were localised in the dispersion suppressor (DS) of the betatron-cleaning insertion. Analytic arguments and simulations show that the large losses are driven by the stripping of the remaining electron from the Pb nucleus by the primary collimators. The rising dispersion in the DS pushes the resulting off-rigidity; fully-stripped ions into the aperture of the superconducting magnets. In this study the measured loss maps are compared against results from simulations. Different mitigation strategies are outlined; including a dispersion suppressor (DS) collimator; crystal collimation or an orbit bump.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/moprb058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/moprb058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/moprb058_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPRB058,700

The FFA arc consists of identical doublets that are designed to have an energy acceptance from 42 to 150 MeV; with a betatron phase advance (i.e.; tune) per cell and periodic orbit position that depends on energy. In the CBETA fractional arc test; we transport the beam through 4 such cells (the first girder); and are capable of injecting beam in to the arc with energies as high as 59 MeV. By creating betatron oscillations in the arc; we can compute the phase advance per cell and periodic orbit position as a function of energy within that range.

In our initial design the electron and hadron magnets were staggered so their respective cold masses did not overlap; however; this restricts the longitudinal space for the first hadron quadrupole and led to the challenge of making a high-field Nb3Sn main coil structure fit inside limited radial space within an external field active shield coil. In our new layout the crossing angle increased from 22 to 25 mrad and the electron and hadron cold masses are now side-by-side. This layout allows longer magnetic lengths for reducing the coil peak fields; NbTi conductor can now be used everywhere. Of course we must take care to control magnetic cross talk between neighboring apertures. One trick we will use to accomplish this is to maximize the yoke material thickness between the beams by tapering (i.e. change coil radius as a function of longitudinal position) some of the electron coils.

ipac2019,,MOPRB105,Measurement and Analysis of Beam Phase-space Distributions for the Fermilab Muon Campus accelerator complex,University of Houston; Houston; Texas; USA; Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab is tasked with measuring the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment with high precision. Since the experiment requires large amounts of muons; it is imperative to systematically study the behavior of the beam along the transport line. Unfortunately; the available diagnostics only provide beam information in X-Y space. For a complete evaluation; information of the phase-space is required. This paper demonstrates a technique to measure the beam phase-space distribution by using a set of beam profiles. First; we establish the theoretical framework that describes the principle of the technique. Next; we apply the technique at four different locations along the accelerator delivery line. Finally; we compare our findings to predictions from tracking simulations. Our results indicate that the beam phase-space volume is conserved; along the beam delivery line; suggesting minimal loses and linear transport as expected by design. Compared to the simulations; there is good agreement in both horizontal and vertical plane with the former being at the 4% level while the latter being in the 15% level. Our proposed technique is expected to provide a promising approach for optimizing injection and thereby improving the performance of the Muon g-2 Experiment.,,D. Stratakispresenter reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/moprb105_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/moprb105.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/moprb105_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPRB105,810

Typically; a foil strips the hydrogen ion beam to facilitate charge-exchange injection of protons into orbits of high energy accelerators; in which the resulting emittance is dominated by phase-space painting. In this paper; a new method to laser extract a narrow beam of neutralised hydrogen from the parent H− ion beam is proposed. Subsequent foil stripping and capture of protons into a storage ring generates cool proton bunches with significantly reduced emittance compared to the parent beam. The properties of the extracted proton beam can be precisely controlled and sculpted by adjusting the optical parameters of the laser beam. Recirculation of the parent beam allows time for space-charge effects to repopulate the emittance phase space prior to repeated laser extraction. We present particle tracking simulations of the proposed scheme; including the laser-particle interaction with realistic optical parameters and show the resulting emittance is reduced. Developments for an experimental demonstration of a laser controlled particle beam are outlined.

The method has been applied to an electric field map of a DTL cavity with 11 m in length comprising 55 rf-gaps. The original field map data of 220 MB was converted into practically noise-free data of just 20 KB. Noise was reduced by 95% as demonstrated using a cubic cavity for which the analytical field map is available.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopts016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopts016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopts016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPTS016,875

Compact accelerator-based neutron sources (CANS) could close this gap. The High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) currently under development at Forschungszentrum Jülich is scalable in terms of beam energy and power due to its modular design. The driver Linac for HBS at will accelerate a 100 mA proton beam to 70 MeV. The Linac is operated with a beam duty cycle of up to 6% (11% RF duty cycle) and can simultaneously deliver three proton pulse lengths (384 Hz@52 mu-s; 96 Hz@208 mu-s and 24 Hz@832 mu-s) for three neutron production targets. In order to minimize the development effort and the technological risk; state-of-the-art technology of the MYRRHA injector is used. The front end of the HBS Linac consists of an ECR source; LEBT and a 2.5 MeV RFQ followed by a CH-DTL with 35 room temperature CH-cavities. All RF structures are operated at 176.1 MHz and are designed for high duty cycle. Solid-state amplifiers up to 500 kW are used as RF drivers. Due to the beam current and the high average beam power of up to 420 kW; particular attention is paid to beam dynamics. In order to minimize losses; a quasi-periodic lattice with constant negative phase is used.

The unmodulated Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. It accepted 3 times the operating power of which is needed in operation**. That level corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 µs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project. This particular high frequency for a 4-ROD-RFQ creates difficulties, which triggered the development of a Ladder-RFQ with its high symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is very well suited for that frequency. The duty cycle is up to 5% for the applied cooling concept.

This signifies a major milestone for the mission of GSI and FAIR. On one hand; the scientific program of GSI depends strongly on beam from SIS18; including the very important developments of detectors for FAIR experiments. On the other hand; large parts of the existing GSI accelerator facility; including SIS18; are now operated with the FAIR control system; demonstrating its suitability for control of a large scale accelerator facility. Commissioning of the new control system started during the shutdown with a series of dry runs; which proved very useful to establish the basic functionalities. Recommissioning of SIS18 was further facilitated by the fact that the machine model of SIS18; implemented in the modeling framework LSA; had already been tested with beam several years before the shutdown. Thus; all operation modes of SIS18; including multi-turn injection; electron cooling; as well as fast and slow extraction could be successfully commissioned during the first weeks of operation. Other commissioning activities concerned the operation of new devices installed during the shutdown. These devices; mostly installed to prepare SIS18 for the operation with FAIR design parameters; open new possibilities in the standard operation of SIS18. A challenge for the operation of SIS18 is posed by ground motion due to ground water lowering for the nearby FAIR construction site. Surveys revealed that SIS18 subsided by several centimeters during one year. Even though the machine was realigned prior to recommissioning; the dynamics of the ground motion will continue to affect operation of SIS18.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopts035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopts035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopts035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPTS035,932

Front-to-end simulations demonstrated that the new design meets the FAIR targets. Implementation of the new electrodes; initially planned for 2019; will require re-adaption of the RFQ cavity rf-parameters by re-shaping the stems that keep the electrodes. However; during the beam time 2018 the existing RFQ did not reach its nominal voltage most likely due to expired lifetime of the electrodes originating from 2009. In order to shorten the RFQ maintenance period and to minimize any risk for upcoming beam time 2019; it was decided to post-pone the implementation of the new design and rather just re-producing the 2009 design electrodes. This contribution is on the re-production process as short-term solution and on the full implementation of the new design as mid-term solution.

Since then; the ACS cavities have been stably running. Although any serious problem induced by the ACS RF window has not yet observed; we decided to replace the RF window of one ACS cavity; which is the eighteenth accelerating cavity in the order of beam energy (ACS18); by the newly manufactured one. The major motivations of the replacement are to check the surface condition of the RF window which have been under operation for nearly five years and to confirm the availability of the newly manufactured RF window. By making use of the summer maintenance period of 2018; we carried out the replacement. This was the first experience for us to replace the RF window installed to the ACS cavity in the linac accelerator tunnel. As for the removed RF window; there was no any abnormal warning found with the visual examination. At the starting up of the cavity’s operation after the maintenance period; we investigated how much time would be required for an RF conditioning. It took around fifty hours so that the peak RF power including the beam loading is stably input to the cavity through the new RF window.

To adjust the VSWR of the ACS21; we designed and fabricated a rectangular waveguide with a capacitive iris which conduces to a better matching between the cavity and the waveguide. In the 2018 summer maintenance period; we installed the newly fabricated waveguide to the ACS21 in the position between the input coupler and the RF window.

It will accelerate 50mA CW deutron beam from 50keV to 1MeV at 162.5MHz. The novel structure of four-vane with window was used to seperate the dipole mode from the working mode. The field tuning of this RFQ was different from conventional four vane RFQ because that the four quadrants of RFQ cavity were coupled. The discipline of field tuning was studied by simulation and experiment. The beam dynamics of the RFQ was designed by equipartation and matching method; limit current effect was considered at the same time.

The PSB will need to deliver two times the current brightness after the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) in order to meet the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) beam requirements. At the current injection energy a large incoherent space charge tune spread limits the brightness of the beams; which is one of the main motivations to increase the injection energy to 160 MeV with the injection provided by Linac4; a new H− linear accelerator. The higher injection energy will allow doubling the beam intensity while maintaining a space charge tune spread similar to current values. The degradation of the beam brightness due to the tune spread can be minimized with a proper choice of working point and an efficient compensation of resonances.

In the past year; it has been continuously providing beam during a test run to assess its reliability in view of the connection to the LHC injector chain. The target reliability of more than 90% has been demonstrated during the accumulated nine months of run in 2017 and 2018. The beam quality at 160 MeV is suitable for producing all beams for the CERN physics program of today. Nevertheless; the limited peak current of 30mA might be a limitation for future high intensity programs. The bottleneck has been identified at the low energy end of the accelerator. In the meantime; beam extraction and low energy beam transport studies are ongoing at a dedicated test stand with the goal to reach beam currents from the pre-injector up to 45 mA.

The Hollow Electron Lens (HEL) is a promising system to control the beam halo. It improves the beam collimation system of the HL-LHC and mitigates possible equipment damage in case of failure scenarios from halo losses. The halo can store up to 30 MJ energy. The specifications for this new device are quite demanding. The source; an electron gun with an annular shaped cathode; has to deliver a current up to 5 A. This is five times higher than the current in the existing electron lenses in Fermi and Brookhaven national laboratories. This note describes the programme carried out to design and test high-perveance guns equipped with two types of high-performance scandate cathodes. The size of the final gun is now considerably smaller than the one of the first prototype; allowing a reduction of diameter and cost of the superconducting magnet system used to steer the electron beam.

In recent years; this topic has been of particular interest for the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project; where a tight transverse emittance blow-up budget between the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) and the Proton Synchrotron (PS) is imposed to assure the required beam brightness for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In order to maintain a high brightness beam; any source of emittance blow-up along the PSB cycle needs to be identified and mitigated. While wire scanners have been mostly used at extraction energy in the PSB; they can also operate along the energy cycle. The scattering of the protons with the wire increases considerably at lower energies; leading to an overestimation of the beam emittance.

Then A 5.2 m S-band linac accelerates the electron beam and compresses the beam by velocity bunching. Since the beam emittance will grow during the velocity bunching process; a solenoid system was installed to reduce the emmitance growth.

Generating a barrier bucket to deplete the longitudinal line density of the coasting beam during the kicker rise time can reduce these losses. Beam tests have been performed with an existing Finemet cavity in the PS; which is normally operated as a wideband feedback kicker. To drive the cavity; a beam synchronous waveform synthesizer based on programmable logic has been developed. It produces a pre-distorted signal which ideally results in a single period sinusoidal voltage pulse with programmable parameters at the gap of the cavity; once or multiple times per revolution. The modelling of the behavior of the power amplifier and the cavity is essential to achieve an anti-symmetric voltage pulse with little pre- and post-pulse ripple.

This mode of interleaving operation of RG2 and PCG beams through the APS linac requires some modifications/additions to several systems of the linac; including RF; magnets; controls and Access Control Interlock System etc. In this paper we report our interleaving design and present the commissioning results of the two beam interleaving operation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/mopts119_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/mopts119.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/mopts119_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-MOPTS119,

However; measurements in the 1980’s and 1990’s proved very disappointing and it was believed that practical limits due to grain boundaries prevented Nb3Sn from achieving its full potential. Only recently (around 2013) has use of the material for accelerator applications been re-visited. Significant progress has been made in the last several years with demonstrated performance reaching levels where implementing Nb3Sn in accelerator applications should be considered.

Now there is growing interest in applying accelerator technology to solve the grand challenges in probing matter at ultrafast temporal and ultrasmall spatial scales. In this talk I will discuss how one can use MeV electrons produced in accelerators to study ultrafast dynamics at atomic scale through ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy techniques. This is made possible with the recent progress both in ultrafast lasers and in the generation and control of high-brightness electron beams used in modern accelerators. I will focus on advanced techniques such as THz streaking and THz compression that may push the resolution to the attosecond regime. Complementary to x-ray FELs; such facility is expected to enable access to new sciences by giving researchers unparalleled power and precision in examining the fundamental nature of matter.

This recently changed; when an R&D study at Fermilab showed that thermal gradients over the surface of the cavity can expel flux from the superconducting material. Further R&D studies showed that the expulsion behavior also depended strongly on the high temperature heat treatment of the cavity. These studies were timely for LCLS-II cryomodule production; in which stringent requirements on the quality factor make trapped flux a significant problem. To minimize degradation due to trapped flux; the recommendations from the R&D program were applied to cryomodule production. This is the first implementation of several new paradigms to minimize trapped flux: fast cooldown; high temperature heat treatment to minimize flux pinning centers; and magnetic hygiene controls. In this contribution; we review the R&D studies and the implementation of the lessons learned in cryomodules for LCLS-II. We present performance statistics from cryomodules as a function of heat treatment temperature and helium mass flow during cooldown. We show that with these modifications; LCLS-II production cryomodules are now achieving an unprecedented Q0 of ~3x1010 or higher; approximately 3x higher than the state-of-the-art 5 years ago.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuxxplm1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuxxplm1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuxxplm1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUXXPLM1,

Each linac consists of twenty C20/C50 cryomodules each containing eight 5-cell cavities and five C100 upgrade cryomodules each containing eight 7-cell cavities. Accurately classifying the source of cavity faults is critical for improving accelerator performance. In addition to archived signals sampled at 10 Hz; a cavity fault triggers a waveform acquisition process where 16 waveform records sampled at 5 kHz are recorded for each of the 8 cavities in the effected cryomodule. The waveform record length is sufficiently long for transient microphonic effects to be observable. Significant time is required by a subject matter expert to analyze and identify the intra-cavity signatures of imminent faults. This paper describes a path forward that utilizes machine learning for automatic fault classification.

This unique; new generation design provides a radically simpler approach to RF feeding of a gun/buncher system; leading to a much shorter beam via velocity bunching owed to an attached traveling wave section of the photo-injector.

There are many ways to accomplish the control of transverse beam profile such as using focusing magnets or shaping masks; and re-partition of the transverse phase-spaces. In comparison; less resources are available to arbitrarily shape the longitudinal distribution directly. However; owing to the transverse-to-longitudinal emittance exchange technique first demonstrated at the Fermilab A0 Photo-injector; the longitudinal beam profiles can be obtained by first shaping the beam transversely; followed by mapping the transverse distribution into longitudinal.

Recently; EPICS has undergone a major revision; with the aim of better computing supporting for the next generation of machines and analytical tools. Many new data types; such as matrices; tables; images; and statistical descriptions; plus users’ own data types; now supplement the simple scalar and waveform types of the former EPICS. New computational architectures for scientific computing have been added for high-performance data processing services and pipelining. Python and Java bindings have enabled powerful new user interfaces. The result has been that controls are now being integrated with modelling and simulation; machine learning; enterprise databases; and experiment DAQs.

This instability appears when the bunch current exceeds a threshold value; and is characterized by spontaneous (and usually irregular) apparition of micro-structures in the bunch. We show that a regular state (with regular apparition of micro-structures) can pre-exist in the system; but with unstable properties; and we demonstrate the possibility of stabilizing this state thanks to a low power feedback loop. As a consequence of this method; a modification of less than 0.3% in the system parameters permits to decrease by more than 40 dB the THz fluctuations at the synchrotron SOLEIL (while keeping the coherent emission).; * Coherent Terahertz synchrotron radiation mastered by controlling the irregular dynamics of relativistic electron bunches; C.

The NLK has a zero and flat magnetic field at the stored beam to leave the stored beam undisturbed but has a maximum field off-axis where the injected beam is located. After the kick; the injected beam is stored. While NLKs have been prototyped at many facilities around the world; injection efficiency and heat loading have been the main impediment to deployment of the NLK. The wakefields that pass through the ceramic chamber aperture can cause severe heat loading and impedance. Despite achieving impressive injection efficiencies; a previous prototype at BESSY II * showed that strong interactions of the stored beam resulted in high heat load causing the thin 5µm Titanium coated ceramic chamber to reach temperatures > 500 °C and fail. To avoid beam induced heat loads; this paper presents studies of the wake impedance and thermal behaviour for our proposed NLK design. Injection simulations and future considerations for installation and operation at the Australian Synchrotron will be discussed.; * T.

ipac2019,,TUZZPLS3,New Method of Calculation of the Wake due to Radiation and Space Charge Forces  in Relativistic Beams,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Radiation reaction force in a relativistic beam; also known as a CSR wakefield; is often computed using a 1D model of a line charge beam. While this model can serve as a useful tool for a quick calculation; in some cases; it may not be sufficiently accurate. In particular; this model misses the so-called compression effects associated with the change of the electromagnetic energy when the beam is compressed longitudinally or transversely. The existing 3D simulation codes that take this effect into account are often slow and are not easy to use. In this work; we propose a new approach to the calculations of radiation and space charge longitudinal forces based on the use of the integrals for the retarded potentials. Our main result expresses the rate of change of particles energy through 2D (in a 2D model) or 3D integrals for a given orbit of the beam. It generalizes the 1D model and includes the transient effects of at the entrance and the exit from the magnet. For a given beam line with known magnetic lattice; and a known distribution function of the beam; the calculation reduces to taking 2D or 3D integrals along the orbit.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuzzpls3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuzzpls3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuzzpls3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUZZPLS3,

Approximately thousand power supplies (PS) will be needed to feed all the magnets; being 57 to operate the booster injector. The two booster dipole PS are the most complex; not only due to their higher current (1.1 kA); voltage (800 V) and power (333 kW) output; but also because the current must follow a quasi-triangular waveform; from a value close to zero to almost the maximum in 320 ms and at a repetition rate of 2 Hz. Due to the high output values; each PS is formed by two sets in parallel of 4 modules in series; what means 8 modules with 550 A / 200 V output. In order to reduce the 2-Hz effect in the grid; each module has two main stages. The input stage has the function to regulate the average voltage in a capacitor bank consuming a constant RMS current from the grid; which value depends on of the PS average output power. The output stage has the function to transfer the energy from the capacitor bank to the load; with the output cur-rent following the reference waveform.

Aiming to triple the production of rare isotopes; ARIEL facility includes the new electron linac driver and two target stations for electron and proton beams. Particularities of ARIEL target stations design define the requirements for vacuum interfaces with both primary electron and proton beamlines and rare-isotope beamlines. None of the existing products fully met the requirements; driving the development of custom vacuum interfaces. The design of new vacuum seals is driven both by unique design specifications (limited amount of allowed axial forces; extreme radiation resistance; remote handleability and high repeatability) as well as limitations of the proposed design of beamline infrastructure in the target hall (limited available space and the choice of materials for certain components).

In a hadron collider such as the LHC; the beam induces dynamic effects due to ion; electron and photon-stimulated gas desorption. The well-known VASCO* code developed at CERN in 2004 (and then PyVASCO**) is already used to estimate vacuum stability and density profiles in steady state conditions. Nevertheless; some phenomena are not taken into account such as the ionization of residual gas by the electron clouds. Therefore; we propose an upgrade of this code by introducing electron cloud maps*** to estimate the electron density and the ionization of gas by electrons; leading to an increase of both electron- and ion-induced desorption. Results obtained with the new code (called DYVACS for DYnamic VACuum Simulation) will be compared to pressure measurements in the VPS sector**** of the LHC.; * A. Rossi; Tech. Rep.; LHC Proj.

A radiation shield is necessary to reduce radiation exposure of workers when maintenance is performed there. A space to install the radiation shield should be secured by newly designing a structure of the vacuum chamber at the injection point and the alumina ceramics beam pipes for the shift bump magnets. To make the space for the shield; the chamber is lengthened along the beam line and the cross-sectional shape is changed from circle to rectangle. The displacement and inner stress of the vacuum chamber due to atmospheric pressure was evaluated to be enough small by the calculation. For the ceramics beam pipe’s rf-shield; the damping resistor was effective to reduce the induced modulation voltages by the pulsed magnetic field.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupmp013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupmp013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupmp013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPMP013,

The system consists of a high-precision analog-digital converter (ADC) circuit and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Since the precision of the ADC circuit determines the current stability of the PS; we first developed the ADC circuit of high accuracy of less than 10 ppm (pk-pk). A proportional-integral (PI) control logic and a digital pulse width modulation (PWM) function was implemented in the FPGA firmware. These functions can be easily modified for each power supply by a desktop computer.

Since all 96 BMs are symmetrically located in the ring; the magnet currents regulated by the 6 power supplies need to be same. Each power supply performs output current feedback control using electronic circuits including analog amplifications and AD / DA conversions. Due to individual differences of the electronic circuits; output current is generally expected to be different for each power supply.

The inner surface of the beam channel is coated with a Ti-Zr-V Non-Evaporable Getter (NEG) thin film; as it has a high effective pumping speed and a low Photon Stimulated Desorption (PSD) yield. After the installation of the U#19; the neighboring uncoated chambers and vacuum components were baked out at 200 °C for 44 hours; and then the NEG coating was activated at 160 °C for 48 hours. As a result; the pressures in the neighboring chambers reached as low as 10-8 Pa. The conditioning of the vacuum chambers with irradiation of Synchrotron radiation evolved favorably as had been expected by a combined simulation of Synrad and Molflow; leading to a satisfactory recovery of the beam lifetime. Vacuum performance of the NEG-coated chamber was assessed especially by means of a residual gas analysis; and the properties of the NEG film were characterized by surface analyses including SEM; EDX; and XRD.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupmp019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupmp019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupmp019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPMP019,

And the current stability requirements better than 10ppm. Therefore; the power supply is mostly used in the mode of module series-parallel. However; during actual commissioning; the power supply often does not run at rated current. If the power supply is running at less than 30% of the rated current; the power output current stability will drop sharply. This topic designed a set of digital controller for multi-module serial-parallel control. The digital controller can automatically adjust the number of input modules according to the current setting; and can automatically allocate the required PWM number of the module. While taking into account the synchronization between the various modules; Ensure the power supply is always running at an optimal working condition. Through a special AD conversion hardware design and advanced closed-loop controller algorithm; the digital controller can provide up to 20 high-resolution PWM signals to drive power conversion devices.,"Funding: Supported by funds, Key laboratory of particle Acceleration Physics & Technology, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences，Project number：Y5294107TD",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupmp023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupmp023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupmp023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPMP023,

The neutron production source is a deuteron beam (4 or 7 MeV) incident upon a rotating; high-pressure; windowless; pure-deuterium gas target. The windowless nature of the target combined with the high pressure leads to significant gas leakage upstream of the neutron production target. This leakage degrades the imaging quality by (1) increasing the depth-of-field blurring and (2) increasing the beam diameter and divergence in the transverse direction via angular straggling in the residual gas. To mitigate these effects; and guided by bench tests and simulations; we designed a differential pumping line (DPL) to ensure the highest quality imaging system. The system consists of three primary stages (chambers); each separated by carefully shaped apertures. These apertures can be long and thin with low-angle tapers due to the high quality of the beam optics (convergence at the target < 5mrad) and low emittance of the beam (~5 pi mm-mrad). The primary cascaded roots pumps are sized to remove >99% of the incoming mass flow in each stage; ensuring that by the third stage furthest from the target; turbomolecular pumps are able to operate in a nominal ~mTorr range.

The vacuum system of FCC-ee must be designed in order to deal with a lower-energy (45.6 GeV); high-current (1390 mA) Z-pole machine and at a later stage with a higher-energy (182.5 GeV) low-current (5.4 mA). The former machine is the most challenging one from the point of view of vacuum; since the photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) generated by the copious synchrotron radiation (SR) fans is quite large. While several concepts have been considered at the beginning; the design retained for the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) is one where the cross-section of the vacuum chamber (VC) in the arcs is a scaled-down version of the one implemented in the SUPERKEKB collider. Contrary to SUPERKEKB tough; the SR fans are absorbed by many short absorbers; with average spacing of 5.8 m. This allow a localization of the PSD gas load and to place lumped pumps in front of the SR absorbers; to maximize the pumping efficiency. The VC design is compatible with the design of the common-yoke dipoles and quadrupoles. The VC material is copper alloy. Optimization of the pressure profiles has been carried out by means of extensive coupled montecarlo simulations; for SR and molecular flow. For the higher energy versions of the machine; for which the SR spectra are characterized by critical energies well above the Compton edge; the localized absorbers facilitate also shielding the tunnel and any radiation-sensitive machine components from X-ray photon damage; by installing short high-Z material around the absorbers.

ipac2019,,TUPMP037,Recent Developments of Monte-Carlo Codes Molflow+ and Synrad+,"R. Kersevan; M. Ady; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Molflow+ and Synrad+ are Monte Carlo simulation tools for ultra-high vacuum and synchrotron radiation; respectively. Over the years they have become a common tool for designing and analysing the vacuum system of particle accelerators. This contribution gives a short summary about new features added since IPAC-14*. Some highlights: In traditional Monte Carlo simulations; one simulated ’virtual’ particle represents a given number of physical molecules or photons. This is a weakness where the pressure or flux of the simulated system spans across multiple orders of magnitude. Synrad now supports low flux mode; a weighed Monte Carlo technique where the represented number of photons is reduced at every reflection; providing significantly better statistics at low flux regions. As for Molflow+; angle maps allow recording the molecules; directional distribution at any point; and then desorb a reduced gas quantity according to the recording. In linear systems; this allows iterative simulations that have been proven to treat systems up to 7 orders of magnitude of pressure difference. Without the new technique the computing time would be prohibitively slow on desktop computers; which is what most users of the two codes use. Both codes now have a built-in geometry builder that allows creating simple models through a set of 3D operations; and modifying those imported from CAD tools. Molflow+ has recently become open source; and it has been made compatible with; and tested on different versions of Linux and macOS. Examples of application of Molflow+ to novel Beam Gas Curtain detector and the design of the FCC-ee vacuum system will be given; alongside with some benchmarking runs against data published in literature.; * M.

The vacuum chamber of this 50 TeV; 100 km collider; will have to cope with unprecedented levels of synchrotron radiation power for proton colliders; dealing simultaneously with a tighter magnet aperture. Since the high radiation power and photon flux will release large amounts of gas into the system; the difficulty to keep a low level of residual gas density increases considerably compared with the LHC. This article presents a study of the beam induced vacuum effects for the FCC-hh novel conditions; the different phenomena which; owing to the presence of the beam; have an impact on the vacuum level of the accelerator. To achieve this; a novel beam screen has been proposed; featuring specific mitigating measures aimed at dealing with the beam induced effects. It is concluded that thanks to the new beam screen design; the vacuum level in the FCC-hh shall be adequate; allowing to reach the molecular density requirement of better than 1015 H2/m3 with baseline beam parameters within the first months of conditioning.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupmp038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupmp038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupmp038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPMP038,
ipac2019,,TUPMP039,Data-driven Controller Design Using the CERN Power Converter Control Libraries (CCLIBS),A. Nicoletti; M. Martinopresenter; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The data-driven control approach is a control methodology in which a controller is designed without the need of a model. Parametric uncertainties and the associated unmodeled dynamics are therefore irrelevant; the only source of uncertainty comes from the measurement process. The CERN Power Converter Control Libraries (CCLIBS) have been updated to include data-driven H-infinity control methods recently proposed in literature. In particular; a two-step convex optimization algorithm is performed for obtaining the 2-degree-of-freedom controller parameters. The newly implemented tools in CCLIBS can be used both for frequency response measurement of the load and for controller synthesis. A case study is presented where these tools are used for an application in the CERN East Area Renovation Project for which a high-precision 900 A trapezoidal current pulse is required with 450 ms flat-top and 350 ms ramp-up and ramp-down times. The tracking error must remain within ± 100 parts-per-million (ppm) during the flat-top (before the ramp-down phase starts). The magnet considered in the case study is of non-laminated iron type; hence the necessity of data-driven techniques since the dynamics of such a magnet is difficult to be modeled accurately (due to eddy currents losses). The Power Converter used is a SIRIUS 2P (with a current and voltage rating of 400 Arms and 450 V; respectively) whose digital control loop is regulated at a sampling rate of 5 kS/s.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupmp039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupmp039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupmp039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPMP039,

A possible impediment; though; comes from flux jumps that; so far; could not be avoided by design unlike for NbTi technology. However; the impact of flux jumps on the powering has not been properly investigated to date. Flux jumps appear during current ramps at relatively low value of current and tend to disappear towards nominal current. They are usually detected as voltage jumps between different magnet coils but they might also produce overall voltage jumps across the magnet electrical terminals. Such jumps might perturb the power converter feedback control loop and therefore potentially jeopardize its precision performance during energy ramps. This work aims at : (i) presenting preliminary experimental test results on some HL-LHC Nb3Sn model and prototype magnets; and (ii) attempting to build a simplified electrical model of the flux jumps (with focus only at its interaction with the power converter feedback control loop). Such work is a starting point for outlining possible power converters control strategies able to minimize flux jumps impact on high-precision powering of Nb3Sn superconducting magnets.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupmp040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupmp040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupmp040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPMP040,

Unfortunately; the conflat (CF-) flanges and the gaskets with non-circular profile were not commercially available. Besides; additional RF-contact bridges between the flanges must be built in for mitigating the impedance from the flange-gaps. In this presentation; various types of the aluminum (Al-) gaskets designed for the non-circular profile Al-flanges for the accelerator ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems are introduced. The surface of the Al-flange is flat to accommodate the special Al-gasket with knife edges for the sealing. Both the flange and gasket are manufactured by the oil-free Ethanol-CNC-machining process that any non-circular profile; e.g. rectangular; race-track; key-hole; etc.; flanges can be precisely produced. The inner diameters of the gasket just suits those of the flanges that the impedance from the gap is significantly reduced. The flanges and gaskets after oil-free machining can be assembled immediately without any chemical cleaning. The experimental results for the as-mentioned non-circular profile Al-flanges reveal the UHV quality at pressure < 20 nPa after vacuum baking.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupmp044_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupmp044.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupmp044_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPMP044,

A regulated power supply maintains the source and support equipment racks at -80kV with respect to local ground. As the facility’s H− beam currents have been increased; voltage droop on the regulated -80 kV power supply has become one of the limiting factors on beam current. The previous regulator used a standard 120kV DC HV supply and a high power planar triode in series to regulate the voltage down to 80 kV and to stop the flow of current during an arcdown of the -80 kV accelerating column. In 2018 we devised a method of using a pair of standard; 50 kV capacitor charging supplies to produce the required 80 kV with minimal stored energy and significantly better voltage regulation over the beam pulse.

The operation of such beams requires the usage of low charge states; which have high cross sections for ionization. To overcome this issue; many upgrade measure have been realized in the past decade; such as the installation of an ion catcher system with low desorption surfaces and coating 65% of the circumference of SIS18 with NEG to lower the static gas pressure. Since the vacuum dynamics during operation prevent the achievement of the intensity goals for FAIR; new concepts have to be developed; to increase the beam intensity. One idea is the installation of additional pumping speed in the form of cryogenic surfaces. Heavy residual gas components; which have the highest ionization cross sections can be cryopumped at moderate temperatures; i.e. already at 50-80 K. In fact; the only typical residual gas component which can not be pumped via cryosorption in this temperature regime is Hydrogen; which has a factor 50 lower ionization cross sections than Argon; the heaviest residual gas component.

More recently a reconfigured lattice was presented at the 6th DLSR workshop. This lattice employed large βy and small βx in the straights. This has several advantages including: increased transverse coherence and brighter beams at small coupling; round beams at small coupling; flatter βy through the straights; and possible off-axis vertical injection at small amplitudes. Most recently longitudinal gradients in the dipoles have been implemented. This has lead to the unit cell bends being replaced by a ’pseudo longitudinal gradient’ bend array: bend1-bend2-bend1.

Since then different operation modes have been implemented at KARA: in particular; the double bend achromat (DBA) lattice with non-dispersive straight sections; the theoretical minimum emittance (TME) lattice with distributed dispersion; and different versions of low compaction factor optics with highly stretched dispersion function. Short bunches of a few ps pulse width are available at KARA. Low alpha optics have been tested and implemented in a wide operational range of the ring and are now routinely used at 1.3 GeV for studies of CSR-induced beam dynamics and THz bursting in the micro-bunching instability.

Another advantage of NbTi based SCUs with respect to permanent magnet devices is radiation hardness; widely demonstrated for NbTi magnets; which is and will become an increasingly important issue with the small gaps in the newest machines as round beam storage rings and FELs. Moreover; SCU technology allows switching of the period length by changing the current direction in one of separately powered subset of winding packages of the superconducting coils. This feature further broadens the energy range of the emitted photons; required by the different beamlines. To this end 0.5 m long superconducting undulator coils with switchable period length between 17 mm and 34 mm have been developed.

This paper will describe the details of further improvements and researches to achieve higher averaged beam current of 1 mA with continuous-wave (CW) beam pattern. At first; to keep the small beam emittance produced by 500 kV DC-photocathode gun; tuning of low-energy beam transport is essential. Also; we found some components degrades the beam quality; i.e.; a non-metallic mirror which disturbed the beam orbit. Other important aspects are the measurement and mitigation of the beam losses. Combination of beam collimator and tuning of the beam optics can improve the beam halo enough to operate with 1 mA stably. The cERL has been operated with beam energy at 20 MeV or 17.5 MeV and with beam rep-rate of 1300 MHz or 162.5 MHz depending on the purpose of experiments.

For example; to cancel out nonlinear dynamics effects; the phase advances between some sections are generally required to be set to certain values in the lattice design. For better designing a MBA lattice using an evolutionary algorithm; the handling of constraints will be important; because it is very hard to satisfy the constraints for most or even all of solutions in the early generations of the algorithm.

At the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring in Lund; Sweden; the linearity of the 2nd order dispersion with chromatic sextupole field strengths has been utilised to investigate the sextupole circuits. The beating induced in the 2nd order dispersion when reducing the strength of a sextupole magnet can be compared to the beating in simulations. From this a beam-based sextupole calibration curve can be found.

Although its performance meets the specifications; it still has a potential to achieve better storage ring beam parameters. We explore two possible improvements. The first one is for the beam lifetime. There are 480 rf buckets while normally 390 bunches are stored. The gap in filing pattern (90 empty buckets) is held to suppress ion instability. After many years of operation; however; the vacuum condition is much better than that of the time when the SLS was turned on. Hence it is possible to shorten the gap. The beam lifetime can then be prolonged due to less bunch current while keeping the net beam current. The study may be also useful to predict possible filling patter in SLS2; which is the SLS upgrade planned. The second one is for the beam emittance. The nominal energy closed orbit coincides with the axes of quadrupole magnets. An off-momentum closed orbit is therefore off-centered through quadrupoles; resulting in a damping partition shift. The beam emittance can be decreased at the expense of a larger energy spread. This was successfully achieved in the ESRF booster. We study whether it is applicable to the SLS storage ring.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupgw066_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupgw066.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupgw066_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPGW066,

This is also the case for the planned upgrade of the Diamond Light Source. One option to increase the Touschek lifetime is to lengthen the electron bunches with a harmonic cavity operated close to a harmonic of the fundamental RF frequency. This paper presents studies of a harmonic cavity for Diamond-II with the focus on maximising the lifetime increase. It is foreseen that the ring will have to operate with a gap in the fill pattern to avoid instabilities and therefore multiparticle tracking was used to determine the effect on stability and lifetime for various cavity parameters taking into account transient beam loading.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupgw078_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupgw078.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupgw078_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPGW078,

That efficiency can be further enhanced by configuring an RLA in a ’dogbone’ topology; which further boosts the RF efficiency by factor of two (compare to a corresponding racetrack). However; the ’dogbone’ configuration requires the beam to traverse the linac in both directions; while being accelerated. This can be facilitated by a special ’bisected’ linac Optics. Here; the quadrupole gradients scale up with momentum to maintain periodic FODO structure for the lowest energy pass in the first half of the linac and then the quadrupole strengths are mirror reflected in the second linac half. The virtue of this optics is the appearance of distinct nodes in the beta beat-wave at the ends of each pass (where the droplet arcs begin); which limits the growth of initial betas at the beginning of each subsequent droplet arc. Furthermore; ‘bisected’ linac optics naturally supports energy recovery in the ’dogbone’ topology.

The beam can obtain this transverse modulation from alternating magnet array (e.g. 90 degree rotated undulator).

Due to small dynamic aperture of the APS Upgrade lattice; swap-out injection is adapted when an entire old bunch is replaced with a new bunch. This injection requires Booster to provide high-charge bunches with up to 17 nC in a single bunch. An extensive work is being carried out on characterizing the existing injector rings to ensure future high-charge operation. In this paper; we will present results of the lattice measurement using the response matrix fit. We will show the analysis of the achievable lattice measurement accuracy in the APS Booster and describe fit parameter modifications required to achieve good fit accuracy for the PAR.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupgw091_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupgw091.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupgw091_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPGW091,
ipac2019,,TUPGW092,Working Impedance Model and Its Effect on the Intensity Limitation of Petra-IV Storage Ring,DESY; Hamburg; Germany; We made sufficient progress in modeling the imped-ance of the PETRA-IV storage ring. The result was ap-plied to estimate the impedance-based single and multi-bunch intensity limit. Due to the extremely small emit-tance of the beam the intrabeam scattering (IBS) effects will be significant unless they are reduced by bunch lengthening. The 3rd harmonic cavity was proposed to dilute the bunch density which resulted in the small syn-chrotron frequency with a large spread. Because of the complexity introduced by impedance and harmonic cavity we used broadband impedance up to 200 GHz to compute the parameters such as bunch length and energy spread at different currents. We found that the microwave instability started very early in current less than 0.5 mA. Even if it is small; the prediction by tracking simulation was consistent with another diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) when the Keil-Schnell criterion was used to predict one from the other. Then; we present the single-bunch current limit which had included the effect of geometric and resistive wall impedances of the NEG-coated chamber. Finally; we present the emittance and lifetime which can be realistically achieved in the ring with the above collective effects included.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupgw092_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupgw092.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupgw092_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPGW092,

In this paper; the operational status of these light sources for FY2018 is described. At the PF-ring; a first-generation undulator was renewed with the beamline components. A vacuum chamber for the new undulator was applied the NEG coating on the inner surface. This is the first attempt in Japanese light sources that the NEG-coated chamber is used for undulators. At the PF-AR; the top-up injection using the direct beam transport line was introduced to the user operation for the first time. Since modification of the beam injector LINAC for enabling simultaneous injection to the four different rings (the PF-ring; PF-AR; SuperKEKB HER and LER) was completed; this top-up operation no longer disturbs the operation of the other three rings.

Two of these devices will operate in the soft x-ray range where there is expected to be a significant change to polarisation at the sample due to transmission effects of the beam line op-tics. Arbitrary polarisation selection of the ID will counter transmission effects and enable circular polarisation at the sample position. A polarisation model of the device is derived which allows for the calculation of both the Stokes parameters and photon energy for any set point of ID gap and phase. Numerical solutions of these equa-tions allow the calculation of gap and phase set points for any desired photon energy or polarisation. The results of the polarisation model are compared with numerical simulations of the synchrotron radiation calculated using measured magnetic fields at various polarisation modes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuprb005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuprb005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuprb005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPRB005,

DESY is push-ing R&D on CW electron sources. A fully superconducting CW gun is under experimental development at DESY in Hamburg; and a normal conducting (NC) CW gun is under physics design at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a backup option. A 217 MHz NC CW gun is developed from the LBNL 187 MHz VHF gun; with enhancement on both cathode gradient and gun voltage to further improve beam brightness.

ipac2019,,TUPRB012,Design of High Power CW IR-THz Source for the Radiation Source ELBE Upgrade,P.E. Evtushenko; T.E. Cowan; U. Lehnert; P. Michel; HZDR; Dresden; Germany; The Radiation Source ELBE at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) is a user facility based on a 1 mA - 40 MeV CW SRF LINAC. Presently HZDR is considering upgrade options for the ELBE or its replacement with a new CW; SRF LINAC-based user facility. A part of the user requirements is the capability to generate IR and THz pulse in the frequency range from 0.1 through 30 THz; with pulse energies in the range from 100 uJ through a few mJ; at the repetition rate between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. This corresponds to the pulse energy increase; dependent on the wavelength by a factor from 100 through 1000. In this contribution; we outline key aspects of a concept; which would allow to achieve such parameters. Such key aspects are: 1 - use of a beam with longitudinal density modulation and bunching factor of about 0.5 at the fundamental frequency; 2 - achieving the density modulation through the mechanism similar to the one used in optical klystron (OK) and HGHG FEL; 3 - generating necessary for the modulation optical beam by an FEL oscillator; and 4 - using two electron injectors; where one injector provides beam for the FEL oscillator while second high charge injector provides beam for the high energy per pulse generation for user experiments. All-in-all the concept of the new radiation source is very similar to an OK; but operating with two beams simultaneously.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuprb012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuprb012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuprb012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPRB012,

Superconducting IDs have the advantage to produce a higher magnetic peak field for a given gap and period length than IDs assembled with permanent magnets. Before installation of a superconducting ID in a synchrotron light source it is of fundamental importance to characterize the magnetic properties by accurate field and field integral measurements. We follow this aim within our R&D program for superconducting undulators (SCUs).

At the European XFEL several different types of collimators are installed at different locations of the beam line; which include the gun collimators; the bunch compressor collimators; and the main and supplementary collimators in the collimation section. Beam halo measurements have been performed using the wire scanners downstream of the main linac; which show that large part of beam halo is collimated by the gun collimator.

At the European XFEL (EuXFEL); dosimeters based on on-line Radfets are used for the un-dulator radiation dose measurements. However; since the Radfets are not only sensitive to the electrons and neu-trons but also to the photons; it can capture the synchro-tron radiation (SR) generated in the undulators; which is not considered to be the main source for undulator radia-tion damage. Therefore; it is important to estimate the contribution of synchrotron radiation to the radiation doses measured by the Radfets. For this purpose; we have first calculated the synchrotron radiation profile using SPECTRA; and then put the profile into the tracking code BDSIM to track it through the whole undulator beam line. The radiation doses from SR have been simulated and compared with the measured values. The differences in the radiation doses measured by the Radfets before and after Pb shielding will also be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuprb021_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuprb021.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuprb021_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPRB021,

Employing a low-emittance and short-bunch electron beam at a high repetition rate; a scheme to resonantly excite optical cavity modes of THz spectrum range via coherent diffraction radiation has been proposed. The confocal cavity design is the special case that resonance conditions of all the eigen modes coincide; resulting in realizing broad-band excitation. But in general cases of non-confocal cavities; the resonance condition depends on the mode; and the resonance peak becomes wide and weak. We performed an experiment with a non-confocal cavity as a follow-up experiment of that we have done with a confocal cavity.

We have already developed a couple of terahertz-wave sources based on coherent synchrotron radiation and coherent transition radiation*; which have been applied to spectroscopic research**. Moreover; we developed coherent edge radiation (CER) at the downstream bending magnets in the FEL sections. Because the edge radiation has an annular shape distribution characterized by the asymmetric first-order Laguerre-Gaussian mode; the CER can be extracted from an optical cavity of the FEL system without a diffraction loss of the FEL beam***. The root-mean-squared bunch length of the electron beam was evaulated by measuring the CER spectra; which was about the same level as the FEL micropulse width. Although the infrared FELs at LEBRA had a long slippage length; the CER intensity can be a guidepost enhancing the FEL power because of the existence of their correlation. In this presentation; the characteristics of the CER including correlation between the CER and the FEL will be reported.; * N. Sei et al.; Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 56; (2017) 032401.  ** N. Sei et al.; J.

A research program has been established to explore the application of the IR-FEL to generate attosecond UV and X-ray pulses through the high harmonic generation (HHG) in noble gases; where the IR-FEL pulses must have a high-peak power and a short-pulse duration. The property of generated FEL pulse is affected by the cavity length detuning of FEL oscillator as well as the small signal gain and the cavity loss. The operation at a small- or zero-detuning length is necessary to generate a FEL pulse shorter than the bunch length; although it requires a long macro-pulse to reach the saturation. For the short FEL pulse generation within a limited macro-pulse length at the LEBRA LINAC; we apply a dynamical modulation to the electron bunch repetition; that is equivalent to a dynamical detuning of the FEL cavity length. We illustrate the potential performance of the IR-FEL with the dynamical detuning by time-dependent 3D FEL simulations. We also evaluate the enhancement of the FEL pulses by an external cavity stacking for the sake of the HHG application.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuprb041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuprb041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuprb041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPRB041,

Responding to the demands of short laser pulses from users; a nonlinearity correction system using sextupole magnets is under consideration to obtain shorter electron bunches. Since the frequency of the SCSS+ injector is S-band; the nonlinearity correction of a bunch compression process using a harmonic correction cavity is not so efficient as the SACLA injector; whose frequency of the injector is L-band. Instead of a complex and costly correction cavity system; the sextupole magnets are simply installed in a dispersive section of the first bunch compressor chicane.

The machine puts very tight tolerance on the straightness of the electron beam orbit. It is hard to achieve the required trajectory due to the off-axis field of the misaligned quadrupoles and undulator segments especially for the SXFEL driven by low energy linac (840MeV). This tight requirement on electron beam straightness can only be met through the beam-based alignment (BBA) technology which achieved great success at LCLS; PAL-XFEL; European-XFEL and SCALA with high electron beam energies. But there has been no report about satisfactory BBA experiment results on soft X-ray FEL facility driven by relatively low energy linacs (on the order of 2 GeV or less) up to now.

At the beginning of beam commissioning; significant photon flux dips could be observed at injection due to a blow-up of the beam size. To eliminate this transient effect; all four kickers were rematched. The leakage field was shielded and the induced current loops at vacuum chambers in the injection area were also eliminated. These efforts reduced the horizontal betatron oscillations and orbit distortions to around one-tenth. In order to decrease the recovery time of photon dips during injection; the operational chromaticity was reduced to improve incoherent effects. After all those improvements; the photon flux dips during injection dropped to 30 % and the recovery time to less than 1 msec.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuprb081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuprb081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuprb081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPRB081,

The dark current will be delivered to End Station A and can work independently of LCLS-II experiments. The dark current will be bunched at a frequency of 46 MHz while extracted current varied from single electrons to 10’s of nA.

The MPG has now funded a significant upgrade to the original FHI FEL. A second short Rayleigh range undulator FEL beamline is being added that will permit lasing from < 5 microns to > 160 microns. Additionally; a 500 MHz kicker cavity will permit simultaneous two-color operation of the FEL from both FEL beamlines over an optical range of 5 to 50 microns by deflecting alternate 1 GHz pulses into each of the two undulators.

Replacing the regular dipoles in the Double­-Bend Achromat lattice by Complex Bends significantly reduces the beam emittance. The first attempt of lattice design for potential NSLS-­II upgrade based on Complex Bend; is described. Compared with the current NSLS­-II lattice; the new solution modifies only three of the six girders per cell. The linear optics has been matched keeping unchanged the lattice parameters at the straight sections; where the light­-generating insertion devices are located. The Complex Bend gradient is limited by 250 T/m assuming possible use of permanent magnets. The lattice provides 65 pm emittance without damping wigglers; use of which results in further decrease of the emittance",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tuprb105_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tuprb105.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tuprb105_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPRB105,

Penning Ion Sources by comparison are relatively old technologies mostly used for cheap singly-charged ion production. However; these ion sources have been used in the past for high-current multiply-charged state ion production of heavy ions up to a few mA of current; and are much smaller; cheaper; and less complex than ECRISs. Therefore; we are developing a Penning Ion source test stand to produce high-current alpha-particles for medical cyclotrons. This requires designs and simulations of all the primary components of the ion source. This system will be used to fully characterize the output beam current and internal plasma properties as a function of varying gas pressure; ion source geometries; magnetic field strength; arc voltage/current; and material properties. The result will be a source optimized for maximum alpha particle beam currents; to be used as a prototype for a commercial Penning Ion Source.; * J. Bennet.

It injects up to 7 A·hrs of H− ions during its ~14-week service cycles; which is an unprecedented lifetime for small-emittance; high-current pulsed H− ion sources. The SNS source also features unprecedented low cesium consumption and can be installed and started up in <10 h.

Ultimately high performance can be achieved with ellipsoidal laser pulses; but 3-dimensional shaping is challenging. High beam quality can also be reached by simple transverse pulse shaping; which has demonstrated improved beam emittance compared to a transversely uniform laser in the ‘pancake’ photoemission regime. In this contribution we present the truncation of a Gaussian laser at a radius of approximately one σ in the intermediate (electron bunch length directly after emission about the same as radius) photoemission regime with high acceleration gradients (up to 60 MV/m).

Furthermore; thicker samples and hence a wider range of possible materials are enabled by the longer mean free path of MeV electrons. In this paper; design steps towards a university-based UED facility with ultrashort and low-emittance MeV electron bunches are presented; including the transverse and longitudinal focusing schemes; which minimize space charge effects and nonlinearities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupts015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupts015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupts015_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPTS015,

The plan is to deliver beams of ions with mass number 𝐴 ≤ 40 with power up to 10 kW. This ambitious goal can be achieved increasing the efficiency of the injection and extraction processes. An extraction efficiency close to 100% is expected by extracting the specific ion beams from the CS by stripping and no longer by electrostatic deflectors. The beams are injected axially and bent onto the median plane with a spiral inflector. Currently; the injection efficiency stays around 15%; also including the effect of a drift buncher placed in the axial injection line. In order to increase the injection efficiency; the study of an upgraded CS central region is ongoing at INFN-LNS. In this paper; the results of simulations of beam tracking through the cyclotron axial bore; the spiral inflector; the central region and further up to the extraction system are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupts023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupts023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupts023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPTS023,

They allow the generation of beams with very high peak current and low transverse emittance; satisfying the tight demands for free-electron lasers; energy recovery linacs; Compton/Thomson sources and high-energy linear colliders. In the paper we present the design of a new full C-band RF photo-injector recently developed in the framework of the XLS-Compact Light design study and of the EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB proposal. It allows to reach extremely good beam performances in terms of beam emittance (at the level of few hundreds nm); energy spread and peak current. The photo-injector is based on a very high gradient (>200 MV/m) ultra-fast (RF pulses <200 ns) C-band RF gun; followed by two C band TW structures. Different types of couplers for the 1.6 cell RF gun have been considered and also a new compact low pulsed heating coupler working on the TM020 mode on the full cell has been proposed.

Recently; random high current transients were discovered in the arc current used to ionize hydrogen in the LANSCE H− ion source; and in the convertor current used to convert protons to H− ions. Most have no effect; but more severe transients can cripple beam output. Hypothesized causes are related to cesiation effects; plasma potential changes; tungsten filament vaporation/sputtering; or from the pulsed power system. A dedicated study was recently done on the LANSCE H− Ion source test stand to determine the cause of these transients. Current understanding indicates that the more severe transients come from a combination of cesiation effects and plasma potential changes.

The NEA surface is conventionally made by Cs and \rm O/NF3 adsorption on the cleaned p-doped GaAs crystal; but the robustness of the cathode is very limited; so that the electron emission is easily lost by residual gas adsorption; ion back-bombardment; etc. To improve the cathode robustness; NEA activation with a stable thin-film on GaAs surface according to Hetero junction hypothesis has been proposed by the author. An experiment of the NEA activation with CsKTe thin film was carried out at Hiroshima University and a significant electron emission with 1.43 eV photon was observed which strongly suggested NEA activation.

We designed the new LEBT; injection; acceleration and extraction systems and we report on the extraction system here. High extraction efficiency is indispensable when increasing the beam intensity since beam loss causes activation of apparatus. New extraction system consists of deflector electrodes and two gradient correctors and probes. One gradient corrector causes a horizontally focus effect on the beam and the other causes horizontally defocus effect to avoid spreading of the beam with strong defocus effect caused by the main cyclotron magnetic field.

There are fout high field septum magnet along the fast extraction line in the MR; and these will be improved to the new magnets which can operate 1Hz frequency. The new high field septa will be installed in 2021. In this poster we will report about the performance of these new septum magnets. These high field septum magnets are called Septum 30(SM30); 31(SM31); 32(SM32); 33(SM33). We will replace SM30; SM31; and SM32. One reasons of cethe replacement is installation of a large-size quadrupole magnet to upsteam postion of the septa. We need to change the longitudinal length of the septa. Second is large aperture of the beam duct for reduction of beam loss by the collision of the halo of the proton beam to the duct. The new high field SM30; SM31 and SM32 have large aperture. and the material of the beam ducts for extraction line are ceramics for reduction of amount of heat generation by eddy current on the surface of the duct. The maetial of the circulating duct are titanium for reduction of radioactivation. On the other hand; the power supply will not be replaced; then the current power supplies will be used for these new septa. The new SM30; SM31; and SM32 were produced in 2015. The first test operation of SM31 were conduced with 2.48 s repein 2015; and we have meaured the magnetic field without problem. In 2018; we conduced the first 1Hz operation with SM30.

It imposes a big limitation on high power beam tuning and study. The number of protons is expected to become 3.3·10+14 for MW operation. Hence; an upgrade of the beam dump from 7.5 kW to 30 kW is planned. The radiation dose rate should be less than 0.25μSv/h on the ground.

Our fabricated diamond field emitter arrays (DFEAs) are the arrays of micrometer-scale diamond pyramids with nanometer-scale sharp tips and produce high per-tip current (> 15 μA per-tip) in DC testing. For the beam divergence measurements; we designed and assembled a test stand consisting of a DFEA cathode; a mesh aperture of 0.375-inch for an anode; and AZO (ZnO:Al2O3) screen coated on a sapphire substrate for beam visualization. A negative voltage of about 40 kV is applied to the cathode; and the mesh and the screen are kept at ground. We measure a size of the electron beam on the AZO screen at different mesh to screen distances at a fixed cathode-mesh gap in order to calculate the beam divergence angles. We also perform the beam dynamics simulations with Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Studio and General Particle Tracer (GPT) using a single pyramidal shape with a nanowire tip model.

However; there is always the very important question of the compatibility of SRF cavities and high quantum efficiency (QE) photocathodes. A deposition of active elements from high QE photocathodes on the surface of a cavity makes it more vulnerable to multipacting (MP) and could affect the operation of an SRF gun. On the other side; MP can significantly reduce the lifetime of a photocathode. It is well known in the SRF community that a strong coupling; high forward power and sufficient cleanliness of cavity walls are the key components to overcome a low-level MP zone. In this paper we present a theoretical model of passing a MP barrier which could help estimate the desirable conditions for successful operation of an SRF gun. We demonstrate our results for the 113 MHz SRF photo-injector for Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) alongside with the experimental observations and 3D simulations of the MP discharge in the cavity. The results of the theoretical model and simulations show good agreement with the experimental results; and demonstrate that; if approached carefully; MP zones can be easily passed without any harm to the photocathode.,,V. Litvinenkopresenter reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupts079_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupts079.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupts079_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPTS079,

Diamond field emitter array (DFEA) cathodes were originally proposed for applications that require large current densities. DFEAs represent periodic arrays of diamond pyramids with micron-size dimensions and tips with diameters of the order of tens of nanometers. DFEAs are known to produce significant currents in field emission regime under direct current (DC) fields and in radio-frequency (RF) guns. It has been proposed that single diamond tip emitters can be employed for production of small tightly focused electron beams for dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) that accelerate particles using the energy of light produced by infrared lasers. To generate short electron bunches required by DLAs diamond pyramids may be triggered with a laser. We have recently observed emission produced by a single diamond pyramid when triggered by a laser at different wavelengths from 256 nm to 2020 nm. We have conducted studies with the goal to understand mechanism of the emission. We clearly observed the change in emission mechanism when the wavelength changed from 256 nm to 512 nm. We believe that while the emission at 256 nm is a clear photoemission; the emission at longer wavelengths is likely the field emission caused by intense electric fields of the laser.,Funding: Los Alamos National Laboratory LDRD Program,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupts089_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupts089.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupts089_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPTS089,

Electric-field-assisted diamond emitters manufactured from semiconductor processes are strong candidates for cathodes in such sources. The micro-scale pyramid structure of the emitter has the desirable attribute of significant field enhancement at the sharp interfaces (apex and edges) to facilitate electron emission. We use the LSP particle-in-cell code to simulate the diamond emitter in a diode setup and obtain the beam size and divergence. An empirical fit of the fields around the apex is extracted for detail study.

Numerical modeling is a useful tool for trying to optimize negative hydrogen ion sources. However there are significant numerical and computational challenges that have to be overcome; including code performance and resolution of separation of time scales between ion and electron motions. One method is to utilize fluid models to simulate inductively coupled ion sources (ICPs). We have been developing algorithms to simulate negative hydrogen production in high-power; external-antenna ICP sources. We present simulation results using the USim*; ** framework to model plasma chemistry that produces negative hydrogen; and model the effects of electron temperature on overall production rates. The numerical plasma chemistry models include processes of ionization; dissociation; recombination; as well as reactive dissociation of vibrationally resolved states and de-excitation of atomic hydrogen. We benchmark our plasma chemistry model results using plasma parameters relevant to experiments being carried out at the D-Pace Ion Source Test Facility. We have also been developing fluid-based drift/diffusion models for multi-component plasmas; such as those in negative hydrogen sources.

We use photocathode as the electron source; which can generate high- quality electron beam such as low emittance; and short bunch. The performance of photocathode is evaluated mainly in terms of quantum efficiency (Q.E.) and lifetime. Cs-Te photocathode used in the rf-gun is known for high Q.E. about 10% with UV light and relatively longer lifetime among semiconductor photocathodes. Since it is a hard environment for photocathode inside the gun; it is necessary to replace the photocathode every several months. In other words; in order to achieve long-term operation of rf-gun; it is necessary to find highly durable photocathode recipe. It has been reported that the Cs-Te photocathode by co-evaporation can produce a photocathode having a longer lifetime as compared with the sequential evaporation. Moreover; we have done studies to improve lifetime and durability of Cs-Te photocathode by coating the cathode surface with CsBr thin film. In this conference; we report the evaluation results of Cs-Te photocathode by co-evaporation; CsBr coating and future prospects.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/tupts111_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/tupts111.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/tupts111_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-TUPTS111,

Following the tendency to reduce dependence on the configuration of the preceding proton run; a completely new optics cycle with the strongest ever focussing at the ALICE and LHCb experiments was designed and rapidly implemented; demonstrating the maturity of the collider’s operating modes. Beam-loss monitor thresholds were carefully adjusted to provide optimal protection from the multiple loss mechanisms in heavy-ion operation. A switch from a basic bunch-spacing of 100 ns to 75 ns was made as the beam became available from the injector chain. A new record luminosity; 6 times the original design and close to the operating value proposed for HL-LHC; provided validation of the strategy for mitigating quenches due to bound-free pair production (BFPP) at the interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS experiments.

Caustics by their nature are discontinuities that result from small continuous perturbations of an input. Under certain conditions; small density modulations will reliably produce striking changes in the corresponding output current profile. These current modulations can shift alone the bunch with varying higher-order longitudinal dispersion. The MAX IV linac double-bend achromats provide the perfect test bed for experimentally verifying how the caustic lines evolve. The natural amplification of small perturbations makes caustics an attractive diagnostic tool; and effective tool for characterise the bunch compressors. This approach also allows us to modify and improve the longitudinal charge profile; removing current spikes or creating tailor shaped current profiles.; * T.K.Charles et. al. Phys. Rev. Accel.

Typically; the size of the target is much larger than the wavelengths under consideration. This fact gives us an obvious small parameter of the problem and allows developing approximate methods of analysis. We develop two methods: ""ray-optical method"" and ""aperture method""**. These methods can be very effective for all situations where we can find the tangential field components on the ""aperture"" which is an object boundary illuminated by Cherenkov radiation. We apply the aperture method to different dielectric objects including a prism; a cone; and a ball. Electromagnetic field is analyzed on different distances from the objects. The special attention is given to investigation of the field in the far-field (Fraunhofer) area having large importance for various applications. We obtain analytical results for different objects; demonstrate typical radiation patterns and discuss new physical effects; in particular; the phenomenon of concentration of radiation and effect of ""Cherenkov spotlight"".

Several aspects of PWFA are under investigation at the Photoinjector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ). One of the main characteristics of these accelerators is the ratio between field strength usable for acceleration and decelerating field strength in the driver bunch; the so called transformer ratio. To reach high transformer ratios usually shaped bunches; e.g. with ramped current profiles are employed as drivers. The so-called self-modulation instability; which causes transverse modulation of a bunch longer than the plasma wavelength; is proposed as a means of supplying short driver bunches for proton-driven PWFA. This talk will give an overview on experimental results in these two aspects of PWFA at PITZ with a focus on the production of electron bunches enabling high transformer ratio acceleration by shaping the photocathode laser pulses of a photoinjector and the demonstration of high transformer ratio PWFA. Simulations and further developments on the shaping techniques; allowing highly flexible electron bunches for future plasma wakefield accelerators are also presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wezpls2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wezpls2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wezpls2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEZPLS2,

Here we present the first successful demonstration of external injection from a linear accelerator (LINAC) into a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) and the subsequent acceleration with ~100% capture efficiency. Stable 31MeV; 20fC electron beams from the LINAC were velocity bunched to the length of ~15fs (r.m.s.) in the high-gradient photocathode RF gun and then external injected into the linear wakefield excited by the 10TW; 42fs laser. The experimental results show that nearly all the electrons can be mono-energetically accelerated and the maximum energy gain reaches 1.8MeV in a 6-mm long plasma; corresponding to an average gradient of about 300MV/m. High capture efficiency of external injection has also been systematically validated by 3D PIC simulations.

Our current injection method uses a four-dipole kicker configuration that perturbs the stored beam during injection while also taking up approximately 4 meters of valuable space. To free this valuable space and provide transparent injections to the beamlines; a single pulsed nonlinear magnetic field kicker (NLK) will be deployed. The NLK has a flat and zero field at the stored beam but maximum field where the injected beam is located off-axis. NLKs deflect only the injected beam; leaving the stored beam undisturbed. NLKs have been extensively prototyped by many facilities around the world already and can produce injection efficiencies of 99 % (see e.g. *). This paper presents the preliminary magnet design for installation of a NLK at the Australian Synchrotron.

BOBYQA (Bound Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation) solves bound constrained optimization problems without using derivatives of the objective function. The Bayesian optimization is an other strategy for global optimization of costly; noisy functions without using derivatives. A python programming interface to MADX allow the use of the python implementation of BOBYQA and Bayesian method. This gave the possibility to use tracking simulation with MADX to determine the loss budget for each lattice setting during the optimization and compare both optimization methods.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepmp005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepmp005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepmp005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPMP005,

The trend is pushing the lattice design to lower the beam emittance; which naturally results in the narrower dynamic aperture. One bottleneck in the upgrades is a beam injection system capable of accumulating required beam intensity and keeping top-up operations with such narrow apertures. Beam injection with a nonlinear kicker and transverse/longitudinal on-axis injections are now in the limelight. However; these techniques still need time to be put into practical use. We take an alternative approach for the SPring-8 upgrade; SPring-8-II; renovating the off-axis beam injection scheme to address the following requirements for the coming diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs): minimizing of both injection beam amplitude and perturbation to stored beam; and topping-up functionality.

The extraction region provides the physics experiments with a quasi-DC flux of high-energy protons over a few seconds; which corresponds to tens of thousands of turns. The resonant slow extraction process provokes beam losses and is therefore the origin of radiation damage and the production of induced radioactivity in this region of the machine. This induced radioactivity imposed high constraints on the equipment design to be reliable to minimise the radiation exposure to personnel during machine maintenance. A detailed FLUKA model was developed in order to better understand the beam loss patterns; activation of the machine and to identify equipment components that could be optimised to reduce the residual dose related hazards.

The BDF is a proposed fixed target facility to be installed in the SPS North Area; to accommodate experiments such as SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles); which is most notably aiming at studying hidden sector particles. This experiment requires a high intensity slowly extracted 400 GeV proton beam with 4·1013 protons per 1 s spill to achieve 4·1019 protons on target per year. The extraction and transport scheme will make use of the first 600 m of the existing North Area extraction line. This contribution presents the status of the design work of the new transfer line and discusses the challenges identified. Aperture studies and failure scenarios are treated and the results discussed. In particular; interlock systems aiming at protecting critical components against the uncontrolled loss of the high energy proton beam are considered.

The crystal; installed a few meters upstream the ZS; bends protons that would otherwise impinge on the ZS wires. Since particle deflection with good efficiency is achieved only when the crystal lattice is aligned within ~10 urad to the trajectory of the particles (at p = 400 GeV/c); a compact goniometer was built to allow the correct angular alignment of the crystal with respect to the incoming beam with a precision of few urad.

Following the successful experimental demonstration of the concept with beam **; detailed tracking simulations have been performed to fully understand the results obtained. Further insights; such as the effective ZS width and its alignment; could be deduced by exploiting the response of the extraction loss as a function of the two degrees of freedom of the crystal (position and angle).

The octupoles distort the particle trajectories in phase space in such a way that the extracted separatrix is folded; which decreases the particle density impinging the wires of the extraction septum at the expense of increasing the extracted beam emittance. During experimental SPS machine studies a reduction of over 40% in the specific (per extracted proton) beam loss measured at the extraction septum was demonstrated.

A key issue of such facilities is the minimization of beam losses that could lead to excessive activation of beam line components. At HIPA; the SINQ beam line is particularly subject to relatively large losses since it receives the highly divergent beam scattered off a 40 or 60 mm thick muon production graphite target (TE). So far; for HIPA; beam line simulations have been carried out only by means of the matrix multiplication codes TRANSPORT and TURTLE. Although very efficient; such tools do not allow a precise determination of beam losses whenever targets and collimators are substantially affecting the beam optics. A true understanding of how beam halo and the low momentum tail contribute to the measured losses can only be achieved by complementing the traditional simulations techniques by a tool that can transport beam particles in different materials and; at the same time; handle complex geometries like the ones of collimators situated in the beam line. Moreover; such an improved beam line simulation would give a significant contribution in evaluating the feasibility of the SINQ beam rotation system currently under study. In this paper we present a simulation of the SINQ beam line combining MCNP models of TE and collimator sections with the TURTLE computation of the magnetic channel.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepmp038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepmp038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepmp038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPMP038,

The S30XL will operate parasitically to the FEL by extracting the unused low intensity 4-GeV LCLS-II bunches into the existing A-line and the End Station-A (ESA). This provides a unique capability of multi-GeV nearly continuous electron beam for a variety of HEP experiments; in particular the dark matter search experiments. The latter require a very low beam current ranging from pA to micro-A; as well as a large beam spot at the detector. The necessary beam shaping will be performed using spoilers and collimators in the A-line; and by optimizing the optics. FLUKA and elegant codes are used to generate and track the beam into the ESA.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepmp049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepmp049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepmp049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPMP049,

To increase the luminosity during collisions the number of circulating hadron bunches will increase to 330 and this requires a modification of the injection hadrons into the RHIC accelerator. This paper describes this injection scheme which is compatible with a design option which uses two hadron rings; one ring for accelerating the hadron beam and the other ring for storing the circulating beam to increase even further the integrated luminosity of the electron-hadron collisions.

The original 12 GeV beam delivery plan was for a maximum of three experimental halls at a time as in the 6 GeV era. Therefore; the new concept increases the po-tential beam time for the experiments up to 33%. This change; although a major improvement in operational capabilities; required only limited modifications to the existing machine. The modifications were mainly timing and pattern changes to the beams in the injector; adding a fourth laser to the photo-cathode gun; and the addition of new RF separators to the highest pass of CEBAF. These changes are now complete and; for the first time; the full system is operating; producing four simultaneous beams through the accelerator to four different destinations.

Recently; a CCC without a toroidal core and with an axially oriented magnetic shielding has been developed at the Institute of Photonic Technologies (IPHT) Jena/Germany. It represents a compact and lightweight alternative to the ’classical’ CCC; which was originally developed at PTB Braunschweig and is successfully in operation in accelerators at GSI and CERN. Excellent low-frequency noise performance was demonstrated with a prototype of this new CCC-type. Current measurements and further tests are ongoing; first results are presented together with simulation calculations for the magnetic shielding. The construction from lead as well as simplified manufacturing results in drastically reduced costs compared to formerly used Nb-CCCs. Reduced weight also puts less constraints on the cryostat. Based on highly sensitive SQUIDs; the new prototype device shows a current sensitivity of about 6 pA/Hz1/2 in the white noise region. The measured and calculated shielding factor is ~135 dB. These values; together with a significant cost reduction - resulting also from a compact cryostat design - opens up the way for widespread use of CCCs in modern accelerator facilities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepgw020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepgw020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepgw020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPGW020,

The aim is to acquire all pertinent accelerator system and beam parameters to facilitate a multi-mission of continuous performance tracking; (semi-)automated feedbacks and setup tools; early detection and isolation of hardware failures or near-misses; and to provide a dependable generic platform for equipment experts that enable post-mortem analyses or remote diagnostics. The goal of the controls integration was to provide a generic abstraction of the vendor-specific electro-mechanical form-factor and software interfaces based on modern software-defined-radio (SDR) principles. In addition to a ns-level-syncronised time- and frequency-domain based acquisitions; the interface provides a wide range of generic user-configurable signal post-processing routines common for SDRs and also found in many modern benchtop oscilloscopes; spectrum- or vector-network analysers. The acquired raw and derived signals are exported to the FAIR control system using a standardised front-end software architecture (FESA) and a common middle-ware (CMW). Further integration goals were to simplify possible future extensions; compactness; readability; reusability; testability; and long-term maintainability of the code-based which led to the re-use of established open-source signal processing and data fitting frameworks such as GNU-Radio and ROOT. While explicitly kept open for new or other specific digitizer or SDRs; the initial integration; prototyping; and testing have been done for the PS3000-; PS4000-; and PS600-series of digitizers from Pico Technology.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepgw021_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepgw021.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepgw021_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPGW021,

In order to measure such beam properties; OTR screens have to sustain thermal and mechanical stresses due to the energy that several bunches deposit. Owing to these requirements; it is essential to identify the more suitable material to optimize the OTR dimensions and to get reliable measures from the diagnostic system. In this paper; we describe a numerical procedure to choose the most performing material taking into account the physical requirements of a multi-bunch high brightness. The procedure is based on a dedicated ANSYS script able to evaluate the fatigue life time of the material considering a high number of thermal cycles generated by several bunches. The main characteristic of this script is the capability to simulate the real thermal and mechanical effect on the target that the hitting particle beam produces. The numerical procedure has been applied to compare the performance of three relevant materials-Aluminium; Silicon and Graphite simulating a beam hitting with well-known parameters.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepgw022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepgw022.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepgw022_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPGW022,

Recently; influence of filling pattern on the accuracy of the XBPMs became apparent; so that we started a systematic evaluation. It was found that the influence was caused by suppression of current signal due to space charge effect; which could be quantified by observing a behaviour of the current signal while changing the voltage of photoelectron collecting electrodes. In order to mitigate the space charge effect; we examined some methods; such as; changing operation parameters of the XBPMs and the undulators. As a result; we successfully reduced the influence of filling pattern.; * H.

On the SPring-8 up-grade project we have a plan to use the linac of SACLA as a full-energy injector of the storage ring. To achieve the SACLA’s user operation and the beam injection to the storage ring in parallel; it is necessary to control the beam energy and the peak current on a pulse by pulse. The demand for an injection occurs anytime during the top-up operation of the storage ring. For this purpose; two accel-erators should be controlled seamlessly and the SACLA has to provide the low emittance electron beam to gener-ate X-ray laser and to be an injector of the storage ring simultaneously. Because SACLA has to control the beam energy and peak current on a pulse by pulse; we are de-signing a system to meet these requirements. A master controller stores a pattern of parameters required for the low-level RF controllers. Each pattern consists of 60 rows which correspond to the parameters for one second with a beam repetition rate of the SACLA; 60Hz. The master sends the parameters to the controllers with reflective memory. We can select the pattern every second on de-mand and it is flexible enough for the top-up operation of the storage ring. Also the data of low-level RF and beam position monitor are stored into the database with a beam repetition rate.

The information of the bunch length measured by the BSM is useful to tune phases of the accelerating cavities in the linear accelerator. For example; in the J-PARC linac; three BSM’s using the tungsten wire are installed and tested at the ACS section to measure the bunch shapes between the accelerating cavities. However; this conventional BSM is hard to measure the bunch shape of H− beam with 3 MeV at the beam transport between the RFQ and DTL sections; because the wire is broken around the center region of the beam. The new BSM using the carbon-nano-tube (CNT) wire is being developed to be able to measure the bunch shape of the H− beam with 3 MeV. One challenge to introduce the CNT wire for the BSM is the measure to the discharge. The careful attention should be paid to apply the high voltage of 10 kV to the CNT wire. The several measures are taken to suppress the discharge from the wire and operate the CNT-BSM.

For the wire scanner; signal on the wire induced by the secondary electron is used for the profile measurement. Signal lost may happen when the wire or the signal chain shorted; thus a backup readout chain is required for the accident condition. As for the BLM; it is difficult to do the online calibration to see how sensitive the monitor is. Based on the two requests above; a crosscheck study was carried out recently; one wire scanner and the BLM next to it were chose at LINAC and RTBT. Both wire signal and BLM signal were recorded while the wire scanner crossing the beam. We found these two type of signals have the same accuracy for the profile measurement; and ~ 1 μA beam loss induced by the wire disturbance can be detected.

In order to cope with this issue; VIDICON cameras are presently used but their production has been nowadays discontinued worldwide. The development of an alternative beam imaging system is described here; based on radiation tolerant optical fibre bundles. Such an optical line relays the image of a scintillating screen to a standard CMOS camera; located away from the high radiation zone. A prototype system based on a 10m long bundle with 104 fibres has been tested in the TT2 transfer line at CERN. The light transmission is rather low; but is compensated by the sensitivity of the CMOS camera. The system had a field of view of 60 mm and a spatial resolution of ~1 mm. The radiation hardness of such a fiber bundle was tested at the IRMA-CEA facility in Saclay; France. The bundle was irradiated at a rate of 3.6 kGy/h for 8 consecutive day. The total integrated dose achieved was ~700 kGy; which corresponds to about ten years of operation at the beam imaging station with the highest radiation dose at CERN. While the light transmission was reduced by 50%; this is still adequate to provide acceptable images.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepgw078_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepgw078.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepgw078_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPGW078,

Simulations have shown that the profile of a coherent transition radiation (CTR) image produced by a charged particle beam is sensitive to bunch length and can thus be used as a diagnostic. This contribution presents the development progress of a novel bunch length monitor based on imaging the spatial distribution of CTR. Due to the bunch lengths studied; 10fs-100fs FWHM; the radiation of interest was in the THz range. This led to the development of a THz imaging system; which can be applied to both high and low energy electron beams.

The main purpose of the orbit FF table is to suppress orbit disturbance around a storage ring; caused by the gap/phase motion of an ID. A conventional procedure is to measure a closed orbit at a reference ID gap/phase state; and another one at a different state; with all types of orbit feedback (FB) systems disabled. Based on the difference orbit; the correction currents for the local ID correctors are estimated to cancel the global orbit distortion. The new method instead utilizes the orbit deviation at the beam position monitors within an ID straight section (ID BPMs) with respect to a dynamically changing orbit that is defined by the orbit at two BPMs bounding the ID straight. Correction currents are determined such that this orbit deviation at the ID BPMs is minimized. Being impervious to transverse kicks external to this bounded region; this measurement can be performed with a global orbit FB system turned on; which could allow parallel table generation for multiple IDs.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepgw101_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepgw101.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepgw101_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPGW101,

The risk of damage on the ring vacuum chambers by the continuing orbit drift without explanation eventually forced us to take emergency study shifts and temporarily lock out the C04 IVU beamline.

While out of time beam is not a particular concern to this experiment; it is a key issue for the subsequent Mu2e rare muon decay experiment; which will use the same bunch formation procedure. Our measurement relies on a statistical technique; in which a small fraction of the beam is scattered from the primary collimation foil in the recycler; and then is detected by a charge telescope consisting of quartz Cherenkov radiators and photomultiplier tubes. By integrating over many revolutions; the time profile of longitudinal halo (out-of-time beam) can be measured down to less than a 10-5 fractional level; relative to in-time beam.

The transparent spin mode; a concept inspired by the figure 8 ring design of JLEIC; is a novel technique for preservation and control of electron and ion spin polarizations in a collider or storage ring. It makes the ring lattice ""invisible"" to the spin and allows for polarization control by small quasi-static magnetic fields with practically no effect on the beam’s orbital characteristics. It offers unique opportunities for polarization maintenance and control in Jefferson Lab’s JLEIC and in BNL’s eRHIC.

Due to a large asymmetry in the electron and ion momenta in an EIC; the particles associated with the initial ion tend to go at very small angles and have small rigidity offsets with respect to the initial ion beam. They are detected after they pass through the apertures of the final focusing quadrupoles. Therefore; the apertures must be sufficiently large to provide the acceptance required by experiments. In addition; to maximize the luminosity; the final focusing quadrupoles must be placed as close to the interaction point as possible. A combination of these requirements presents serious detection; optics and engineering design challenges. We present a design of a full-acceptance interaction region of Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC). The paper presents how this design addresses the above requirements up to an ion momentum of 200 GeV/c.

The spin tune in the ST mode is zero and the spin motion becomes degenerate: any spin direction repeats every particle turn. In contrast; the lattice of a conventional collider determines a unique stable periodic spin direction; so that the collider operates in the Preferred Spin (PS) mode. Contributions of perturbing magnetic fields to the spin resonance strengths in the PS mode are usually calculated using the spin response function. However; in that form; it is not applicable in the ST mode. This paper presents a response function formalism expanded for the ST mode of operation of conventional colliders with two identical Siberian snakes in the highly-relativistic limit.

The machine is composed of a 50/70 MeV injector Linac and a storage ring where an electron bunch collides with a laser pulse accumulated in a Fabry-Perot resonator. The final goal is to provide an X-rays average flux of 1012-1013 ph/s. A demonstrator was funded and is being built on the Orsay university campus. The S-band injector Linac consists of 2.5 cell photocathode RF gun and a TW accelerating section. During the commissioning phase; a standard LIL S-band accelerating section is able to achieve around 50 MeV corresponding to around 45 keV X-rays energy. Since the maximum targeted X-ray energy is 90 keV; the development of a new S-band accelerating section; intended to replace the LIL structure; will provide an electron beam energy of 70 MeV. This requires essentially the development of more reliable high gradient compact S band accelerating section. Such design is tailored for high gradient operation; low breakdown rates.

Thus it is a demanding challenge to measure its actual internal cavity surface shape after the complete preparation process with a resolution; sufficiently high (better than 0.2 mm) to serve as input for meaningful comparative field simulations. First tests with a vendor’s on-site X-ray source; operating at X-ray energies up to 590 keV revealed an insufficient resolution of the inner surface; attributed to the unfavorable X-ray damping characteristics of niobium. This was overcome with the aid of an accelerator-based source (X-ray spectrum up to 9 MeV); operated by Fraunhofer IIS; Fürth; Germany.

The proposed mode launcher exploits a fourfold symmetry which minimizes both the dipole and the quadrupole fields in order to mitigate the emittance growth in the early stages of the acceleration process. Two identical aluminum mode launchers have been assembled and measured in back-to-back configurations for three different central waveguide lengths. From the back-to-back results we infer the performance of each mode launcher. The low power RF test; performed at the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (INFN-LNS); validate both the numerical simulations and the quality of fabrication.

The cavity; which is driven by a vacuum tube amplifier; has a wideband frequency response and the beam loading in the cavity is multiharmonic. Therefore; the tube must generate a multiharmonic output current. An LTspice circuit model is developed to analyze the vacuum tube operation and the compensation of the multiharmonic beam loading. The model includes the cavity; tube amplifier; beam current; and LLRF feedback control. The feedback control consists of the I/Q demodulator including low pass filters; PI control; and I/Q modulator.

Directional coupler may be a three-port component or a four-port component with certain specification such as frequencies; bandwidth and structure. To meet the requirements of stable coupling degree and high directivity; we designed two types of directional coupler working at 11.424 GHz with high power handling capacity. One consists of two parallel rectangular waveguides with four holes drilled along the central line of the narrow-wall for coupling the electromagnetic power from the main-waveguide to the sub-waveguide which is called H-plane directional coupler. Simulations show that the coupling degree of H-face directional coupler is 49.9 dB and the directivity is 54.5 dB .The peak electric field is about 29MV/m while operating at 200 MW peak power. The other consists of a circular main-waveguide transmitting TM01 mode and a rectangular sub-waveguide transmitting TE10 mode; called circular-rectangle waveguide directional coupler. These two waveguide are connected by six holes drilled on the side of the circular main-waveguide and along the central line of the wide-wall of the sub-waveguide. The coupling degree of this directional coupler is 50.14 dB and the directivity is 37.93 dB due to the simulation. The bandwidth is about 800MHz. The peak electric field is 404.5V/m while operating at 200 MW peak power. Comparing with the H-plane directional coupler; peak electric field of this directional coupler is lower. Low peak electric field can reduce the risk of RF breakdown and the Multipactor effect; which ensures the stable high power operation of the directional coupler.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/weprb052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/weprb052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/weprb052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPRB052,

Until now; the bunching cell of the linac has a full-cell geometry. However; to maximize the acceleration of electrons after emission from the electron gun; the geometry of the first bunching cell is modified from a full-cell to a half cell. To accelerate electron beams more gently; recently; we increased the total number of bunching cells from 1.5 to 2.5.

Resulting from the capture of field emitted electrons; dark current produces additional radiation that needs to be accounted for in experiments. In this paper; an analysis of dark current is presented for four accelerating structures that were tested and conditioned in CERN’s X-band test facility for CLIC. The dependence on power; and therefore on accelerating gradient; of the dark current signals is presented. The Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission seems to be in accordance with the experimental data.

The third harmonic cavity at ALBA will be used to increase the bunch length in order to improve the beam lifetime and increase the beam stability thresholds. The main advantage of an active third harmonic cavity is that optimum conditions can be reached for any beam current. This paper presents the evolution of the preliminary design of this cavity and its trans-dampers: high order modes coaxial dampers with waveguide transitions to N; which allows extracting the power of the high order modes induced by the beam outside of the cavity and to dissipate it using standard loads. This approach has two main advantages: no ferrites brazing is needed and they provide a diagnostic to analyze the beam dynamics.

In the first approach; MgB2 powder dispersed in acetone was used as an electrolytic medium. Application of a DC voltage of 400 V between a graphite anode and a Copper film (serving as cathode); with the electrode distance maintained at ~2cm; resulted in the electrochemical deposition of MgB2 on the Cu surface. In an alternate approach; MgB2 in powder form was used directly for sputtering based deposition. The powder was initially compacted to form a thin layer that served as the magnetron target. Application of a pulsed DC power of 25W for 4 hours yielded MgB2 thin film on Si substrates. Samples were characterized by XPS analysis to ascertain their elemental composition; which confirmed the presence of Mg and B; in addition to traces of C and O as impurities.

High brightness beams essentially consist of a large number of electrons in a small phase space volume; i.e. a high peak current. When such beams are generated from the cathode; there is a strong space charge force; which elongates the bunch and reduces its brightness. An optimal solution is to raise the accelerating voltage in the gun. However; the maximum gradient is limited by the effects of RF breakdown. The probability of RF breakdown is reduced as the RF pulse length decreases. We present a development of an electron photoinjector operating with short RF pulse; 10 ns scale. We have designed an X-band gun including the RF design; beam quality optimization; and engineering. The gun will be fed by 10 ns; 300 MW RF pulse generated at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility for two-beam acceleration experiments.

CW regime can in principle be realized with normal conducting structures provided the shunt impedance is high. Such structures can be designed using dielectrics (ultra-pure ceramics in C-band and diamond in mm-waves) with ultra-low loss tangent (~10-6). The use of dielectrics allows to concentrate the electromagnetic energy density in the dielectric region and thus minimize fields and ohmic loss on metallic walls. The thermal loss in dielectric can be relatively low given the loss tangent is small. We report here the design of structures with shunt impedance on the order of 104 MOhm/m; which is several orders of magnitude higher than shut impedance in copper structures in GHz and THz range. High shunt impedance makes it possible to accelerate electrons to 1 MeV using kW-level CW RF sources like magnetrons in C-band and gyrotrons in THz range.

The field non-uniformity across the beam aperture in the crabbing cavities produces higher order multipole components; similar to that which are present in magnets. Knowledge of higher order mode multipole field effects is important for accurate beam dynamics study for the crabbing system. In this paper; we quantify the multipole components and analyse their effects on the beam dynamics.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/weprb076_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/weprb076.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/weprb076_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPRB076,

One of the HOM couplers is an rf filter; which is a high pass filter designed to couple to the horizontal dipole modes and accelerating modes up to 2 GHz; while rejecting the fundamental operating mode at 400 MHz. The coupler consists of a high pass filter circuit where the rejection of the operating mode and transmission of HOMs are sensitive to dimensional deviations. An rf test box has been designed to measure the transmission of the rf filter in order to qualify the fabricated HOM coupler and to tune the coupler. This paper presents the measurements of the HOM coupler with the rf test box.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/weprb077_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/weprb077.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/weprb077_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPRB077,

While much of the recent R&D focus has been on materials and surface science; our aim is to optimize the cavity geometry to maximize performance with current materials. The recent demonstration of a highly efficient parallel-feed normal-conducting RF structure at SLAC has served as a proof-of-concept. Instead of coupled elliptical cells; the structure employs isolated re-entrant cells. To feed RF power to the cavities; each cell is directly coupled to an integrated manifold. The structure is made in two parts; split along the beam axis; which are then joined. Applied to SRF; simulations suggest such a structure could nearly double the achievable gradient; while reducing cryogenic RF loss by more than half. We are experimentally verifying the concept using an X-band SRF design to be tested at SLAC.,"Funding: Research funded by a SLAC Laboratory-Directed Research and Development award, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, contract number DE-AC02-76SF00515",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/weprb090_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/weprb090.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/weprb090_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPRB090,

To meet those; it is necessary to optimize or develop new methods for the control systems. One of the difficulties lies in the relatively long computation time of current beam dynamics codes. In this context; the very low computation time of neural network is of great attraction. However; a neural network has to be trained in order to be of any use. The training of a beam dynamic predictor uses a large dataset (experimental or simulated) that represents the dynamics over the parameter space of interest. Therefore; choosing the right training dataset is crucial for the quality of the neural network predictions. In this work; a study on the sampling choice for the training data is performed to train a neural network to predict the transmission of a beam through a low energy beam transport line and a Radiofrequency Quadrupole.

In order to accelerate the required 125mA/40 MeV continuous deuteron beam from 5 MeV to 40 MeV; a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) linac; housed in five cryomodules; is proposed. The design is based on two beta families (β=0.11 and β=0.17) of half-wave resonators (HWR) at 175MHz. The transverse focusing is achieved using one solenoid coil per focusing period. This paper presents the extensive multiparticle beam dynamics simulations that have been performed to adapt the beam along the SRF-linac in such a high space charge regime. As one of the constraints of the IFMIF linac is a low level of beam losses; specific optimizations have been done to minimize the beam occupancy in the line (halo).

The latter relies on the surface barrier potentials of the cathode material at a fixed wavelength of the incident light; and is thus significantly influenced by the presence of strong rf and beam self-fields at / close to the cathode surface. This is; in particular; the case in high brightness injectors for modern free electron lasers. In this article; the beam self-fields are determined in a self-consistent approach; based on which improved transverse and temporal emission distributions are obtained. The nonlinear correlations of the intrinsic surface slice emittance within the bunch are shown for multiple bunch charges. A peak to peak variation of the intrinsic surface emittance is estimated as 30\% for the highest charge-density case considered in this paper. An overall reduction of the average intrinsic emittance is computed as 10\% accordingly. The cooling effect on the cathode surface is enhanced as the local space-charge density rises. Furthermore; the impacts of the cooling effect on downstream beam qualities are demonstrated through particle tracking simulations based on the injector setup at the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepts013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepts013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepts013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPTS013,

The instability leads to a charge modulation in the longitudinal phase space. The resulting substructures on the longitudinal bunch profile vary over time and lead to fluctuations in the emitted power of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). To study the underlying longitudinal dynamics on a turn-by-turn basis; the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator) provides a wide variety of diagnostic systems. By synchronizing the single-shot electro-optical spectral decoding setup (longitudinal profile); the bunch-by-bunch THz detection systems (THz power) and the horizontal bunch size measurement setup (energy spread); three important properties of the bunch during this instability can be measured at every turn for long time scales. This allows a deep insight into the dynamics of the bunch under the influence of the microbunching instability. This contribution will discuss effects like the connection between the emitted CSR power and the deformations in the longitudinal bunch profile on the time scale of the instability.,Funding: This work has been supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Grant No. 05K16VKA).

The periodic nature of the external focusing potential can give rise to serious ion losses under a specific condition. The loss mechanism is essentially the same as the coherent betatron resonance well-known in intense beam dynamics[*; **]. In fact; the collective motion of an ion plasma in the LPT is shown equivalent to that of a charged-particle beam traveling through an alternating-gradient focusing lattice. In the present study; we perform the direct measurement of low-order coherent oscillation modes in the LPT by detecting image currents induced on the electrodes’ surfaces. The four-rod structure of the LPT allows us to pick up feeble signals of the dipole and quadrupole oscillations of a plasma bunch.

The Simulator of Particle Orbit Dynamics (S-POD) is a compact apparatus designed on the basis of this fact for diverse beam-physics experiments. We have so far employed Ar+ ions that can readily be produced from neutral Ar gas atoms through the electron bombardment process. A space-charge-induced tune shift of up to about 20% of the bare tune can be achieved in Ar+ plasmas [*]. We are now preparing for future S-POD experiment to explore even higher beam-density regions. For this purpose; a large number of Ca+ ions need to be stored in the LPT. Since S-POD is equipped with a powerful laser cooler for Ca+; the use of this ion species vastly expands the density range we can survey. The production of an intense bunch of Ca+ ions is; however; not so easy because of some technical reasons. By optimizing the operating condition of a multi-sectioned LPT; we succeeded in increasing the number of accumulated Ca+ ions to the level comparable to Ar+ ion plasmas.

It is generally chosen on the tune diagram such that the so-called ""incoherent tune spread"" of a stored beam does not overlap with low-order ""single-particle resonance"" lines. We here propose a new approach to construct the stability tune diagram on the basis of the self-consistent coherent picture. The betatron resonance condition recently conjectured from one-dimensional Vlasov predictions is employed for this purpose; which predicts the existence of twice as many resonance stop bands as expected from the well-known incoherent resonance condition at high beam density *; **. The proposed general rules for the stability-chart construction are very simple and free from any model-dependent unobservables like space-charge-depressed incoherent tunes. As an example; we apply the present rules to the lattice of the rapid cycling synchrotron at J-PARC and explain why the operating bare tunes of this machine have been chosen slightly below 6.5 in both transverse directions.; * K.

A clear dynamical analogy between the DTL system and compact Paul ion-trap system is pointed out; which indicates that we can conduct a fundamental design study of high-intensity hadron linacs experimentally in a local tabletop environment instead of relying on large-scale machines.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepts023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepts023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepts023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPTS023,

Achieving this goal requires using momentum slip-stacking in the SPS; the LHC injector. Slip-stacking will be applied on an intermediate energy plateau to interleave two batches; reducing the bunch spacing from 100 ns to 50 ns and thus increasing the total number of bunches injected into the LHC. Realistic macro-particle simulations; with the present SPS impedance model are used to study and design this complicated beam manipulation. Slip-stacking can be tested experimentally only after the upgrade of the SPS 200 MHz RF system; in 2021. Preliminary; slip-stacking related beam measurements were performed at the end of 2018. In this paper both macro-particle simulations and beam measurements are reported with emphasis given on optimisation of the process; crucial to achieve the required HL-LHC parameters (bunch lengths; beam losses).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepts039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepts039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepts039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPTS039,

A large number of electrons impacting on the beam screens of the cold magnets induces significant heat load; reaching values close to the full cooling capacity available from the cryogenic system. Interestingly; it is observed that parts of the machine that are by design identical show very different heat loads. We used numerical simulations to investigate the possibility that these differences are induced by different surface properties; in particular maximum Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) for the different cryomagnets. Using the PyECLOUD code; the electron cloud build-up was simulated assuming different values of SEY in the LHC cold magnets. Comparing the measured heat loads to the simulation results for the 25 ns beams at 450 GeV we have identified the SEY values that match the observations in these conditions. These SEY values were found to be in good agreement with the heat loads measured with different beam configurations (changing the bunch pattern; the bunch intensity and the beam energy).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/wepts051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/wepts051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/wepts051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-WEPTS051,

The creation of geometries is a significant bottleneck in producing complete simulation models and reducing the effort required will provide the ability of non-experts to simulate the effects of beam losses on realistic accelerators. The paper describes a flexible and easy to use Python package to create geometries usable by either Geant4 (and so BDSIM or G4Beamline) or FLUKA either from scratch or by conversion from common engineering formats; such as STEP or IGES created by industry standard CAD/CAM packages. The conversion requires an intermediate conversion to STL or similar triangular or tetrahedral tessellation description. A key capability of pyg4ometry is to mix GDML/STEP/STL geometries and visualisation of the resulting geometry and determine if there are any geometric overlaps.

A strong wakefield induced energy modulation can be produced using a dielectric lined waveguide; the resultant micro-bunched beam is capable of producing coherent terahertz radiation *. We report on observation of energy modulation due to self-wakefields in a few picosecond duration and ~1 nC charge electron bunches of LUCX facility at KEK. To produce the modulation; we used a corrugated dielectric waveguide with an inner radius of 2 mm and a period of corrugation of 10 mm. In this case; the period of corrugation is longer than the wavelength of the main accelerating mode.

Through use of a special magnetic element the ring is designed to induce a large tune spread with amplitude while maintaining integrable motion. This will allow for the suppression of instabilities in high-intensity beams without significant reduction in dynamic aperture. One important aspect of this is the nonlinear decoherence that occurs when a beam is injected off axis or receives a transverse kick while circulating in the ring. This decoherence has been studied in detail; with simulations; for protons in IOTA both with and without space-charge. However; it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally.

To achieve this; preservation of the phase space density of the electron bunch during acceleration and compression is absolutely necessary. The LCLS-II-HE is designed to transport a 100 pC bunch with an emittance of ~0.3 mm-mrad with minimal emittance dilution. However; in simulations starting from a normalized emittance on the order of 0.1 mm-mrad; the emittance growth is significant. In this paper; the sources of emittance growth are studied along the accelerator; in particular; around the laser-heater; the two bunch compressors. We have investigated mechanisms of emittance growth such as space charge; coherent synchrotron radiation; chromatic aberration; and spurious dispersion. Due to the extremely small emittance from the injector; 3-D space charge effect is important to determine the space charge dominated region and emittance dominated region. With this understanding; emittance preservation schemes are proposed.

Nowadays; wake potential is mostly predictable by 3D codes. Analytical prediction of impedance theories can be helpful as a side solution. On the other hand; some asymmetries in the geometry of components might make troubles and lead to imprecise numerical results in 3D simulations. Analytical approximation of discontinuities; holes; and grooves can give us an estimation of expected results and can be used as a benchmark in the case that we do not have any experimental data. To clarify the validity of theoretical expressions; general discontinuities are simulated in CST. The comparison of final results is presented here.

In order to simulate the lattice with such wigglers; it is useful to be able to model the effect of the wiggler on the optics without resorting to direct tracking; which is time-consuming and so ill-suited for the repeated evaluations necessary in running an optimizer.

Polarized deuteron and proton beams were obtained at the intensity of 2×109 ppp and 108 ppp; respectively. The injection with RF adiabatic capture was used in two last Nuclotron runs where C6+; Xe42+; Kr26+ and Ar16+ ion beams were accelerated. The resonant stochastic extraction (RF knockout technique) was realized. The complex is now used for fixed target experiments with extracted beams and experiments with an internal target. In the near future; the Nuclotron will be the main synchrotron of the NICA collider facility being constructed at JINR. The installation in the Nuclotron of beam injection system from the Booster and of the fast extraction system in the Collider are required for its operation in the NICA complex.

It is critical to demonstrate experimentally cooling by a bunched electron beam and to benchmark the experimental data with simulations. Such experimental and simulation studies were carried out by a collaboration of Jefferson Lab and Institute of Modern Physics (IMP); utilizing a DC cooler at IMP. The thermionic gun of the DC cooler was modified by pulsing its grid voltage to produce cooling electron pulses in a pulse length range of 0.07 - 3.5 µs; with a 250 kHZ repetition frequency. The performed experiments clearly demonstrated cooling of a RF focused ion bunches by this pulsed electron beam. The momentum spread of cooled ion bunch has been reduced from ~2x10-3 to ~6x10-4 in less than 0.5 second. The simulation results agree with the measurements qualitatively.

In addition; carbon and proton beams; the latter with up to 800 MeV; will be provided to a fourth room dedicated to research. After beam generation and pre-acceleration to 7MeV; a 77m long synchrotron accelerates particles up to the requested energy for clinical treatment. A third-order resonance extraction method is used to extract the particles from the synchrotron in a slow controlled process and then transfer the particles to the 4 irradiation rooms with a spill time of 0.1-10 seconds to facilitate the control of the delivered radiation dose during clinical treatments.

In 2018; mass-production of zirconium-89 (Zr-89) is successfully achieved. Zr-89 has a half-life of 3.3 days which is well matched to the circulation half-lives of antibodies. In addition; long-term proton irradiation for the production of germanium-68 (Ge-68); which is one of the typical generator RIs; was also carried out. A generator is a device used to extract the positron-emitting daughter radioisotope from a source of the decaying parent radioisotope which has a relatively long half-life. Furthermore; we are trying to optimize irradiation conditions for the RI production and following processes after the irradiation.

The project includes two variable-gap; hybrid-permanent-magnet undulator lines: A soft x-ray undulator line with 21 undulator segments optimized for a photon energy range from 0.2 keV to 1.3 keV and a hard x-ray undulator line with 32 undulator segments designed for a photon energy range from 1.0 keV to 25.0 keV. This paper focuses on the design; development; and performance of the hard x-ray undulator line which utilizes uniquely-developed; vertically-polarizing undulators. To fully compensate the magnetic force throughout the entire gap range these devices incorporate non-linear spring systems which permit the construction of relatively compact undulators.

Injectors will need to supply full-current bunch replacement in the ring with high single-bunch charge for swap-out. For upgrades of existing light sources; such as the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U); it is economical to retain the existing injector infrastructure and make appropriate improvements. The challenges to these improvements include achieving high single-bunch charge in the presence of instabilities; beam loading; charge stability and reliability. In this paper; we discuss the rationale for the injector upgrades chosen for APS-U; as well as backup and potential alternate schemes.

Hara et al.; Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 21; 040701 (2018).,,"We have an upgrade plan of the SPring-8 storage ring to provide much more brilliant X-rays with a low-emittance electron beam. Since the upgraded ring requires a low-emittance injection beam, we are planning to timeshare the linac of the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facility, SACLA, as an injector for the upgraded ring. The SACLA linac delivers low-emittance and short-bunch electron beams to two XFEL beamlines with a 60 Hz repetition rate. The beam route is right now equally changed by a kicker magnet at a switchyard. The beam parameter is also optimized for each XFEL beamline by changing RF parameters pulse-by-pulse with simple software at this moment*. Since the number of beam injection shots to the storage ring is much less frequent than XFEL shots, one of the XFEL shots must be overridden by an injection with on-demand basis. In addition, the beam quality, such as 1 mm mrad normalized emittance, 10 fs bunch length and 10 kA peak current, must be maintained not to deteriorate the XFEL performance. Therefore, we have developed an on-demand beam route and RF parameter switching system with sufficient speed, precision and reliability. A beam route data is transmitted to each accelerator unit by a reflective memory network, and special software changes the parameters of each accelerator unit pulse-by-pulse according to the received data. We tested the on-demand switching system at a test bench and the SACLA linac. The beam parameters were appropriately controlled with a negligible failure rate. The user service of the beam injection from SACLA to SPring-8 is scheduled in 2020 and the on-demand switching system is almost ready for the time-sharing operation of multiple XFEL beamlines and a SPring-8 injection.",https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thyypls1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thyypls1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thyypls1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THYYPLS1,

Modern heavy ion accelerator facilities such as the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI provide for high intensity heavy ion beams beyond 200 MeV/u. Heavy ion stripping at a lower energy enables more efficient acceleration up to the final beam energy; compared to acceleration of ions with a low charge state. Due to the high power deposited by the heavy ions in the stripping media and radiation damages if a solid target is used; self-recovering stripper media must be applied. General implementation options for different stripper target media are discussed in this paper; as well as general considerations to optimize the Linac layout through the appropriate choice of stripping medium and stripping energy. The driver Linac for the Dubna Electron-Radioactive Isotope Collider fAcility (DERICA) project; recently initiated by JINR; is foreseen to provide for 100 MeV/u Uranium beam in continuous wave mode.

In order to reduce the size; the weight and operation cost; two superconducting coils are designed to implement the 2.35T central field. And the magnet weight is about 90 tons. The constant gap between the sectors is considered without deteriorating the beam stability. A dedicated design on extraction zone is performed to make the average field to close the isochronous field. The extraction efficiency is expected higher than 80%; by regulating the 1st harmonic field and arranging the extraction elements properly. In order to avoid the large scale of volume helium explosion in the quench; the low temperature superconducting coil using NbTi/Cu wire is cooled by 4K GM Cryocooler in a helium volume limiting design.

BDSIM is a code for the simulation of energy deposition and charged particle backgrounds in accelerators that uses the Geant4 physics library. Geant4 includes a broad range of ion elastic and inelastic interactions and allows the definition of partially stripped ion beams. However; no models are currently available to handle in-flight interactions involving the bound electrons. In this paper we present a semi-empirical model of beam ion stripping by material atoms that is implemented in BDSIM as an extension of Geant4’s existing physics processes and is fully integrated into a comprehensive set of matter interactions for partially stripped ions.

Simulations have shown that as much as seven times the energy that was extracted from used fuel from light water reactors can be produced by this method before the accelerator demands significant power from the reactor. Once the fuel rods have been converted from oxide ceramics to fluoride salts; in a process that is proliferation resistant (not chemical reprocessing); the fuel can be burned for centuries without increasing its volume while reducing its radio-toxicity.

In the laser stripping experiments recently carried out at SNS; an ultra-violet (UV) laser was used to excite the electrons in 1-GeV hydrogen atoms from the n=1 state to the n=3 state. In this talk; we propose a sequential resonant excitation scheme by using two laser beams to excite electrons in a sequence of two steps: from the n=1 state to the n=2 state and from the n=2 state to any higher state. The advantages of the sequential resonant excitation scheme include (1) lower laser power requirement due to higher transition probability in the first excitation step and (2) possibility of shifting the stripping laser wavelength from UV regime to longer wavelengths. An application of the sequential resonant excitation scheme in combination with the double-resonance optical cavity technology to the laser stripping of 1.3-GeV H− beam (envisioned in the SNS proton power upgrade project) will be described.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpmp049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpmp049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpmp049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPMP049,

Among other things; its 7.2 hour half life is long enough to allow for recovery and labeling; but short enough to avoid long term activity in patients. Unfortunately; the only practical technique for its production is to bombard a 209-Bi target with a ~29 MeV alpha beam; so it is not accessible to commercial isotope production facilities; which all use fixed energy proton beams. The US Department of Energy is therefore supporting the development of a ""University Isotope Network"" (UIN) to satisfy this need. Our prposoal is to retrofit the variable-energy; multi-species cyclotron at the Crocker Nuclear Laboratory at the University of California Davis with an internal Bi-209 target; such that we can put at least 100 uA of 29 MeV alpha particles on target without concerns about extraction efficiency. Using very conservative assumptions; we are confident we will be able to produce 60 mCi of 211-At in solution in an eight hour shift; which includes setup; exposure; and chemical recovery.

By applying online optimiza-tion; we achieve minimum beam sizes 75 µm from 1 to 13 pC; two orders of magnitude higher charge density than previously achieved using conventional solenoid tech-nique.

This imaging technique requires a proton beam of 330 MeV incident kinetic energy for adult patients. Employing superconducting technology in the beam delivery system allows it to be of comparable size to a conventional proton therapy gantry. A superconducting bending magnet design for a proton computed tomography gantry is proposed in this paper. The 30 deg; 3.9 T canted-cosine-theta dipole wound with NbTi wires is used to steer 330 MeV protons in an isocentric beam delivery system which rotates around the patient. Two methods of magnetic field shielding are compared in the context of proton therapy facility requirements; traditional passive shielding with an iron yoke placed around the magnet and an active shielding option utilising extra layers of the superconducting coil.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpmp054_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpmp054.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpmp054_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPMP054,

The drawback is a relatively higher energy spread and especially a huge beam divergence at the plasma exit; leading to an irremediable and strong emittance degradation right after its extraction from the plasma for transferring it to an application or another plasma stage. In this article; we determine the criteria to be achieved so as to minimize this emittance growth after pointing out all the parameters involved in its mechanism. Then the plasma down ramp profile is studied in a typical configuration of the EuPRAXIA project at 5 GeV. It turns out that no specific profile is needed. For minimizing emittance growth at beam extraction; it is enough to optimize the ramp length so that the Twiss parameter γ is minimized. Finally the design of an optimal transfer line allows showing that the emittance growth can be contained to less than 10% in realistic conditions when transferring the beam to a free electron laser.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpgw006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpgw006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpgw006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPGW006,

The RAFFIA employs 4 bending magnets with gradient in the main pole face and reverse field strip at its front side which generate strong focusing in both planes. Beam dynamics properties of the RAFFIA of 140 MeV for C-60 have been evaluated by linear optics. The result has been confirmed with a help of 3D macro-particle computer simulation**. It is identified that the issue of COD generated from field non-uniformity associated with a finite size of the bending magnet is inherent. The programmed COD correction by steering magnets are discussed as well as the importance of uniformity in the magnet field profile. So far it has been unknown what beam current is acceptable in the RAFFIA. In order to estimate space-charge effects in the RAFFIA under design; the 2D core (σ) evolution equation has been derived from the envelope equation perturbed by space-charge fields. Resonant structures and chaotic motion in the phase space of (σ; σ’) have been clarified as a function of beam current. Those results were justified by macro-particle tracking based on a renormalized transfer matrix approach***. As a result; it turns out that the 8+ C-60 beam of 200 uA is acceptable.; * K.Takayama; et. al; Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 18; 050101 (2015).  ** Taufik; et. al; sub. to Phys. Rev.

In particular: 10 magnetic triplets were replaced with higher gradient ones; two cryomodules with quarter wave resonator were moved from the PIAVE injector to ALPI; so as to make them available both for exotic and stable beams; the cryogenic plant was renovat-ed; the whole linac; its injector and its beam lines were eventually realigned via LASER tracking (LT). The ex-pected outcome of the refurbishment project is a larger beam transmission (crucial for the efficient transport of the unavoidably low current exotic beams) and improved overall reliability so as to further extend the lifetime of an already 25 years old machine.

When the electron beam is tilted by half of the collision angle; the scat-tered X-rays becomes the largest. Calculation shows that more than threefold luminosity will be achieved in our system and could be larger luminosity depending on the beam parameters. The intensity of scattered light can be efficiently enhanced by using a collision laser with high intensity; high quality and ultrashort pulse duration. Thus; we have introduced a regenera-tive amplifier using ceramics thin-disk as a collision laser and developed a dedicated laser system.

One existing moderation method involves the use of wide-band-gap materials as moderators such as rare gas solids and solid nitrogen thin films (band-gap energy between 11 eV and 22 eV). Based on this moderation method; we have studied the use of helium gas as a moderator; with the goal of producing the slow muon beam more efficiently. Because of helium’s high (24.6 eV) ionization energy and because the cross section for muonium formation is suppressed in helium gas; we expect the production of slow muons using helium gas to be highly efficient.,"Funding: This work is supported by CAS, National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11875281), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M650845)",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpgw039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpgw039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpgw039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPGW039,

As we know; the beam parameters，including the current profile; strongly depend on the injection process. To explore the underlying physics and optimize beam parameters in PBAs; a temporal characterization is highly required for different injection schemes. Based on coherent transition radiation(CTR) method; the preliminary experiment to measure beam temporal profiles from both self-injection and ionization injection schemes in a single-shot mode has been performed at Tsinghua University. And the simulations using the similar experimental parameters have been performed to interpret the different injection processes; which show some agreement with the experimental results; especially for the features of bunch durations,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpgw048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpgw048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpgw048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPGW048,

Electron bunches are produced using an RF-gun equipped with a Cs2Te photocathode illuminated by an ultraviolet (UV) laser pulse. To generate the UV laser beam a fraction of the infrared (IR) laser beam used for ionization of rubidium is extracted from the laser system; time-compressed to a picosecond scale and frequency tripled using nonlinear crystals. The transport line of the laser beam over the 20 m distance was built using rigid supports for mirrors and air-evacuated tube to prevent any possible beam pointing instabilities due to vibrations and air convection. Construction of the UV beam optical system enables appropriate beam shaping and control of its size and position on the cathode; as well as time delay with respect to the IR pulse; i.e. with respect to the plasma wakefield seeder.

The requirement for CLIC main beam quadrupole (MBQ) alignment is positioning to within 1 µm from target in 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) with ± 3 mm travel. After motion; the position should be kept passively while the system’s fundamental frequency is above 100 Hz. Cam movers are considered for the task. Traditionally they are used for the alignment of heavier magnets with lower accuracy and stiffness requirement. This paper presents a new CLIC prototype cam mover with design emphasis on the fundamental frequency. A finite element method (FEM) model predicts the mode shapes and eigenfrequencies of the system and can be used for further improving the design. Experimental modal analysis (EMA) of the prototype shows that the prototype’s fundamental frequency is at 44 Hz.

The position of devices, such as magnets and collimators, has to be adjusted in a fast and ergonomic way to decrease the ionizing dose received by the personnel. Each equipment type has its own unique set of requirements such as the weight, or the desired position accuracy. The two opposite approaches are, on one hand, a simple and time-consuming manual adjustment, using regulating screws and shims, and, on the other hand, the use of precise and expensive automatic positioning stages and platforms. In the frame of the High Luminosity LHC project, in order to fulfill the safety and technical requirements of alignment for lightweight components, a standardized system is under development. It will provide easy, low-cost and fast adjustment capability for several types of components that could be embarked on it.

In parallel; numerical tools have been developed in order to optimize the setup configuration and the analysis of the expected results. The most important issue when dealing with numerical simulation over such large interaction distances is to obtain a good accuracy at a limited computing cost in order to be able to perform parametric studies. Reduction of the computational cost can be obtained either by using state-of-the-art numerical technics and/or by introducing adapted approximation in the physical model. Concerning LPA; the relevant Maxwell-Vlasov equations can be numerically solved by Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods without any additional approximation; but can be very computationally expensive. On the other hand; the quasi-static approximation ***; which yields a drastic reduction of the computational cost; appears to be well adapted to the LPA regime. In this paper we present a detailed comparison of the performance; in terms of CPU; of LPA calculations and of the accuracies of their results obtained either with a highly optimized PIC code (FBPIC **) or with the well known quasi-static code WAKE ***. We first show that; when considering a sufficiently low charge bunch for which the beam loading effect can be neglected; the quasi-static approximation is fully validated in the LPA regime. The case of a higher bunch charge; with significant beam loading effects; has also been investigated using an enhanced version of WAKE; named WAKE-EP. Additionally; a cost evaluation; in terms of used energy per calculation; has also been done using the multi-CPU and multi-GPU versions of FBPIC.; * E. Baynard et al; Nucl. Instrum. Meth. Phys. Res.

The practical execution of a combined plasma wakefield acceleration section and a laser injected typically requires a dual gas medium for precision ionization of low and high ionization thresholds. The concept can be partially simplified in experiment by replacing the plasma wakefield acceleration component with a dielectric wakefield acceleration scheme; sacrificing field gradient but maintaining low emittance beam generation. In this paper; we describe the progress on the design of a hybrid scheme; using laser injection in a gas medium within a dielectric wakefield accelerator structure. The proof-of-concept experiment is planned to take place at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpgw073_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpgw073.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpgw073_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPGW073,

With the scaling of the RF structure up to these frequencies; conventional fabrication techniques do not achieve the required accuracy and tolerances. Improved manufacturing techniques including diffusion bonding; brazing or clamping split-block geometries produce high quality structures when successfully implemented. However; in most schemes the resulting gap and irregularities at the iris result in a local field enhancement which is not desirable for high-gradient operation. Development of advanced split-block braze technique for THz accelerators was required for high quality miniature accelerators. A new braze technique was developed for W-band structures to control the flow of braze alloy; enabling fabrication of the first high-gradient brazed structures at mm-wave frequencies. This fabrication process has the potential to overcome consistent fabrication defects around the cell iris. Thin spacers were used to set the final gap between blocks during the braze process; while braze foil thickness is varied with minimal impact on the resulting frequency. To demonstrate the robustness of this technique; testing after the various manufacturing steps was done to monitor and track frequency change throughout the process. This technique is further pushed to produce G-band RF structures; operating at 300 GHz.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpgw078_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpgw078.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpgw078_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPGW078,

Developing state-of-the-art technology to access these details entails utilizing X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), ultrafast electron diffraction (UED), and advanced electron microscopes. In particular, ultrafast diffraction science received growing attention thanks to innovation in sources, detectors and instrumentation in general. Within this context, interest in laser-generated THz wave-matter interaction has recently emerged as a new regime for controlling electrons with high temporal precision. Previously, the SLAC UED team has demonstrated attosecond electron metrology using laser-generated single-cycle THz radiation, which is intrinsically phase locked to the optical drive pulses, to manipulate multi-MeV relativistic electron beams. Here we demonstrate further steps towards achieving ultrafast timing resolution that utilizes femtosecond electron bunches. The proposed setup allows for compressing electron beam bunches down to a femtosecond using interaction with high field single-cycle THz pulses. We demonstrate a novel design of a dispersion-free parallel-plate tapered waveguide that provides focusing of THz pulses achieving >100 MV/m field strength at the interaction point as measured by electro-optical sampling for ~7 μJ of incoming THz pulse energy.

Indeed; metallic and dielectric accelerating structures at THz frequencies are plausible candidates toward miniaturization of accelerators. RF breakdown in such structures is a major factor limiting their performance. Therefore; comprehensive analysis of RF breakdown physics in mm-wave accelerating structures is needed; which includes understanding of dependencies of the breakdown rate on geometric; electromagnetic and material properties. In this work we report on high power tests of a 110 GHz single-cell standing wave accelerating structure powered by a 1 MW gyrotron. The RF power is coupled from the gyrotron into the accelerating structure with a Gaussian to TM01 mode converter through a quasi-optical setup. We demonstrate coupling of 10 ns; 100s of kilowatt pulses into the structure using a fast switch and achieving ~150 MV/m accelerating gradients.

Usually; flat or stepped square pulses are used for testing. Producing a perfectly flat output pulse from the klystron can be challenging especially for testing standing wave (SW) accelerators. SW accelerator structures reflect high power back to the klystron and no isolator can withstand the reflected power level for high gradient operation. This results in a distorted output pulse from the Klystron. We developed a modulation technique that solves this problem using a negative feedback loop. This technique can also overcome a poor modulator performance and other system errors. The pulse correction feedback was successfully implemented for high gradient SW accelerator testing at SLAC and KEK.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpgw084_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpgw084.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpgw084_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPGW084,

It follows the studies made by the FP7 Design Study EUROν[1] (2008-2012); regarding future neutrino facilities. The primary proton beam line completing the linear accelerator will consist of one or several accumulator rings and a proton beam switchyard. The secondary beam line producing neutrinos will consist of a four-horn/target station; a decay tunnel and a beam dump. A challenging component of this project is the enormous target heat-load generated by the 5 MW proton beam. In order to reduce this heat-load there will be four targets; which will be hit in sequence by the compressed proton pulses; thereby reducing the beam power on each target to 1.25 MW. Following the EUROν studies; a packed bed of titanium spheres cooled with helium gas has become the baseline design for a Super Beam based on a 2-5 GeV proton beam with a power of up to 1 MW per target; with other targets being considered for comparison. The hadron collection will be performed by four hadron collectors (magnetic horns); one for each target. Each of these target/hadron-collector assemblies will receive proton pulses three times more frequently than in present projects; and by an average beam power of 1.25 MW; which is twice as high as in present neutrino projects. The feasibility of the target/horn station for the ESSνSB project is discussed here.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB013,

For this purpose we are developing a new shot to shot feedback system with a time resolution of less than 1 fs*. We plane to generate stable THz pulses by optical rectification of a fraction of the plasma generating high energy laser pulses in a nonlinear lithium niobate crystal. With these pulses we will energy modulate the electron bunches shot to shot before the plasma to achieve the time resolution. In this contribution we will focus on realization aspects of the shot to shot feedback system and the lithium niobate crystal itself. Here we compare different approximations for the modeling of the generation dynamics (second order or first order calculation) and of the dielectric function (influence of the dispersion relation; of the free carries generated by the pump adsorption and their saturation; depletion of the pump) in order to investigate the importance of a detailed description of the optical properties for the THz generation.,*The feedback system will be tested at the Accelerator R&D facility SINBAD (Short Innovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY).,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB020,

As both the generator- and beam-current act on the same system input; a feedforward disturbance compensation can be a promising approach to improve beam qualities and suppress instabilities induced by the beam current. Particle tracking simulations; incorporating twenty ferrite cavities and their attached LLRF control systems; are performed to analyse the sensitivity of the beam quality with respect to errors in the feedforward beam current compensation.

Since these components need to move from nanometer up to millimeter range they cannot be stabilized by only using rigid structures. For that reason an active stabilization system with fast and precise sensors needs to be developed. Here a Laserinterferometer is used; which provides picometer resolution at several MHz sample rate. In this paper we will present a laboratory setup which consists of a 6-slot Micro Telecommunication Computing Architecture generation 4 (MTCA.4) crate with standard components such MicroTCA carrier hub (MCH); central processing unit (CPU); power supply (PS) and cooling unit (CU).

The encoder signals given by the interferometer controller are processed within the FPGA and then forwarded to the piezo amplifier RTM-board.

The typical time duration of a radio frequency (RF) pulse is about 1.3 ms. The RF power transmitted to the superconducting RF (SCRF) cavity as a set of successive pulses (10 Hz repetition rate); causes strong mechanical stresses inside the cavity. The mechanical deformations of the RF cavity are typically caused by the Lorentz force detuning (LFD). The cavity can be tuned to a 1.3 GHz resonance frequency during the RF pulse using fast piezo tuners. Since the E-XFEL will use around 800 cavities (each cavity with double piezos); a distributed architecture with multi-channel digital and analog control circuits seems to be essential. The most sought-after issue is high-voltage; high-current piezo driving circuit dedicated to multi-channel configuration. The driving electronics should allow a maximum piezo protection against any kind of failure. The careful automation of the piezo tuners control and its demonstration for the high gradient conditions a real challenge.

Charts are one of the most visible but at the same time often underappreciated accelerator control system components even though these are crucial for easing and improving a quick intuitive understanding of complex or large quantities of data; which in turn is used to efficiently control; troubleshoot or improve the accelerator performance. While the Java SDK and other third-party libraries provide some charting components; we found that these lack either functionality; performance; or are based on outdated complex APIs. Based on earlier GSI and CERN designs and careful analysis of missing functionalities; performance bottlenecks; and long-term maintenance risks for the necessary workarounds; we decided that it was worth to re-engineer a new scientific charting library that preserves the functionality of established other libraries while addressing the performance bottlenecks and APIs issues. The new library offers a wide variety of plot types common in the scientific community; a flexible plugin system to extend the functionality towards chart interactors as well as online parameter measurements commonly found in oscilloscopes. Tailored towards high performance; it achieves real-time update rates up to 25 Hz for data sets with a few 10k up to 5 million data points. The new API shields the complexity from and eases the library’s use by normal users; while still being modular and having explicitly open interfaces that allow more-inclined developers to modify; add or extend missing functionalities.

This injection scheme is beneficial for the next upgraded ring; SPring-8-II; where low emittance injection beams is required. The developed timing system aims at synchronizing the timing between the RF frequencies of the two accelerators which do not have a common subharmonic frequency. An important point is to keep the high performance of the current timing system which provides stable XFEL operation at SACLA. For this purpose; we designed and constructed a MicroTCA.4 system comprised of a high-speed ADC and an RF front-end for the synchronization. The RF signal of SACLA is digitized by the ADC whose clock is synchronized to SPring-8. A digital down-converter in the FPGA on the ADC module gives the phase difference instantaneously and a feedback logic applies a frequency modulation (FM) to the master oscillator of SACLA so as to synchronize SACLA with SPring-8. A bench test result showed that the timing jitter between the two frequency at injection timing was 1.2 ps rms; which was sufficient for the required value of 3 ps rms for the beam injection to the ring.

A beam window is installed in the beam line to each beam dump. It is considered that the parameters of acceptable beam　to able to be injected the beam window are the 50 mA current; the 100 micro-sec width and the 2.5 Hz repetition. On the other hand; at beam study of Linac; the beam with higher power than these parameters are not used. Therefore; the beam study was started and performed only after the operator checked that the beam parameters are within the acceptable values. However; at the beam study of 2018; a beam windows of 0-degree dump was cracked because the beam that exceeds acceptable parameters was injected due to human error. Then; beam study using 0-degree dump was impossible at all. And; in order not to cause such accident again; we began to develop the beam window protection system. Moreover; as soon as possible; implementation of the system was required. Therefore; we designed and developed this system by improving it based on the particle management system which can measure all 25 Hz beam.

These kickers are required to meet the following specifications: (1) rise and fall time does not exceed 100 ns; (2) two bunches which are 96 ns apart must be kicked by single pulse; (3) the stability of peak current for the extraction kickers must be less than 0.1 %. Kicker magnets are designed as a conventional kicker with a ferrite core. The pulse shape is a double half sine for the two bunch injection. In order to achieve short rise time; a saturable inductance is used. The design and performance of kicker magnets and the power supplies are reported.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb036_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb036.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb036_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB036,

Stability of pulse modulator feeding power for klystron plays an utmost important role in energy stability and occupy dominant factors in bringing influences in stability of RF power. Presently; stability of high-power pulse modulator of LINAC (Linear Accelerator) is on the level of 0.1% to 0.05% usually. In order to meet the higher stability requirements; it is very necessary for close-loop feedback control techniques instead of traditional open-loop to be applied in the modulator design. The stability controller adopts double control-loops techniques which feedback signals are respectively from PFN(Pulse Forming Network) and pulse transformer in oil tank. In addition; the paper also introduces recent progress on high stability CCPS research(Capacitor Charging Power Supply); which brings direct impact on the stability of modulator. In comparison with the former close-loop design; high stability CCPS design takes the overall modulator stability into full consideration. And the feedback control algorithm utilized to adjust PWMs for full bridge switch is implemented in the CCPS controller directly rather than modulator controller independent of CCPS. It is expected to obtain 0.01% stability by taking the above measures.,Funding: Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(11675250),reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB042,

This machine is equipped with a new digital Low-Level RF (LLRF) system that implements beam and cavity loops as well as longitudinal diagnostics. ELENA’s LLRF was instrumental for machine commissioning by decelerating some 1 E7 antiprotons from 5.3 MeV to 100 keV. Commissioning with H− ions took also place. Challenges faced included coping with low beam intensity and the wide frequency swing. This paper gives an overview of the LLRF system capabilities and operation.

A surface coating with a low secondary electron yield; applied to the inner surface of an alumina tube to reduce dynamic vacuum activity without increasing the probability of UFOs; and which is compatible with the high voltage environment; was included in a prototype MKI installed in the LHC during the 2017-18 Year End Technical Stop. In addition; this MKI included an upgrade to relocate a significant portion of beam induced power from the yoke to a ’damping element’: this element is not at pulsed high voltage. The effectiveness of the upgrades has been demonstrated during LHC operation; hence a future version will include water cooling of this ’damping element’.

To safely enter the HL-LHC era; a campaign to redesign the kicker’s beam screen was launched. An improved beam-screen has already been implemented in an upgraded MKI; that was installed in the LHC tunnel in the Year End Technical Stop (YETS) 17/18; and has been successfully tested during 2018 operation. However; the improved design alone is not expected to be enough for HL-LHC operation; and further modifications are required.

Of particular interest; from a beam stability point of view; is the transverse beam coupling impedance (TBCI) that is used to determine intensity limitations of a machine. Until recently; no conclusive TBCI data for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) injection kicker magnets (MKIs) was available. However; in view of the upgrade of the MKIs for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project; the TBCI of the existing design needed to be estimated to be used as reference for an upgraded version. To that end; electromagnetic simulations were carried out to determine the dipolar and quadrupolar components of the TBCI in the two transverse planes. To validate the simulations; test bench measurements were performed using standard RF measurement techniques. In the present work; the results from TBCI simulations and measurements are reported and compared.

The septa are all mounted on a single support structure that can move the ensemble coherently and; in addition; the internal anode and cathode of each tank can be moved independently. The septum is aligned to the beam by measuring and minimising the induced beam loss signals in the extraction region following an alignment procedure that is usually carried out manually at the beginning of each year. The large number of positional degrees of freedom complicates the procedure and until recently each tank was aligned one after the other semi-manually; typically requiring 8 hours. It is not uncommon that the septum has to be re-aligned later in the run taking time away from physics programme. To tackle this issue; a simplified beam dynamics and scattering simulation routine was developed to permit error studies with a large number of seeds to be carried out in a reasonable computation time. In this contribution; the simulation model will be described before the results of its exploitation to understand the efficacy of alignment procedures based on different optimization algorithms are discussed and compared to the present operational procedure. The effort culminated with the implementation of an automated alignment procedure based on a Powell optimisation algorithm that reduced the time needed to align the septum by over an order of magnitude.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb080_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb080.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb080_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB080,

An upgrade was therefore launched; consisting of the installation of two more cavities during the machine shutdown in 2019-2020 (LS2). Installation of more cavities requires the installation of extra Low Level RF (LLRF) electronics. The present LLRF system consists of the original equipment installed in the 1970s; plus some additions dating from the late 1990s when the SPS was commissioned as LHC injector. The High-Power RF up-grade has motivated a complete renovation of the LLRF during LS2; use of a MicroTCA platform; use of a digital deterministic link for synchronization (the so-called White Rabbit); use of an absolute clock for the processing; new algorithms for reducing the cavity impedance; and a complete re-design of the beam control loops and slip-stacking.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb082_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb082.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb082_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB082,

These IRs are interconnected with the arc sections consisting of a periodic magnet structure. During the operation of the LHC small amounts of the beam particles are lost; creating prompt radiation fields in the accelerator tunnels and the adjacent caverns. One of the main loss mechanisms in the LHC arc sections is the interaction of the beam particles with the residual gas molecules. The analysis of the dose levels based on the beam loss measurement data shows that the majority of the measurements have similar levels; which allow to define baseline values for each arc section. The baseline levels decreased during the years 2015; 2016 and stabilised in 2017 and 2018 at annual dose levels below 50 mGy; which can be correlated with the residual gas densities in the LHC arcs. In some location of the arcs radiation spikes exceed the base line by more than two orders of magnitude. In addition to the analysis of these dose levels; a novel approach of identifying local dose maxima and the main driving mechanisms creating these radiation spikes will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb083_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb083.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb083_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB083,

Exposed electronics and accelerator components show lifetime degradation and stochastic Single Event Effects (SEEs) which can lead to faults and downtime of the LHC. Close to the experiments the radiation levels scale nicely with the integrated luminosity since the luminosity debris is the major contributor for creating the radiation fields in this area of the LHC. In the collimation regions it was expected that the radiation fields scale with the integrated beam intensities since the beams are continuously cleaned from particles which exceed the accelerator’s acceptance. The analysis of radiation data shows that the dose measurements in the collimation regions normalised with the integrated beam intensities for 2016 and 2017 are comparable. Against expectations; the intensity normalised radiation datasets of 2018 in these regions differ significantly from the previous years. Especially in the betatron collimation region the radiation levels are up to a factor 3 higher. The radiation levels in the collimation regions correlate with the levelling of beta-star and the crossing angle in the high luminosity experiments ATLAS and CMS. These increased normalised doses have direct implications on the expected dose levels during future LHC operation; including the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb084_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb084.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb084_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB084,

We introduced ground fenders (see Fig. 1) to this new design which resulted in the reduction of the loss factor and substantial increase of the kicker shunt impedance. The transverse profile of the kicker electrodes was matched to the race-track beam pipe in the straight sections to minimize broadband impedance. The ground fenders can reduce the leakage of image currents through the gaps between the two strip line electrodes and also help to achieve a better impedance matching for the TEM modes in the transmission lines formed by the stripline electrodes and beam pipe in the kicker. The RF design and analysis of trapped resonant modes in the kicker were simulated by the 3-D electromagnetic code GdfidL [1].

We apply this procedure to two different problems: correcting the orbit in the Cornell synchrotron and maximizing the dynamic aperture in the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). Cornell’s rapid cycling synchrotron accepts a 200 MeV beam from the linac and accelerates it to 6 GeV for injection into the CESR. ‘Kicker coils’ (dipole correctors) are used to correct for residual fields which would otherwise cause beam loss at the low energies. In such cases; it is usually advisable to measure and correct the orbit. However; one cannot measure the orbit without first getting the beam to circulate a few hundred times; by which point the low-energy orbit would already be mostly corrected. In order to speed up the process of empirical orbit tuning; we form knobs which have the largest effect on the global orbit error; so that the dimensionality of the space which must be searched may be greatly reduced. A small dynamic aperture in CESR will have adverse effects on beam lifetime and injection efficiency; and so ought to be maximized by tuning sextupoles. However; it is often unclear which sextupoles one ought to tune to alleviate the problem. Moreover; once the chromaticity is properly adjusted; it should not be changed. Since we expect resonance driving terms (RDTs) to have a large impact on the dynamic aperture; we develop sextupole knobs which change the RDTs as much as possible while leaving the chromaticity fixed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb099_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb099.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb099_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB099,

This facility will ultimately accelerate electrons to 8 GeV; with beams of 375 kW at 1 MHz. At such high-powers; errant beams will need to be detected very fast -200 μs- to limit exposure and to protect beam-line and safety components. Currently; LCLS-I uses ion chambers both as Point Beam Loss Monitors (PBLM) by collimators; dumps; septa; etc.; and also as Long Beam Loss Monitors (LBML) that provide detection coverage in extended areas where the accelerator enclosure is not sufficiently thick to shield full beam losses. But due to the finite ion mobility and related screening effects; ion chambers are not fast enough; and their response would not be linear at high charge rates. LCLS-II will use synthetic mono-crystalline diamond chips as PBLMs; as those offer nanosecond time resolution due to the high mobility of holes generated in the valence band by charged particles. LBLMs will be 200 m-long optical fibers; with photomultipliers to detect Cerenkov photons produced by charged particles in the fibers. Use of these technologies requires tests and models to correlate their response to different beam losses. Response functions for these detectors have been developed for the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. After benchmarking the models; these have been applied to place PBLMs at locations where signal is relatively insensitive to beam-strike uncertainties and sufficiently above electronic noise; while keeping lifetime to radiation-damage long. Also; topologies where found were one PBLM can protect several components; resulting in cost reductions. As for LBLMs; the existing model helps scale signals for different beam loss configurations as a function of the fiber position.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb102_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb102.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb102_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB102,

Then we introduced a simple feedback version that performs these bump corrections automatically as needed to maintain the sources within in 1 um/urad for select beamlines. In addition; an RF frequency feedback was also implemented to improve stability for 3-pole wigglers and bending magnet users. As a parallel effort; X-ray BPMs were included in a local feedback system to stabilize photon beam motion for several ID beamlines. However; this feedback scheme is not transparent to FOFB; and suspected to be the source of occasional saturation of fast corrector strength.

Any uncontrolled release of such energy could potentially result in severe damage to the accelerator components. Machine protection of the FCC-hh is hence very important and challenging. With a machine-protection strategy similar to the LHC; FCC would require up to three turns to dump the beam synchronously after a failure detection. Due to several possible ultrafast failures; which could lead to significant beam losses in a few turns; it is important to further reduce the reaction time of the machine protection system (MPS) for the FCC. Reducing the detection time of a failure by using faster beam monitors; e.g. diamond detectors; can reduce the time between a beam loss and the beam dump request. Communication delay of the interlock system to the beam dumping system can be reduced by using a more direct signal path. More than one beam-free abort gap will shorten the time required for the synchronization between the abort gap and the extraction kicker. Different failure scenarios are classified according to the speed of the failure onset and the subsequent increase of induced beam losses. The critical failure modes; their potential mitigations and impacts on the design of the MPS are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb113_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb113.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb113_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB113,

This paper discusses the observations made on the LHC beams that could be correlated to CE work.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb116_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb116.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb116_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB116,

The PAL-XFEL requires very tight control of the klystron RF phase jitter 0.03-degree for S-band RF; 0.1-degree for X-band RF and the beam voltage stability of below 50 ppm. The RF phase jitter is directly related to the amplitude stability of modulator output pulses. There are several factors to satisfy the stability and reliability for the PAL-XFEL modulator. The largest sources of pulse-to-pulse instability are a current charging power supply (CCPS) for PFN charging; a thyratron switch; and a klystron focusing magnet power supply (MPS). In this paper; the operation and debugging results of those devices are described.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thprb117_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thprb117.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thprb117_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPRB117,

To control the transverse scattering and decrease the damage to healthy tissue caused by secondary particle; influence of the range shifter material was studied. In this paper; the Monte Carlo software Geant4 and FLUKA are applied to analyse the transport process of proton beam in the range shifters made of six different materials: PMMA; Lexan; Lucite; Polyethylene; Polystyrene; and Wax. The beam spot sizes at the iso-center with or without range shifter was calculated for the HUST-PTF scanning nozzle.

In order to fulfil stability requirements (magnets displacement caused by vibration of 6 nm) imposed to achieve expected performance; the mechanical assembly of supporting structures and magnets were designed without adjustment mechanisms. Yet; the misalignment errors of the magnets are the dominating source of dynamical aperture reduction; leading to a maximum permissible deviation of 40 micrometers between adjacent magnets. To this end; dimensional engineering was applied to conceive an alignment concept for magnets on a same girder based solely on the geometric characteristics of the parts. For the large volume positioning of girders in the storage ring tunnel; the applied methodology followed a strategy optimized to reduce measurement uncertainty; as described in the literature. This paper will present the complete measurement process that led to the alignment of Sirius; from the deployment and survey of reference networks to the final alignment of the machine. To express a consistent and unequivocal alignment result and assess the alignment quality considering the measurement uncertainty; an innovative metric described previously was employed. This work will show that the positioning of supports satisfies the requirement of 80 micrometer between girders. Also; the devices and mechanisms used for assembling will be detailed. Inspection of full girder set performed on a Coordinate measuring machine shows a maximum deviation of 30 micrometers for any pair of magnets on a common support.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpts002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpts002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpts002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPTS002,

This ultra-low emittance machine is based on approximately 700 magnets with 28 mm typical gap. The standard vacuum chamber; that makes up around 80% of the circumference; is a 26 mm external diameter copper tube. Due to the small conductance of the chambers and the limited space between the magnets; the vacuum pumping will be based on distributed concept and then non­-evaporable getter (NEG) coating will be extensively used. To activate the NEG coating; the chambers must be heated at 200°C for about 24 hours. The solution for Sirius was the development of an ultra-thin heating tape; 0.4 mm thick; which allows an in-situ bake-out. The developed tapes are able to operate continuously at 220°C and have in their design a thermal shield that reduces the radiation heat loss to the magnets.

For the planned heavy ion synchrotron SIS100 at FAIR; an inspection robot is currently under development; featuring an optical imaging system with which the robot can be navigated through the beam pipe. We present the current prototype; which is based on a modular snake-like robot with active wheels and joints. Due to the stipulated low movement velocity; it can be shown that a kinematic model is sufficient to control the robot whereas dynamical effects can be neglected. This concept is proven in experiments with the prototype. At the current development status; the robot is controlled manually by setting the velocity of the first module and its desired turning angle.

Narrow bore multipole magnets with compact coil assemblies have been designed. We optimized the shimming for enough good field regions; and minimized ohmic loss at the coils for suppressing thermal deformation. To improve the accuracy of vibrating wire magnet alignment; practical wire sag distributions have been quantitatively evaluated. In 2018; a test half-cell was constructed by which the feasibilities of the magnets and the overall alignment precisions including the effects of the thermal deformation of magnets; a repeatability of magnet reassembly has been confirmed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpts024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpts024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpts024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPTS024,

Before brazing the alumina duct and the Ti sleeves; the Ti sleeves were treated with nitric hydrofluoric acid. The purpose of this study is to clear the effect of this treatment for titanium material. It was cleared by SEM observation that the roughness of the titanium material after the nitric hydrofluoric acid treatment becomes big. It was also measured that the thickness of oxide film on surface of the titanium material was 12.7 nm before treatment and 6.0 nm after treatment. As a result of measuring the wettability of the brazing material which was silver brazing filler metal (Ag: 72%; Cu: 28%) on the Ti surface and the diffusion of the Ti material into the brazing material; it became clear that both the clearing of oxide layer on the alumina ceramics and the vacuum condition of the vacuum heating furnace were important for brazing between alumina ceramics and pure titanium.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpts026_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpts026.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpts026_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPTS026,

The CCIPM is composed of ceramics cylinder of 60 mm diameter and four copper coils; which are implanted in the groove penetrated on the ceramic thickness along 30 cm length by silver brazing*. In addition to this structure; we succeeded in the implementations of cable connecting base that mechanically connect the coils and power supply with feeder lines and the pattern shape coating inside the ceramic cylinder. Improved brazing technique made it possible to braze the coil and the base on the coil at the same time that the coils are implanted in the ceramic thickness.

In order to increase the beam intensity to improve the sensitivity of the CP violation study in neutrino sector; shorter repetition cycle and higher beam current are required. As part of the upgrade project; both injection and fast-extraction (Fx) kicker magnet systems have been improved. Air-cooled non-inductive ceramic resistors are used as the impedance-matching terminator for the injection kicker magnet. Power consumption and temperature rise of the termination resistor due to the beam induced current was simulated to optimize the number of parallel of the resistors. Efficiency of cooling fans was also simulated to improve the cooling ability.

The addition of magnets in the longitudinal gap between the poles further enhances the peak field strength of the undulator. A method of enhancing the peak field strength of the undulator using cryogenic temperature permanent magnets and adding side magnets has been studied. The remanence of the magnet will increase at low temperatures and the peak field strength of the undulator will increase. The side magnets do not increase the maximum peak field strength of the undulator; but can reduce the solenoid magnetic field requirements and reduce the solenoid volume and cost.

The RF power of each module is combined through coaxial combiner while its DC power is provided by parallel connected DC power supplies which can provide better redundancy and reliability. The home-made solid-state amplifier is demonstrated to have quite high quality RF power and reliability with acceptable power combination efficiency.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/thpts074_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/thpts074.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/thpts074_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-THPTS074,

A folded quarter wave resonator structure of 300 mm length accesses a wide range of frequencies. The structure is cooled in liquid He bath at 4 K. All internal resonator components (except for test samples) were fabricated out of superconducting materials. Consequently; when the resonator is cooled; the bulk of the losses are due to the copper coating. The RF resistivity is determined from Q measurements; since for a fixed geometry the quality factor of a resonant cavity is proportional to the square root of the conductivity. The RF input loop and the output signal antenna are adjustable when cold via bellows to control matching to each cavity mode. The Q values of 10 resonant modes between 180 and 2500 MHz are deduced from the bandwidth of the S21 response Network Analyzer measurements.

Shortly after the reintroduction of beam into the SR in late January; higher than expected heating was observed in the cryogenic cooling system. Steering the electron beam orbit in the upstream dipole provided reduction of the amount of synchrotron radiation reaching into the HSCU and allowed the device to properly cool and operate. Modeling the HSCU geometry with MARS shows the importance of Compton Scattering in transferring synchrotron photons with energies in the range of 10-100 keV through the vacuum chamber into the HSCU magnet pole and winding regions. Simulations carried out using MARS with EGS5 enabled indicate a rapid increase in transfer efficiency from the chamber wall to the HSCU with photon energy.

The dipoles of a standard DBA lattice are replaced in the Complex Bend by high-gradient (~ 450 T/m) quadrupoles interleaved between discrete dipoles. In another version of the Complex Bend [3] the high gradient quadrupoles are displaced transversely along the beam trajectory to generate the required dipole field. In the latter version the quadrupole strength is reduced to ~ 250 T/m for a lattice that will conform to the layout of the existing NSLS-II 3-GeV storage ring.

Beam availability data has been meticulously captured and binned over the years to completely characterize the Structures, Systems and Components (SSCs) and other factors that have caused or contributed to accelerator downtime. Over these years, a critical spares list prioritized the spare equipment purchases that were deemed most critical by the management team. In the span of the years 2013 ’ 2015, significant accelerator upgrades and equipment replacements were performed in a set of activities known as LANSCE-RM. Last year, a new risk-based approach was developed by the management team that included an analytical assessment and a quantitative evaluation of probability and consequence.

IHEP (institute for High Energy Physics; Beijing) is pursuing critical technologies R&D for future circular colliders like the Super Proton Proton Collider (SPPC). SPPC will need thousands of high field (12-20 T) superconducting magnets in around 20 years. A long term R&D roadmap of the advanced high field magnets has been made; aiming to push the technology frontier to the desired level; and a strong domestic collaboration is established; which brings together expertise of Chinese superconductivity community from fields of materials; physics; technology and engineering. The goal is to address prominent scientific and technological issues and challenges for high field applications of advanced superconducting materials. In the past year a model magnet with hybrid coils (NbTi and Nb3Sn ) has been manufactured and tested; reaching a dipole field above 10 T in the two apertures. A full Nb3Sn model has also been fabricated and tested with a coil made of iron based superconductor inserted in the center.

At first; the device evaluation test was carried out with a resistive load circuit. With the conditions of drain voltage of 10 kV and load resistance of 1 kΩ; turn on loss Eon; turn off loss Eoff; rise time Tr and fall time Tf were 1.7 mJ; 1.1 mJ; 64 ns; and 75 ns; respectively. As to gate charge characteristics; required electric charge to increase gate source voltage from 0 V to 20 V was about 80 nC. Thereafter; the 2s-12p switch array was designed and assembled; where 12 MOSFETs are equally aligned on a circle shaped circuit board and two circuit boards are stacked in series. A 14 kV-490 A-5 us pulse with a rise time of 430 ns in the long pulse mode and a 18 kV-318 A-1 us pulse with a rise time of 289 ns in the short pulse mode were successfully demonstrated.

The COMET Experiment aims to find new physics beyond the Standard Model by searching for the coherent neutrinoless conversion of a muon to an electron in muonic atoms; so-called mu-e conversion. This requires an extremely clean pulsed beam; and development of this beam plays a key role in the pursuit of the highest level of sensitivity. This successful extraction test is the clearing of a major milestone for the forthcoming experiment. The goal of the extraction tests was to confirm the beam quality under the customized MR operation mode. The J-PARC MR usually accelerates the proton beam (at one bunch per 600ns) up to 30GeV. But in the test; the MR instead accelerates the proton beam (at one bunch per 1.2us) up to 8GeV. The number of protons leaking between proton bunches; so-called EXTINCTION; must be less than one for every 1010 protons in the bunch. Extraction tests in the customized mode were conducted in January and February 2018 and resulted in many successes. In this test; leakage protons between bunches was successfully reduced below the objective of 10−10 of the number of protons in a bunch. This is a great success to guarantee the quality of proton beam required by COMET experiment. In addition; the time development of proton leakage was also precisely studied with several RF settings which enables us to further improve the extinction. In this paper; the result of extinction measurement and future prospect of beam extinction improvement is presented in addition to the detailed description of customized MR operation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/frxxpls2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/frxxpls2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/frxxpls2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-FRXXPLS2,

The development has culminated in large accelerator-driven radiation sources such as undulators and free-electron lasers; which are a big feature of the DESY campus. The bright laser-like beams from these sources have precipitated methodological advances for imaging complex forms of matter; such as biological macromolecules or man-made nanostructures. An understanding of how to synthesise atomic-resolution images was developed 100 years ago by Bragg; and still forms the basis for ongoing research in structure determination and coherent imaging; but in ways that perhaps Bragg would not have imagined. Our ambitions are to use these new capabilities to overcome bottlenecks in macromolecular imaging and to form ultrafast snapshots of molecules in action; to piece together their motions and reactions.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/talks/fryplm1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/papers/fryplm1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2019/posters/fryplm1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2019-FRYPLM1,
