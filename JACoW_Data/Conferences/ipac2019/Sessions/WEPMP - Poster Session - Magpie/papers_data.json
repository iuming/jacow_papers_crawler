        "Future beamline development at the Australian Synchrotron requires free floor space within the straights for a short undulator and relocation of diagnostics. Our current injection method uses a four-dipole kicker configuration that perturbs the stored beam during injection while also taking up approximately 4 meters of valuable space. To free this valuable space and provide transparent injections to the beamlines",
        "a single pulsed nonlinear magnetic field kicker (NLK) will be deployed. The NLK has a flat and zero field at the stored beam but maximum field where the injected beam is located off-axis. NLKs deflect only the injected beam",
        "leaving the stored beam undisturbed. NLKs have been extensively prototyped by many facilities around the world already and can produce injection efficiencies of 99 % (see e.g. *). This paper presents the preliminary magnet design for installation of a NLK at the Australian Synchrotron. We discuss the beam dynamics and thermal transfer constraints on kicker placement",
        "field-flatness and the magnet and ceramic chamber design for adaptation to our 3 GeV beam. Installation plans and other constraints for future deployment are also outlined.",

        "A concept for simultaneous beam delivery to all four CEBAF experimental halls from a single injector and a single main accelerator for the 12 GeV era was proposed in 2012. The original 12 GeV beam delivery plan was for a maximum of three experimental halls at a time as in the 6 GeV era. Therefore",
        "the new concept increases the po-tential beam time for the experiments up to 33%. This change",
        "although a major improvement in operational capabilities",
        "required only limited modifications to the existing machine. The modifications were mainly timing and pattern changes to the beams in the injector",
        "adding a fourth laser to the photo-cathode gun",
        "and the addition of new RF separators to the highest pass of CEBAF. These changes are now complete and",
        "for the first time",
        "the full system is operating",
        "producing four simultaneous beams through the accelerator to four different destinations. In this paper",
        "in addition to presenting the results of the full system commissioning",
        "we will discuss important details about the new configuration plus some of our operational challenges."
