        "The Australian third generation 3 GeV Synchrotron Light Source was originally commissioned with a 100 MeV linear accelerator (LINAC) fed by two 37 MW S band pulsed klystrons. A pulse compressor in form of a SLED cavity was added later to enable single klystron operation for redundancy in case of a modulator failure. The SLED was successfully commissioned in May 2017 including remote selection of single klystron with SLED operation without degradation of beam energy. Two years on there have been some unexpected operational benefits including reduced phase sensitivity and drift allowing repeatable injection based solely on diagnostic phase read backs. Temperature stabilised power amplifiers based on S band GaN radar technology are being trialed in the meantime with a goal to set and inject with minimal operator adjustment. The results from the SLED cavity upgrade are shown and the latest S band radar technology designs are outlined."

The method has been applied to an electric field map of a DTL cavity with 11 m in length comprising 55 rf-gaps. The original field map data of 220 MB was converted into practically noise-free data of just 20 KB. Noise was reduced by 95% as demonstrated using a cubic cavity for which the analytical field map is available."

        "Due to the decommissioning of several research reactors there will be a severe drop in available neutrons for research in Europe in the next decade despite the commissioning of the European Spallation Source (ESS). Compact accelerator-based neutron sources (CANS) could close this gap. The High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) currently under development at Forschungszentrum Jülich is scalable in terms of beam energy and power due to its modular design. The driver Linac for HBS at will accelerate a 100 mA proton beam to 70 MeV. The Linac is operated with a beam duty cycle of up to 6% (11% RF duty cycle) and can simultaneously deliver three proton pulse lengths (384 Hz@52 mu-s",
        "96 Hz@208 mu-s and 24 Hz@832 mu-s) for three neutron production targets. In order to minimize the development effort and the technological risk",
        "state-of-the-art technology of the MYRRHA injector is used. The front end of the HBS Linac consists of an ECR source",
        "LEBT and a 2.5 MeV RFQ followed by a CH-DTL with 35 room temperature CH-cavities. All RF structures are operated at 176.1 MHz and are designed for high duty cycle. Solid-state amplifiers up to 500 kW are used as RF drivers. Due to the beam current and the high average beam power of up to 420 kW",
        "particular attention is paid to beam dynamics. In order to minimize losses",
        "a quasi-periodic lattice with constant negative phase is used. The contribution describes the conceptual design and the challenges of such a modern high power proton accelerator with high reliability and availability."

The unmodulated Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. It accepted 3 times the operating power of which is needed in operation**. That level corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 µs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project. This particular high frequency for a 4-ROD-RFQ creates difficulties, which triggered the development of a Ladder-RFQ with its high symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is very well suited for that frequency. The duty cycle is up to 5% for the applied cooling concept. Manufacturing has been completed in September 2018. We will show the finalization of assembly after manufacturing as well as low level RF measurements. The final machining step for both flatness and frequency tuning has been finished in April 2019. *Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 874 (2017) 012048  **Proceedings of",

        "A deutron CW RFQ was designed and fabricated in Peking University. It will accelerate 50mA CW deutron beam from 50keV to 1MeV at 162.5MHz. The novel structure of four-vane with window was used to seperate the dipole mode from the working mode. The field tuning of this RFQ was different from conventional four vane RFQ because that the four quadrants of RFQ cavity were coupled. The discipline of field tuning was studied by simulation and experiment. The beam dynamics of the RFQ was designed by equipartation and matching method",
        "limit current effect was considered at the same time. The final design result of the RFQ was: voltage between electrodes was 60kV",
        "transport efficiency of RFQ is 98%",
        "field unflatness is less than 2% after tuning",
        "the deformation of RFQcavity is less than 80um. Only 47 hours was spent to increase CW power of cavity from 0 to 55kW in high power test and The RFQ can working stable at the design voltage. The preliminary H2+ beam exeperiment has been done and 1.78mA CW beam was obtained at exit of RFQ. This paper will introduce the detail of design and experiment of the RFQ."

An attempt to characterize the skew-sextupolar component of the radio frequency field of the crab-cavity (a3) has been carried out by means of beam-based techniques using turn-by-turn monitoring of the betatron motion. The skew nature of a3 couples the horizontal and vertical betatron motions through a non-linear term. Therefore by exciting the horizontal betatron motion it was possible to observe a spectral line in the vertical beam motion driven by the non-linear coupling at the characteristic frequency 2Qx. A measurement of the magnitude of a3 was thus obtained by characterizing amplitude and phase of such line. The results of the measurements are discussed here."

The IS and the following low energy beam transport (LEBT) section were manufactured and tested with beam to meet ESS requirements at INFN-LNS and delivered to ESS towards the end of 2017. Beam commissioning of these two sections on the ESS site has started in September 2018 and will continue until the end of June 2019.

The modelling of the behavior of the power amplifier and the cavity is essential to achieve an anti-symmetric voltage pulse with little pre- and post-pulse ripple.
