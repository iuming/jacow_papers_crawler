        "During successful beam commissioning of the superconducting 15-gap Crossbar H-mode cavity at GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung heavy ions up to the design beam energy have been accelerated. The design acceleration gain of 3.5 MeV inside a length of less than 70 cm has been reached with full transmission for heavy ion beams of up to 1.5 particle mueA. The measured beam parameters confirm sufficient beam quality. The machine beam commissioning is a major milestone of the R&D for the superconducting heavy ion continuous wave linear accelerator HELIAC of Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) and GSI developed in collaboration with IAP Goethe-University Frankfurt. The next step is the procurement and commissioning of so called ’Advanced Demonstrator’ - the first of series cryo module for the entire accelerator HELIAC. Results of further Demonstrator beam tests",
        "as well as the status of the Advanced demonstrator project will be reported."

        "we report the first results of beam measurements at the Muon Campus with emphasis on the key achievements that have contributed to the successful beam delivery to the Muon g-2 Experiment. These achievements include the production of an intense secondary beam from the target",
        "it’s transport over 2 km",
        "the successful monitoring of muons from the available diagnostics and the development of techniques for measuring the transverse optics. We also present detailed comparisons between experimental data and simulation and discuss the similarities and differences observed."
