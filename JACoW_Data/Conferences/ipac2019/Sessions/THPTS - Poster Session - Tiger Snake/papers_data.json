        "An 8 Tesla superconducting solenoid was commissioned at The Australian National University to make precision measurements of fusion cross-sections. Forces between the solenoid and the iron yoke that houses it must always be maintained within safe limits and precision location of the solenoid coil is necessary to achieve this. Thermal contraction of components can impact the locating structure of the solenoid coil",
        "leading to unsafe forces. Improvements to this structure allowed successful completion of the first fusion measurements with the 8T solenoidal separator",
        "and demonstrated that it is now ready for a program of fusion measurements."

        "an innovative metric described previously was employed. This work will show that the positioning of supports satisfies the requirement of 80 micrometer between girders. Also",
        "the devices and mechanisms used for assembling will be detailed. Inspection of full girder set performed on a Coordinate measuring machine shows a maximum deviation of 30 micrometers for any pair of magnets on a common support."

        "The Super-FRS (Superconducting FRagment Separator) at FAIR is a two-stage in flight separator",
        "which aims to produce rare isotopes of all elements up to Uranium and separate them spatially within a few hundred nanoseconds so that a study of very short lived nuclei can be performed efficiently. In total",
        "it is required to construct 24 dipoles and 170 multipole magnets (quadrupole",
        "sextupole",
        "octupole and steering dipole). Due to the limit of space",
        "the multipole magnets will be arranged as a group (2 ~ 9 magnets) in a common cryostat and they are called as a multiplet. The design challenge of the multiplet lies in a strong iron saturation of the quadrupole leading to disturb the field quality and high design pressure of the He vessel (20 bars). The first multiplet for the Super-FRS is constructed. The magnet column consisting of one quadrupole and one sextupole is cooled in a He vessel filled with up-to 800 liters of liquid He. The both magnets are superferric type and have a large warm bore radius of 190 mm. This paper presents the design overview and the manufacturing status of the first multiplet."

        "The staggered array undulator consists of staggered poles and solenoid coils that form a periodically aligned transverse magnetic field in the pole gap. The addition of magnets in the longitudinal gap between the poles further enhances the peak field strength of the undulator. A method of enhancing the peak field strength of the undulator using cryogenic temperature permanent magnets and adding side magnets has been studied. The remanence of the magnet will increase at low temperatures and the peak field strength of the undulator will increase. The side magnets do not increase the maximum peak field strength of the undulator",

        "214 neodymium permanent magnets have been manufactured for the return loop of the CBETA multi-turn ERL being built at Cornell University. There are 5 types of quadrupole and combined-function gradient magnets using a variant of the circular Halbach design. These are made out of NdFeB material and glued into an aluminium housing with water channels for temperature stabilisation. The NdFeB wedges and magnet construction were done by outside companies",
        "while the final \"tuning\" using inserts containing 64 iron wires per magnet was done at BNL over a period of about 6 months. Average relative field errors of 2.3·10-4 were achieved on the beam region. The magnet strengths vary by type but are of order 10T/m for quadrupole component and up to 0.3T for the dipole. This paper reports on the field quality and timeline achieved in this production process."

        "higher than expected heating was observed in the cryogenic cooling system. Steering the electron beam orbit in the upstream dipole provided reduction of the amount of synchrotron radiation reaching into the HSCU and allowed the device to properly cool and operate. Modeling the HSCU geometry with MARS shows the importance of Compton Scattering in transferring synchrotron photons with energies in the range of 10-100 keV through the vacuum chamber into the HSCU magnet pole and winding regions. Simulations carried out using MARS with EGS5 enabled indicate a rapid increase in transfer efficiency from the chamber wall to the HSCU with photon energy. Realistic spectral distributions of synchrotron photons are employed as input to MARS for several bending magnet field strengths."

In another version of the Complex Bend [3] the high gradient quadrupoles are displaced transversely along the beam trajectory to generate the required dipole field. In the latter version the quadrupole strength is reduced to ~ 250 T/m for a lattice that will conform to the layout of the existing NSLS-II 3-GeV storage ring.

        "The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), like many other accelerator facilities, was built decades ago and has been repurposed when new missions were adopted. With an ongoing beam availability expectation of at least 80% delivered to the Experimental Areas (EAs), a balance between cost of spare equipment and budget has always been a challenge. Beam availability data has been meticulously captured and binned over the years to completely characterize the Structures, Systems and Components (SSCs) and other factors that have caused or contributed to accelerator downtime. Over these years, a critical spares list prioritized the spare equipment purchases that were deemed most critical by the management team. In the span of the years 2013 ’ 2015, significant accelerator upgrades and equipment replacements were performed in a set of activities known as LANSCE-RM. Last year, a new risk-based approach was developed by the management team that included an analytical assessment and a quantitative evaluation of probability and consequence. The resulting risk register (risk-based equipment list) is being used to guide decisions on funding requests and provide justification to mitigate operational risks. A paper by the same authors was published at LINAC 2018 describing this risk-based approach that serves to reformulate the critical spares list. This paper, in the sections that follow, expands on the approach by detailing the specific results of the analyses that led to the first risk register. Additionally, it evaluates the historical beam downtime at LANSCE compared to the current funding allocation choices made to increase the reliability."

The SCL consists in 4 cryomodules. The first two cryomodules host 6 & 7 half-wave resonator (HWR) low beta cavities (β = 0.09) at 176 MHz",
