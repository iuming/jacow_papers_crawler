      "abstract": "A new design of RF-shielded bellows is proposed for the TPS to alleviate wake field effects and Joule heating resulting from contact resistance at the contact interface of sliding two dissimilar metals. Most efforts are put into controlling corrosion which is regarded as the main cause of electrical contact degradation. Rh-Au is chosen as a mating interface because they are stable under high temperature condition. Experimental tests are made to find an effective plating thickness of Rh and Au and to determine a suitable normal load applicable on the Rh-Au interface. A preliminary design of RF-shielded bellows that can sustain thousands of cycles during their lifetime is under testing. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

This paper summarizes the improvements in the vacuum systems in the last ~10 years and shows some data on the downtimes caused by vacuum failures. The refurbished equipment is significantly more maintainable and will contribute to extend the life of this old accelerator",
