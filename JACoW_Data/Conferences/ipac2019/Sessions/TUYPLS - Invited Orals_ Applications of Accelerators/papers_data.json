        "During the past century particle accelerators and their technology have played an essential role to improve standards of living and well-being. Originally developed to investigate the fundamental laws of nature",
        "today",
        "accelerators in different configurations are producing beams of subatomic particles and charged atoms that help to manage our health and our environment; they also provide a significant tool for manufacturing industry",
        "for sustaining greener",
        "safer energy",
        "and for securing our borders and ensuring national security. They offer advance investigation methods considered essential in many fields of basic and applied science. Innovative technical developments are in progress or in the horizon",
        "and will extend the practical use of accelerators even further for the social and economic benefit of all. The quest for more compact",
        "more efficient",
        "lower cost",
        "portable",
        "combined with imaging",
        "… is ongoing and not absent of challenges. In this talk the recent developments of particle accelerators focused in societal applications will be described as well as the issues",
        "challenges and opportunities the R&D in this brave new field is facing."
