        "and a 1.6GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS).It is designed with a beam power of 100kW in the first phase and reserves upgrade capability to 500kW in the second phase. It has completed initial beam commissioning and has started user operation in 2018. And meanwhile the beam power is quickly going up from the initially above 10kW to 50kW during the user operation",
        "and we can foresee that the designed beam power of 100 kW can be reached in the next year. This talk gives the most recent status of beam power ramping in CSNS",
        "as well as future upgrade plan to increase the beam power up to 500 kW."
