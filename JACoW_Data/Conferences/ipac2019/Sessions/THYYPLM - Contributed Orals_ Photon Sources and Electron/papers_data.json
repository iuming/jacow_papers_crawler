        "Operating a storage ring close to a horizontal resonance and manipulating the transverse non-linear beam dynamics can generate stable Transverse Resonance Island Buckets (TRIBs)",
        "which give a 2nd stable orbit in the ring. Both orbits can be populated with different electron bunch filling patterns and provide two different radiation sources to the user community. Such a machine setting has been established at BESSY II and was tested under realistic user conditions in a first ’TRIBs/Two Orbit User Test Week’ in February 2018. Results and user feedback will be discussed in this contribution."

        "high-performance storage ring light sources based on multibend achromat optics will require on-axis injection because of the extremely small dynamic aperture. Injectors will need to supply full-current bunch replacement in the ring with high single-bunch charge for swap-out. For upgrades of existing light sources",
        "such as the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U)",
        "it is economical to retain the existing injector infrastructure and make appropriate improvements. The challenges to these improvements include achieving high single-bunch charge in the presence of instabilities",
        "beam loading",
        "charge stability and reliability. In this paper",
        "we discuss the rationale for the injector upgrades chosen for APS-U",
        "as well as backup and potential alternate schemes. To date",
        "we have achieved single-bunch charge from the injectors that doubles the original design value",
        "and have a goal to achieve about three times the original design value."
