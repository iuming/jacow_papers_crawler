The machine is composed of a 50/70 MeV injector Linac and a storage ring where an electron bunch collides with a laser pulse accumulated in a Fabry-Perot resonator. The final goal is to provide an X-rays average flux of 1012-1013 ph/s. A demonstrator was funded and is being built on the Orsay university campus. The S-band injector Linac consists of 2.5 cell photocathode RF gun and a TW accelerating section. During the commissioning phase",
        "a standard LIL S-band accelerating section is able to achieve around 50 MeV corresponding to around 45 keV X-rays energy. Since the maximum targeted X-ray energy is 90 keV",
        "the development of a new S-band accelerating section",
        "intended to replace the LIL structure",
        "will provide an electron beam energy of 70 MeV. This requires essentially the development of more reliable high gradient compact S band accelerating section. Such design is tailored for high gradient operation",

A high pressure rinsing cabinet (HPR) has been implemented between the ISO-class 6 and 4 cleanroom. A RF-cavity can be loaded and unloaded from both sides. HPR treatments are possible for cavities of up to 1.4 m length and about 0.7 m diameter. For drying the ISO-class 4 clean room is equipped with a 160 C vacuum oven. New cleanroom lifters allow the handling of up to 200 kg heavy objects. A rail system in the cleanroom floor is installed to move out the entire cold string of the cleanroom after assembly and leak testing. First operational experiences with this facility will be presented."

The superconducting region will use five types of radio frequency cavities. In the region from 2 to 180 MeV the acceleration will be done using Half Wave Resonator (HWR) and Single Spokes (SS) cavities. HWR cavities will accelerate the beam from 2 to 10 MeV with a geometrical beta of 0.08 and the SS ones will do from 10 to 180 MeV using two cavity families with geometrical betas of 0.16 and 0.43.

        "it will need more than two hundred 650MHz/800kW klystrons. The secondary electron yield (SEY) effect suppression is very important for the klystron working stable. The simulation uses an incident primary electron source and considers all the phases and power levels of the input microwave. Two methods are simulated for the SEY suppression. The groove cutting on the nose of cavities is much simple while the TiN coating can suppress better. The effect after groove cutting on nose is also simulated and the corresponding compensations are adopted. For simplify the fabrication progress as well as some experience that can be referenced",
        "the groove cutting method is adopted finally for the first klystron prototype",
        "which is expected to be available in the summer of 2019."

The third harmonic cavity at ALBA will be used to increase the bunch length in order to improve the beam lifetime and increase the beam stability thresholds. The main advantage of an active third harmonic cavity is that optimum conditions can be reached for any beam current. This paper presents the evolution of the preliminary design of this cavity and its trans-dampers: high order modes coaxial dampers with waveguide transitions to N",

        "To this day CW linear electron accelerators were based only on expensive and bulky (embedded in a cryostat) superconducting accelerating structures. CW regime can in principle be realized with normal conducting structures provided the shunt impedance is high. Such structures can be designed using dielectrics (ultra-pure ceramics in C-band and diamond in mm-waves) with ultra-low loss tangent (~10-6). The use of dielectrics allows to concentrate the electromagnetic energy density in the dielectric region and thus minimize fields and ohmic loss on metallic walls. The thermal loss in dielectric can be relatively low given the loss tangent is small. We report here the design of structures with shunt impedance on the order of 104 MOhm/m",
        "which is several orders of magnitude higher than shut impedance in copper structures in GHz and THz range. High shunt impedance makes it possible to accelerate electrons to 1 MeV using kW-level CW RF sources like magnetrons in C-band and gyrotrons in THz range. Such CW accelerators will find applications in sterilization",

        "Nb3Sn films have the potential to augment niobium in SRF cavities. Besides single-cell cavity efforts to improve Nb3Sn films",
        "we are working to replicate single-cell results onto the practical 5-cell CEBAF cavities. High quality factors (1011 at 2.0K and 10zEhNZeHn at 4.3 K) have been measured",
        "but the cavities are typically limited by strong low-field Q-slopes and early quenches. Two of the cavities were selected to be assembled into a ’mock-up’ cavity pair unit",
        "the standard step before installation into a cryomodule. Comparison of test results between VTA and pair test offered the first glimpse into post-processing effects on the cavity performance."

The successful installation and commissioning of the X-ray pinhole beamline allows now to measure the emittance and helps in proper 3rd harmonic cavities tuning against the coupled bunch mode instabilities.
