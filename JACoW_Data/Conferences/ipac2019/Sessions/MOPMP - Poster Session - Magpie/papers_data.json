        "We report the design of the pre-injector chain for the Future Circular e+ e− Collider (FCC-ee) system. The electron beam from a low-emittance RF gun is accelerated by an S-band linac up to 6 GeV. A damping ring at 1.54 GeV is required for emittance cooling of the positron beam. The intermediate energy step from the exit of the S-band linac at 6 GeV to the 20 GeV injection energy of the top-up booster can be provided by the modified Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)",
        "serving as a pre-booster ring (PBR). An alternative option to reach 20 GeV energy would be to extend the S-band linac with a C- or X-band linac. An overall cost optimisation will determine the choice of the final configuration. Beam loss and emittance dilution in the linac due to space charge effects",
        "wakefields",
        "and misalignment of accelerator components can be mitigated by RF phasing and orbit steering. Start-to-end simulations examine the beam transport through the linac up to either 6 GeV or 20 GeV. The results indicate large design margins. Simulations of the beam dynamics in the damping ring (DR) demonstrate a sufficiently large momentum acceptance. Effects of intrabeam scattering and electron cloud instability in the DR are also studied."

Equipment of two experimental stations is under development by the JINR-ITEP-MEPhi collaboration for these applied researches. Ion beams with the energy of 3.2 MeV/n extracted from the heavy ion linac HILAc will also be used for irradiation and testing of microchips.

Three types of RF stations will be used in the NICA Collider to reach the necessary beam parameters. The first one is for accumulation of particles in the longitudinal phase space with the moving burrier buckets under action of stochastic and/or electron cooling systems. The second and third RF stations are for formation of the final bunch size in the colliding regime. This report presents numerical simulations of longitudinal beam dynamics which taken into account the longitudinal space charge effect during the accumulation and bunching procedures. Influence of space effects leads to some decrease in the accumulation efficiency and requires special manipulation with the 2nd and 3rd RF stations during the adiabatic capture and bunching procedures. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
