        "experimental and technological research in subnuclear",
        "nuclear and astroparticle physics. LNF have an extensive experience in designing",

        "magnets and mechanics. LNF have always had a close relationship with the regional and national industries",
        "stimulating the development and growth of the industrial background by means of close collaboration with partners. The LATINO (a Laboratory in Advanced Technologies for INnOvation) project is an initiative that fits into this path and aims to strengthen this relationship",
        "allowing access to the technologies",
        "instruments and competences not otherwise available to the enterprises. A modern vision of advanced economies recommends the Technology Transfer from the research world to the productive activities through the creation of research infrastructures as the most efficient system for generating innovation and economic development [1-3]. The Regione Lazio",
        "despite hosting centres of excellence",
        "has a delay in the establishment of this kind of infrastructures."
