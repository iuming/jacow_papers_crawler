        "We report the first evidence of substantial gain in a soft-X ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) based on Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG). The experiment was focused on harmonics 36 (~7.3nm) and 45 (5.8 nm) and clearly demonstrated the expected EEHG capability of generating powerful and coherent FEL pulses",
        "with strongly reduced sensitivity to electron-beam fluctuations. The experiment was carried out at FERMI",

        "The realization of fully coherent X-ray radiation pulse has been a long-standing challenge for free-electron lasers. A promising way for producing stable transform-limited pulses is based on the harmonic up-conversion techniques with a conventional laser as the seed. However",
        "it is found that the insignificant phase error in the seed laser will be eventually multiplied by the harmonic number",
        "leading to a degradation of the output temporal coherence at short wavelength. Here",
        "we report the demonstration of a slippage boosted spectral cleaning technique to mitigate the impact of seed laser induced phase errors and to improve the temporal coherence of a seeded FEL. Experimental results show that fully coherent radiation pulses can be generated in a seeded FEL with the help of the proposed technique."
