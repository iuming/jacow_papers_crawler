The proposed solution will allow the use of COTS or in-house designed FMC modules and interface with the control system through PoE+ enabled Ethernet connection. The Chameleon device will also be able to plug into a White Rabbit network to enable the high performance synchronisation capabilities. This device will reduce the cost of implementing application specific solutions to better support the growing demands of scientific research at the Australian Synchrotron."

KAPTURE provides digitization for pulses at rates of 500 MHz using up to 4 sampling points per pulse to record each bunch and each turn for potentially unlimited time. The new KAPTURE-2 system now provides eight sampling points per pulse",

This contribution will report on first results of the KAPTURE-2 system at KARA."

Both sensors are equipped with a double-sided strip segmented metallization (300 µm width) which allows a position determination of the beam. Those sensors are able to deliver a time precision <100 ps and can handle rate capabilities up to 107 particles/s/channel. Beside the diamond sensors a plastic scintillation based beam halo detector is used. The read-out of the detectors is based on the TRB3 system*. A 264 channel TDC (Time to Digital Converter) is implemented in FPGA technology with 10 ps precision. The TRB3 system serves as a fast and flexible Data Acquisition System (DAQ) with integrated scaler capability. The analysis and online visualization is performed using the Data Acquisition Backbone Core (DABC)** framework. In this contribution the performance of the system",

The new BSM using the carbon-nano-tube (CNT) wire is being developed to be able to measure the bunch shape of the H− beam with 3 MeV. One challenge to introduce the CNT wire for the BSM is the measure to the discharge. The careful attention should be paid to apply the high voltage of 10 kV to the CNT wire. The several measures are taken to suppress the discharge from the wire and operate the CNT-BSM. This presentation reports the current status of the development and future prospective for the CNT-BSM."

A comparative study of the different currents transformers was carried out in order to characterize their contribution to longitudinal and transverse impedance. The gap in the vacuum chamber of the current transformers was varied in order to study its effect on the heat deposited by the beam in the corresponding device and on the resonance in the longitudinal impedance spectrum.

A series of measurements of the electro-optic signals were previously obtained by an EO-BPM prototype installed in the SPS. This paper focuses on an advanced design that would further improve the sensitivity of the pick-up by optimising the shape of the metallic electrode mounted onto the crystal. The proposed upgraded electro-optic pickups significantly increase the image field profile of the passing bunch inside a lithium niobate crystal embedded within the pickup.

The new method instead utilizes the orbit deviation at the beam position monitors within an ID straight section (ID BPMs) with respect to a dynamically changing orbit that is defined by the orbit at two BPMs bounding the ID straight. Correction currents are determined such that this orbit deviation at the ID BPMs is minimized. Being impervious to transverse kicks external to this bounded region",
