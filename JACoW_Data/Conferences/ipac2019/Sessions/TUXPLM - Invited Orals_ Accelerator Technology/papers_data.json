        "Nb3Sn has long held the promise to significantly improve the performance of superconducting RF cavities in terms of power dissipation and achievable field. However",
        "measurements in the 1980’s and 1990’s proved very disappointing and it was believed that practical limits due to grain boundaries prevented Nb3Sn from achieving its full potential. Only recently (around 2013) has use of the material for accelerator applications been re-visited. Significant progress has been made in the last several years with demonstrated performance reaching levels where implementing Nb3Sn in accelerator applications should be considered. The talk discusses the performance limits and potential applications of Nb3Sn."
