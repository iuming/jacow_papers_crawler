      "abstract": "A preliminary design for a new storage for the Canadian Light Source was presented at IPAC’18 (Dallin). More recently a reconfigured lattice was presented at the 6th DLSR workshop. This lattice employed large βy and small βx in the straights. This has several advantages including: increased transverse coherence and brighter beams at small coupling; round beams at small coupling; flatter βy through the straights; and possible off-axis vertical injection at small amplitudes. Most recently longitudinal gradients in the dipoles have been implemented. This has lead to the unit cell bends being replaced by a ’pseudo longitudinal gradient’ bend array: bend1-bend2-bend1. This results in smaller emittance with simple magnet designs while maintaining adequate dynamic aperture for off-axis injection. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

We have chosen a 4-bend achromat lattice to achieve a low emittance keeping a small circumference with a rather relaxed space issue. The number of cells is 16 and the ring circumference is about 350 m. Number of available beam lines are 26 including short straight sections for multi-pole wigglers. Horizontal emittance is expected to be around 1.1 nmrad",

Reversible seeding scheme is one of the promising scenarios with less challenges on the storage ring lattice design. The key problem for reversible SSMB is the precise cancelation of the laser modulation which will allow producing turn-by-turn coherent radiation without spoiling the transverse emittances and energy spread.

There are 480 rf buckets while normally 390 bunches are stored. The gap in filing pattern (90 empty buckets) is held to suppress ion instability. After many years of operation",
        "however",
        "the vacuum condition is much better than that of the time when the SLS was turned on. Hence it is possible to shorten the gap. The beam lifetime can then be prolonged due to less bunch current while keeping the net beam current. The study may be also useful to predict possible filling patter in SLS2",

This paper presents studies of a harmonic cavity for Diamond-II with the focus on maximising the lifetime increase. It is foreseen that the ring will have to operate with a gap in the fill pattern to avoid instabilities and therefore multiparticle tracking was used to determine the effect on stability and lifetime for various cavity parameters taking into account transient beam loading."

        "We made sufficient progress in modeling the imped-ance of the PETRA-IV storage ring. The result was ap-plied to estimate the impedance-based single and multi-bunch intensity limit. Due to the extremely small emit-tance of the beam the intrabeam scattering (IBS) effects will be significant unless they are reduced by bunch lengthening. The 3rd harmonic cavity was proposed to dilute the bunch density which resulted in the small syn-chrotron frequency with a large spread. Because of the complexity introduced by impedance and harmonic cavity we used broadband impedance up to 200 GHz to compute the parameters such as bunch length and energy spread at different currents. We found that the microwave instability started very early in current less than 0.5 mA. Even if it is small",

The ALS-U design promises to deliver diffraction limited performance in the soft x-ray range by lowering the horizontal emittance to about 70 pm rad resulting in two orders of magnitude brightness increase for soft x-rays compared to the current ALS. The design utilizes a nine bend achromat lattice, with reverse bending magnets and on-axis swap-out injection utilizing an accumulator ring.

        "The SPS-II is a 3 GeV ultralow emittance light source which is now under studied and designed by Thailand Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI). The SPS-II storage ring is based on Double-Triple Bend Achromat (DTBA) cell with a circumference of 321.3 m aiming for horizontal emittance of less than 1 nm-rad. The compact lattice leaves narrow space for vacuum components. The small gap between poles of the magnets requires narrow vacuum chambers and limits the conductance of the chambers. The chambers will be made by stainless steel with a thickness of 1.5 mm. the cross section of beam duct is 40 mm × 16 mm elliptical shape. The bending chamber is designed as a long triangular chamber such that photon absorber can be installed as far from the light source as possible to lower the power density of the heat load. The overview of designed vacuum system for the SPS-II is presented."
