        "D-Pace’s 13.56 MHz Radio Frequency (RF) multi cusp negative ion source uses an Aluminium Nitride (AlN) dielectric window for coupling RF power from an external antenna to the plasma chamber. Ion source operation was limited to low RF power (< 3500 W) due to failures (cracks) occurring on the window during experiments. Such events can cause damages to the vacuum system and plasma chamber. The current work deals with simulations performed on the ion source to study the factors leading to the failure of the window. Based on results from the simulations",
        "a new design was introduced. The improved design yielded positive results in terms of source performance and stability of the AlN window."

The final beam shaping is done by two resistive quadrupoles. In this contribution the status of the beamline is described together with the tests performed with conventional accelerators at INFN-LNS.

We can expect that the flatness and reproducibility of flat top current can be improved. We confirmed that 1Hz operation and high accuracy of its output current and magnetic field with the new septum magnet system. We had some problem in unexpected instability of output current. In this report we also summarize the measure against the instabillity."

        "there is always the very important question of the compatibility of SRF cavities and high quantum efficiency (QE) photocathodes. A deposition of active elements from high QE photocathodes on the surface of a cavity makes it more vulnerable to multipacting (MP) and could affect the operation of an SRF gun. On the other side",
        "MP can significantly reduce the lifetime of a photocathode. It is well known in the SRF community that a strong coupling",
        "high forward power and sufficient cleanliness of cavity walls are the key components to overcome a low-level MP zone. In this paper we present a theoretical model of passing a MP barrier which could help estimate the desirable conditions for successful operation of an SRF gun. We demonstrate our results for the 113 MHz SRF photo-injector for Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) alongside with the experimental observations and 3D simulations of the MP discharge in the cavity. The results of the theoretical model and simulations show good agreement with the experimental results",

        "We present the results of experimental observation of emission from single diamond field emitter tips when triggered by an ultra-short laser pulse. Diamond field emitter array (DFEA) cathodes were originally proposed for applications that require large current densities. DFEAs represent periodic arrays of diamond pyramids with micron-size dimensions and tips with diameters of the order of tens of nanometers. DFEAs are known to produce significant currents in field emission regime under direct current (DC) fields and in radio-frequency (RF) guns. It has been proposed that single diamond tip emitters can be employed for production of small tightly focused electron beams for dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) that accelerate particles using the energy of light produced by infrared lasers. To generate short electron bunches required by DLAs diamond pyramids may be triggered with a laser. We have recently observed emission produced by a single diamond pyramid when triggered by a laser at different wavelengths from 256 nm to 2020 nm. We have conducted studies with the goal to understand mechanism of the emission. We clearly observed the change in emission mechanism when the wavelength changed from 256 nm to 512 nm. We believe that while the emission at 256 nm is a clear photoemission",
        "the emission at longer wavelengths is likely the field emission caused by intense electric fields of the laser."

Electric-field-assisted diamond emitters manufactured from semiconductor processes are strong candidates for cathodes in such sources. The micro-scale pyramid structure of the emitter has the desirable attribute of significant field enhancement at the sharp interfaces (apex and edges) to facilitate electron emission. We use the LSP particle-in-cell code to simulate the diamond emitter in a diode setup and obtain the beam size and divergence. An empirical fit of the fields around the apex is extracted for detail study. The trend of the beam divergence observed in the simulation is further corroborated using electron’s trajectory in the empirical field model. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "The high current and high bunch charge polarized electron source is essential for cost reduction of eRHIC. It aims to deliver electron beam with 10 mA average current and 5.3 nC bunch charge. We analyzed the mechanism of cathode degradation and proposed using a large strain superlattice GaAs photocathode in a high voltage DC gun to increase the charge lifetime above kilo Coulomb. The gun has been designed and fabricated and expected to start commissioning by the mid of this year. In this paper",
        "we will present the modeling of ion back bombardment and cathode degrading. We proposed an anode offset scheme to increase cathode lifetime. Also",
        "we will describe the details of gun design and the strategies to demonstrate high current high charge polarized electron beam from this source."

        "Photocathode laser shaping techniques to generate temporally shaped electron bunches are appealing owing to their simplicity. Such technique is being considered to form shaped electron bunches to enhance the transformer ratio in beam-driven accelerators. At low energy (i.e. during the emission process) the transverse and longitudinal space charge effects are coupled so that attaining a low beam transverse emittance require the laser to be spatiotemporal shaped. In this paper",
        "we explore the generation of a linearly-ramped bunch with optimized transverse emittance by temporally and radially shaping the laser pulse to provide an adequate initial distribution. We discuss a possible implementation of the optical shaping technique and describe a planned experiment."
