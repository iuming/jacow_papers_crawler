The production mode is based on the photo-fission process of a thick UCx target heated up to 2000°C and using the ISOL technique. For the ionization of the released fission fragments",

The mono-charged RIB exiting from the source must be separated using a magnetic dipole in order to select a nucleus before its transmission through electrostatic devices up to the experimental set-ups. This paper is focus on the separator which was build and exploited with success since 40 years. We propose to revisit this dipole with a precise field-map calculation and particles transport simulations. These results will be use as a first brick of the understanding and reliability of the transmission along the RIB lines at the ALTO facility."

        "a fast and adaptive feedback system is the appropriate approach to stabilize the dynamics and to overcome the limitations given by the instability. In this contribution",
        "we discuss first efforts towards a longitudinal feedback design that acts on the RF system of the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator) and aims for stabilization of the emitted THz radiation. Our approach is based on methods of adaptive control that were developed in the field of reinforcement learning and have seen great success in other fields of research over the past decade. We motivate this particular approach and comment on different aspects of its implementation."

One of such a method is the introduction of an excess of chromaticity from that of natural chromaticity by reversing the sextupole magnetic fields from the middle of the acceleration cycle. The benifits of this method are twofold. It allows to utilize sextupole for chromaticty correction at lower energy and also mitigate the beam instability at higher energy because of introducing higher chromaticity.

The distribution of breakdown timing shows a peak at the moment of RF power switches off. A series of simulation was performed to study the after-pulse breakdown effect in such a standing-wave structure. A method of calculating poynting vector over time is proposed in this article to study the modified poynting vector at critical points in the cavity. Field simulation and thermal simulation were also carried out to analyse possible reasons for the after-pulse breakdown effect."

This was observed in tracking for LEP and the Future Circular e+e- Collider (FCC-ee). Synchrotron radiation in the quadrupoles modulates the particle energy at the double betatron frequency. Energy modulation varies transverse focusing strength at the same frequency and creates a parametric resonance of the betatron oscillations with unusual properties. It occurs at arbitrary betatron frequency and the magnitude of the parameter modulation of the betatron oscillation depends on the oscillation amplitude. Equilibrium between the radiation damping and the resonant excitation gives the boundary of the stable motion. Here we continue comparison of tracking results with analytical calculations of the parametric resonance."

Earlier we considered with this approach radiation of the bunch moving along the axis of circular vacuum corrugated waveguide**. Comparison of analytical results with COMSOL simulations showed high accuracy of the EBC method. Here we analyze an analogous problem for the waveguide with corrugated wall and dielectric filling under condition that Cherenkov effect takes place in the dielectric. Due to this fact the radiation differs radically from that in the vacuum waveguide. At the same time",
        "the radiation has essential differences from the one in the usual dielectric waveguide. The radiation properties in the waveguide under consideration and its differences from the radiation in the waveguide with smooth wall are analyzed.",

It is no problem since the longitudinal dynamics is not sensitive to beam-beam interaction. But it is different since the bunch will also be lengthend during beam-beam interaction by beamstrahlung effect. It is very natural and more self-consistent to consider the longitudinal impedance in the beam-beam simulation. The simulation shows that the working point region of stable collision is slightly shifted by the longitudinal impedance. It is found that the vertical coherent oscillation may decreases the beam-beam limit with impedance at some working point."

The new injection scheme is likely to give rise to beta beating above the required level of 5\\% and new measurements are required. Achieving accurate optics measurements in PSB lattice is a challenging task that has involved several improvements in both hardware and software. This paper summarizes all the improvements that have been performed in the optics measurement acquisition system together with a brief summary of the first results obtained."

These misalignments would result from overlapping fringe fields of different field maps. The 3D field maps are obtained from the software for electromagnetic calculations OPERA. The full 3D map is saved in the tracking coordinate system and a ROOT (An Object Oriented Data Analysis Framework) ntuple is then created for analysis.

        "Crab cavities are a critical component within the High Luminosity upgrade project for the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). It is foreseen to use crab cavities in order to compensate the geometric luminosity reduction factor (reduction of the luminous region at the Interaction Point [IP]) due to the beam crossing angle (required for minimizing the impact of the long range beam-beam effects on the single particle beam dynamics) and increase the number of collisions per bunch crossing. In 2018 the first beam tests of crab cavities with protons were performed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. Two vertical superconducting cavities of the Double Quarter Wave (DQW) type were fabricated and installed in the SPS to verify some key components of the cavity design and operation. This paper will present some of the first results relating to the proton beam dynamics in the presence of crab cavities."

        "the linear optics correction algorithm for storage rings is revisited. In modern ring-based accelerators",
        "optics corrections are determined from repetitive measurements which help identify systematic and random quadrupole errors in presence of various measurement noises. This process is a multivariate nonlinear regression problem driven by either a completed lattice model or a Jacobian matrix. Starting from the Bayes’ theorem",
        "’likelihood functions’ and ’prior probability’ distributions are extracted from a complete linear optics model. Under some assumptions",
        "the least square algorithm and then the Jacobian matrix approach can be re-derived. The coherence of the correction algorithm is ensured through specifying a self-consistent regularization coefficient to prevent overfitting. Optimal weights for different correction objectives are obtained based on their measurement noise level. A new technique has been developed to resolve degenerated quadrupole errors when observed at a few select BPMs. A necessary condition of being distinguishable is that their optics response vectors seen at these specific BPMs should be near-orthogonal."

We focus on the field calculation of this method and show that the original idea has missed the important terms of fields due to electron acceleration and therefore only applies to a linear motion. To correct this limitation we developed a modified algorithm that gives consistent fields with direct calculations using the Liénard-Wiechert equation. Some basic signatures of the near-field SR fields are also drawn for a cyclotron motion by using this modified approach."

Experience obtained at many accelerator facilities shows the beam-based measurements are often different from the pre-computed impedance budgets",
