Two of these devices will operate in the soft x-ray range where there is expected to be a significant change to polarisation at the sample due to transmission effects of the beam line op-tics. Arbitrary polarisation selection of the ID will counter transmission effects and enable circular polarisation at the sample position. A polarisation model of the device is derived which allows for the calculation of both the Stokes parameters and photon energy for any set point of ID gap and phase. Numerical solutions of these equa-tions allow the calculation of gap and phase set points for any desired photon energy or polarisation. The results of the polarisation model are compared with numerical simulations of the synchrotron radiation calculated using measured magnetic fields at various polarisation modes."

The Cu-linac will produce a pair of electron bunches separated by the cavity-round-trip distance during each linac cycle.
