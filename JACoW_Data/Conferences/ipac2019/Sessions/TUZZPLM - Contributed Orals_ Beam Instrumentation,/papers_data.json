        "The European XFEL is in the operational stage since fall 2017. Since then",
        "tuning of the FEL performance (e.g. of the photon pulse energy) has become increasingly important. Due to a large number of parameters to which FEL facilities are highly sensitive and their complex correlations",
        "controlling and optimizing them in a speedy manner is becoming a very important and challenging task. Several automated optimization procedures were developed to optimize the FEL beam quality. In this work",
        "we present the status and the results of these activities",
        "as well as the optimization statistics."

New computational architectures for scientific computing have been added for high-performance data processing services and pipelining. Python and Java bindings have enabled powerful new user interfaces. The result has been that controls are now being integrated with modelling and simulation",
