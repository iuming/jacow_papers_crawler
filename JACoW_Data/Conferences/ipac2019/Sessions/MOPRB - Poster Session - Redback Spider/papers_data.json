        "The FCC-ee project studies the design of a future 100 km e+/e− circular collider for precision studies and rare decay observations in the range of 90 to 350 GeV center of mass energy with luminosities in the order of 1036 cm-2s-1. In order to reach these luminosity requirements",
        "extreme focusing is needed in the interaction regions. For the Z energy (45.6 GeV) lattice",
        "the maximum beta value is 8322 m",
        "and the vertical beta function is 0.8 mm at the IP. These aspects of the FCC-ee lattice make it particularly susceptible to misalignments and field errors",
        "and therefore present an appreciable challenge for emittance tuning. A challenging correction scheme is proposed to reduce the coupling and the vertical emittance. We describe a comprehensive correction strategy used for the low emittance tuning. The strategy includes special programs",
        "that had been developed to optimise the lattice based on Dispersion Free Steering",
        "linear coupling compensation based on Resonant Driving Terms and beta beat correction utilising response matrices. Thousands of misalignment and field error random seeds were introduced in MADX simulations and the final corrected lattices are presented."

Several million individual particle tracks have been recorded passing through a series of focusing magnets in a number of different configurations and a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride absorber. Measurement of the tracks upstream and downstream of the absorber has shown the expected effects of the 4D emittance reduction. Further studies are providing now more and deeper insight.

        "Short pulse two-beam acceleration (TBA) is a structure wakefield acceleration (SWFA) approach aiming to achieve gradient above 250 MV/m using rf pulses less than 20 ns. An X-band 11.7 GHz metallic power extractor has been developed as the power source to test accelerating structures in this extreme regime. The power extractor is designed to be driven by high charge bunches separated by 769.2 ps (9 times the X-band period) on an L-band 1.3 GHz beamline. In the recent experiment",
        "~280 MW rf pulses with 3 ns flat-top have been measured by a coaxial rf pickup when driven by 8-bunch trains with a total charge of ~500 nC. The power level is ~50% lower than the theoretical prediction and simulation. Experimental investigation suggests that the missing power was mainly caused by the multipacting issue inside the rf pickup",
        "which could be eliminated by a newly-designed directional coupler."

      "abstract": "Advanced CW accelerators are one of high priority directions identified by Advanced Accelerator Concepts Research Roadmap Workshop Report *. High transformer ratio of beam-driven accelerators is critically important for cost-effective FEL systems. We present a proposed experiment for demonstrating a high transformer ratio CW dielectric accelerator using operational SRF accelerator built for Coherent electron Cooling experiment. This accelerator operates with CW electron beam comprised of 78 kHz train of electron bunches. Electron bunches with controllable longitudinal and charge up to 10 nC per bunch are generated in 1.25 MV SRF photo-electron gun. This bunches are ballistically compressed to duration of 10-to-30 psec and accelerated to 15 MeV in SRF linac**. Such bunches would be excellent drivers of high-transformer ratio DWA accelerators. In this paper we present expected performance of proposed CW DWA accelerator. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

In our initial design the electron and hadron magnets were staggered so their respective cold masses did not overlap; however",
        "this restricts the longitudinal space for the first hadron quadrupole and led to the challenge of making a high-field Nb3Sn main coil structure fit inside limited radial space within an external field active shield coil. In our new layout the crossing angle increased from 22 to 25 mrad and the electron and hadron cold masses are now side-by-side. This layout allows longer magnetic lengths for reducing the coil peak fields; NbTi conductor can now be used everywhere. Of course we must take care to control magnetic cross talk between neighboring apertures. One trick we will use to accomplish this is to maximize the yoke material thickness between the beams by tapering (i.e. change coil radius as a function of longitudinal position) some of the electron coils. The new eRHIC IR layout and magnet design is reported in this paper along with ongoing R&D to wind tapered coils."

Our proposed technique is expected to provide a promising approach for optimizing injection and thereby improving the performance of the Muon g-2 Experiment."

Subsequent foil stripping and capture of protons into a storage ring generates cool proton bunches with significantly reduced emittance compared to the parent beam. The properties of the extracted proton beam can be precisely controlled and sculpted by adjusting the optical parameters of the laser beam. Recirculation of the parent beam allows time for space-charge effects to repopulate the emittance phase space prior to repeated laser extraction. We present particle tracking simulations of the proposed scheme",
