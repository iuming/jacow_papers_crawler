        "The RadiaBeam/SLAC dechirper was installed to demonstrate the concept of using wakefields from a corrugated structure to change the energy profile along an electron bunch. Since installation",
        "the system has allowed a large number of additional XFEL operating modes including fresh-slice two-color or three color operation",
        "fresh-slice seeding",
        "passive streaking",
