        "the facility has demonstrated excellent stability with very small timing jitter of about 20 fs",
        "and commissioned the self-seeding system over a wide range of photon energies",
        "etc. The talk will provide an overview of the last three years at the PAL-XFEL",
        "including some detailed experimental results",
        "as well as future prospects for the laboratory."

        "SACLA. Self-seeding of a hard x-ray FEL has been demonstrated at SLAC and SACLA using a transmission type scheme with a single crystal. However",
        "the gain of the spectral brightness is limited in the transmission type scheme. Therefore",
        "a reflection type self-seeding system with a pair of channel-cut crystals has been developed at SACLA and self-seeding experiments have been performed. Adoption of a channel-cut crystal is critically important to minimize the delay of the seed laser from the electron bunch. Preliminary results showed much higher spectral brightness and much better stability than the transmission scheme. This talk presents the design of the reflection type scheme and the performance of the self- seeded XFEL obtained at SACLA."

In this paper",
