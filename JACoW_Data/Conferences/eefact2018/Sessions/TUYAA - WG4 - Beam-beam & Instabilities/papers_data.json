        "the Italian lepton collider",
        "operates routinely with high intensity electron and positron colliding beams. The high current multi-bunch beams are stored in two independent rings",
        "each of them 97 m long",
        "and are distributed in 100 ’ 110 contiguous buckets out of the 120 available",
        "spaced by only 2.7 ns. Since its construction",
        "DAΦNE has been operated in different configurations which",
        "overall",
        "allowed to store current up to 1.4 A and 2.45 A in the positron and in the electron beam respectively. Still today DAΦNE holds the record for the highest electron beam current ever stored in particle factories and modern synchrotron radiation sources. The DAΦNE experience in terms of beam dynamics optimization aimed at achieving the high intensity beams is presented",
        "with special emphasis on the e-cloud related issues",
        "which represent the dominant effect limiting the positron beam current."

Its luminosity performance relies on the beam stability under high-intensity electron and ion beam operation. The impedance budget analysis and the estimations of beam instabilities are currently underway. In this paper",
        "we present the update status of our back-of-envelope estimations for these collective instabilities",

        "permanent magnets and solenoids were attached to the beam pipes as additional countermeasures. Consequently",
        "during Phase-2 commissioning from March to July 2018",
        "experiments showed that the threshold beam current for exciting ECE increased by a factor of at least two relative to that during Phase-1 commissioning. While the countermeasures were strengthened",
        "the effectiveness of the antechambers and TiN film coating was re-evaluated. From various simulations and experiments during Phase-2 commissioning",
        "the antechamber was found to be less effective than expected with regard to reducing the number of photoelectrons in the beam channel. The TiN film coating",
        "on the other hand",
        "was considered to have a low secondary electron yield as expected."
