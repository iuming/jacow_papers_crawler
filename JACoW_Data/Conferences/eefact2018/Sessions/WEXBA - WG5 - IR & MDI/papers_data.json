        "New e+e− accelerator designs aim for factory-like performance with high-current beams and high luminosities. These new machines will push interaction region designs to new levels and require a careful evaluation of all previous background sources as well as introduce possibly new background sources. I present here a summary of standard background sources and also suggest a new possible background source for Synchrotron Radiation (SR) namely",
        "specular reflection. In addition",
        "one will have to pay closer attention to the beam tail particle distribution as this may become a significant source of SR background from the high-current and high-energy beams of these new designs."
