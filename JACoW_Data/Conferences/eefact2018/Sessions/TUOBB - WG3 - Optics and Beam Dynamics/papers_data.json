        "Collision in SuperKEKB phase II commissioning has started in April 2018. Luminosity was lower than the geomterical value even in very low bunch current. Linear x-y coupling at IP caused by skew of QCS was conjectured as error source. x-y coupling correction using skew corrector of QCS resulted in luminosity recover of 2 times. After the QCS skew correction",
        "luminosity is still limited at relatively low bunch current. Nonlinear x-y coupling at IP is conjectured as a source of the luminosity limitation. We discuss effects of linear and nonlinear x-y coupling at IP on the beam-beam performance."

        "The nano-beam scheme can squeeze the vertical beta function at the IP much smaller than the bunch length. It implies that the large chromaticity is generated in the vicinity of the final focus quadrupole magnets and the strong sextupoles are adopted to correct the chromaticity",
        "for instance the local chromaticity corrections. While understanding of the off-momentum optics is important to optimize the dynamic aperture to make Touschek lifetime long and to reduce the luminosity degradation due to chromatic behaviors. In general",
        "there is a discrepancy between measurements and those obtained from the optics model. The chromatic phase-advance is introduced to measure the off-momentum optics and correct by using sextupole magnets."

        "BEPCII has been operated in the energy region from 1.0 GeV to 2.3 GeV since 2009. The energy region is quite large so that it is very important to select optics for the optimized luminosity. Different optics within different energy region at BEPCII will be introduced in detail in this paper."
