        "The efficient plug to beam power conversion promised by the use of Superconducting RF to accelerate particle beams is still the driving force to pursue the development of this technology. Once the effective gain reached the level to pay for cryogenics",
        "big physics laboratories started to believe on SRF",
        "investing resources and proposing large challenging projects. Since then the cooperation with industry has been crucial to transform e few lab results into reliable SRF cavities and related ancillaries. This process started in the eighties and reached the actual paradigm with the realization of the European XFEL. All the new large scale projects in construction or proposed should start from the analysis of this experience and move forward from there."

        "Eight superconducting accelerating cavities were operated for more than ten years at the KEKB. Commisioning operation of SuperKEKB is ongoing and those cavities are also used to accelerate the electron beam of 2.6 A. There are some issues to address the large beam current and to realize stable operation. One issue is a large HOM power of 37 kW expected to be induced in each cavity module. To cope with the HOM power issue",
        "we have installed an additional HOM damper to the downstream of the cavity module. Another issue is degradation of Q values of the cavities during the ten years operation. Cause of the degradation was particle contamination. To clean the cavity surface",
        "high pressure rinsing (HPR) is an effective way. Therefore we have developed a horizontal HPR. In this method",
        "a nozzle for water jet is inserted horizontally into the cavity module without disassembly of the cavity. We applied the horizontal HPR to our degraded cavities. The RF performances of those cavities have been successfully recovered. In this report",
        "present status of our cavity will be presented. Additionally",
        "LLRF control issues for SuperKEKB will be introduced."
