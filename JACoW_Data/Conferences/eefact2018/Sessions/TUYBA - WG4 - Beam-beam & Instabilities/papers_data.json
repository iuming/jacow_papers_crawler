        "Coherent beam-beam nstability in head-tail mode has been predicted in collision with a large crossing angle. The instability is serious for design of future e+e− colliders based on the large crossing angle collision. It is possible to observe the instability in SuperKEKB commissioning. Horizontal beam size blow-up of both beams has been seen depending on the tune operating point. We report the measurement results of the instability in SuperKEKB phaseII commissioning."

        "One of the main requirements for future e+e− colliders is high luminosity. If the energy per beam does not exceed 200 GeV",
        "the optimal choice will be a circular collider with \"crab waist\" collision scheme. Here",
        "to achieve maximum luminosity",
        "the beams should have a very high density at the IP. For this reason",

        "but at high energies BS substantially changes the picture. In the example of FCC-ee",
        "we will consider the features of beam-beam interaction at high-energy crab waist colliders",

Some issues related with beam-beam interaction will be emphasized. The bunch lengthening due to impedance and beamstrahlung is simulated in a more self-consistent method. It is found that there exist very narrow stable working point space at W-mode during the CDR design study. We’ll show wider tune scan result. It is found that there exist some disagreement between dynamic aperture and beam lifetime. We try to define the so-called diffusion rate map to explain the cause. Some initial result for different lattice solution is shown."
