        "KEKB/SuperKEKB cryogenics operation will be introduced. KEKB was built in the tunnel of the TRISTAN accelerator. The TRISTAN accelerator was operated from 1986 to 1995. The superconducting acceleration cavities were installed in 1988 to increase the beam energy. The cryogenic system for superconducting cavities was also established simultaneously. In 1989 superconducting cavities were added",
        "and cryogenic systems were also enhanced from 4kW to 6.5kW. KEKB took over many facilities from TRISTAN. The cryogenic system for superconducting cavities is one of them. This old refrigerator is used also in SuperKEKB. In operation of the cryogenic system",
        "it is necessary to cool down the equipment from room temperature. In KEKB",
        "its cooling rate of cavities are limited to 2.5~3K/h. In the steady state",
        "the pressure and the liquid level in the superconducting cavity cryomodule should be kept constant. To keep the condition in the cryomodule stably",
        "the sum of the heat generated by RF and the heater is controlled as constant. In KEKB/SuperKEKB",
        "superconducting magnets are also used. They have their own refrigerator. In the workshop",
        "they are also introduced."

        "the booster ring and the collider ring. There are 432 superconducting cavities in total. In the booster ring",
        "there are 96 ILC type 1.3 GHz 9-cell superconducting cavities; eight of them will be packaged in one 12-m-long module. There are 12 such modules. In the collider ring",
        "there are 240 650 MHz 2-cell cavities; six of them will be packaged in one 11-m-long module. There are 40 of them. All the cavities will be cooled in a liquid-helium bath at a temperature of 2K to achieve a good cavity quality factor. The cooling benefits from helium II thermo-physical properties of large effective thermal conductivity and heat capacity as well as low viscosity and is a technically safe and economically reasonable choice. The 2K cryostat will be protected against heat radiation by means of two thermal shields cooling with 5-8K helium as well as 40-80K helium from a refrigerator. There are 4 cryo-stations along the 100km circular collider with the physical design of double ring. Generally",
        "each cryo-station is supplied from a common cryogenic plant",
        "with one refrigerator and one distribution box. The cooling capacity of each refrigerator is 18kW @ 4.5K."
