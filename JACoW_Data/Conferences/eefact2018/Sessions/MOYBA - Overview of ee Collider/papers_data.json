        "VEPP-2000 is the only electron-positron collider operating with round beams that allow to enhance beam-beam limit. VEPP-2000 with SND and CMD-3 detectors carried out two successful data-taking runs after new BINP injection complex was commissioned. The 2016/2017 run was dedicated to high energy range (640-1000 MeV per beam) while the 2017/2018 run was focused at 275-600 MeV/beam energies. With sufficient positron production rate and upgraded full-energy booster the collider luminosity was limited by beam-beam effects",
        "namely flip-flop effect. Thorough machine tuning together with new ideas introduced to suppress flip-flop allowed to achieve high beam-beam tuneshift and bunch-by-bunch luminosity values at specific beam energies. The achieved luminosity increased 2-5 times in a whole energy range in comparison to phase-1 operation (2010-2013)."

        "it has a higher new-physics reach potential in comparison with other exotic atoms. We propose a low energy e+e− collider for production of the not yet observed (μ+μ-) bound system. Low beam energy E(beam)=400 MeV and small circumference Π=30 m of the machine make it inexpensive to manufacture and operate. Large crossing angle (75 degrees)of e+e− beams produces dimuonium with non-zero momentum shifting decay point from beams collision area and providing effective suppression of the main source of background – elastic e+e− scattering. The peak luminosity at μ+μ- production threshold is 8×1031 cm-2s-1. Reversing one of the beams direction allows to study π± and η mesons with high luminosity.",
