        "approximately ten experimental runs per day were performed with e−/e+ injections in between. As another collider PEP-II had a powerful injector SLAC",
        "the KEKB injector had to make a few improvements seriously",

        "continuous injection scheme",
        "eventual simultaneous top-up injections",
        "as well as many operational optimizations. The design of SuperKEKB further required the beam quality improvements especially in the lower beam emittance for the nano-beam scheme",
        "as well as in the beam current for the higher ring stored current and the shorter lifetime."
