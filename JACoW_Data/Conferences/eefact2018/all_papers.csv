eefact2018,,MOXAA02,Highlights from SuperKEKB Commissioning,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; SuperKEKB is an electron-positron double-ring asymmetric-energy collider to search new physics phenomena appeared in B-boson decays. In order to accomplish this purpose; the huge statics; it is necessary for 40 times the luminosity as high as the predecessor KEKB collider. The strategy is that the vertical beta function at the IP is squeezed down to 1/20 and the beam currents doubles those of KEKB while keeping the same beam-beam parameter. The vertical beta function at the IP will be much smaller than the bunch length; however; the hourglass effect which degrades the luminosity will be reduced by adopting a novel ‘‘nano-beam’ scheme. First of all; the Phase 2 commissioning was focused on the verification of nano-beam scheme. Secondary; beam related background at the Belle II detector was also studied for the preparation of the pixel vertex detector installed before the Phase 3 operation. The preliminary results and accomplishments of the commissioning in Phase 2 will be reported in this article.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ee,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/talks/moxaa02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/papers/moxaa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/posters/moxaa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2018-MOXAA02,1

VEPP-2000 with SND and CMD-3 detectors carried out two successful data-taking runs after new BINP injection complex was commissioned. The 2016/2017 run was dedicated to high energy range (640-1000 MeV per beam) while the 2017/2018 run was focused at 275-600 MeV/beam energies. With sufficient positron production rate and upgraded full-energy booster the collider luminosity was limited by beam-beam effects; namely flip-flop effect. Thorough machine tuning together with new ideas introduced to suppress flip-flop allowed to achieve high beam-beam tuneshift and bunch-by-bunch luminosity values at specific beam energies. The achieved luminosity increased 2-5 times in a whole energy range in comparison to phase-1 operation (2010-2013).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ee,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/talks/moyba01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/papers/moyba01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/posters/moyba01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2018-MOYBA01,34

Observation and study of dimuonium (μ+μ-) will test QED and quantum mechanics computations in the new regime. Dimuonium radius is 200 times smaller than positronium; therefore; it has a higher new-physics reach potential in comparison with other exotic atoms. We propose a low energy e+e− collider for production of the not yet observed (μ+μ-) bound system. Low beam energy E(beam)=400 MeV and small circumference Π=30 m of the machine make it inexpensive to manufacture and operate. Large crossing angle (75 degrees)of e+e− beams produces dimuonium with non-zero momentum shifting decay point from beams collision area and providing effective suppression of the main source of background – elastic e+e− scattering. The peak luminosity at μ+μ- production threshold is 8×1031 cm-2s-1. Reversing one of the beams direction allows to study π± and η mesons with high luminosity.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/talks/moyba02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/papers/moyba02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/posters/moyba02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2018-MOYBA02,

This was observed in LEP and the Future Circular e+e- Collider (FCC-ee). Synchrotron radiation in the quadrupoles modulates the particle energy at the double betatron frequency. Energy modulation varies transverse focusing strength at the same frequency and creates a parametric resonance of the betatron oscillations.

In order to reach these requirements; extreme focusing of the beam is needed in the interaction regions; leading to a vertical beta function of 0.8 mm at the IP. These challenges make the FCC-ee design particularly susceptible to misalignment and field errors. This paper describes the tolerance of the machine to magnet alignment errors and the effectiveness of optics and orbit correction methods that were implemented in order to bring the vertical dispersion to acceptable values; which in turn limits the vertical emittance. Thousands of misalignment and error seeds were introduced in MADX simulations and a comprehensive correction strategy; which includes macros based upon Dispersion Free Steering (DFS); linear coupling correction based on Resonant Driving Terms (RDTs) and response matrices; was implemented.

The electron clouds were considered to exist in the beam pipes in the drift spaces of the ring; where the beam pipes have antechambers and titanium nitride (TiN) coating as countermeasures against ECE. Following this; permanent magnets and solenoids were attached to the beam pipes as additional countermeasures. Consequently; during Phase-2 commissioning from March to July 2018; experiments showed that the threshold beam current for exciting ECE increased by a factor of at least two relative to that during Phase-1 commissioning. While the countermeasures were strengthened; the effectiveness of the antechambers and TiN film coating was re-evaluated. From various simulations and experiments during Phase-2 commissioning; the antechamber was found to be less effective than expected with regard to reducing the number of photoelectrons in the beam channel. The TiN film coating; on the other hand; was considered to have a low secondary electron yield as expected.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ee,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/talks/tuyaa04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/papers/tuyaa04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/posters/tuyaa04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2018-TUYAA04,95

eefact2018,,TUYBA02,Beam-beam Effects at High Energy e+e− Colliders,"BINP SB RAS; Novosibirsk; Russia; One of the main requirements for future e+e− colliders is high luminosity. If the energy per beam does not exceed 200 GeV; the optimal choice will be a circular collider with ""crab waist"" collision scheme. Here; to achieve maximum luminosity; the beams should have a very high density at the IP. For this reason; radiation in the field of a counter bunch (BS - beamstrahlung) becomes an appreciable factor affecting the dynamics of particles. In particular; in the simulation for FCC-ee; new phenomena were discovered: 3D flip-flop and coherent X-Z instability. The first is directly related to BS. The second can manifest itself at low energy (where BS is negligible); but at high energies BS substantially changes the picture. In the example of FCC-ee; we will consider the features of beam-beam interaction at high-energy crab waist colliders; and optimization of parameters for high luminosity.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ee,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/talks/tuyba02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/papers/tuyba02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/posters/tuyba02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2018-TUYBA02,106

Still; some beam parameters of these machines; like energy spread and damping decrements; are so high near 80 GeV per beam; that it is required special consideration and tricks to overcome the difficulties. The author has written simple spin tracking code; which simulates main features of the RD process in presence of continuous energy diffusion due to synchrotron radiation fluctuations. It was shown by this study; that the applicability of the RD method is limited by the effect of widening of a width of the central peak of the spin precession spectrum when the synchrotron tune is chosen too low; say below 0.05. In this case spin precession lost its resonant nature due to overlap of the wide central spectrum peak with nearby synchrotron side bands.

In the Phase-1 commissioning in 2016; vacuum scrubbing and confirmation of the stabilities of new vacuum components at approximately 1 A were carried out. Though some problems such as pressure bursts accompanying beam losses were revealed; no serious problem was found in the vacuum system. During the subsequent shutdown; the countermeasures against the problems were taken; and new beam pipes and components such as beam collimators were installed. The Phase-2 commissioning; where beam collision tuning was mainly performed; was carried out from March to July 2018. The collimators worked very well to suppress the background noise of the Belle-II detector; though some of them were damaged by the beam. The frequency of the pressure burst drastically decreased though the typical beam currents were lower than those of the Phase-1.

Electron cloud build up simulations on the Z resonance revealed the necessity of minimising the Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) of the pipe walls by applying a Ti-Zr-V Non-Evaporable Getter (NEG) coating in the entire ring. Beam dynamics simulations at 45.6 GeV pointed out that minimising the thickness of this layer is mandatory to reduce the resistive wall (RW) impedance; thus increasing the single bunch instability thresholds and ensuring beam stability during operation. However; reducing the coating thickness can affect the performance of the material and therefore the SEY. For this reason; an extensive measurement campaign was performed at CERN to characterise NEG thin films with thicknesses below 250 nm in terms of activation performance and SEY measurements.

There are some issues to address the large beam current and to realize stable operation. One issue is a large HOM power of 37 kW expected to be induced in each cavity module. To cope with the HOM power issue; we have installed an additional HOM damper to the downstream of the cavity module. Another issue is degradation of Q values of the cavities during the ten years operation. Cause of the degradation was particle contamination. To clean the cavity surface; high pressure rinsing (HPR) is an effective way. Therefore we have developed a horizontal HPR.

There are 432 superconducting cavities in total. In the booster ring; there are 96 ILC type 1.3 GHz 9-cell superconducting cavities; eight of them will be packaged in one 12-m-long module. There are 12 such modules. In the collider ring; there are 240 650 MHz 2-cell cavities; six of them will be packaged in one 11-m-long module. There are 40 of them. All the cavities will be cooled in a liquid-helium bath at a temperature of 2K to achieve a good cavity quality factor. The cooling benefits from helium II thermo-physical properties of large effective thermal conductivity and heat capacity as well as low viscosity and is a technically safe and economically reasonable choice. The 2K cryostat will be protected against heat radiation by means of two thermal shields cooling with 5-8K helium as well as 40-80K helium from a refrigerator. There are 4 cryo-stations along the 100km circular collider with the physical design of double ring. Generally; each cryo-station is supplied from a common cryogenic plant; with one refrigerator and one distribution box. The cooling capacity of each refrigerator is 18kW @ 4.5K.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ee,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/talks/wepab05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/papers/wepab05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2018/posters/wepab05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2018-WEPAB05,282
