Compact Accelerator-based Neutron Sources (CANS) offer the possibility of an intense source of pulsed neutrons with a capital cost significantly lower than spallation sources. In an effort to close the neutron gap in Canada a prototype; Canadian compact accelerator-based neutron source (PC-CANS) is proposed for installation at the University of Windsor. The PC-CANS is envisaged to serve two neutron science instruments; a boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) station and a beamline for fluorine-18 radioisotope production for positron emission tomography (PET). To serve these diverse applications of neutron beams; a linear accelerator solution is selected; that will provide 10 MeV protons with a peak current of 10 mA within a 5% duty cycle. The accelerator is based on an RFQ and DTL with a post-DTL pulsed kicker system to simultaneously deliver macro-pulses to each end-station. Several choices of Linac technology are being considered and a comparison of the choices will be presented.,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code please see instructions how to view/control embeded videos Slides FR1AA05 [1.945 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/supcjo01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/supcjo01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/supcjo01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-SUPCJO01,

These compact accelerators rely on advancements made to both Nb3Sn SRF cavities and commercial cryocoolers; which together allow for the removal of liquid cryogenics from the system. This approach to SRF cavity operation; based on novel conduction cooling schemes; has the potential to drastically extend the range of application of SRF technology. By offering robust; non-expert; turn-key operation; such systems enable the use of SRF accelerators for industrial; medical; and small-scale science applications. This presentation will provide an overview of the significant progress being made at Cornell; Jefferson Lab; and Fermilab (FNAL); including stable cavity operation at 10 MV/m. It will also introduce the primary challenges of this new field and their potential solutions; along with an overview of the various applications which could benefit the most from this technology.,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code please see instructions how to view/control embeded videos Slides TU1AA02 [4.683 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/supcjo04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/supcjo04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/supcjo04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-SUPCJO04,

linac2022,,MO2AA03,The FLASHForward Experiment at DESY,Oxford University; Physics Department; Oxford; Oxon; United Kingdom; R.T.P. D’Arcy; J. Osterhoff; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; The FLASHForward experiment at DESY is a beamline built for electron-beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration. The drive beams; supplied by the linac of the free-electron laser FLASH; have energies of up to 1.40 GeV; a charge of up to 1 nC; emittance of a few mm mrad; a pulse duration down to 50 fs; and can be supplied at up to MHz repetition rates. In the future; FLASHForward aims to operate as a beam-quality-preserving; high efficiency; high-average-power plasma-based energy booster for FLASH. To achieve this; during its first data-taking period (2018-2021) novel techniques were developed to enable high-quality plasma wakefield acceleration at >GV/m accelerating gradients*. Further; the upper limits of the achievable repetition rate of plasma-based accelerators were explored for the first time with a view to demonstrating high-average-power (>kW) operation**.

PIP2IT comprises the warm front end and the first two PIP-II superconducting cryomodules. PIP2IT is designed to accelerate a 2 mA H− beam to an energy of 20 MeV. The facility serves as a testbed for a number of advanced technologies required to operate PIP-II and provides an opportunity to gain experience with commissioning of the superconducting linac; significantly reducing project technical risks. Some PIP2IT components are contributions from international partners; who also lend their expertise to the accelerator project. The project has been successfully commissioned with the beam in 2021; demonstrating the performance required for the LBNF/DUNE. In this paper; we describe the facility and its critical systems. We discuss our experience with the integrated testing and beam commissioning of PIP2IT; and present commissioning results.

To provide the maximum flexibility many users require mobile CVI systems to allow vehicles to be screened efficiently for threats and contraband. The need for mobile systems means that the linear accelerator; and ancillary systems; used to generate the x-rays must be compact; rugged; and reliable. These systems must meet image performance tests specified by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The IEC also defines a standard for material discrimination. The requirements of these standards mean that the x-ray output produced by the linac needs to be consistent during and between scans; with the stability and repeatability of the output being critical. The tolerances on the linac output to meet the performance standards combined with the need for a compact system gives an unusual challenge for the linac design. A review of how different stability measures impact the performance tests is presented. This is compared to current technologies and possible future linacs used for mobile CVI systems.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/mopojo11_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/mopojo11.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/mopojo11_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-MOPOJO11,50

It is gaining significant interest from the global medical community as an improved user-friendly technology to reduce the usage of Ir-192. However; the present EB machines all use electron beams at energies of 100 kV or less to generate the X-ray photons; which limits their use to low dose-rate brachytherapy. We focus on the development of a compact and light weight 1-MeV linac to generate and deliver >250 kV X-ray photons to the patient. The device is intended to retrofit to existing brachytherapy applicators.

EuXFEL is currently being operated in a pulsed mode with a repetition rate of 10Hz. One upgrade scenario consists of operating the EuXFEL also in a Continuous-Wave (CW) mode of operation to improve the quality of experiments. This upgrade brings new challenges and requires new algorithms to deal with controlling a stable accelerating field inside the Superconducting Radiofrequency (SRF) accelerating cavities and keeping them on resonance in this new mode of operation. The purpose of this research work is to identify the mechanical dynamics of the cavities which will facilitate the development of the resonance controller for the CW upgrade. To this extent; experiments were conducted at a test bench. For the first time; in this work; two different types of spectrally rich excitation signals: multi-sine and stepped-sine are used to excite the mechanical dynamics of the cavities using the piezo actuator. After the analysis of experimental data; mechanical modes are successfully identified and will be used to design the controller.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/mopopa02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/mopopa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/mopopa02_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-MOPOPA02,76

With the exception of the first station which is part of the injector; each station comprises 32 1.3-GHz SRF TESLA cavities; driven by a single 10-MW klystron. A sophisticated state-of-the-art low-level RF (LLRF) system maintains the complex vector sum of each RF station. Monitoring and maintaining the calibration of the cavity electric field (gradient) probe signals has proven critical in achieving the maximum energy performance and availability of the SRF linac. Since there are no dedicated diagnostics for cross-checking calibration of the LLRF system; a procedure has been implemented based on simultaneously measuring the beam transient in open-loop operation of all cavities. Based on methods originally developed at FLASH; the European XFEL procedure makes use of automation and the XFEL LLRF DAQ system to provide a robust and relatively fast (minutes) way of extracting the transient data; and is now routinely scheduled once per week.

It is evolving from the concept of the 4 European cancer therapy centers applying light ions up to carbon. The new linac will in its simpliest version allow C4+ - beam injection into synchrotrons at 5 A MeV; with high beam transmission and allowing currents up to 5 mA alpha - particles. An advanced ECR - ion source will inject into an RFQ - IH-DTL combination. The DTL concept allows upgraded versions for A/q - values up to two and with beam energies of 7.1 A MeV from IH - tank2 and 10 A MeV from IH-tank3. The higher beam injection energies for light ions allow a relaxed synchrotron operation at lowest magnetic field levels. A main argument for the DTL extensions however is an additional linac function as radioisotope facility driver. The 7.1 A MeV are especially defined for the clean production of 211At; which may play a future role in cancer therapy. The linac will allow for high duty factors - up to 10%; to fulfil the needs for efficient radioisotope production. Solid state amplifiers with matched design RF power levels (up to 600 kW for IH3) will be used.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/mopoge01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/mopoge01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/mopoge01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-MOPOGE01,134

The accelerator features also a vertical low energy (3-7 MeV) line for irradiation of samples in horizontal position.

A prerequisite to achieve such goal is the capability to complete the RF conditioning of the accelerating modules in a systematic and automatic way; with minimal inputs from RF engineers. In the past years ADAM developed an automatic conditioning system capable of increasing the main conditioning parameters ’ RF power; pulse width; repetition rate ’ while controlling the cavity breakdown rate and vacuum level.

This is especially the case in a normal-conducting linac; because the cavity’s acceleration efficiency varies with the velocity of the synchronous particle. For low-energy proton acceleration; while Alvarez drift-tube linacs (DTLs) are the most prevalent; TE-mode accelerating structures; which could also be called H-mode structures; are also widely used immediately after an initial radiofrequency quadrupole linac (RFQ). At present; the representative structures of TE modes are interdigital H-mode (IH) DTL and crossbar H-mode (CH) DTL; which are based on the TE11-mode pillbox cavity and TE21-mode pillbox cavity; respectively. In this presentation; acceleration efficiency of TE-mode structures including higher-order TE-modes such as TE31 and TE41 was comparatively reviewed with Alvarez DTL.

The sequentially measuring and monitoring the comb-like beam pulse ensures the beam stability with less beam loss at the current operation and higher beam intensity scenarios at the J-PARC.

This device is designed on the principle of detecting the secondary ions from the ionisation induced in the interaction between the quantum gas jet and charged particle beams. This monitor aims to generate an intense gas jet with a diameter of less than 100 µm; which can ultimately lead to superior position resolution and high signal intensity resulting from a strongly focused quantum gas jet. This is done by exploiting the quantum wave feature of the neutral gas atoms to generate an interference pattern with a single maximum acting as an ultra-thin gas jet using an ’atom sieve’ which is similar to the light focusing with a Fresnel zone plate. This device will be minimally interceptive and will work analogously to a mechanical wire scanner.

It utilises a supersonic gas curtain which traverses the beam perpendicular to its propagation and measures beam-induced ionisation interactions of the gas. A 2D transverse beam profile image is created by orientating the gas jet 45 degrees to obtain both X and Y distributions of the beam. This paper builds upon previously used single-slit skimmers and improves their ability to form the gas jet into a desired distribution for imaging beam halo. A skimmer device removes off-momentum gas particles and forms the jet into a dense thin curtain; suitable for transverse imaging of the beam. The use of a novel double-slit skimmer is shown to provide a mask-like void of gas over the beam core; increasing the relative intensity of the halo interactions for measurement. Such a non-invasive monitor would be beneficial to linacs by providing real time beam characteristic measurements without affecting the beam. More specifically; beam halo behaviour is a key characteristic associated with beam losses within linacs.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/mopori04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/mopori04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/mopori04_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-MOPORI04,227

Often; properties are measured beforehand for fixed operation modes; users then rely on the long-term stability of the beam. Otherwise; diagnostics must be integrated into a user experiment; costing resources and limiting space in the user area. This contribution proposes the application of machine learning to develop a suite of virtual diagnostic systems. Virtual diagnostics take data at easy to access locations; and infer beam properties at locations where a measurement has not been taken; and often cannot be taken. Here the focus is the user area at the planned Full Energy Beam Exploitation (FEBE) upgrade to the CLARA facility (UK). Presented is a simulation-based proof-of-concept for a variety of virtual diagnostics. Transverse and longitudinal properties are measured upstream of the user area; coupled with the beam optics parameters leading to the user area; and input into a neural network; to predict the same parameters within the user area.

One of the crucial steps in the course of acceleration along the UNILAC is the stripping of the ions by a gas stripper in front of the main linac. Its efficiency is decisive in reaching the intensities required and may be increased by more than 50% by introducing hydrogen as stripping target; instead of the nitrogen used so far. This requires the stripper to be operated in a pulsed mode; since otherwise the pumping speed is not sufficient to maintain suitable vacuum conditions. The proof of principle was demonstrated in 2016*. A dedicated project aims for a setup suitable for routine operation. Main issues are safety; reliability and automated operation. We report on the development done since 2016 and give an overview of the realisation coming within the next few years.

We investigate possible microscopic mechanisms that drive improved performance by carrying out sequential RF tests on cavities subjected to low temperature baking. We compare performance evolution to observations made with material science techniques and find correlations with material parameters. We also discuss other key advancements that enable high gradient operation in cryomodules. please see instructions how to view/control embeded videos Slides TU1AA03 [2.007 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/tu1aa03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/tu1aa03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/tu1aa03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-TU1AA03,295
linac2022,,TU1AA04,SWELL and Other SRF Split Cavity Development,CERN; Meyrin; Switzerland; An innovative superconducting cavity topology has been recently proposed at CERN and at Lancaster University. It integrates longitudinal slots crossing perpendicularly the RF surface. The RF current lines run along the slots; inducing no perturbation of the accelerating mode. Thanks to this approach; the cavity can be built using halves or quadrants; which is well appropriate to precise manufacturing techniques. This configuration allows direct access to the RF surface; thus facilitating the surface preparation and thin film deposition process in the case of cavities based on Nb/Cu technology. The contact faces between the cavity parts are moved to the slots’ ends where the electromagnetic fields are extremely low; thus relaxing the constraints on the quality of the assembly joints. This paper covers the latest development of a 600 MHz slotted elliptical cavity called SWELL; which has been proposed as an alternative option for the FCC-ee RF system as well as a simplified SWELL version of a single cell 1.3 GHz elliptical cavity and a new 6 GHz split resonator made of two halves for superconducting thin film characterization.,Acknowledgement of U.

The past two decades have seen the commissioning of numerous XFEL facilities; which quickly surpassed Synchrotron light sources to become the most brilliant X-ray sources. Such facilities have; so far; heavily relied on room temperature S-band RF photoguns to produce the high brightness electron bunches required for lasing; however such photoguns are reaching their peak performance limit and new methods must be investigated to continue to increase the brightness of these facilities. This talk will begin with a review of the design and performance of several electron guns currently operational in XFELs. Following will be a discussion of current efforts in continuing to increase this peak brightness including moving to cold cathode schemes and the use of very high gradients on the cathode. Finally we will describe ongoing activities at PSI to develop the next generation of high gradient RF photoguns for increased peak brightness.,,please see instructions how to view/control embeded videos Slides TU1PA01 [1.781 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/tu1pa01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/tu1pa01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/tu1pa01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-TU1PA01,324

The intense neutron source is produced by impinging deuterons; from high-power linear deuteron accelerator; on a liquid lithium curtain. The facility has accomplished the preliminary design phase and is currently in its detailed design phase. At the present stage; it is important to have a clear understanding of how the commissioning of the facility will be performed; especially the commissioning of a 5 MW CW deuteron beam; together with the lithium curtain and the beam optimization for the neutron irradiation.

The architecture combines the power of N-many RF power transistors into a single resonant cavity that are surface-mounted and -cooled. The system is designed so that failure of individual transistors has negligible performance impact. Due to the electrical and mechanical simplicity; maintenance and logistics are simplified. DTI demonstrated the basic feasibility of a 50-100 kW class amplifier resonant cavity combiner system at 650 MHz. A single-cavity system reached 15 kW at 66% power-added efficiency with ten of 12 slots filled on only 1 of 2 cavities faces. The system further demonstrated the expected graceful degradation; an intermittent fault occurred on 1 of the 10 modules and the only observable effect was a reduction in output power to 13.3 kW with a slight reduction in efficiency.

Also; a complete RF test stand is being implemented to perform the high-power conditioning in traveling and standing wave mode; to verify the power handling capa-bility of the coupler and its thermal behaviour. The RF test stand; based on EPICS environment; can provide up to 2 MW peak power at 352.2 MHz in a pulse operation of 14 Hz and a duty cycle of 4.9%.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/tupopa03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/tupopa03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/tupopa03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-TUPOPA03,410

After successful commissioning in 2013; superficial vane damage has been observed in 2020. In view that the RFQ is a single point of failure; in parallel to the production of a near identical spare (RFQ2); design studies on a longer-term upgrade have been launched: Linac4-RFQ3. Main goals are to achieve a design with higher beam acceptance; reduced beam losses; and reduced RF breakdown rate. Two versions of RFQ are under study: a conventional RFQ built by brazing copper; as well as an RFQ with titanium vane tips (brazed on copper). High-gradient experiments suggest that titanium vane tips support higher surface fields compared to copper; up to 40 MV/m; and are more resistant against beam irradiation.

The reason for the problem was unknown at that time. Initially; the MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) was 104 days; which was so rare that other problems with the RF system clearly dominated and were addressed first. Over the next 2 years; the error became more frequent and occurred on average every 18 days. After the winter shutdown of the XFEL in 2020; the problem became absolutely dominant; with an MTBF of 2 days. Therefore; the fault was investigated with top priority and was finally identified. Two units of the control electronics communicate via USB 2.0 with the main server. Using special measurement technology; it was possible to prove that weak signal levels in the USB signal led to bit errors and thus to the crash of the control electronics. This article describes the troubleshooting process; how to measure the signal quality of USB signals and how the problem was solved in the end.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/tupopa17_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/tupopa17.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/tupopa17_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-TUPOPA17,451

Increasing the amount of harmonic current produced in the klystron requires increasing the velocity bunching in the input cavity. Additional cavities may be used to improve the bunching; however they do so at additional cost and space requirements for the klystron. Moreover; at higher currents space charge counteracts this velocity bunching reducing the amount of harmonic current that can be produced. Our concept resolves these challenges by employing a new type of high-efficiency; multi-beam klystron. Our design consists of a single two-frequency input cavity; a wiggler; and an output cavity. The two-frequency input cavity approximates a linear function in time thereby increasing the harmonic content of the beam; while the wiggler provides strong longitudinal focusing to mitigate the effects of space charge. In this paper we provide the theoretical foundation for our design and present initial numerical calculations showing improved bunching from the harmonic mode and the wiggler.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/tupopa27_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/tupopa27.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/tupopa27_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-TUPOPA27,466

With the ambitious goal of eventually achieving at least 95% availability; several upgrade and improvement projects are ongoing. One such project is the modification of the coaxial couplers that transfer radio frequency (RF) power to the accelerator’s Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). The proposed modification utilizes stub sections and capacitive coupling to construct a physically separable assembly with DC isolation. With a separated coupler assembly; the section that includes the magnetic coupling loop can be permanently mounted to the RFQ which would eliminate the need to re-adjust the couplers after maintenance activities; upgrades; and repairs. Additionally; the modified design would provide increased multipaction suppression with DC biasing and potentially lower thermal gradients across the device.

These modules must be safely transported from DL to FNAL in the USA. Previous experience with cryomodule transport was leveraged at both labs to design a transport system to protect the cryomodules during transit. Requirements for the system included mitigation of shocks; drops; and vibrations; and acting as a lifting fixture. It is comprised of a tessellated steel frame which encompasses the module with a wire rope isolator arrangement which the module mounts to. The frame was designed to withstand the weight of the 12.5 tonne cryomodule in various load cases. Details of shock and vibration profiles were obtained from MIL-STD-810H and were used to guide the sizing of the isolators. The frame and the isolation system were analysed via FEA using the shock and vibration profiles as an input. The transport system was found to be suitable for the given isolation; frame stiffness; and lifting code requirements. The frame has been fabricated and successfully load tested at FNAL. It will now be road tested with a dummy cryomodule before undergoing a trial run to DL.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/tupoge08_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/tupoge08.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/tupoge08_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-TUPOGE08,498

However; when high-intensity beams are injected in such high-gradient structures (>35 MV/m); the beam loading effect must be considered by design since this beam-cavity interaction can result in a considerable gradient reduction with respect to the unloaded case. Studying energy conservation; a partial differential equation (PDE) has been derived for injected beams; in both the relativistic and ultrarelativistic limit. Making use of this; a specific simulation package within RF-track has been developed; allowing realistic tracking of charged particle bunches under this effect regardless of their initial velocity. The performance of such tool has been assessed by reproducing previously obtained beam loaded fields in CLIC main linac and CLIC Drive-Beam linac structures.

In this paper; we present a new simple start-to-end optimisation strategy that is developed for the CompactLight accelerator beamline; focusing on the hard X-ray mode. The optimisation is divided into two steps. The first step improves the electron beam quality that finally leads to a better FEL performance by optimising the major parameters of the beamline. The second step provides matched twiss parameters for the FEL undulator by tuning the matching quadrupoles at the end of the accelerator beamline. A single objective optimisation method; with different objective functions; is used to optimise the performance.

FEBE will allow the use of high charge (up to 250 pC); moderate energy (up to 250 MeV); electron bunches for a wide variety of accelerator applications critical to ongoing accelerator development in the UK and international communities. The facility consists of a shielded enclo-sure; accessible during beam running in CLARA; with two very large experimental chambers compatible with a wide range of experimental proposals.

The machine’s uptime was increased in 2012 by the replacement of the Cockcroft Walton accelerator with an RFQ system to take the beam from 35 keV to 750 keV; however; this came with a reduction in transmitted beam between the source and the entrance to Tank 1 of the LINAC. Fermilab currently operates with less than 50% of the beam current from the ion source making it to the entrance of tank 1. In an effort to understand the causes of this reduction in transmission efficiency a vertically movable paddle was installed between the first two solenoids allowing the beam size to be investigated before entering the RFQ. Comparing this data to the emittance measurements done after the first solenoid in the Ion Source R&D lab a more complete picture of the beams propagation through the LEBT has begun to be established when compared with the simulation results.

Based on cheap industrial standard Neodym permanent magnets; design studies for Solenoids and Quadrupoles are presented. The Solenoid design consists of three segments; where the outer segments possess a radial magnetization and the inner segments an axial magnetization. This increases the mean field strength in comparison to a singlet hollow cylinder solenoid. The quadrupole design consists of 16 block magnets and is designed to be rather simplistic. The casing consists of two half shells; which can be easily mounted around a beam pipe. For a quadrupole triplet configuration the influence of different geometric parameters on beam transport regarding focusing strength and emittance growth is investigated. Furthermore; a variation of the quadrupole design was mounted in vacuum in a triplet configuration. Using custom 3D-printed mounts for small raspberry pi cameras the beam could be observed inside the quadrupoles.

Compared with other wakefield acceleration schemes; our scheme is straightforward since it requires only a gas cell and a source of nanoparticles for electron injection. No external guiding or heating mechanisms are employed. The nanoparticle-assisted laser wakefield acceleration can control all the electron beam parameters: charge; energy spread; energy; emittance; and the number of bunches in the beam. Bunch charges are on the order of a few nanocoulomb for the whole beam and in the 100pC range in the high energy part; an order of magnitude increase over previous results at >5 GeV. We demonstrate shots with percent-level narrow energy spread at multi-GeV energies as well as varying numbers of electron bunches.

In particular; the muon beam normalized transverse emittance is a relevant figure of merit to meet luminosity requests. A typical issue impacting the achieved transverse emittance in muon collider schemes so far considered is the phase space dilution caused by Coulomb interaction of primary particles propagating into the target where muons are generated. In this study we present a new scheme for muon beam generation occurring in vacuum by interactions of electron and photon beams.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,please see instructions how to view/control embeded videos Slides WE1AA06 [3.975 MB] reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/we1aa06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/we1aa06.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/we1aa06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-WE1AA06,

In regions of the world with significant leather production this can lead to a significant environmental impact. However recent studies have suggested that leather can instead be tanned using a combination of electron beams in a process inspired by the industrial crosslinking of polymers; to drastically reduce the quantity of wastewater produced in the process; thereby resulting in a reduced environmental impact as well as potential cost savings on wastewater treatment. In this talk; initial studies of leather tanning will be presented as well as accelerator designs for use in leather irradiation.,"Funding: STFC through the grant reference ST/S002189/1, and the Cockcroft Institute core grant, STFC grant reference ST/P002056/1.",please see instructions how to view/control embeded videos Slides WE2AA02 [1.803 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/we2aa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/we2aa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/we2aa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-WE2AA02,645

However; Ac-225-radiopharmaceutical development has been prevented by insufficient supplies of Ac-225. An electron linac based Ra-225/Ac-225 production system has many advantages: the size of the system is relatively small; a high beam current is easily achieved and the cross section of the Ra-225 production reaction; Ra-225(gamma; n)Ra-225; is relatively high. Moreover; the production amounts of impurity nuclides are very small. These advantages can lead to a cost-effective system. With the final goal of implementing such a system; we have been evaluating the Ra-225/Ac-225 production amount in a real-scale system. To provide more cost-effectiveness; we have been considering production of other medical nuclides using the same system. Cu-67 is recently being studied as nuclides for treatment agents. Mo-99 is a parent nuclide of Tc-99m and commonly used in nuclear medicine. We also have carried out the evaluation of Cu-67 and Mo-99/Tc-99m production amounts.

linac2022,,TH1AA01,Nitrogen Gas-Jet Curtain for Windowless Helium Gas Cell Equipped With Differential Pumping Systems,"RIKEN Nishina Center; Wako; Japan; Windowless helium gas cells are used for heavy ion beam charge strippers; high intensity beam targets; and GARIS (GAs-filled Recoil Ion Separator) for nuclear physics experiments. They are usually accompanied by a differential pumping system; but due to the high diffusion rate of helium gas; helium gas diffuses into the region where a high vacuum is required; and as a result; it is difficult to increase the helium gas pressure. To solve this problem; we invented the ""nitrogen gas curtain"". This not only prevents helium gas from leaking out to the high vacuum side; but also allows nitrogen to leak out instead of helium; making it easier to increase the vacuum level. This system has been incorporated into the gas stripper and the GARIS-3 apparatus at the RIKEN RIBF and continues to operate stably.

FEL operation requires stringent requirements for the beam stability at the linac output; such as the electron bunch arrival time; peak current and beam energy. Among other things; a highly stable RF system is required to guarantee the beam stability. RF performance often dominates the overall performance and availability of FELs; and for this reason the SwissFEL RF system has been designed based on the state-of-the-art technologies that have enabled excellent RF stability; resulting in an arrival time jitter of ~10 fs rms and relative beam energy stability of 10-4 rms.

Commissioning results of the injector part of the ARES linac delivered promising beam quality results to achieve these numbers. The bunch compressor system is foreseen to be used to bench mark numerical models for coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and space charge (SC) for ultra-short electron bunches.

Compared to the Gun4 series; Gun5 aims for a 50% increase of the duration of the RF pulse (up to 1 ms at 10 Hz repetition rate) combined with high gradients (up to ~60 MV/m at the cathode). In addition to the improved impedance; the new cavity is equipped with an RF probe to measure and control the amplitude and phase of the RF field inside the gun. The first prototype of the new RF gun was manufactured at DESY and installed at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) in October 2021. In mid-October 2021 the RF conditioning began; aiming for achieving the aforementioned RF parameters. The conditioning procedure involves a slow gradual increase in repetition rate; RF pulse duration and peak power while carefully monitoring vacuum conditions and signals from interlock sensors. The results of RF conditioning will be reported.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpojo03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpojo03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpojo03_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPOJO03,699

The performance enhancement has been based on the use of optimization and control routines of the beam parameters; but also by the application of regular preventive hardware maintenance procedures. Besides; the Linac reliability has been improved also by the implementation of alternative working modes in case of hardware failures; like operating at 67 MeV; with only one klystron and one accelerating section. In this respect; a new upgrade of the RF waveguide system is being implemented; with the aim to produce 80 MeV electron beam using only one klystron that will feed both accelerating sections. Furthermore; the possibility to install a thermionic RF-gun to inject directly into the first accelerating section is under study; ensuring the Linac’s reliability even in case of a major event. Details of the Linac performance during the past years and a description of the new hardware upgrades are presented in this work.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpojo07_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpojo07.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpojo07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPOJO07,703

Currently this linac is being designed with 3 m long traveling wave structures; which provide a gradient of 16 MV/m. We propose the use of a 1 m distributed coupling design as a potential alternative and future upgrade path to this design. Distributed coupling allows power to be fed into each cavity directly via a waveguide manifold; avoiding on-axis coupling**. A distributed coupling structure at S-band was designed to optimize for shunt impedance and large aperture size. This design provides greater efficiency; thereby lowering the number of klystrons required to power the full linac. In addition; particle tracking analysis shows that this linac maintains lower emittance as bunch charge increases to 14 nC and wakefields become more prevalent. We present the design of this distributed coupling structure; as well as progress on structure manufacturing and characterization.; * F.

This linac will employ a patented travelling wave accelerating structure with outside power flow which combines the advantages of high efficiency with energy tunability of traveling wave cavities. Unlike standing wave structures; the proposed structure has little power reflected back to the RF source; eliminating the need for a heavy; lossy waveguide isolator. In contrast to the side-coupled cavity designs; the proposed structure is symmetrical and therefore it does not have deflecting axial fields that impair the beam transport. The high shunt impedance will allow the linac to achieve an output energy of up to 10 MeV when powered by a compact commercial 9.3 GHz 1.7 MW magnetron. For pulse-to-pulse tuning of the beam output energy we will change of the beam-loaded gradient by varying the triode gun current.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpojo16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpojo16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpojo16_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPOJO16,727

This sets particular requirements on the kind of injectors that they can use as the injectors must be capable of producing bunches at MHz repetition rates; compressing the bunches to the specified value and transporting those bunches while they are still in the space charge dominated regime into the main ERL all while keeping the emittance low. In particular; PERLE will require a 20 mA beam consisting of 500 pC bunches with a repetition rate of 40 MHz. These bunches will be required to have rms lengths of 3mm; a total beam energy of 7 MeV; appropriate Twiss parameters to match them to the main loop and transverse emittances of < 6 mm mrad.

Azimuthal angular distribution of the bremsstrahlung photons from 28-GHz ECRIS were measured at Busan Center of KBSI. Gamma-ray detection system consists of three round type NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors positioned 62 cm radially from the beam axis and another detector placed at the extraction port for monitoring photon intensity along the beam axis. Bremsstrahlung photons energy spectra were measured at six azimuthal angles at RF power of 1 kW.

Currently; the facility treats 40 patients per day and is improving its systems and workflows to further increase this number. Although MedAustron is a young and modern center; the life-cycle of certain crucial control electronics is near end-of-life and needs to be addressed. This paper presents the 216MHz injector Low-Level Radio Frequency (iLLRF) system with option of use for the synchrotron Low-Level Radio Frequency (sLLRF - 0.4-10MHz). The developed system will unify the cavity regulation for both LLRFs and will also be used for beam diagnostics (injector/synchrotron) and RF knock-out slow extraction. The new LLRF system is based on a µTCA platform which is controlled by the MedAustron Control System based on NI-PXIe. Currently; it supports fiberoptics links (SFP+); but other links (e.g. EPICS; DOOCS) can be established. The modular implementation of this LLRF allows connections to other components; such as motors; amplifiers; or interlock systems; and will increase the robustness and maintainability of the accelerator.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpopa12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpopa12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpopa12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPOPA12,764

A higher Q means that a higher RF field can be sustained; and a higher acceleration can be produced in the cavity for length unity. However; in certain situations; e.g.; too high RF field; the SRF cavities can experience quenches that risk creating damage due to the rapid increase in the heat load. This is especially negative in continuous wave (CW) operation due to the impossibility of the system to recover during the off-load period. The design goal of a quench-detection system is to protect the system without being a limiting factor during the operation. In this paper; we compare two different classification approaches for improving a quench detection system. We perform tests using traces recorded from LCLS-II and show that the ARSENAL classifier outperforms a CNN classifier in terms of accuracy.,Funding: This work is supported by DASHH (Data Science in Hamburg - HELMHOLTZ Graduate School for the Structure of Matter) under Grant No.: HIDSS-0002.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpopa15_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpopa15.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpopa15_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPOPA15,775

The frequency error of the superconducting cavities must be smaller than a few of Hz to operate in beam acceleration mode. To minimize the freuqency error as much as possible; the error is calculated in the low-level RF(LLRF); and the proposed tuner control system changes the superconducting cavity frequency by using a mechanical tuner and a motor attached to the cavity directly. This control system deals with not only the initial frequency error of the cavity but also the frequency drift of the cavity induced by external disturbance such as the slow fluctuation helium pressure automatically. In addition; an automatic proportional gain calibration technique is also proposed. In this paper; the detailed operation and techniques will be described.,Funding: This research was supported by the RISP of ibs funded by the Ministry of Science and the National Research Foundation (NRF) of the Republic of Korea under Contract 2013M7A1A1075764.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpopa18_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpopa18.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpopa18_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPOPA18,778

The jacketed cavities are supplied with liquid helium from a header tank at the top of the configuration. A few cavities have been tested in different positions and the results have been analysed. The pressure of the helium inside the jacketed cavities is affected by the height of the liquid helium column above the jacket and using results from earlier analysis during cool-down enables the pressure of the cavity to be determined from the frequency of operation. Analysis of the effects may allow for corrections to the frequency to be made. In addition to the above observations there have also been some challenges in the operation at higher power as the phase of the self-excited loop driving the system; has been seen to change.

This weld can lead to large increases in surface resistance and limit the performance of thin film coated cavities. Many problems with the coating process for thin film Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities are also due to this weld. Thin film SRF cavities can perform as well as bulk niobium cavities if the cavity is manufactured seamlessly; without any weld; as they have a more uniform surface; however; they are much more difficult and expensive to manufacture. A cavity with a split longitudinally; parallel to the direction of the electric field; would not need to be welded. These seamless cavities are easier to manufacture and coat. This opens the possibilities to coat with new materials and multilayer coatings. These cavities may allow SRF cavities to operate at significantly better parameters (higher quality factor and maximum accelerating field) than current state of the art cavities.

The copper back wall of the cavity also served as the gun photocathode. In order to reduce significant time required for replacement and/or reactivation of the photocathode and improve the flexibility of the injector the gun has been upgraded for operation with DESY/INFN style interchangeable photocathodes. This upgrade included a new design of the cavity back wall to accommodate the photocathode socket and equipping the gun with a load-lock system. Modification of the gun also required replacement of the bucking coil; which zeros field in the photocathode emission plane. After the upgrade; the gun was commissioned and then operated with a hybrid Cu/Mo photocathode during the last two years. During winter-spring 2022 experimental run the gun steadily operated with a cathode field of 60 MV/m; limited by the RF power available and with an off-centre diamond turned photocathode which delivered stable bunches with a charge of 100 pC.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpori15_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpori15.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpori15_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPORI15,854

Structures must be subjected to a conditioning process before operational use; in which the gradient is gradually increased up to the operating value. A limiting effect during this process is breakdown or vacuum arcing; which can cause damage that limits the ultimate operating gradient. Techniques to efficiently condition the cavities while minimising the number of breakdowns are therefore important. In this paper; machine learning techniques are applied to detect breakdown events in RF pulse traces by approaching the problem as anomaly detection; using a variational autoencoder. This process detects deviations from normal operation and classifies them with near perfect accuracy. Offline data from various sources has been used to develop the techniques; which we aim to test at the CLARA facility at Daresbury Laboratory. Deployment of the machine learning system on the high repetition rate gun upgrade at CLARA has begun.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/talks/thpori16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/papers/thpori16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2022/posters/thpori16_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2022-THPORI16,858

The facility has been put into commissioning since 2018. The RFQ has successfully accelerated the beams with M/q within 2~7 in the CW regime. High transmission efficiencies (typically higher than 97%) were relatively easy to achieve for beam currents of ~0.1 emA level. Experimental research such as C-C burning investigation in nuclear astrophysics needs intense heavy ion beam of a broad beam energy variation while maintaining very low energy spread. A setup of ion beam energy modulation system has been developed; which is mainly composed of a drift tube linac (DTL) for beam energy tuning and two quarter wave resonator (QWR) re-bunchers placed at upstream and downstream of the DTL respectively for beam quality control and longitudinal matching. More than 0.05 pmA carbon beam with an energy spread of <0.3% (FWHM) has been delivered to the experimental terminal.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; IHEP CSNS; Guangdong Province; People’s Republic of China; This paper presents the physics design of the superconducting linac for CSNS-II project which starts in this year.
