        "During commissioning and operation run in 2021-2022 the photoinjector of the CLARA-VELA facility a 2.5 cell cavity S-band photocathode gun originally developed for the APEX experiment was used. The copper back wall of the cavity also served as the gun photocathode. In order to reduce significant time required for replacement and/or reactivation of the photocathode and improve the flexibility of the injector the gun has been upgraded for operation with DESY/INFN style interchangeable photocathodes. This upgrade included a new design of the cavity back wall to accommodate the photocathode socket and equipping the gun with a load-lock system. Modification of the gun also required replacement of the bucking coil",
        "which zeros field in the photocathode emission plane. After the upgrade",
        "the gun was commissioned and then operated with a hybrid Cu/Mo photocathode during the last two years. During winter-spring 2022 experimental run the gun steadily operated with a cathode field of 60 MV/m",
        "limited by the RF power available and with an off-centre diamond turned photocathode which delivered stable bunches with a charge of 100 pC."

        "Maximising the accelerating gradient of RF structures is fundamental to improving accelerator facility performance and cost-effectiveness. Structures must be subjected to a conditioning process before operational use",
        "in which the gradient is gradually increased up to the operating value. A limiting effect during this process is breakdown or vacuum arcing",
        "which can cause damage that limits the ultimate operating gradient. Techniques to efficiently condition the cavities while minimising the number of breakdowns are therefore important. In this paper",
        "machine learning techniques are applied to detect breakdown events in RF pulse traces by approaching the problem as anomaly detection",
        "using a variational autoencoder. This process detects deviations from normal operation and classifies them with near perfect accuracy. Offline data from various sources has been used to develop the techniques",
        "which we aim to test at the CLARA facility at Daresbury Laboratory. Deployment of the machine learning system on the high repetition rate gun upgrade at CLARA has begun."
