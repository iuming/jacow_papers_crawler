        "Heavy ion linac requires ion source to deliver high-intensity and highly-charged heavy ion beams in order to achieve higher beam intensity and better cost-effective performance. The 3rd generation highly-charged ECR ion sources with microwave frequency 24-28 GHz and NbTi superconducting magnet have been operating in a few laboratories worldwide",
        "which are able to provide heavy ion beams such as 129Xe30+ of 300 euA",
        "238U33+ of 400 euA. To further improve beam intensity for higher charge state heavy ion beams",
        "a 4th generation ECR ion source named as FECR (the First fourth generation ECR ion source) with frequency 45 GHz and Nb3Sn superconducting magnet is being developed at IMP. The FECR Nb3Sn magnet is being assembled and it is expected the first beam commissioning results could be presented. Recent research and development on the 3rd and 4th generation ECR ion sources for heavy ions will be reviewed",
        "and future directions will be discussed in this talk.",

        "an order of magnitude increase over previous results at >5 GeV. We demonstrate shots with percent-level narrow energy spread at multi-GeV energies as well as varying numbers of electron bunches. This new method therefore shows great potential to support the further development of laser-plasma-based electron acceleration.",
