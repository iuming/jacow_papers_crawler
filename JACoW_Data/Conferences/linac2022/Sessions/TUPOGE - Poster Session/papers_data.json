        "A quarter-wave resonator (QWR) cryomodule was designed and assembled at TRIUMF for the energy upgrade of the VECC ISOL-RIB facility to boost radioactive isotopes from 1MeV/u to 2MeV/u. The top loading cryomodule was chosen based on the ISAC-II low energy section design",
        "consisting of four superconducting QWRs and one superconducting solenoid. The major change from ISAC-II concept is separating the RF space vacuum from the isolation vacuum. The cryogenic commissioning was recently completed. The cold mass alignments and the cryogenic heat loads were measured. The cavity performance was qualified in both test regime and operating regime. The cavity degradations caused by magnetic pollution from solenoid and the recovery procedure were verified. This paper will report the detailed results of the commissioning."

Details of shock and vibration profiles were obtained from MIL-STD-810H and were used to guide the sizing of the isolators. The frame and the isolation system were analysed via FEA using the shock and vibration profiles as an input. The transport system was found to be suitable for the given isolation",

These were incorporated into the design of the pre-production Single Spoke Resonator Type 2 cryomodule (ppSSR2 CM) and the pre-production Low Beta 650 MHz cryomodule (ppLB650 CM). This paper presents the pHB650 CM lessons learned and experiences gathered from the design to the lower coldmass assembly and how this cryomodule has a positive impact on all the next Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) cryomodules due to the standardization set up among SSR and 650 cryomodules."
