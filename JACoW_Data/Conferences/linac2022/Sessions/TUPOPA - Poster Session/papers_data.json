        "ESS Bilbao is manufacturing a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) aimed at accelerating up to 3 MeV the protons generated in the ion source. The progress made and the difficulties encountered with the RFQ are discussed in this paper. A power coupler proto-type for the RFQ has been developed while several me-chanical constraints were also studied in the final cou-pler. This prototype operates at a lower power",
        "then it can work using PEEK window for the vacuum interface and it does not require neither brazing nor cooling system. Also",
        "a complete RF test stand is being implemented to perform the high-power conditioning in traveling and standing wave mode",
        "to verify the power handling capa-bility of the coupler and its thermal behaviour. The RF test stand",
        "based on EPICS environment",
        "can provide up to 2 MW peak power at 352.2 MHz in a pulse operation of 14 Hz and a duty cycle of 4.9%."

        "the coupler is redesigned at HIM in order to not only reduce the heat input but to provide an overall improved power coupler for the HELIAC. It is designed for maximal power of 5 kW cw at the frequency of 216.816 MHz. A prototype has been tested and commissioned recently. This includes several RF-tests at room temperature and in cryogenic environments. The results of these tests will be presented in this paper."

        "Traditional klystron efficiencies are limited by the output electron beam harmonic current and energy spread. Increasing the amount of harmonic current produced in the klystron requires increasing the velocity bunching in the input cavity. Additional cavities may be used to improve the bunching",
        "however they do so at additional cost and space requirements for the klystron. Moreover",
        "at higher currents space charge counteracts this velocity bunching reducing the amount of harmonic current that can be produced. Our concept resolves these challenges by employing a new type of high-efficiency",
