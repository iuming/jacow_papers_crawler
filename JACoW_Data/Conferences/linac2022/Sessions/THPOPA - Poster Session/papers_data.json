        "The aim of present study is to determine end-point energies of the bremsstrahlung photons energy spectra emitted from 28-GHz ECRIS by using inverse-matrix unfold method. Azimuthal angular distribution of the bremsstrahlung photons from 28-GHz ECRIS were measured at Busan Center of KBSI. Gamma-ray detection system consists of three round type NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors positioned 62 cm radially from the beam axis and another detector placed at the extraction port for monitoring photon intensity along the beam axis. Bremsstrahlung photons energy spectra were measured at six azimuthal angles at RF power of 1 kW. Monte Carlo simulation based on Geant4 package was performed to take the geometrical acceptance and energy-dependent detection efficiency into account due to large non-uniformity in the material budget. We extracted true bremsstrahlung energy spectra using the inverse-matrix unfolding method. The end-point energies of the bremsstrahlung photons after application of deconvolution method were found to be 1.320±0.050 MeV",

      "abstract": "Low Level RF systems have historically fallen into two categories. Custom systems developed at national laboratories or industrial systems using custom hardware specifically designed for LLRF. Recently however advances in RF technology accompanied by demand from applications like quantum computing have led to commercially available systems that are viable for building a modular low-level RF system. Here we present an overview of a Keysight based digital LLRF system. Our system employs analog upconversion and downconversion with an intermediate frequency of 100MHz. We discuss our phase-reference system and provide initial results on the system performance. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
