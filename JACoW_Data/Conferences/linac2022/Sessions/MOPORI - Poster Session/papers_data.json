        "The gas jet beam profile monitor is a non-invasive beam monitor that is currently being commissioned at the Cockcroft Institute. It utilises a supersonic gas curtain which traverses the beam perpendicular to its propagation and measures beam-induced ionisation interactions of the gas. A 2D transverse beam profile image is created by orientating the gas jet 45 degrees to obtain both X and Y distributions of the beam. This paper builds upon previously used single-slit skimmers and improves their ability to form the gas jet into a desired distribution for imaging beam halo. A skimmer device removes off-momentum gas particles and forms the jet into a dense thin curtain",
        "suitable for transverse imaging of the beam. The use of a novel double-slit skimmer is shown to provide a mask-like void of gas over the beam core",

        "beam halo behaviour is a key characteristic associated with beam losses within linacs."

The main challenges in fabrication were machining the complex cavity parts with high precision",
