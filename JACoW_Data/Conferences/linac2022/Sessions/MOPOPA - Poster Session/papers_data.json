        "The European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) is to-date the largest X-ray research facility around the world which spans over 3.4 km. EuXFEL is currently being operated in a pulsed mode with a repetition rate of 10Hz. One upgrade scenario consists of operating the EuXFEL also in a Continuous-Wave (CW) mode of operation to improve the quality of experiments. This upgrade brings new challenges and requires new algorithms to deal with controlling a stable accelerating field inside the Superconducting Radiofrequency (SRF) accelerating cavities and keeping them on resonance in this new mode of operation. The purpose of this research work is to identify the mechanical dynamics of the cavities which will facilitate the development of the resonance controller for the CW upgrade. To this extent",
        "experiments were conducted at a test bench. For the first time",
        "in this work",
        "two different types of spectrally rich excitation signals: multi-sine and stepped-sine are used to excite the mechanical dynamics of the cavities using the piezo actuator. After the analysis of experimental data",
        "mechanical modes are successfully identified and will be used to design the controller."

A promising concept to provide the THz pulses with satisfactory properties for the experiments is to generate them using a linear accelerator-based free-electron laser (FEL). A simulation study of a THz FEL facility capable of generating powerful tunable coherent THz radiation that covers the wavelength range of 25 ’m to 100 ’m was performed. An accelerator beamline layout based on the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) and an APPLE-II undulator with a period length of 40 mm were used in the simulation study. Results of the study are presented and discussed in this paper."
