        "The TRIUMF Ion Source and Injection System (ISIS) beamline is used to transport the 300 keV H− beam from the ion source to the injection into the 500 MeV cyclotron. The vertical section of the beamline",
        "upgraded in 2011",
        "is very robust and reliable",
        "while the horizontal section",
        "now 50 years old",
        "is very demanding in maintenance",
        "and presents a high risk of downtime due to aging. The horizontal beamline is being re-designed with well proven optical concepts",
        "and modern UHV technologies already used in the vertical section",
        "and in the ARIEL RIB transport system; this will produce a more efficient system",
        "easier to maintain and tune. The beamline will use electrostatic optical modules like matching",
        "periodic",
        "and 90-degree achromatic bend sections; updated elements include bunchers",
        "a high-energy pulser",
        "a 5:1 selector",
        "and a new set of diagnostics. A crucial aspect of the new beamline is a magnetic shield",
        "to compensate the cyclotron stray field",
        "comprised of a mu-metal in-vacuum liner allowing HV feedthroughs and diagnostics insertion without breaking the shield continuity. The new injection beamline will be controlled via EPICS. The paper will present the status of the project."

        "this came with a reduction in transmitted beam between the source and the entrance to Tank 1 of the LINAC. Fermilab currently operates with less than 50% of the beam current from the ion source making it to the entrance of tank 1. In an effort to understand the causes of this reduction in transmission efficiency a vertically movable paddle was installed between the first two solenoids allowing the beam size to be investigated before entering the RFQ. Comparing this data to the emittance measurements done after the first solenoid in the Ion Source R&D lab a more complete picture of the beams propagation through the LEBT has begun to be established when compared with the simulation results. We will present these results here."
