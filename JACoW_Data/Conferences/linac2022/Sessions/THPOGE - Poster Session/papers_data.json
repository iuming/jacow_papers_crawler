      "abstract": "CEA is committed to delivering a Medium Energy Beam Transfer line and a superconducting linac (SCL) for SARAF accelerator in order to accelerate 5 mA beam of either protons from 1.3 MeV to 35 MeV or deuterons from 2.6 MeV to 40 MeV. The SCL contains 13 half-wave resonator (HWR) low beta cavities (β= 0.09) at 176 MHz and 14 HWR high-beta cavities (β = 0.18) at 176 MHz. The low-beta and high-beta series were qualified in 2021 and 2022 respectively. This contribution will focus on the observation of the multipactor barriers for all cavi-ties. It will present series of data obtained during the conditioning of these cavities reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "The vertical test stand in use at Daresbury has three cavities loaded horizontally at different heights. The jacketed cavities are supplied with liquid helium from a header tank at the top of the configuration. A few cavities have been tested in different positions and the results have been analysed. The pressure of the helium inside the jacketed cavities is affected by the height of the liquid helium column above the jacket and using results from earlier analysis during cool-down enables the pressure of the cavity to be determined from the frequency of operation. Analysis of the effects may allow for corrections to the frequency to be made. In addition to the above observations there have also been some challenges in the operation at higher power as the phase of the self-excited loop driving the system",

        "Many current accelerators use cavities that are manufactured as two half cells that are electron beam welded together",
        "the weld is across the peak surface current of the cavity. This weld can lead to large increases in surface resistance and limit the performance of thin film coated cavities. Many problems with the coating process for thin film Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities are also due to this weld. Thin film SRF cavities can perform as well as bulk niobium cavities if the cavity is manufactured seamlessly",
        "without any weld",
        "as they have a more uniform surface",

        "they are much more difficult and expensive to manufacture. A cavity with a split longitudinally",
        "parallel to the direction of the electric field",
        "would not need to be welded. These seamless cavities are easier to manufacture and coat. This opens the possibilities to coat with new materials and multilayer coatings. These cavities may allow SRF cavities to operate at significantly better parameters (higher quality factor and maximum accelerating field) than current state of the art cavities. This work discusses development and testing of longitudinally split seamless cavities at Daresbury Laboratory."

        "fine grain niobium (Nb) (grain size ~ 50 um) and large grain Nb (grain size of a few cm) are being used for the fabrication of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Medium grain forged ingot with grain size of a few hundred um may be beneficial for cost-effectiveness as well as providing better performance for future SRF-based accelerators. Forged ingot Nb with medium grain size is a novel production method to obtain Nb discs used for the fabrication of superconducting radio frequency cavities. We have fabricated two 1.5 GHz single cell cavities made from forged Nb ingot with a residual resistivity ratio of ~100. The cavities were chemically and mechanically polished and heat-treated in the temperature range of 650-1000 C before the rf test. One of the cavities reached an accelerating gradient of 34 MV/m with a quality factor Q > 1e10",
        "while the second cavity was limited at 14 MV/m",
        "likely due to a weld defect at the equator."
