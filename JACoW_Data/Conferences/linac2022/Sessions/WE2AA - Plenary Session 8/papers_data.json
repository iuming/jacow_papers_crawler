In regions of the world with significant leather production this can lead to a significant environmental impact. However recent studies have suggested that leather can instead be tanned using a combination of electron beams in a process inspired by the industrial crosslinking of polymers",

Mo-99 is a parent nuclide of Tc-99m and commonly used in nuclear medicine. We also have carried out the evaluation of Cu-67 and Mo-99/Tc-99m production amounts.
