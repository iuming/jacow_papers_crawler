Its main goal will be to characterize and to qualify materials under irradiation in a neutron field similar to the one faced in a fusion reactor. The intense neutron source is produced by impinging deuterons",

        "together with the lithium curtain and the beam optimization for the neutron irradiation. In this contribution",

        "Multi-harmonic buncher cavities (MHB) are used in ion linacs to increase the bunch separation so the beam can be injected in rings or used in applications like time-of-flight experiments. The ideal saw-tooth electric field profile of the buncher is achieved in practice by adding several components of its Fourier expansion (multi-harmonics). ESS-Bilbao will develop* a MHB intended to be tested in the CERN-ISOLDE facility. The design and prototyping include the buncher device itself as well as the solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) to power it. The buncher design (finite elements and beam dynamics) has been carried out to optimize it for ISOLDE beams and frequencies of 1/10th of the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) frequency. The testing of the cavity at ESS-Bilbao proton beam injector (before the RFQ) has also been studied."

The system is designed so that failure of individual transistors has negligible performance impact. Due to the electrical and mechanical simplicity",

A single-cavity system reached 15 kW at 66% power-added efficiency with ten of 12 slots filled on only 1 of 2 cavities faces. The system further demonstrated the expected graceful degradation; an intermittent fault occurred on 1 of the 10 modules and the only observable effect was a reduction in output power to 13.3 kW with a slight reduction in efficiency. Combining of multiple cavities was also demonstrated at low power."

Research Instruments, located in Germany, built and processed the cavities at the vendor site, including electropolishing as the final active chemistry step. Twenty-eight cavities for seven cryomodules and an additional four cavities for a spare cryomodules were delivered to Jefferson Lab and first qualification tests were completed on all cavities as received from the vendor. The performance largely exceeded the requirements on quality factor and accelerating gradient. Here we present the status of initial cavity qualification tests, rework on unqualified cavities and final cavity qualification with helium vessel prior to installation in cryomodules. In addition, an update on cryomodule production is presented."

The project will install seven superconducting RF cryomodules and supporting RF power systems and ancillaries to increase the beam energy to 1.3 GeV . The injection and extraction region of the accumulator ring will be upgraded, and a new 2 MW mercury target has been developed along with supporting equipment for high-flow gas injection to mitigate cavitation and fatigue stress.
