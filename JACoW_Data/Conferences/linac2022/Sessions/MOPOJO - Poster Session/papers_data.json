        "We are developing an accelerator-based terahertz source that can produce arbitrary polarization states from linearly polarized coherent undulator radiation (CUR). The polarization manipulation of the CUR can be realized using the Martin’Puplett interferometer employed as an optical phase shifter. This study also demonstrates a variable polarization manipulator by using the terahertz CUR (THz-CUR) source based on an extremely short electron bunch at Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH)",
        "Tohoku University. The horizontally polarized CUR with a frequency of 1.9 THz was manipulated into variable polarization state",
        "and Stokes parameters were measured to derive the degree of polarization. Beam experimental results will be presented in this conference."
