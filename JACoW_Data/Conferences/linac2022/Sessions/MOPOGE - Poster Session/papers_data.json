        "Within the EU H2020 project HITRIplus for the development of cancer therapy with heavy ions a linac was designed. It is evolving from the concept of the 4 European cancer therapy centers applying light ions up to carbon. The new linac will in its simpliest version allow C4+ - beam injection into synchrotrons at 5 A MeV",
        "with high beam transmission and allowing currents up to 5 mA alpha - particles. An advanced ECR - ion source will inject into an RFQ - IH-DTL combination. The DTL concept allows upgraded versions for A/q - values up to two and with beam energies of 7.1 A MeV from IH - tank2 and 10 A MeV from IH-tank3. The higher beam injection energies for light ions allow a relaxed synchrotron operation at lowest magnetic field levels. A main argument for the DTL extensions however is an additional linac function as radioisotope facility driver. The 7.1 A MeV are especially defined for the clean production of 211At",
        "which may play a future role in cancer therapy. The linac will allow for high duty factors - up to 10%",
        "to fulfil the needs for efficient radioisotope production. Solid state amplifiers with matched design RF power levels (up to 600 kW for IH3) will be used."

Two round-profiles geometry and some variations of two important parameters of a 750 MHz IH-DTL are proposed in this paper in order to improve shunt impedance performance regarding an existing solution with flat-walled cavity developed by CERN. The proposed designs are shaped such that they guarantee an easy connection of RF and vacuum auxiliaries. Electromagnetic simulations are checked with CST Microwave Studio."
