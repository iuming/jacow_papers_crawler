        "but due to the high diffusion rate of helium gas",
        "helium gas diffuses into the region where a high vacuum is required",
        "and as a result",
        "it is difficult to increase the helium gas pressure. To solve this problem",
        "we invented the \"nitrogen gas curtain\". This not only prevents helium gas from leaking out to the high vacuum side",
        "but also allows nitrogen to leak out instead of helium",
        "making it easier to increase the vacuum level. This system has been incorporated into the gas stripper and the GARIS-3 apparatus at the RIKEN RIBF and continues to operate stably. In this talk",
