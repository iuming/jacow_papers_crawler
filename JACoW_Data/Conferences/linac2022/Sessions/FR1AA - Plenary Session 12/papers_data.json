        "LEAF (Low Energy heavy ion Accelerator Facility) is a low energy high intensity heavy ion accelerator complex for multidiscipline researches that features a high performance superconducting ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) ion source",
        "and a high current heavy ion beam lianc. The facility has been put into commissioning since 2018. The RFQ has successfully accelerated the beams with M/q within 2~7 in the CW regime. High transmission efficiencies (typically higher than 97%) were relatively easy to achieve for beam currents of ~0.1 emA level. Experimental research such as C-C burning investigation in nuclear astrophysics needs intense heavy ion beam of a broad beam energy variation while maintaining very low energy spread. A setup of ion beam energy modulation system has been developed",
        "which is mainly composed of a drift tube linac (DTL) for beam energy tuning and two quarter wave resonator (QWR) re-bunchers placed at upstream and downstream of the DTL respectively for beam quality control and longitudinal matching. More than 0.05 pmA carbon beam with an energy spread of <0.3% (FWHM) has been delivered to the experimental terminal.",
