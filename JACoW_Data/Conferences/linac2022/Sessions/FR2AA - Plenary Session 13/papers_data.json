        "Exponential gain of extreme ultraviolet radiation at 27 nm was observed in a free-electron laser (FEL) driven by the electron beam generated in a laser-driven plasma wake-field accelerator at SIOM (China",
        "Shanghai). This experiment",
        "showing that the quality of the beam generated in the laser plasma accelerator is sufficient to sustain amplification in a FEL",
        "represents a long awaited fundamental milestone. In addition",
        "more recently a first demonstration of FEL exponential gain was also achieved in a beam-driven plasma accelerator at a wavelength of 830 nm at INFN (Frascati",
        "Italy). The performances of these FELs cannot match those available in existing FEL facilities. However",
        "these experiments represent a technological breakthrough and pave the way for FELs driven by extremely compact accelerators.",
