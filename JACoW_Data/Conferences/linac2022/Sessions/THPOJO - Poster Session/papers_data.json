        "high quality electron beams has attracted more and more interest in accelerator science. Electron bunches with these properties are necessary to operate and test novel diagnostics and advanced high gradient accelerating schemes. Furthermore",
        "several medical and industrial applications require high-brightness electron beams. The dedicated R&D linac ARES at DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) is now fully operational and able to produce these electron beams at the nominal energy of 155 MeV and deliver it to users. This paper gives an overview of the ARES linac and summarizes the beam parameter measurements. The possibilities for user operation will be described in detail."

        "We present the first commissioning results of the movable bunch compressor (BC) designed for the ARES linac at DESY. The development and simulated performance has been reported earlier and predicts sub-fs electron bunches with high charge densities. Commissioning results of the injector part of the ARES linac delivered promising beam quality results to achieve these numbers. The bunch compressor system is foreseen to be used to bench mark numerical models for coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and space charge (SC) for ultra-short electron bunches. Here we will present first measurements of the dispersion as well as calculations for the longitudinal dispersion. In the future the PolariX transverse deflecting structure (TDS) will be commissioned to fully characterize the ARES electron beam."

Unlike standing wave structures",

The high shunt impedance will allow the linac to achieve an output energy of up to 10 MeV when powered by a compact commercial 9.3 GHz 1.7 MW magnetron. For pulse-to-pulse tuning of the beam output energy we will change of the beam-loaded gradient by varying the triode gun current."
