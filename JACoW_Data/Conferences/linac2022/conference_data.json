            "New neutron sources are needed both for Canada and internationally as access to reactor based neutrons shrinks. Compact Accelerator-based Neutron Sources (CANS) offer the possibility of an intense source of pulsed neutrons with a capital cost significantly lower than spallation sources. In an effort to close the neutron gap in Canada a prototype",
            "Canadian compact accelerator-based neutron source (PC-CANS) is proposed for installation at the University of Windsor. The PC-CANS is envisaged to serve two neutron science instruments",
            "a boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) station and a beamline for fluorine-18 radioisotope production for positron emission tomography (PET). To serve these diverse applications of neutron beams",
            "a linear accelerator solution is selected",
            "that will provide 10 MeV protons with a peak current of 10 mA within a 5% duty cycle. The accelerator is based on an RFQ and DTL with a post-DTL pulsed kicker system to simultaneously deliver macro-pulses to each end-station. Several choices of Linac technology are being considered and a comparison of the choices will be presented."

            "The PIP-II Injector Test (PIP2IT) facility is a near-complete low energy portion of the Superconducting PIP-II linac driver. PIP2IT comprises the warm front end and the first two PIP-II superconducting cryomodules. PIP2IT is designed to accelerate a 2 mA H− beam to an energy of 20 MeV. The facility serves as a testbed for a number of advanced technologies required to operate PIP-II and provides an opportunity to gain experience with commissioning of the superconducting linac",
            "significantly reducing project technical risks. Some PIP2IT components are contributions from international partners",
            "who also lend their expertise to the accelerator project. The project has been successfully commissioned with the beam in 2021",
            "demonstrating the performance required for the LBNF/DUNE. In this paper",
            "we describe the facility and its critical systems. We discuss our experience with the integrated testing and beam commissioning of PIP2IT",
            "and present commissioning results. This important milestone ushers in a new era at Fermilab of proton beam delivery using superconducting radio-frequency accelerators."

It is evolving from the concept of the 4 European cancer therapy centers applying light ions up to carbon. The new linac will in its simpliest version allow C4+ - beam injection into synchrotrons at 5 A MeV",
            "with high beam transmission and allowing currents up to 5 mA alpha - particles. An advanced ECR - ion source will inject into an RFQ - IH-DTL combination. The DTL concept allows upgraded versions for A/q - values up to two and with beam energies of 7.1 A MeV from IH - tank2 and 10 A MeV from IH-tank3. The higher beam injection energies for light ions allow a relaxed synchrotron operation at lowest magnetic field levels. A main argument for the DTL extensions however is an additional linac function as radioisotope facility driver. The 7.1 A MeV are especially defined for the clean production of 211At",
            "which may play a future role in cancer therapy. The linac will allow for high duty factors - up to 10%",

A 2D transverse beam profile image is created by orientating the gas jet 45 degrees to obtain both X and Y distributions of the beam. This paper builds upon previously used single-slit skimmers and improves their ability to form the gas jet into a desired distribution for imaging beam halo.

A normal conducting double quarter-wave cavity has been designed to deliver a transverse kick of 300 kV when driven by an 800 W solid-state amplifier at 273 MHz. The main challenges in fabrication were machining the complex cavity parts with high precision",

We compare performance evolution to observations made with material science techniques and find correlations with material parameters.

The ideal saw-tooth electric field profile of the buncher is achieved in practice by adding several components of its Fourier expansion (multi-harmonics). ESS-Bilbao will develop* a MHB intended to be tested in the CERN-ISOLDE facility. The design and prototyping include the buncher device itself as well as the solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) to power it. The buncher design (finite elements and beam dynamics) has been carried out to optimize it for ISOLDE beams and frequencies of 1/10th of the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) frequency. The testing of the cavity at ESS-Bilbao proton beam injector (before the RFQ) has also been studied."

A single-cavity system reached 15 kW at 66% power-added efficiency with ten of 12 slots filled on only 1 of 2 cavities faces. The system further demonstrated the expected graceful degradation; an intermittent fault occurred on 1 of the 10 modules and the only observable effect was a reduction in output power to 13.3 kW with a slight reduction in efficiency. Combining of multiple cavities was also demonstrated at low power."

Research Instruments, located in Germany, built and processed the cavities at the vendor site, including electropolishing as the final active chemistry step. Twenty-eight cavities for seven cryomodules and an additional four cavities for a spare cryomodules were delivered to Jefferson Lab and first qualification tests were completed on all cavities as received from the vendor. The performance largely exceeded the requirements on quality factor and accelerating gradient. Here we present the status of initial cavity qualification tests, rework on unqualified cavities and final cavity qualification with helium vessel prior to installation in cryomodules. In addition, an update on cryomodule production is presented."

The cryogenic commissioning was recently completed. The cold mass alignments and the cryogenic heat loads were measured. The cavity performance was qualified in both test regime and operating regime. The cavity degradations caused by magnetic pollution from solenoid and the recovery procedure were verified. This paper will report the detailed results of the commissioning."

            "this came with a reduction in transmitted beam between the source and the entrance to Tank 1 of the LINAC. Fermilab currently operates with less than 50% of the beam current from the ion source making it to the entrance of tank 1. In an effort to understand the causes of this reduction in transmission efficiency a vertically movable paddle was installed between the first two solenoids allowing the beam size to be investigated before entering the RFQ. Comparing this data to the emittance measurements done after the first solenoid in the Ion Source R&D lab a more complete picture of the beams propagation through the LEBT has begun to be established when compared with the simulation results. We will present these results here."

The development and simulated performance has been reported earlier and predicts sub-fs electron bunches with high charge densities. Commissioning results of the injector part of the ARES linac delivered promising beam quality results to achieve these numbers. The bunch compressor system is foreseen to be used to bench mark numerical models for coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and space charge (SC) for ultra-short electron bunches. Here we will present first measurements of the dispersion as well as calculations for the longitudinal dispersion. In the future the PolariX transverse deflecting structure (TDS) will be commissioned to fully characterize the ARES electron beam."

Azimuthal angular distribution of the bremsstrahlung photons from 28-GHz ECRIS were measured at Busan Center of KBSI. Gamma-ray detection system consists of three round type NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors positioned 62 cm radially from the beam axis and another detector placed at the extraction port for monitoring photon intensity along the beam axis. Bremsstrahlung photons energy spectra were measured at six azimuthal angles at RF power of 1 kW. Monte Carlo simulation based on Geant4 package was performed to take the geometrical acceptance and energy-dependent detection efficiency into account due to large non-uniformity in the material budget. We extracted true bremsstrahlung energy spectra using the inverse-matrix unfolding method. The end-point energies of the bremsstrahlung photons after application of deconvolution method were found to be 1.320±0.050 MeV",

Custom systems developed at national laboratories or industrial systems using custom hardware specifically designed for LLRF. Recently however advances in RF technology accompanied by demand from applications like quantum computing have led to commercially available systems that are viable for building a modular low-level RF system. Here we present an overview of a Keysight based digital LLRF system. Our system employs analog upconversion and downconversion with an intermediate frequency of 100MHz. We discuss our phase-reference system and provide initial results on the system performance. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

            "The vertical test stand in use at Daresbury has three cavities loaded horizontally at different heights. The jacketed cavities are supplied with liquid helium from a header tank at the top of the configuration. A few cavities have been tested in different positions and the results have been analysed. The pressure of the helium inside the jacketed cavities is affected by the height of the liquid helium column above the jacket and using results from earlier analysis during cool-down enables the pressure of the cavity to be determined from the frequency of operation. Analysis of the effects may allow for corrections to the frequency to be made. In addition to the above observations there have also been some challenges in the operation at higher power as the phase of the self-excited loop driving the system",
            "has been seen to change. This paper discusses some of the observation",

            "Many current accelerators use cavities that are manufactured as two half cells that are electron beam welded together",
            "the weld is across the peak surface current of the cavity. This weld can lead to large increases in surface resistance and limit the performance of thin film coated cavities. Many problems with the coating process for thin film Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities are also due to this weld. Thin film SRF cavities can perform as well as bulk niobium cavities if the cavity is manufactured seamlessly",
            "without any weld",
            "as they have a more uniform surface",

            "would not need to be welded. These seamless cavities are easier to manufacture and coat. This opens the possibilities to coat with new materials and multilayer coatings. These cavities may allow SRF cavities to operate at significantly better parameters (higher quality factor and maximum accelerating field) than current state of the art cavities. This work discusses development and testing of longitudinally split seamless cavities at Daresbury Laboratory."

            "fine grain niobium (Nb) (grain size ~ 50 um) and large grain Nb (grain size of a few cm) are being used for the fabrication of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Medium grain forged ingot with grain size of a few hundred um may be beneficial for cost-effectiveness as well as providing better performance for future SRF-based accelerators. Forged ingot Nb with medium grain size is a novel production method to obtain Nb discs used for the fabrication of superconducting radio frequency cavities. We have fabricated two 1.5 GHz single cell cavities made from forged Nb ingot with a residual resistivity ratio of ~100. The cavities were chemically and mechanically polished and heat-treated in the temperature range of 650-1000 C before the rf test. One of the cavities reached an accelerating gradient of 34 MV/m with a quality factor Q > 1e10",
            "while the second cavity was limited at 14 MV/m",

            "During commissioning and operation run in 2021-2022 the photoinjector of the CLARA-VELA facility a 2.5 cell cavity S-band photocathode gun originally developed for the APEX experiment was used. The copper back wall of the cavity also served as the gun photocathode. In order to reduce significant time required for replacement and/or reactivation of the photocathode and improve the flexibility of the injector the gun has been upgraded for operation with DESY/INFN style interchangeable photocathodes. This upgrade included a new design of the cavity back wall to accommodate the photocathode socket and equipping the gun with a load-lock system. Modification of the gun also required replacement of the bucking coil",
            "which zeros field in the photocathode emission plane. After the upgrade",
            "the gun was commissioned and then operated with a hybrid Cu/Mo photocathode during the last two years. During winter-spring 2022 experimental run the gun steadily operated with a cathode field of 60 MV/m",
            "limited by the RF power available and with an off-centre diamond turned photocathode which delivered stable bunches with a charge of 100 pC."

High transmission efficiencies (typically higher than 97%) were relatively easy to achieve for beam currents of ~0.1 emA level. Experimental research such as C-C burning investigation in nuclear astrophysics needs intense heavy ion beam of a broad beam energy variation while maintaining very low energy spread. A setup of ion beam energy modulation system has been developed",

PIP2IT comprises the warm front end and the first two PIP-II superconducting cryomodules. PIP2IT is designed to accelerate a 2 mA H− beam to an energy of 20 MeV. The facility serves as a testbed for a number of advanced technologies required to operate PIP-II and provides an opportunity to gain experience with commissioning of the superconducting linac",

        "we describe the facility and its critical systems. We discuss our experience with the integrated testing and beam commissioning of PIP2IT",
        "and present commissioning results. This important milestone ushers in a new era at Fermilab of proton beam delivery using superconducting radio-frequency accelerators."

A simulation study of a THz FEL facility capable of generating powerful tunable coherent THz radiation that covers the wavelength range of 25 ’m to 100 ’m was performed. An accelerator beamline layout based on the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) and an APPLE-II undulator with a period length of 40 mm were used in the simulation study.

It is evolving from the concept of the 4 European cancer therapy centers applying light ions up to carbon. The new linac will in its simpliest version allow C4+ - beam injection into synchrotrons at 5 A MeV",
        "with high beam transmission and allowing currents up to 5 mA alpha - particles. An advanced ECR - ion source will inject into an RFQ - IH-DTL combination. The DTL concept allows upgraded versions for A/q - values up to two and with beam energies of 7.1 A MeV from IH - tank2 and 10 A MeV from IH-tank3. The higher beam injection energies for light ions allow a relaxed synchrotron operation at lowest magnetic field levels. A main argument for the DTL extensions however is an additional linac function as radioisotope facility driver. The 7.1 A MeV are especially defined for the clean production of 211At",
        "which may play a future role in cancer therapy. The linac will allow for high duty factors - up to 10%",

It utilises a supersonic gas curtain which traverses the beam perpendicular to its propagation and measures beam-induced ionisation interactions of the gas. A 2D transverse beam profile image is created by orientating the gas jet 45 degrees to obtain both X and Y distributions of the beam. This paper builds upon previously used single-slit skimmers and improves their ability to form the gas jet into a desired distribution for imaging beam halo. A skimmer device removes off-momentum gas particles and forms the jet into a dense thin curtain",

Its efficiency is decisive in reaching the intensities required and may be increased by more than 50% by introducing hydrogen as stripping target",

        "An innovative superconducting cavity topology has been recently proposed at CERN and at Lancaster University. It integrates longitudinal slots crossing perpendicularly the RF surface. The RF current lines run along the slots",
        "inducing no perturbation of the accelerating mode. Thanks to this approach",
        "the cavity can be built using halves or quadrants",
        "which is well appropriate to precise manufacturing techniques. This configuration allows direct access to the RF surface",
        "thus facilitating the surface preparation and thin film deposition process in the case of cavities based on Nb/Cu technology. The contact faces between the cavity parts are moved to the slots’ ends where the electromagnetic fields are extremely low",
        "thus relaxing the constraints on the quality of the assembly joints. This paper covers the latest development of a 600 MHz slotted elliptical cavity called SWELL",
        "which has been proposed as an alternative option for the FCC-ee RF system as well as a simplified SWELL version of a single cell 1.3 GHz elliptical cavity and a new 6 GHz split resonator made of two halves for superconducting thin film characterization."

This talk will first discuss simulation optimizations that show that intrinsic emittance reductions of at least an order of magnitude beyond the state of the art can still yield dramatic emittance improvements in multiple applications including free-electron laser injectors and ultrafast electron diffraction. Finally",
        "this talk will discuss the status of the generation of low intrinsic emittance in modern semiconductor photocathodes",
        "and will present new results on the minimum achievable intrinsic emittances from CsTe photocathodes.",

The ideal saw-tooth electric field profile of the buncher is achieved in practice by adding several components of its Fourier expansion (multi-harmonics). ESS-Bilbao will develop* a MHB intended to be tested in the CERN-ISOLDE facility. The design and prototyping include the buncher device itself as well as the solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) to power it. The buncher design (finite elements and beam dynamics) has been carried out to optimize it for ISOLDE beams and frequencies of 1/10th of the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) frequency. The testing of the cavity at ESS-Bilbao proton beam injector (before the RFQ) has also been studied."

The architecture combines the power of N-many RF power transistors into a single resonant cavity that are surface-mounted and -cooled. The system is designed so that failure of individual transistors has negligible performance impact. Due to the electrical and mechanical simplicity",
        "maintenance and logistics are simplified. DTI demonstrated the basic feasibility of a 50-100 kW class amplifier resonant cavity combiner system at 650 MHz. A single-cavity system reached 15 kW at 66% power-added efficiency with ten of 12 slots filled on only 1 of 2 cavities faces. The system further demonstrated the expected graceful degradation; an intermittent fault occurred on 1 of the 10 modules and the only observable effect was a reduction in output power to 13.3 kW with a slight reduction in efficiency. Combining of multiple cavities was also demonstrated at low power."

Research Instruments, located in Germany, built and processed the cavities at the vendor site, including electropolishing as the final active chemistry step. Twenty-eight cavities for seven cryomodules and an additional four cavities for a spare cryomodules were delivered to Jefferson Lab and first qualification tests were completed on all cavities as received from the vendor. The performance largely exceeded the requirements on quality factor and accelerating gradient. Here we present the status of initial cavity qualification tests, rework on unqualified cavities and final cavity qualification with helium vessel prior to installation in cryomodules. In addition, an update on cryomodule production is presented."

The project will install seven superconducting RF cryomodules and supporting RF power systems and ancillaries to increase the beam energy to 1.3 GeV . The injection and extraction region of the accumulator ring will be upgraded, and a new 2 MW mercury target has been developed along with supporting equipment for high-flow gas injection to mitigate cavitation and fatigue stress.

        "several upgrade and improvement projects are ongoing. One such project is the modification of the coaxial couplers that transfer radio frequency (RF) power to the accelerator’s Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). The proposed modification utilizes stub sections and capacitive coupling to construct a physically separable assembly with DC isolation. With a separated coupler assembly",
        "the section that includes the magnetic coupling loop can be permanently mounted to the RFQ which would eliminate the need to re-adjust the couplers after maintenance activities",

Fermilab currently operates with less than 50% of the beam current from the ion source making it to the entrance of tank 1.

Comparing this data to the emittance measurements done after the first solenoid in the Ion Source R&D lab a more complete picture of the beams propagation through the LEBT has begun to be established when compared with the simulation results.

Four types of accelerating structures are adopted to obtain the efficient acceleration with a wide beta range from 0.01 to 0.94. The project is moving into the construction phase. They already demonstrated the re-acceleration scheme of the decelerated muons using a 324-MHz RFQ in 2017. The high-power test of the 324-MHz Interdigital H-mode (IH) DTL using a prototype cavity will be performed in 2021. The fabrication of the first module of 14 modules of the 1296-MHz Disk and Washer (DAW) CCL will be done to confirm the production process. Moreover",

A typical issue impacting the achieved transverse emittance in muon collider schemes so far considered is the phase space dilution caused by Coulomb interaction of primary particles propagating into the target where muons are generated. In this study we present a new scheme for muon beam generation occurring in vacuum by interactions of electron and photon beams.",

The dedicated R&D linac ARES at DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) is now fully operational and able to produce these electron beams at the nominal energy of 155 MeV and deliver it to users. This paper gives an overview of the ARES linac and summarizes the beam parameter measurements. The possibilities for user operation will be described in detail."

The development and simulated performance has been reported earlier and predicts sub-fs electron bunches with high charge densities. Commissioning results of the injector part of the ARES linac delivered promising beam quality results to achieve these numbers. The bunch compressor system is foreseen to be used to bench mark numerical models for coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and space charge (SC) for ultra-short electron bunches. Here we will present first measurements of the dispersion as well as calculations for the longitudinal dispersion.

Azimuthal angular distribution of the bremsstrahlung photons from 28-GHz ECRIS were measured at Busan Center of KBSI. Gamma-ray detection system consists of three round type NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors positioned 62 cm radially from the beam axis and another detector placed at the extraction port for monitoring photon intensity along the beam axis. Bremsstrahlung photons energy spectra were measured at six azimuthal angles at RF power of 1 kW. Monte Carlo simulation based on Geant4 package was performed to take the geometrical acceptance and energy-dependent detection efficiency into account due to large non-uniformity in the material budget. We extracted true bremsstrahlung energy spectra using the inverse-matrix unfolding method. The end-point energies of the bremsstrahlung photons after application of deconvolution method were found to be 1.320±0.050 MeV",

This paper presents the 216MHz injector Low-Level Radio Frequency (iLLRF) system with option of use for the synchrotron Low-Level Radio Frequency (sLLRF - 0.4-10MHz). The developed system will unify the cavity regulation for both LLRFs and will also be used for beam diagnostics (injector/synchrotron) and RF knock-out slow extraction. The new LLRF system is based on a µTCA platform which is controlled by the MedAustron Control System based on NI-PXIe. Currently",

        "too high RF field",
        "the SRF cavities can experience quenches that risk creating damage due to the rapid increase in the heat load. This is especially negative in continuous wave (CW) operation due to the impossibility of the system to recover during the off-load period. The design goal of a quench-detection system is to protect the system without being a limiting factor during the operation. In this paper",

        "The vertical test stand in use at Daresbury has three cavities loaded horizontally at different heights. The jacketed cavities are supplied with liquid helium from a header tank at the top of the configuration. A few cavities have been tested in different positions and the results have been analysed. The pressure of the helium inside the jacketed cavities is affected by the height of the liquid helium column above the jacket and using results from earlier analysis during cool-down enables the pressure of the cavity to be determined from the frequency of operation. Analysis of the effects may allow for corrections to the frequency to be made. In addition to the above observations there have also been some challenges in the operation at higher power as the phase of the self-excited loop driving the system",

        "Many current accelerators use cavities that are manufactured as two half cells that are electron beam welded together",
        "the weld is across the peak surface current of the cavity. This weld can lead to large increases in surface resistance and limit the performance of thin film coated cavities. Many problems with the coating process for thin film Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities are also due to this weld. Thin film SRF cavities can perform as well as bulk niobium cavities if the cavity is manufactured seamlessly",
        "without any weld",

These cavities may allow SRF cavities to operate at significantly better parameters (higher quality factor and maximum accelerating field) than current state of the art cavities. This work discusses development and testing of longitudinally split seamless cavities at Daresbury Laboratory."

        "fine grain niobium (Nb) (grain size ~ 50 um) and large grain Nb (grain size of a few cm) are being used for the fabrication of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Medium grain forged ingot with grain size of a few hundred um may be beneficial for cost-effectiveness as well as providing better performance for future SRF-based accelerators. Forged ingot Nb with medium grain size is a novel production method to obtain Nb discs used for the fabrication of superconducting radio frequency cavities. We have fabricated two 1.5 GHz single cell cavities made from forged Nb ingot with a residual resistivity ratio of ~100. The cavities were chemically and mechanically polished and heat-treated in the temperature range of 650-1000 C before the rf test. One of the cavities reached an accelerating gradient of 34 MV/m with a quality factor Q > 1e10",
        "while the second cavity was limited at 14 MV/m",

        "During commissioning and operation run in 2021-2022 the photoinjector of the CLARA-VELA facility a 2.5 cell cavity S-band photocathode gun originally developed for the APEX experiment was used. The copper back wall of the cavity also served as the gun photocathode. In order to reduce significant time required for replacement and/or reactivation of the photocathode and improve the flexibility of the injector the gun has been upgraded for operation with DESY/INFN style interchangeable photocathodes. This upgrade included a new design of the cavity back wall to accommodate the photocathode socket and equipping the gun with a load-lock system. Modification of the gun also required replacement of the bucking coil",
        "which zeros field in the photocathode emission plane. After the upgrade",
        "the gun was commissioned and then operated with a hybrid Cu/Mo photocathode during the last two years. During winter-spring 2022 experimental run the gun steadily operated with a cathode field of 60 MV/m",
        "limited by the RF power available and with an off-centre diamond turned photocathode which delivered stable bunches with a charge of 100 pC."

        "Maximising the accelerating gradient of RF structures is fundamental to improving accelerator facility performance and cost-effectiveness. Structures must be subjected to a conditioning process before operational use",
        "in which the gradient is gradually increased up to the operating value. A limiting effect during this process is breakdown or vacuum arcing",
        "which can cause damage that limits the ultimate operating gradient. Techniques to efficiently condition the cavities while minimising the number of breakdowns are therefore important. In this paper",
        "machine learning techniques are applied to detect breakdown events in RF pulse traces by approaching the problem as anomaly detection",
        "using a variational autoencoder. This process detects deviations from normal operation and classifies them with near perfect accuracy. Offline data from various sources has been used to develop the techniques",
        "which we aim to test at the CLARA facility at Daresbury Laboratory. Deployment of the machine learning system on the high repetition rate gun upgrade at CLARA has begun."

High transmission efficiencies (typically higher than 97%) were relatively easy to achieve for beam currents of ~0.1 emA level. Experimental research such as C-C burning investigation in nuclear astrophysics needs intense heavy ion beam of a broad beam energy variation while maintaining very low energy spread. A setup of ion beam energy modulation system has been developed",

        "showing that the quality of the beam generated in the laser plasma accelerator is sufficient to sustain amplification in a FEL",
        "represents a long awaited fundamental milestone. In addition",
        "more recently a first demonstration of FEL exponential gain was also achieved in a beam-driven plasma accelerator at a wavelength of 830 nm at INFN (Frascati",
        "Italy). The performances of these FELs cannot match those available in existing FEL facilities. However",
        "these experiments represent a technological breakthrough and pave the way for FELs driven by extremely compact accelerators.",
