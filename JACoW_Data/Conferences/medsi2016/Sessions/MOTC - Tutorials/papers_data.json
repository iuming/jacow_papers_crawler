        "We will explain the basic concepts of optics regarding focusing with grazing incidence reflective surfaces. The concept of aberration and figure error",
        "and the aberrations associated to the typical geometric surfaces found in mirrors will be described with some detail. We will describe how mirror benders can approximate these geometrical figures",
        "how to compute the required mechanical characteristics",
        "and the optical effect of the residual errors. Finally",
        "we will describe",
        "and illustrate with examples",
        "the main aspects that have to be considered in the mechanical implementation",
        "their characterization and their operation in the beam-line."
