      "abstract": "The first shutter assembly outside of the Front End (FE) for Brockhouse X-Ray Diffraction and Scattering Sector (BXDS) beamline required a unique design solution to accommodate all components into required safety shutter position. Located between the IVW high energy wiggler monochromator and POE1 wall, the total envelope size approximated 1m x 0.660m (LxW). Accommodating a smaller space required an alternative shutter design than traditionally used implemented at the CLS. The alternative proposed design combined the collimator (CLM), safety shutter (SSH), photon shutter (PSH) and Fixed Mask (FM) into one chamber. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted on the FM and PSH assembly to verify that geometric designs were adequate for reasonable operation in the beamline. FEA was used to determine the steady-state thermal and static-structural response in both operating positions. Missteer was analyzed for both operating positions to a maximum of 2.5mm (commonly accepted missteer used at the CLS) from center. Finally, two extreme position (5mm) analyses were completed for determination of potential, but unlikely operating conditions. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "a shock tube system with an inner diameter of 35 mm and a total length of 10 m was prepared to measure the shock Mach number. Experiments have been conducted that simulated an inrush of the atmosphere into the high-vacuum (~10-3 Pa) pipe by using a trigger system that combines of a thin cellophane diaphragm with a plunger. Special ionization gauges with a high-speed amplifier are distributed about every 1 m to detect the transit time of the shock wave and to measure the pressure in a low-pressure chamber after the actuation of the FCS system. By inserting vacuum components with various cross-sectional shapes including actual front-end components into the shock tube",
        "the attenuation in the shock wave was systematically investigated."

Experimental results indicated that both gratings were contributing to the poor energy resolution and this led to venting the monochromator to investigate. The initial suspicion was that a systematic error had occurred in the ruling process on the VLS gratings",
        "but that proved to not be the case. Instead the problem was isolated to mechanical constraints used to mount the gratings into their respective side-cooled holders. Modifications were made to the holders to eliminate problematic constraints without compromising the rest of the design. Metrology performed on the gratings in the original and modified holders demonstrated a 20-fold improvement in the surface profile error which was consistent with finite element analysis performed in support of the modifications. Two gratings were successfully reinstalled and subsequent measurements with beam show a dramatic improvement in energy resolution."

        "The live animal imaging program at the Bio-Medical Imaging and Therapy (BMIT) facility at the Canadian Light Source has been developing for the last 5 years and continues to grow. It is expected to become a large portion of the user activity as numerous groups work towards the goal of live animal studies. Synchrotron-based imaging of live animals is an opportunity for great science that also brings challenges and specific requirements for the experimental end-station. The beamline currently provides basic support and has been improving the facilities available. For example",
        "there have been changes to the lab to allow for longer rodent housing and improved housing during measurements. Remote control of heat lamps and of flow rate for gas anaesthesia allow a veterinarian or animal care worker to make adjustments without interrupting the imaging. Integration of user equipment such as heart/breathing monitoring and ultrasound equipment with the beamline systems can be used for gating control of imaging. Future improvements will be done with consultation with university veterinarians and the user groups."

There was a need to introduce an exchangeable filter between the soller slits and the 32-element germanium detectors. It was further required to have an automated filter exchange system so that users could quickly vary filter thicknesses and types to determine the effect on the signal. An auto-mounting filter system was created to meet these requirements and allows users to quickly exchange filters without breaking experimental hutch lockup. The auto-mounter cartridge can hold up to ten slides that measure 100mm X 55mm in cross-section. The device inserts slides in an extremely small envelope between the soller slits and the liquid helium cryostat. The auto-mounter assembly also houses the stages required to actuate the soller slits laterally and vertically. During device commissioning we performed 800 consecutive successful filter exchanges as part of a stress test. The spatial constraints",

This is a development project for Eu-XFEL led by the MPG’s Semiconductor Laboratory. This is a silicon detector with ~40000 um2 hexagonal pixels. The Photon Science Detector Group at DESY has the responsibility for the Mechanics/Thermal Workpackage of DSSC. This presents a challenge particularly because ~400 W are put out by the electronics in the in-vacuum detector head (by sensors and electronics boards). The heat load distributes in four cooling blocks (which are movable) where the cooling-tubes welded in. The aim is to achieve -20°C sensor temperature on each Sensor (four per block). The detector components (very sensitive and expensive electronics) will be operated in vacuum. Therefore it is important that coolant-liquid is safe enclosed. From that idea starts the design of double-walled bellow cooling pipes",

ALBA has developed a new motorized beamstop* consisting of a two-rotation mechanism inside vacuum that composes a movement able to cover all range of the active area of the detector. The presented solution involves a main rotation reached by a gear and a worm drive actuated by a stepper motor and a second rotation relative to the main one produced by a piezo rotation stage. For each position appears two different solutions. This characteristic permits take two equivalent images in the detector with the same beamstop position but different orientation in the beamstop support; thus permitting the compensation of the support shadow on the active area of the detector."
