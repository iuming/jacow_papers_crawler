        "Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps are widely used for maintaining a clean ultra-high vacuum (UHV) of ≤10-8 Pa because of their high pumping speeds for hydrogen and active gases in the UHV region. In addition",

        "titanium parts",
        "a DN 40 conflat flange",
        "and a tantalum heater. The NEG pills are vertically and radially aligned around the heater to maximize the effective area for pumping. After activation at 400 °C for 30 min",
        "the pumping speeds of the NEG pump were measured with the orifice method. Pumping speeds of 140-130",
        "200-140",

        "in a pumped-quantity range of 0.01-0.1 Pa·L. Since the NEG pump is composed of a heating unit and a NEG module",
        "the pumping speeds can be improved by increasing the number of NEG modules. These NEG pumps are favourable alternatives to sputtering ion pumps."

These springs are designed to exhibit non-linear spring characteristics that can be closely tuned to match the force curve exerted by the magnetic field",
