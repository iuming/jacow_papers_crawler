        "An overview of the double branch 185m I14 Nano-probe beam-line under construction at DLS will be presented together with the end-station design in further detail. The end station consists of a split vacuum vessel containing a KB mirror configuration (at UHV) and the sample environment (at HV) which is just 50mm from the end of the final KB optic. An in-vacuum detector is mounted between the KB and the sample whilst two externally mounted detectors will operate between 0.25m & 3m from the sample. Four cryogenic samples can be brought into the vessel at a time and transferred remotely to the sample position with cooling provided by a Helium pulse tube cooler. With an initial 50nm size beam",
        "stability is absolutely critical and careful attention has been paid in the design to mitigate any thermal and structural sources of vibration. An array of interferometers reference the KB mirrors and sample position and will be used to actively correct for any drifts. The very tight space constraints involved have greatly increased the complexity and duration of the design but testing of prototypes is now underway. The system is scheduled for build and test through the Autumn 2016."
