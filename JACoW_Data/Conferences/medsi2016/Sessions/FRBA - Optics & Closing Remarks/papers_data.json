        "provide an energy resolution ranging from few hundreds of eV down to the Darwin width of few eV. The bender principle",
        "design",
        "manufacture and first commissioning will be described. The virtual source",
        "produced with a white beam transfocator",
        "can be before or after the monochromator. Therefore the bending mechanism must allow both concave and convex configuration with bending radius from 20m to infinite. Each bender is equipped with two home made piezo-jacks in close loop with capacitive sensor. The system is liquid Nitrogen cooled. The thermal behaviour will be described in detail and thermo-mechanical finite element analysis presented."

        "spot size as well as better beam uniformity at sample position. Based on the experience of ALBA Phase I beam lines a new alter-native design of a mirror bender* is proposed. The system includes two main functionalities: the mirror bender mechanism and mirror figure error correc-tion. Both mechanisms are based on the introduction of a force constrain on the mirror surface instead of a geometrical one. As being based on a force mechanism they could reach high resolution and especially for the correctors which can achieve nanometre resolution. The correctors are designed to provide high force stability in the mirror side",
        "eliminating the crosstalk between bending and figure correction",
        "and minimizing the sensitivity to drifts. With such controlled deformation of the mirror substrate it is possible to obtain the desired surface figure not only to correct mirror figure errors but also to adapt it to the incident wavefront",
        "thus becoming adaptive system. The mechanical solutions are presented which are able to correct mirror surfaces with a resolution of 1 nm reaching slope errors below 100 nrad."

        "A Double Multilayer Monochromator (DMM) was designed in-house for the VMXi beam-line. This paper describes the novel engineering solutions employed to build a high stability instrument. PiezoMotor® actuators drive sine-arm Bragg axes for both optics providing the coarse and fine motion in a single actuator. The long translation of the second multilayer is driven externally via a linear shift to eliminate in-vacuum pipe & cable motions. A high stability air bearing translates the whole DMM across the two multilayer stripes. The optics are water cooled via an Indium / Gallium eutectic alloy bath to minimise coupled vibrations. The DMM is operational on the VMXi beam-line",

We will especially discuss the aspects of cooling technology to minimize the thermal deformation and the management and minimization of the mechanical coupling between the mirror bending and the cooling."
