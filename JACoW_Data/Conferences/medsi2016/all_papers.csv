medsi2016,,MOTB01,Advanced Computational Methods for Vacuum Technology With Application to Synchrotron Radiation Light Sources,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Following the progress in the design and improvement of their performances; the new generations of light sources have come to a point where diffraction-limited x-ray beams are a reality. This evolutionary trend has required a parallel evolution of the design of their vacuum systems; and the application of cross-disciplinary discoveries in the field of materials; surface treatments; thin-films; pumping technology; and more. This 2 ½ hour tutorial will follow the following program: ▪ Basics of gas dynamics: outgassing; conductance; pumping speed. ▪ Basics of synchrotron radiation (SR); with examples relevant to vacuum design. ▪ SR-induced desorption. ▪ Computational methods for vacuum: a review. ▪ Practical examples of analysis; simulation; and design of key components of light sources. ▪ Summary and conclusions.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/motb01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/motb01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/motb01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOTB01,
medsi2016,,MOTB02,"Finite Element Analysis in Design of Synchrotron Instrumentation - Issues, Good Practices and New Horizons",ANL; Argonne; Illinois; USA; Finite Element Analysis(FEA) is a design tool widely implemented in the design of synchrotron instrumentation to predict behavior of a particular design under the assumed real life conditions. Although FEA is a very popular and trusted design tool in use for several decades; it is of paramount importance to emphasize that it is only as accurate as the user’s input into the analysis and the interpretation of the results. In its introduction the tutorial will cover the importance of accurate inputs into the analysis and correct interpretation of the results as well as the best practices in how to improve said accuracies. Second part will cover the nature of the phenomena analyzed with thermal and structural simulations with the emphasis on the seemingly paradoxical fact that thermally loaded structures frequently fail only upon load removal. The third part will cover thermal and structural simulations with several examples. The tutorial will be concluded with alternate applications of FEA in the design of synchrotron instrumentation. Examples of multi-physic and vibration analysis; component weight optimization; and the analysis of the acoustic levitation supports will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/motb02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/motb02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/motb02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOTB02,

medsi2016,,MOPE01,Stabilization Methods for Force Actuators and Flexure Hinges,C. Colldelram; J. Nicolás; C. Ruget; ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron; Cerdanyola del Vallès; Spain; In the framework of the design of an adaptive optics for x-ray mirrors a stabilization system* for force actuators and flexure hinges have been conceived. This corrector allows to deform the mirror surface at nanometre level but for this purpose it requires resolutions better than 0.02; by using ultra-low constant springs; and to preserve the introduced deformation it is needed to be stable at the same level. The corrector needs to be insensitive when dismantling and remounting the mirror. In the other hand in order to support the corrector its structure is attached to the bender frame and the spring force is transmitted through a level arm by means a bearing articulation. This introduces a small friction but it is still preferably to eliminate it. A new method based -k spring-like constant principle is proposed. Based on this technique it is possible to stabilize the force exerted on the mirror below 0; 02N for an error range more than 1 mm. In addition applying the principle to a flexure it allows to compensate it in an angular range in within the torque variation tend to be null; below 0; 005 Nm; thus becoming a short range; frictionless and zero torque articulation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/mope01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/mope01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/mope01_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOPE01,1

Naturally; the new 4th generation machines; with their small emittances; start to bring about higher stability performance requirements; in spite of factors as high power loads; power load variation; and vibration sources. A new high-dynamics DCM (Double Crystal Monochromator) is under development at the Brazilian Light Source for the Sirius EMA beamline (Extreme Condition X-ray Methods of Analysis). The disturbances induced by the coolant flows are known to be among the most detrimental influences to a DCM performance; however; quantitative force numbers involved in such disturbances are not commonly investigated. According to the novel dynamic concept; these forces should be predictably translated into stability performance. Therefore; experimental setups that allow the indirect measurement of such forces in conditions close to those of operation were designed. The results comparing different indirect cooling profiles and manufacturing processes (brazing and additive manufacturing) are shown.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/mope02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/mope02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/mope02_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOPE02,8

medsi2016,,MOPE04,Dynamically Isotropic Hexapods for High-Performance 6-DOF Manipulation,MAX IV Laboratory; Lund University; Lund; Sweden; Recent advances in synchrotron facilities have led to a growing need for 6-DOF precise manipulation. Hexapods are the most widely used parallel robots which provide 6 DOFs. To obtain high precision and high dynamic performance in hexapods; it is necessary to design them in such a way that low eigen frequencies are avoided (while the eigenf requencies are also functions of the complex 3D geometry of hexapods). Theoretically; maximizing the lowest eigen frequency leads to a condition where multiple eigen frequencies become equal; which is known as (complete or partial) dynamic isotropy. Thus; one may consider a dynamically isotropic hexapod as the optimal design solution; where precision and dynamic performance is a goal. In this work; we analytically address this problem and establish a practical guideline in order to design generalized hexapods with complete dynamic isotropy. The findings are based on the recently defended PhD dissertation by Behrouz Afzali-Far.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/mope04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/mope04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/mope04_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOPE04,

Especially for Coherent X-ray Scattering and X-ray Nanoprobe beam-lines; severe specifications of the slits are more necessary to define proper beam sizes in horizontal and vertical directions at sample. The opening size of each pair of slits assembled orthogonally is usually needed to range within several microns; so the UHV-compatible piezo-driven stages with closed-loop system were adopted for the purposes of fine adjustment; precise positional accuracy and repeatability. To reduce X-ray scattering effect; the rectangular single-crystal film was bonded on the edge of the slit blade. The machined rotary weak-link structure and piezo-driven actuators were used to slightly adjust parallelism of each pair of the blades with the method of single-slit diffraction. To enhance structural and thermal stability; the granite plinths with specified shape were designed and the precise temperature controlling system will be set up recently. The overall design; mechanical specifications and procedure of testing for secondary source slits will be introduced in this paper.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/mope05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/mope05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/mope05_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOPE05,12

The device is used for the calibration of high precision angle measuring systems; such as autocollimators; levels and encoders. The state of art requirements for the SAG according to autocollimator manufacturers and users are: ±3600"" stroke; 0.001"" resolution; high stability and portability. The key element behind the angular motion generation consists on a flexure mechanism. This approach makes possible to reduce the overall size of the LRSAG. Moreover; the mechanism consists on a Parallel Kinematic Mechanism that supports the end effecter; enabling high stiffness and high eigenfrequencies. The mechanisms is actuated by two piezo linear stages that provide large stroke (20 mm) and very high resolution (2 nm in closed loop mode). Two independent measuring systems are also integrated in the angle generator. These systems provide feedback about the position of the moving platform based on imaging systems.

The new performance demands a wire travelling speed up to 20 m/s and a position measurement accuracy of the order of 1 µm. In order to minimize the error source of the wire position measurement; a challenging concept has been developed which consists of the placement of the motor rotor and the angular position sensor in vacuum. The implementation of this new concept requires the use of a magnetic brake; hybrid vacuum bearings; the design and production of very thin (<0.5mm) wall vacuum chamber regions and the production of titanium components by 3D additive technologies. The implementation of this new concept has required different optimization processes as the structural optimization under dynamic load of the most critical rotating elements or the optimization of the control system and the motion pattern.

The luminosity goal leads to stringent alignment requirements for single quadrupole magnets. Vertical and lateral offset deviations with regards to a given orbit reference in both ends of a quadrupole shall be below 1 µm and quadrupole roll deviation shall be below 100 µrad. Translation in the direction of particle beam is not controlled but mechanically locked. A parallel kinematic platform based on cam movers was chosen as system for detailed studies. Earlier studies have shown that cam movers can reach the CLIC requirements through an iterative process. The paper presents new modular off-the-shelf control electronics and software including three optional positioning algorithms based on iterations as well as a more advanced algorithm which can reach target position in one movement. The advanced algorithm reads wire position sensors (WPS); calculates quadrupole orientation based on the readings and updates the remaining trajectory during motion.

Conceived as an alternative to the precision hexapods it fulfils the gap of sample (and/or; instruments) positioning in small (height) available working spaces of synchrotron Diffractometers (Dm).

The new 4th generation machines; with emittances in the range of order of 100 pm rad; require even higher stability performances; in spite of the still conflicting factors such as high power loads; power load variation; and vibration sources. A new high-dynamics DCM is under development at LNLS for the future X-ray undulator and superbend beamlines of Sirius. Aiming at inter-crystal stability of a few tens of nrad and considering the limitations of the current DCM implementations; several aspects of DCM engineering are being revisited. The system concept is chosen such that a control bandwidth in the order of 200 to 300 Hz can be achieved. This requires well-designed system dynamics; which can be realized by applying a fundamentally different architecture than that used in common DCM designs; based on principles used in ultra-precision systems for semiconductor manufacturing. As a result; known disturbances can be attenuated or suppressed; and internally excited modes can be effectively handled.

The mechanical concept features separate positioning stages for each optical element. Those are based on a serial combination of coarse motion axes and a fine alignment 6 DoF Cartesian parallel kinematics**. That allows to meet the contradictory demands of a fast long-range travel of up to 1000 mm and in the same time a precise alignment with a resolution in the nanometer range. Multiple laser interferometers monitor the position of the optical elements and allow an active control of their alignment. All optical elements and mechanics will be installed inside an UHV chamber; including the interferometer and about 100 stepper motors. With this paper we present the mechanical design for the SDL.

Due to high absorption of 2.5 keV photons in air (more than 99; 9 % at 100 mm) our high precision goniometers (three independent stages) for the high resolution monochromator will have to be put into high vacuum (1x10-7 mbar).

Our approach to solving this problem is to use piezo actuators (a long travel range of the chosen actuator) combined with a high precision spindle ball bearing to make a simple setup of an in vacuum high precision goniometer. The goal is to achieve an angular resolution of 10 nanorad - a movement that will be monitored and controlled by an in vacuum encoder.

medsi2016,,MOPE37,Diamond Multi-Bend Achromats for Low Emittance and New Insertion Devices,J. Kay; N.P. Hammond; DLS; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom,,Diamond Light Source is pioneering the move to a Multi Bend Achromat storage ring lattice for low emittance combined with the creation of new straight sections available for Insertion Devices (ID). Diamond is at an advanced stage of replacing one Double Bend Achromat (DBA) cell of the existing storage ring with a Double Double Bend Achromat (DDBA). The DDBA cell which is to be installed in Autumn 2016 has 4 dipoles and has been designed with a new straight section in the middle. This allows a new ID source point to be installed on an existing Bending Magnet port in the shield wall for a new micro-focus protein crystallography beamline called VMX-m. This same principle will be applied to the proposed Diamond II project which will be based on a Double Triple Bend Achromat with 6 dipoles per cell achieving even lower emittance whilst providing many more IDs. This paper describes the engineering challenges of these projects. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/mope37_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/mope37.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/mope37_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOPE37,90

The use of HV also permits good cleanliness in the optical set up. As addition; is necessary to create an adaptable and modular design where several chambers could be assembled together. One additional constrain is the stability. A new model of HV chambers is presented. These consist in a frame where the walls are exchangeable panels; which make easier the introduction of a new configuration of ports. The system was designed as construction blocks. For a proper connection of the chambers a new interior fixation and pushers system was designed. Thanks to this; coupling new HV chambers; the volume total can be also easily modified.

The main objective is to enhance the hydraulic system in order to significantly improve its thermal and water flow stability. In normal operation some problems have been identified that affect the performance of the LINAC: flowrate below the nominal values and water flow decreasing in time. The cooling subsystems have been experimentally characterized in terms of the pressure drop and flowrate. The measurements were taken using a portable hydraulic unit made at ALBA as well as a set of ultrasonic flowmeters. For the numerical studies the cooling network has been simulated using the software Pipe Flow Expert. The experimental results have shown that a number of components are too restrictive. In some cases the possibility to increase the flowrate is limited. The numerical results show that the velocity magnitude is inadequate in some places; producing air bubble entrapment; high pressure drop at pipes and insufficient flow. Based on this study several modifications are presented in order to raise the nominal flow and to adequate the water flow velocities between 0.5 and 3 m/s.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/mope42_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/mope42.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/mope42_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOPE42,102

The problem was mainly caused by the air accumulated in pipes due to very low velocities of water flow. A literature review was conducted about the minimum water flow velocity for removing air in pipelines as design criteria. The aim of this work is to develop hydraulic solutions in order to achieve the minimum flowrate in pipelines of the Experimental Area (EA) ring. In the short term it is proposed to install a controlled bypass in the EA. A numerical simulation using the software Pipe Flow Expert has been implemented in order to determine the requirements of the bypass that works under different conditions to assure a minimum flowrate all along the ring. The velocity map in EA ring is simulated for different scenarios: 180 and 360 degrees distribution for both clockwise and anticlockwise rotation. For the long term a design of pipes with variable cross section is proposed which optimizes the flow velocity magnitude in EA ring in agreement with the design criteria.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/mope43_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/mope43.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/mope43_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-MOPE43,105

This is of particular importance for high precision X-ray optics; as mirrors or double crystal monochromators (DCM); which should keep the beam stable. The DCM is the first optical element in most synchrotron beamlines; which has to operate under high heat load. Thus; the cryogenic cooling and high vacuum are necessary conditions for the DCM operation in most cases. Unfortunately; cryogenic cooling is a source of the vibrational instability that has to be reduced in order to improve the beamline performance. Here; we present a method to measure vibration directly at the DCM crystals. This method was used to study and improve vibrational stability of several PETRA III monochromators. The results of the measurements allow us to discover common sources of instabilities. These results will be shown and discussed and we will describe in detail the modifications performed on the LN2 system and the monochromator design; which leads to the improvement of the angular stability at the best down to 50 nrad RMS.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/tuca01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/tuca01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/tuca01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-TUCA01,

The second compression chicane (BC2) of SwissFEL consists of four dipole magnets bending the beam on the horizontal plane along a C-shaped orbit and has a total length of 17 m. The position of the two central dipoles can be continuously adjusted to achieve the required transverse offset in order to realize a wide range of compression schemes. To ensure the requires mechanical stability of the accelerator components sitting on the long and movable steel girder (7.7 m); it is essential to design a stiff support structure with high eigen frequencies. In the design stage; displacement frequency responses are calculated in a modal based linear dynamic analysis using finite element method to ensure vibration amplitude below 1 micrometer. Special considerations are given to the modelling of linear guide systems; as they introduce nonlinear support conditions and need to be adequately simplified in the calculation.

Though stability scales with temperature fluctuations; there is some hidden complexity is the subject. Firstly; not all temperature oscillations will distort the structure: fast variations will hardly propagate into the structure; little change in overall dimensions but primarily pointing errors. Conversely; slow variations will result in quasi uniform temperature fields that change dimensions; hence mainly positional errors. Secondly; there is randomness in temperature fluctuations which obscures the actual severity of a given environment: randomness occurs timewise; but also space-wise. For highly stable situations; random part of the temperature field becomes prominent; and discarding this component becomes questionable. No harshness indicator exists that could help quantifying the actual severity of a given thermal environment. It is the objective of this paper to provide some insight on the matter; and propose a simple yet efficient numerical method allowing the evaluation of actual structural response to any realistic thermal environment.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/tuca03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/tuca03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/tuca03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-TUCA03,133

We have made direct measurements; at cryocooled conditions; on a H-DCM currently deployed at MAX IV that has a relative pitch stability of 25 nrad RMS; 1-2500 Hz; and an absolute pitch stability of 18 nrad RMS; 2-2500 Hz; when running the cryocooler in a condition that allows 1.5kW to be extracted via the circulating liquid nitrogen. These results demonstrate the advantage in terms of vibrational stability of circulating the liquid nitrogen high pressures; which enables the flow velocities to be reduced to obtain equivalent cooling performance. The value of performing live measurements is illustrated as we show that a vibration of the in-vacuum cryoline support structure is not translated into relative crystal vibrations; contrary to the intuitive assumption that this would be the primary source of beam instability.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/tuca04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/tuca04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/tuca04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-TUCA04,

The new 4th generation machines; with emittances in the range of order of 100 pm rad; require even higher stability performances; in spite of the still conflicting factors such as high power loads; power load variation; and vibration sources. A new high-dynamics DCM (Double Crystal Monochromator) is under development at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory for the future X-ray undulator and superbend beamlines of Sirius. Aiming at an inter-crystal stability of a few tens of nrad (even during the Bragg angle motion for flyscans) and considering the limitations of current DCM implementations; several aspects of the DCM engineering are being revisited. In order to achieve a highly repeatable dynamic system; with a servocontrol bandwidth in the range of 200 Hz to 300 Hz; solutions are proposed for a few topics; including: actuators and guides; metrology and feedback; LN2 indirect cooling; crystal clamping; thermal management and shielding.

The potential for problematically high material temperatures and thermal gradients can be expected to be greater than that for previous generation machines on account of the shorter source-to-receiving surface distances. Conventionally; photon absorbers are made from copper which is highly opaque to x-rays. A consequence of this is that the majority of the heat is absorbed within a very short distance of the surface. Utilizing materials that allow a more volumetric absorption of the radiation can improve the efficiency of heat removal as it can keep surface temperatures and thermal gradients lower than would otherwise be possible. This paper discusses multiphysics analysis of a crotch absorber for the APS Upgrade project (APS-U) via full-coupling of heat-transfer and structural mechanics.

The window uses 75um thick Kapton HN film and given the size; pressure and the short distance to the sensors; it was necessary to support it on a frame. To avoid any information loss from shadowing of the detector; a frame was designed so that shadows will be projected into the gaps between the detector modules. The geometry was such that DMLS**** was an effective way of producing the item. Given the slenderness of the structure and the forces it supports; the material approaches or exceeds its yield point; so a bilinear; isotropic; hardening material model was chosen; moreover; large deflections were enabled. Also; the contacts were modelled with augmented Lagrange frictional formulation. All these assumptions made the analysis strongly non-linear.,,*Grazing Incidence Small/Wide Angle X-ray scattering  **Wide Angle X-ray Scattering  ***Small Angle X-ray Scattering ****Digital Metal Laser Sintering,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/tupe18_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/tupe18.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/tupe18_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-TUPE18,201

It will provide 2700 pulses in trains of 600 microsecond duration at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. For the photon beam diagnostics; several gas-based devices have been developed and placed in the beam transport system. They operate with different noble gases (Xe; Ne; Ar) with pressures up to 1·10-4 mbar. Having a windowless beam-line; and a limited capability for noble gases that can be provided by the distributed array of ion pumps sustaining the UHV environment; a turbo-molecular based differential pumping section has been developed. This modular system is able to minimize the gas flow to the rest of the beam transport system; also offering a large optical clear aperture between pumping stages; and enabling the required installation and alignment flexibility in all the tunnel locations (up to 10); including variations as floor and ceiling-mounted versions.

Ice blockage formed and prevented helium gas from relieving during liquid helium (LHe) refill. This resulted in an internal pressure built up; which caused expelling of the LHe and cold gas helium (GHe) from the wiggler cryostat. Several improvements were performed over the years including replacement of the original rupture disk; the pressure relief valves and installation of metal O-ring seals at external ports. Following these improvements; a major upgrade on the wiggler safety relief path was implemented by adding a new vent pipe directly connected to the cryostat for safety exhaust. The LHe refill path was also modified to eliminate possibility of ice blockage. During initial tests after the up-grades; we experienced significant heat load increase which was linked to the thermal acoustic oscillations in the LHe transfer line. The problem was resolved by improving the insulation vacuum in the transfer line and adding a super insulation assembly into the direct vent pipe along with a plug at the refill path.,*Work supported by Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics under contract No. C60109-029  ¿ Linda. Lin@lightsource.ca,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/tupe21_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/tupe21.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/tupe21_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-TUPE21,209

To provide diffraction-limited spatial resolution below 30 nm; reduction of wave aberrations of low order; i.e.; spherical aberration; coma; and astigmatism; should be key technical challenge for the microscope. In this paper; firstly; we describe detail of optical design and instrumentation of the point diffraction interferometer (PDI); so as to provide high enough sensing accuracy of 100 pm; which would be required for an optical axis adjustment of the EUV objective. Next; experimental results of wave front correction on the EUV objective are reported. We corrected spherical aberration and coma by precisely aligning an optical axis of the mirrors; while effects of astigmatism were also minimized with a figure-deformable mirror which can control radius of curvature in two mutually orthogonal directions.

Thus; the refrigeration of these components is complex when one has in mind that the coolant flow cannot be too turbulent in order to not induce much vibration in the components. Oxygen Free Electrolytic Cu (OFEC) has been replaced by the Glidcop; on 4th generation synchrotron applications; due to its good thermal conductivity and preservation of mechanical properties after heating cycles. However; as this material is not very workable in terms of union with other materials; which led to the development of a brazing process for Glidcop and stainless steel union. Glidcop samples were submitted to a Cu-electroplating process and a silver base alloy (BVAg-8) was used to join the parts in a high vacuum furnace. Electroplating was used to improve the filler metal wettability. The results were very satisfactory; ensuring water and vacuum tightness.

The support system must be rigid so that its static deflection under its own weight and the combined weight of the magnets is small and repeatable. For vibration stability the lowest natural frequency of the magnet-support assembly should be greater than 50 Hz. To meet thermal stability requirements it is desirable to minimize bending deformation of the support system when subjected to temperature changes. In addition; the magnet support system should be easy to transport; easy to align; and cost effective. Altogether these requirements are difficult to satisfy; especially if the main structural component of the support system is a girder of length greater than 3 meters. In this paper we propose a magnet support system design consisting of column-type supports joined by removable C-beams. The column-type supports provide a superior stability performance without compromising the alignment capability.

One such set (length 2 m; period length 15 mm) is under development for Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). To obtain a magnetic-field distribution of the cryogenic undulator after it is cooled to an operating target temperature below 80 K; a device of hybrid type combining a Hall probe and stretched-wire method has been designed and developed; to perform the field measurement at low temperature and in an ultra-high vacuum environment. The Hall probe is used to measure the field on axis in the transverse and vertical directions; the stretched wire is utilized to measure the field integral in the vertical and horizontal directions in the horizontal plane. Unlike a conventional field-measurement system in air; this innovative system must be located in an ultra-high vacuum environment with limited clearance.

For the APS-U removal and installation; current planning calls for a 12-month shutdown and testing period; prior to resumption of operations. It calls for quick installation of the magnet support system with assembly and installation alignment tolerance. A three-point; semi-kinematic vertical mount for the magnet modules is the approach to reduce time for alignment. The longest section is the curved FODO section (four quads with three Q-bends interleaved; and a three-pole wiggler). All magnets of the FODO section sit on a single piece of support structure in order to have a good control over the magnet-to-magnet alignment tolerance. It brings challenge to minimize the top surface deflection and maximize the first mode frequency of the magnet support structure that is supported at three points. These constraints call for the need of optimizing the magnet support structures.

The ESRF EBS consists of replacing the current double-bend achromat storage ring by a new ring based on a 7-bend achromat lattice. This will enable a reduction of the electron beam horizontal emittance by a factor of 30 (140pm horizontal emittance) and an increase of the brilliance and coherence of the photon beam. As a consequence; the storage ring stability (vibrational and thermal) is of major importance; which implies specific design issues. The engineering design of standard cell components is now completed; some prototypes have been built and most of the large procurement contracts have been placed with the objective to pre-assemble equipped girders from mid 2017 and install them from beginning 2019. After introducing the context and the expected gain from the new storage ring; this talk will focus on the main technical challenges and present the mechanical design solutions adopted for the magnets and other strategic components *.

Engineering instabilities have two origins: mechanical and thermal. Major thermal issues are: - air conditioning presents a temperature ramp up of 2°C along the sector - storage ring requires a warm up period of 4 days for reaching a stable orbit These effects have been observed and corrected for 20 years. With EBS requirements; we need to identify these thermal effects in order to reduce the disturbances; thus improving more systematically the source stability. The study is lead by the comparison between the present and the new thermal system. To do so; it is necessary to evaluate the heat balance in this system; as well as to identify the thermal time constant of each component. FEA models have been performed to reveal sensitivity of these thermal issues. A full scale mock-up cell equipped with a prototype girder is measured with power cables inside.

The end station is a unique instrument with a bespoke cryogenically cooled multi-axis goniometer and a large curved Pilatus 12M detector in a high vacuum environment. As experiments become limited by radiation damage to the crystals; optimised strategies are needed to orient crystals in the most efficient way to obtain a complete dataset with a minimal X-ray dose. Two key factors affect the optimisation strategies. Firstly; shadowing on the detector by the goniometer resulting in data loss in this region and secondly; collisions between the goniometer and other components in the end station restricting the available angular range for sample centering and data collection.

At the APS-U the mag-net-to-magnet vibration tolerances are about 10 nm *. Timelines; installation requirements; and budgets constrain the resources available for prototyping and physical testing. Reliance on FEA to predict dynamic response is para-mount in insuring the tolerances are met. However; obtaining accurate results from a magnet support structure FEA is not as simple as analysing the CAD model of the structure. The 16th century author Nostradamus published a collection of prophecies that since his time; have been held up as predictions of various world events. While it is attractive to think his collection of short poems can be used to foretell the future; in reality it is only the vagueness and absence of any dates that make them easy to apply in a posthoc basis. Arguably; a similar statement can be made about the use of FEA in predicting accelerator support response. In this presentation the important contributors to FEA dynamic modelling will be discussed along with techniques that can be used to generate necessary data for models that can accurately predict response.; * APS-Upgrade; Functional Requirements Document; Advanced Photon Source; Argonne; IL; USA; APSU 1695659; May 2016.,"Funding: Argonne is managed by UChicago Argonne, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/weba01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/weba01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/weba01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-WEBA01,272

The thermal contact resistance of the eGaIn can be smaller than 0.1 mm2. K/W. The LCLS-II KB mirrors will be water cooled; and mostly dynamically bendable. The requirement on the bending accuracy can be expressed as residual slope error after the subtraction of the ideal ellipsoidal shape. This residual slope error should be smaller than 0.1rad; which is at least 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the mirror bent slope. Therefore; the mechanical constraint force from the eGaIn interface should be at least 4; and mostly 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the bending forces with the bending arm length comparable to the mirror length. But what is the mechanical constraint force of the eGaIn interface? What are the mechanical properties of the eGaIn in terms of Youngs or shear modulus. How should this eGaIn interface optimized; for instance the thickness of this interface?

Heat pipes and vapor chambers excel at precisely this so it is natural to consider them for the application. However; even though this technology has been proven to be an excellent thermal management solution for cooling everything from laptops to satellite shields in space; they have yet to be adopted for use in particle accelerators. The use of heat pipes and vapor chambers are thermal transport devices which work on the principle of capillary-force-driven two-phase flow. These devices are highly customizable and offer very high effective thermal conductivities (5; 000-200; 000 W/m/K) depending on many factors including size; shape; and orientation.

Located between the IVW high energy wiggler monochromator and POE1 wall, the total envelope size approximated 1m x 0.660m (LxW). Accommodating a smaller space required an alternative shutter design than traditionally used implemented at the CLS. The alternative proposed design combined the collimator (CLM), safety shutter (SSH), photon shutter (PSH) and Fixed Mask (FM) into one chamber. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted on the FM and PSH assembly to verify that geometric designs were adequate for reasonable operation in the beamline. FEA was used to determine the steady-state thermal and static-structural response in both operating positions. Missteer was analyzed for both operating positions to a maximum of 2.5mm (commonly accepted missteer used at the CLS) from center. Finally, two extreme position (5mm) analyses were completed for determination of potential, but unlikely operating conditions. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/wepe01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/wepe01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/wepe01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-WEPE01,309

In order to predict the transit time of the shock wave and the following pressure increase; a shock tube system with an inner diameter of 35 mm and a total length of 10 m was prepared to measure the shock Mach number. Experiments have been conducted that simulated an inrush of the atmosphere into the high-vacuum (~10-3 Pa) pipe by using a trigger system that combines of a thin cellophane diaphragm with a plunger. Special ionization gauges with a high-speed amplifier are distributed about every 1 m to detect the transit time of the shock wave and to measure the pressure in a low-pressure chamber after the actuation of the FCS system.

New state of the art light sources will have low emittance; high energy beams; which will give potential for higher beam losses. These losses will yield higher radiation dose rates at the downstream wall and stricter safety requirements in the first optical enclosure. Throughout the installation of local shields at NSLS-II; verification dose rate studies of various shielding configurations were performed. Analysis of these studies revealed that a circular outer bulk shield wall could greatly reduce the dose rate to the users who work near the front end optical components.

The energy resolution of the beamline was not meeting original specifications by several orders of magnitude. The monochromator; an in-focus VLS-PGM; is currently configured with a high and a medium-line-density grating. Experimental results indicated that both gratings were contributing to the poor energy resolution and this led to venting the monochromator to investigate. The initial suspicion was that a systematic error had occurred in the ruling process on the VLS gratings; but that proved to not be the case. Instead the problem was isolated to mechanical constraints used to mount the gratings into their respective side-cooled holders. Modifications were made to the holders to eliminate problematic constraints without compromising the rest of the design. Metrology performed on the gratings in the original and modified holders demonstrated a 20-fold improvement in the surface profile error which was consistent with finite element analysis performed in support of the modifications. Two gratings were successfully reinstalled and subsequent measurements with beam show a dramatic improvement in energy resolution.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/wepe14_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/wepe14.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/wepe14_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-WEPE14,336

When operating the cell; to separate the weak currents induced by the X-ray absorption process at the electrode in contact with the electrolyte (TEY signal) from the faradaic current set between the electrodes; the incoming beam must be chopped at a certain frequency (w). Then; using a lock in amplifier; the signal at this frequency w can be extracted and measured. When the chopper is located in the beam path; it produces pulses with a frequency w; modulating the TEY signal. The chopper developed at ALBA; with variable frequency; improves previous designs which used piezo-actuated choppers constrained to work at fixed oscillating frequencies**. The design consists of a slotted disk that spins around an axis by means of an UHV stepper motor. A LED and photodiode based UHV sensor ensures that frequency drifts do not affect the measurements.

A non-dispersive pair of bent Laue-type crystals is used; with the first crystal water-cooled. The monochromator operates at energies from 25 to 150 keV; and the maximum width of the beam is 190 mm at crystal location. The beam intensity is between 1013 and 1014 photons/s/mm2 under typical operating conditions. In normal mode of operation; if the first crystal is bend with 3 N*m and the second crystal with 2 N*m torque; the measured FWHM of the spectral bandwidth at 50 keV is 1%. With the improved design of the holding springs; the monochromator is quite insensitive to vibrations; it can operate with small turbo pump attached for medium resolution imaging at 20-50 keV. Due to high power loads; the system experiences high out-gassing and a proper filter set to protect the crystal and to reduce the thermal drift is required.

To define a secondary source; a specially-designed slit is located in the focal plane. The aperture is adjustable from 0 to 500 µm and a transverse movement allows scan of the whole slit at constant gap. A pair of tungsten cylinders act as slit blades; they are mounted on a support rotating around a vertical axis. The distance between the cylinders is fixed (500 µm); the actual beam aperture is the projection of the gap between the cylinders; defined by the rotation angle.

In order to increase the beam separation as well as to provide power filtering and higher harmonics rejection for the downstream optics; a dual mirror system with focusing capability is used as the first optic at approximately 28 m from the center of the straight section. The inboard mirror (2.6 mrad) reflects the inboard beam outboard while the outboard mirror (4.1 mrad) reflects the outboard beam inboard. The beam presented to the dual mirror system is defined by two 1 mm x 1 mm apertures. The maximum power absorbed by each mirror is 200 W. Two vertically deflecting monochromators with minimum offset of 17 mm are located in the First Optical Enclosure on the outboard branch. The monochromator for the inboard branch is located in the corresponding experimental station.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/wepe18_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/wepe18.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/wepe18_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-WEPE18,342

For the first time in the Synchrotron or FEL world; the large bending needed to focus the beam will be coupled with a cooling system; since the full FEL power is delivered through all of the optics to the sample. In this paper we will discuss the key design elements of the KB mirror system. We will cover the flexure hinge based bender mechanism which provides a well-defined axis of rotation. The flexure based twist and height correction mechanisms which allow correction for manufacturing and assembly tolerances. The parallel leaf spring lever arms which allow the use of relatively low bending forces with high resolution and do so while maintaining a constant direction of force application. The epoxy joint which was designed to minimize the tensile loading of the epoxy to increase its performance.

The setup for EMIL consists of two canted undulators; providing a wide energy spectrum of 70 - 10.000 eV; three monochromators (two plane grating monochromators and one LN2-cooled double crystal monochromator) and ten mirror chambers for radiation dispersion and focusing into two separate pathways of 65 m length. Split-mirror chambers distribute the desired photon energy to one (or simultaneously to two) of five experimental endstations. The maximum lateral distance between all beamline elements is not more than one meter. This narrow design; selectable monochromators and several beam crossings require advanced modification of all vacuum chambers to enable variable beam routes. Long pathways demand a very high mechanical and thermal stability as well as a reproducible motion of all optical elements. The chosen constant strut-length hexapod design for the mirror chambers provides a wide range of movement in six degrees of freedom.

Unlike the well-known transfocator devices the optical elements are randomly selectable. This enables a number of potential modes of operation; including the fine adjustment of focal length by adjusting the effective lens centre position when using CRLs or the use of some positions within the array to implement filters or reference foils. Actuation and guidance is achieved within the thickness of the element; so that the overall length of the device is minimised. The device has been in user operation on the I04 MX beamline at Diamond Light Source (DLS) since 2015. Another device is being assembled for use on the I11 beamline at DLS.

The fiber laser system; which is operated at 1030 nm fundamental wavelength; is capable of reaching up to 0.1 mJ pulse with a repetition rate of 400 kHz. A higher harmonic generation system enlarges the spectral range from UV to mid-infrared. To increase the laser power density at a sample position; the x-ray was additionally focused by a polycapillary lens (Polycapillary Optics; XOS). The synchronization of X-ray and laser pulses is based on the RF master clock of the storage ring.

The spectrometer with a length of 5 m is installed on a rotating girder platform and allows varying scattering angles from 30° to 130°. The position of the CCD detector is longitudinally adjustable on the girder and vertically adjustable on a moving frame to allow an angle between 2° to 15° in the vertical plane. In the scope of a CCD camera upgrade; the modification of the vertical alignment of the guiding structure and ultra-high vacuum tanks became necessary. The new camera with a higher resolution and larger detector size weights around 25 kg. It is required to have a vibration amplitude well below 2 micrometer. We will present the critical design parameters of the upgrade; and the effort to increase bending stiffness of vacuum guide structure while keeping major geometry parameters. In addition; kinematic overdeterminacy was removed. After the upgrade we performed vibration measurements verifying that dynamic stability of the camera is improved; and design goal is reached.

We report here on the technical design of the detector chamber which is placed below the magnet chamber and is also connected to the deposition chamber. Because of various constrains a sophisticated mechanics had to be developed to provide integrated functionality for both the detector holder and the sample transfer units. The detector unit consists of a tubular holder of 5 cm diameter which travels more than 60 cm vertically and exhibits an unlimited rotation degree of freedom of 360 degrees within the magnet bore. The sample transfer unit consists of a telescopic movement mechanism allowing for the sample holder vertical travel within the detector tubular holder.

The construction project for beamline 7.0.1 (BL7.0.1; COherent Scattering and MICroscopy (COSMIC)) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) consists of two branch lines; each of which has vertical and horizontal slit assemblies. These assemblies were fabricated from a preexisting design; positively impacting project schedule and budget. Apart from orientation; the slit assemblies are identical. The goal for parallelism is ± 2 microns over the full 25 mm length. The each slit blade edge can travel ± 5 mm about the beam center with the resolution of a micron; slits can scan over that range with a nominal size of about 10 microns.

Beamstops are usually confined inside a vacuum tube minimizing air space between the sample and the detector. For certain experiments; a motorized beamstop is required to achieve a precise positioning in different regions of the detector active area. ALBA has developed a new motorized beamstop* consisting of a two-rotation mechanism inside vacuum that composes a movement able to cover all range of the active area of the detector. The presented solution involves a main rotation reached by a gear and a worm drive actuated by a stepper motor and a second rotation relative to the main one produced by a piezo rotation stage. For each position appears two different solutions. This characteristic permits take two equivalent images in the detector with the same beamstop position but different orientation in the beamstop support; thus permitting the compensation of the support shadow on the active area of the detector.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/wepe40_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/wepe40.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/wepe40_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-WEPE40,378

Ultrashort x-ray pulses in the range of only a few up to several 100s of femtoseconds are so short that the exposure of a sample is over before x-ray-induced radiation damage effects can alter the atomic structure Therefore; a radiation dose far above the conventional radiation damage limits can be applied to a sample in a Â“diffraction before destructionÂ” approach. Therefore; with such femtosecond snapshots high-resolution diffraction data can be obtained from samples unperturbed by radiation damage effects. At the same time; data collection can be performed at room temperature; avoiding cryogenic conditions; which helps to keep biological samples close to their native conformation and allows for time-resolved studies of dynamical conformational behaviour.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/wepe44_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/wepe44.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/wepe44_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-WEPE44,

There are two main sources of X-ray scattering (besides the sample) that reach the detector; contribute to back-ground and limit data resolution. These are scattering within the collimator that escapes the exit aperture and air-scattering of the direct beam before it terminates in the beamstop. Scattering from the collimator can be reduced by decreasing the exit aperture size. A quad mini-beam collimator was built consisting of 5/50; 10/70; 20/100 and 150/300 µm beam defining/exit aperture combination; respectively. Previous collimators were positioned in the X-ray beam by two motorized translational motions and two manual angular adjustments via a kinematic mount.

medsi2016,,FRBA02,The Nanobender: A New X-Ray Mirror Bender With Nanometer Figure Correction,C. Colldelram; J. Nicolás; P. Pedreira; L. Ribó; C. Ruget; I. Sics; ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron; Cerdanyola del Vallès; Spain; J.M. Casalta Escuer; C. Martín-Nuño Gonzalez; A. Tomas Justribo; D. Úbeda Gonzalez; SENER; Cerdanyola del Vallès; Spain; Over time X-Ray mirrors are demanded for better focusing; closer to sample refocusing; spot size as well as better beam uniformity at sample position. Based on the experience of ALBA Phase I beam lines a new alter-native design of a mirror bender* is proposed. The system includes two main functionalities: the mirror bender mechanism and mirror figure error correc-tion. Both mechanisms are based on the introduction of a force constrain on the mirror surface instead of a geometrical one. As being based on a force mechanism they could reach high resolution and especially for the correctors which can achieve nanometre resolution. The correctors are designed to provide high force stability in the mirror side; eliminating the crosstalk between bending and figure correction; and minimizing the sensitivity to drifts. With such controlled deformation of the mirror substrate it is possible to obtain the desired surface figure not only to correct mirror figure errors but also to adapt it to the incident wavefront; thus becoming adaptive system. The mechanical solutions are presented which are able to correct mirror surfaces with a resolution of 1 nm reaching slope errors below 100 nrad.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/frba02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/frba02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/frba02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-FRBA02,413
medsi2016,,FRBA03,Design of the Diamond Light Source DMM for the VMXi Beamline,D.J. Butler; J.H. Kelly; DLS; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom; A Double Multilayer Monochromator (DMM) was designed in-house for the VMXi beam-line. This paper describes the novel engineering solutions employed to build a high stability instrument. PiezoMotor® actuators drive sine-arm Bragg axes for both optics providing the coarse and fine motion in a single actuator. The long translation of the second multilayer is driven externally via a linear shift to eliminate in-vacuum pipe & cable motions. A high stability air bearing translates the whole DMM across the two multilayer stripes. The optics are water cooled via an Indium / Gallium eutectic alloy bath to minimise coupled vibrations. The DMM is operational on the VMXi beam-line; experimental and performance data is presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/frba03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/frba03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/frba03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-FRBA03,420
medsi2016,,FRBA04,LCLS-II KB Mirror Systems: Technical Challenges and Solutions,L. Zhang; D. Cocco; N.M. Kelez; D.S. Morton; SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Based on the success of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; the Department of Energy has funded the LCLS-II - a billion-dollar project. In addition to the existing LCLS copper linac that delivers FEL pulses at 120 Hz; the LCLS-II project will provide a 4 GeV superconducting (SC) linear accelerator to deliver high-repetition-rate FEL pulses; up to 1 MHz. The average power of the FEL beam from the SC linac will range from 20 to 200 W; and potentially to 600 W. The FEL beam has ultra-short pulse length (down to a few fs); narrow energy band width (down to less than 10-4; thanks to self-seeding technology); and is fully coherent beam. The preservation of the wavefront is essential to maintain the outstanding FEL beam properties. In this paper; we will describe the technical challenge of the optics design to preserve the FEL beam wavefront. We will focus on the KB mirror system for LCLS-II instruments. We will especially discuss the aspects of cooling technology to minimize the thermal deformation and the management and minimization of the mechanical coupling between the mirror bending and the cooling.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/talks/frba04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/papers/frba04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2016/posters/frba04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2016-FRBA04,
