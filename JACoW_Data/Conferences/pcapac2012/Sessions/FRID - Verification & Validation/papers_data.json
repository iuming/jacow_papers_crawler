        "The analysis of most recent developments on high-performance software technologies suggests that new a design of distributed control systems (DCS) for particle accelerators may profit from solutions borrowed from cutting-edge Internet services. To fully profit from this new technologies the DCS model should be reconsidered",
        "thus leading to the definition of a new paradigm. In this paper we present the conceptual design of a new control system for a particle accelerator and associated machine data acquisition system (DAQ)",
        "based on a synergic combination of a non-relational key/value database (KVDB) and network distributed object caching (DOC). The use of these technologies",
        "to implement continuous data archiving and data distribution between components respectively",
        "brought about the definition of a new control system concept offering a number of interesting features such as a high level of abstraction of services and components and their integration in a framework that can be seen as a comprehensive control services provider for GUI applications",
        "front-end controllers",
        "measurement and feedback procedures etc."
