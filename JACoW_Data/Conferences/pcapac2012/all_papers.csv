pcapac2012,,WEKA01,The CSS Story,M.R. Clausen; J. Hatje; J. Penning; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; Control System Studio (CSS) is designed to serve as an integration platform for engineering and operation of todays process controls as well as machine controls systems. Therefore CSS is not yet another replacement of existing operator interfaces (OPI) but a complete environment for the control room covering alarm management; archived data displays diagnostic tools and last not least operator interfaces. In addition we decided to use CSS as the platform for the whole engineering chain configuring EPICS based process control databases; configuring and managing the I/O; editing state notation programs; configuring role based access rights and many more. Due to the ease of use of CSS as an Eclipse based product; we decided to use the CSS core also for all our stand alone processes. This helped us to reduce the diversity of running products/ processes and simplified the management. In this presentation we will describe our experience with CSS over the last two years. How we managed the transition from old displays to new ones; how we changed our alarm/ message philosophy and last not least which lessons we learned.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/weka01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/weka01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/weka01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-WEKA01,1
pcapac2012,,WEKA02,Evolution of Control Systems for Large Telescopes and Accelerators : A retrospective,BARC; Mumbai; India; Particle accelerators and telescopes are big instruments of experimental physics. Even though markedly different in design & construction; particle accelerators and telescopes complement each other in answering man's most profound questions on the nature and origin of universe. Today's particle accelerators are mammoth microscopes peering in to the structure and properties of building blocks of matter with ever larger energies or particle intensities. On the other hand; telescopes look outside in to the cosmos to ever greater distances and time. As they become bigger and more powerful; both accelerators and telescopes have been continuously pushing the frontiers of technology in all spheres- detectors & front-end electronics; control; communication and computing. This has resulted in electronics which is smaller; consume less power; faster; more accurate; more reliable and support higher capacities. In this keynote address; the speaker traces over two decades of association in building control and information systems for world's big telescopes such as GMRT (Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope; 90's) and MACE (Multiple Atmospheric Cerenkov Emission; today) in India and large particle accelerators such as LHC (90's) and FAIR (today).

pcapac2012,,WECC02,EPICS Channel Access Using WebSocket,Sokendai; Ibaraki; Japan; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; RIKEN Nishina Center; Wako; Japan; Web technology is useful as a means to widely inform of accelerators and beam status.　For this purpose; WebOPI[1] as to web-based system using Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) with EPICS was implemented by SNS. On the other hand; it is often necessary to perform the accelerator control from various locations as well as central control room during the beam operation and the maintenance.　However; it is not realistic to replace GUI-based operator interface (OPI) with Web-based system using Ajax technology because of interactive performance.　Therefore; as a next-generation OPI over the web using EPICS Channel Access (CA); we developed a client system based on WebSocket; which is a new protocol provided by Internet Engineering Task Force for Web-based system.　WebSocket is a web technology providing bi-directional; full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.　By utlizing Node.js and WebSocket access library named Socket. IO; a WebSocket server was implemented. As a result; Web-based client systems became available not only in the central control room but also with various types of equipment for accelerator operation.,,[1] http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/cs-studio/wiki/webopi,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/wecc02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/wecc02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/wecc02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-WECC02,7

Logging of system parameters at a faster rate plays a crucial role in analysing and understanding machine behaviour. Logging all the machine parameters consistently at the rate of typically more than 1 Hz has been the aim of a recent data logging system upgrade. Nearly ten thousand parameters are being logged at varying intervals of one second to one minute in Indus accelerator complex. The present logging scheme is augmented to log all these parameters at a rate equal to or more than 1 Hz. The database schema is designed according to data type of the parameter. The data is distributed into historical table and intermediate table comprising of recent data. Machine control applications read the parameter values from the control system and store them into the text-files of finite time duration for each sub-system. The logging application of each subsystem passes these text files to database for bulk insertion. The detail design of database; logging scheme and its architecture is presented in the paper.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/wepd01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/wepd01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/wepd01_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-WEPD01,12

The booster gets 20 MeV beam from Microtron; ramps up its energy to 450/550 MeV which is then extracted for injection in Indus-1/Indus-2. The ramping cycle repeats every second. For this; various magnet power supplies are fed with synchronous reference voltage & current waveforms and accordingly they feed the magnets with current waveforms of ~800 msec. A system was required to synchronously capture data of all power supplies to analyze changes on cycle to cycle basis. Global data acquisition system polling data at 1 Hz can't acquire sufficient points to do this. So a VME and PC based system has been developed for parallel and fast capture of data from 13 such power supplies. VME station has a CPU; 13 ADC cards and one control card. User can select- permit to capture; start delay; samples and time interval between samples. Advantages are' Isolated; simultaneous capturing on 13-channels; capturing synchronized with an event and selectable capturing-rate and samples.

It is in use at BARC-TIFR laboratory. The development was motivated by the growing demand for higher throughput in view of the increasing size of experiments. The VME based data acquisition system provides a powerful alternative to CAMAC standards on account of higher readout speeds (100 ns/word) resulting in reduced dead time. Further; high density VME modules are capable of providing up to 640 channels in a single VME crate with 21 slots. The software system LAMPS[1]; earlier developed for CAMAC based system and used extensively in our laboratory and elsewhere has been modified for the present VME based system. The system makes use of the VME library to implement Chain Block Transfer Readout (CBLT) and gives the option of both Polling and Interrupt mode to acquire data. Practical throughput of ~250 ns/word in zero-suppressed mode have been achieved. The developed software currently supports CAEN[2] V785 ADC; V775 TDC and V862 QDC and V830 Scalar Modules.

This operates with several filling modes such as 60; 240 and 320 bunches with 100mA or 40 bunches with 80mA at a positron beam energy of 6 GeV. The horizontal beam emittance is 1nmrad while a coupling of 1% amounts to a vertical emittance of 10pmrad. During a user run unscheduled beam dumps triggered by Machine Protection System may occur. In many cases the reason can be identified but in some it remains undetected. Though the beam is lost some signature is left in the ring buffers of the 226 BPM electronics where last 16384 turns just before the dump are available for post-mortem analysis. Scrutinizing turn by turn orbits and the frequency spectrum measured at a BPM can improve understanding of such a beam loss and may help to increase the efficiency of operation by eliminating the sources. Here we discuss in detail the functionality of a Java GUI used to investigate the reasons for unwanted dumps. In particular; the most effective corrector method is applied to identify correctors that might have perturbed the golden orbit leading to violations of the interlock limits.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/wepd22_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/wepd22.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/wepd22_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-WEPD22,43

The formulation begins with system parameter identification (Transfer function of the process); which was calculated by applying weighted-recursive least square method. The pole zero cancellation technique was applied to estimate PID controller parameters ;which in-turn results into the matched coefficients of the system parameters to the Controller parameters. An additional tuning parameters 'α' is proposed in our method; which provides an additional flexibility of tuning the response time of the controller without disturbing the controller parameters.

It synchronizes and controls the actions of up to 12 purpose-built slave cards; connected in a crate. Facility-wide synchronization is a core FAIR requirement and thus precise timing of SCU slave actions is of vital importance. The SCU consists primarily of two components; a daughter board with CPU and a carrier board with FPGA; interconnected by PCI Express. The CPU receives configuration and set values with which it programs the real-time event-condition-action (ECA) unit in the FPGA. The ECA unit receives event messages via the timing network; which also synchronizes clocks using White Rabbit. Matching events trigger actions on the SCU slave cards such as ramping magnets; triggering kickers; etc. Timing requirements differ depending on the action taken. For softer real-time actions; an interrupt can be generated for complex processing on the CPU. Alternatively; the FPGA can directly fire a pulse or bus operation. The delay and jitter achievable in each case differs and this paper examines their timing performance to determine which is appropriate for the required actions.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/wepd48_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/wepd48.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/wepd48_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-WEPD48,84

The PDP11; supplied with it; was replaced by an IBM PC running DOS before the accelerator was commissioned in 1989. The present system; commissioned in 1997 to include the LINAC; runs on a network of PCs under the GNU/Linux operating system. We have followed a distributed approach by grouping the signals; around 1000 in total; based on the location. Each group is connected to a server computer; by hardware interfaces like CAMAC; VME and custom hardware. The signals connected to each server PC are handled by a server program and they are accessible to the outside world; over a TCP/IP network; using a unique identifier consisting of a Label; Function and Unit. The features like a user interface; monitoring for alarm conditions; data logging and partial automation are handled by several client programs; communicating to multiple servers to access the hardware. The communication is done by passing a message packet and waiting for the reply. The message consists of the unique signal identifier and commands for setting/reading analog and digital parameter values. The development of the control system also resulted in low cost equipment for science education[1]. It also helped further development of the control system by additions like client programs in Python language. This feature enabled accelerator users to write simple scripts for tasks like setting the LINAC resonator parameters based on calculations; writing routines for partial automation etc. The system is cost effective; scalable and simple.

Additional resolution in the time domain gives insight in the temporal structure evolution and thus access to dynamics of processes allowing to understand functionality of devices and organisms and to optimize technological processes. Such time resolved dynamic analyses ofμsize structures became now possible by the new ultrafast tomography at the TopoTomo beamline of the synchrotron light source ANKA. At TopoTomo the whole experimental workflow has been significant improved in order to decrease the total duration time of a tomography experiment in a range of minutes. To aim the goal of a Tango based control system for ultra fast tomography with a data throughput of several 100 MB/s; detectors and computing infrastructure have been optimized.

We decided to move the system to a NoSQL key value database. We decided to use an open source database Memcached. This is a database that is high performance key-value cache optimized for speed only. For this reason we could use Memcached not for storing data; but as a channel of communication between front-end processors and consoles. The first object that we have installed is the camera system. We chose this class of elements because the amount of data is high; cameras are at least 640x480 with 8 bit. In this first installation we made some speed test: we increased the speed transfer and the data transfer is now independent from the number of high level CPUs that are using the same image. The success of this installation convinced us to bring the entire data transfer of SPARC control system to use Memcached as data server.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/thcb03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/thcb03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/thcb03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-THCB03,112

When the standard framework must deal with numerous 'foreign' elements it is often worthwhile to adopt a new framework; rather than 'disguising' such components with a wrapper. The DOOCS[1] and TINE[2] control system frameworks fall into this scenario. Both systems have a device server oriented view; which made early mapping attempts (~2001) immediately successful. Transparent communication; however; is but a small (albeit important) part of the control system merger currently taking place. Both systems have well-established central services (e.g. archiving and alarms); and possess a general 'culture' which might dictate to a large extent how something is actually 'done'. The long term goal of the DOOCS/TINE merger is to be able to make use of any tool; from either the DOOCS or TINE toolbox; on any control system element.

A typical high pressure measurement is carried out by placing the sample in the Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) with the sample located in a region of beam diameter within 50-100 μm. The X-Ray beam has to pass through the DAC to ensure maximum illumination of the sample with the X-Rays. An X-Y beam scanner/locater cum placement system is developed; which scans an area of 10 x 10 mm2 with resolution of 10 to 100 μm in rough scan mode and fine scans selected area with programmable resolution of 2.5 to 25 μm.

This depends on the actual situation and in which environment the system is operated. If you can rely on a scheduled downtime of the controlled system every week; reliability is defined in hours or weeks. In this case the system must run just longer than the scheduled downtime. If the system has to continuously operate for months and even years; your requirements are rising. In cases where continuous operations must be guaranteed even during software or hardware updates; redundant systems come into play. The hardware selection process is driven by basic requirements like 'no moving parts' or 'redundant power supplies'. This implies the selection of possible (fan-less) CPU boards with passive cooling. It also implies no hard discs and reduces therefore the selection of possible operating systems. Continuous operation during updates requires redundant controllers/ CPUs also in addition to redundant power supplies. The latter has a lot of impact on the software running inside the controllers. We will describe the selection process of the components we have chosen and summarize our experience of several years of operations.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/thpd02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/thpd02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/thpd02_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-THPD02,139

Search and Scram units which are controlled by PLC have been installed at different places inside the cell area. The operator of the accelerator has to clear all the units by pressing the secure button. Clearing each of the unit and pressing the button ensures that there is nobody left inside the cell after all the units are cleared. If someone remains trapped inside cell even after search and secure operation successfully performed; he can press any emergency button located on each of the Scram unit to switch off the accelerator immediately. The operation is time limited so if the operator fails to do the search operation in time; the entire system will get tripped and will require to the operator to do the entire operation again. This system generates HV ON enable signal. If any of the door is opened or Scram is pressed the HV supply switches off and radiation ceases off immediately.

pcapac2012,,THPD13,SocketCAN Device Support for EPICS IOCs,C. Burandt; U. Bonnes; J. Enders; M. Konrad; N. Pietralla; TU Darmstadt; Darmstadt; Germany; A large number of devices used at the S-DALINAC are controlled by IOCs running on standard personal computers via CAN bus (Controller Area Network). CAN interface controllers for PCs are commercially available from different manufacturers but although they all share the same basic functionality; most of them have a vendor-specific API. Moreover; traditional CAN drivers can usually be accessed by only one process at a time which avoids the use of sniffer programs for debugging. In contrast to that the SocketCAN network stack [1]; included in recent Linux kernels; provides access to the CAN bus via network devices (BSD sockets) which can be accessed by multiple applications at the same time via a vendor independent interface. A set of open source CAN drivers provides access to controllers of different vendors. This contribution describes an EPICS device support that makes use of the SocketCAN framework and thereby is independent from the API of a specific vendor. The device support has been used successfully in a production environment at the S-DALINAC since almost two years.,,[1] http://developer.berlios.de/projects/socketcan/,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/thpd13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/thpd13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/thpd13_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-THPD13,163

Advanced digital technologies allow development of control systems for RF applications. Digital LLRF system offers inherent advantages like flexibility; adaptability; good repeatability and low drift errors compared to analog system.

Properly sampling of down converted IF generates accurate feedback signal and eliminates the need of separate detector for amplitude and phase. Controller is implemented in Vertex-4 FPGA with proper control algorithm which offers fast correction with good accuracy and also controls the amplitude and phase in all four quadrants. Single I/Q modulator work as common correctors for both amplitude and phase. LO signal is derived from RF signal itself to achieve synchronization between RF; LO and FPGA clock.

The former arises in case of theorem proving approach due to the ingenuity involved in constructing a proof and the latter is encountered in model checking approach while carrying out composition of a large number of processes that constitute a typical distributed system. A combined approach of the above two methods has been devised that eventually considers the reachability in finite distributed system protocol model. It computes the reachability in backward traversal on the fly. Due to the complications in implementation; the Protocol Verification algorithm[1][2] is modified to reduce the number of states explored and hence the complexity of the algorithm.

pcapac2012,,FRCC04,Digital Pulse Processing Techniques for High Resolution Amplitude Measurement of Radiation Detector,P. Singhai; P. Dhara; A. Roy; VECC; Kolkata; India; HITK; Kolkata; India; The digital pulse processing techniques for high resolution amplitude measurement of radiation detector pulse is an effective replacement of expensive and bulky analog processing as the digital domain offers higher channel density and at the same time it is cheaper. We have demonstrated a prototype digital setup with high-speed sampling ADC with sampling frequency of 80-125 MHz followed by series of IIR filters for pulse shaping in a trigger-less acquisition mode. The IIR filters; peak detection algorithm and the data write-out logic was written on VHDL and implemented on FPGA. We used CAMAC as the read out platform. In conjunction with the full hardware implementation we also used a mixed-platform with VME digitizer card with raw-sample read out using C code. The rationale behind this mixed platform is to test out various filter algorithms quickly on C and also to benchmark the performance of the chip level ADCs against the standard commercial digitizer in terms of noise or resolution. The paper describes implementation of both the methods with performance obtained in both the methods.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/frcc04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/frcc04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/frcc04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-FRCC04,279

To fully profit from this new technologies the DCS model should be reconsidered; thus leading to the definition of a new paradigm. In this paper we present the conceptual design of a new control system for a particle accelerator and associated machine data acquisition system (DAQ); based on a synergic combination of a non-relational key/value database (KVDB) and network distributed object caching (DOC). The use of these technologies; to implement continuous data archiving and data distribution between components respectively; brought about the definition of a new control system concept offering a number of interesting features such as a high level of abstraction of services and components and their integration in a framework that can be seen as a comprehensive control services provider for GUI applications; front-end controllers; measurement and feedback procedures etc.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/frid01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/frid01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/frid01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-FRID01,282
pcapac2012,,FRCD02,"Process Control for Parallel Run of Two Helium Liquefiers at VEC Centre, Kolkata",S. Pal; U. Panda; VECC; Kolkata; India; WBSEDCL; India; Two helium liquefiers are working in tandem while one is always connected with the superconducting cyclotron. High pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) controls are necessary to maintain varying helium flow to the cold box. Since these two liquefiers share the same HP and LP pipelines; any pressure fluctuation due to rapid change in flow sometimes causes trip to the liquefiers. To overcome this problem there is a need for fast responsive HP control. Introduction of derivative gain in the PID loop for fast action is not desirable as it creates instability to the control system. This problem was rectified by introducing a novel control scheme based on the forced opening of the unloading valve to push back helium gas to buffer tank by changing the offset of PI control as a function of Buffer Tank pressure. A simulation using Matlab Simulink was performed initially to check the performance of pressure control loop. The same is implemented in the control loop of the new liquefier and an experiment was performed. The experimental results obtained will be discussed in the final paper.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/talks/frcd02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/papers/frcd02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2012/posters/frcd02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2012-FRCD02,285
