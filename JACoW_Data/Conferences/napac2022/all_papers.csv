This impose a great responsibility on the researchers and engineers developing, building and updating research facilities. Accelerator development are important research projects and will affect many stakeholders regardless if it is a smaller upgrade of an RF system or development of a large scale FEL. Wet developing new systems project management is a core competence for every laboratory. Yet this is a knowledge area often ignored in favor skill development in areas closer to physics and technology. This can be a very expensive mistake as the value of proper project management cannot be underestimated. This half day training will give you insight in the basics of projects.

napac2022,,SUZF1,Introduction to Systems Engineering Concepts,"Element Aero; Chicago; USA; Roddare; Lund; Sweden; Systems engineering has long been employed in defense and non-defense industries but not commonly in particle accelerator systems. The common definition of Systems Engineering is as follows ""It is a transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enable the successful realization; use; and retirement of engineered systems; using systems principles and concepts; and scientific; technological; and management methods."" This overview introduces participants to the fundamental principles of systems engineering and their application to the development of complex systems. Systems engineering helps address engineering challenges as well as how systems engineering is essential to project management. The overview will help the participant learn the language of methods and processes commonplace in industry. We will define the following through examples: systems; the systems development lifecycle; and methods of systems engineering; beginning with the system requirements. One example will be exploring a novel particle accelerator through systems engineering methods.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS",,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/suzf1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/suzf1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/suzf1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-SUZF1,

Downsizing of high energy large scaled accelerators by advanced technologies enables a variety of medical and industrial uses. One of the highlights is upgrade of sustainable supply chain of medical radioisotopes by the best mix of research reactors and accelerators. 99Mo/99mTc for diagnosis are going to be produced by low enriched U reactor and proton-cyclotron; electron rhodotron and electron linac. Moreover; the theranostics by 177Lu (beta) and 211At/225Ac (alpha) are going to be realized. Proton-cyclotron and electron linac are expected to produce them soon. This new affordable radiation therapy should play an important role in the IAEA project of Rays of Hopes. Next; proof-of-principle trails of on-site bridge inspection of the portable X-band (9.3 GHz) electron linac X-ray/neutron sources are under way. The technical guideline for the practical inspection is to be formed in a couple of years.

The crab cavity Radio Frequency (RF) system will inject low levels of noise to the crabbing field; generating transverse emittance growth and potentially limiting luminosity lifetime. In this work; we estimate the transverse emittance growth rate as a function of the Crab Cavity RF noise and quantify RF noise specifications for reasonable performance. Finally; we evaluate the possible mitigation of the RF noise induced emittance growth via a dedicated feedback system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/moyd3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/moyd3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/moyd3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOYD3,6

Due to the detector solenoid in the interaction region; the design horizontal crabbing angle will be coupled to the vertical plane if uncompensated.

The hybrid scheme consists of modular chromatic matching of periodic systems and beamlines. The first-order chromatically matched solutions are linearly parameterized with the local linear chromaticities that control the higher order chromatic beatings. The parameterization enables an efficient optimization of dynamic aperture. As a result; we successfully achieve the 1% design criterion for the momentum aperture in the ring.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/moyd6_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/moyd6.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/moyd6_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOYD6,

We propose here an injector which can; in principle; generate electron bunches at the same rate as the operating RF frequency. A conduction-cooled superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity operating in the CW mode and housing a field emission element at its region of high axial electric field can be a viable method of generating high-repetition-rate electron bunches. In this paper; we report the development and experiments on a conduction-cooled Nb3Sn cavity with a niobium rod intended as a field emitter support. The initial experiments demonstrate ~0.4 MV/m average accelerating gradient; which is equivalent of peak gradient of 3.2 MV/m. The measured RF cavity quality factor is 1.4 × 108 slightly above our goal. The achieved field gradient is limited by the relatively low input RF power and by the poor coupling between the external power supply and the RF cavity. With ideal coupling the field gradient can be as high as 0.6 MV/m still below our goal of about 1 MV/m,Funding: The project is supported by DOE HEP Accelerator Stewardship award to Fermilab and Northern Illinois University,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/moye3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/moye3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/moye3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOYE3,16

During the 2018 production run; the DTL began to intermittently break down; leading to a series of root cause investigations. These analyses included eliminating the usual suspects: vacuum leak; debris in tank; driveline window; power coupler; etc. The throttling back of repetition rate from 120 to 60 Hz allowed continued production with a diminished beam; one that reduced neutron flux to three experimental areas. During the annual shutdown in 2019; a more thorough investigation involving the use of x-ray detection; high-resolution cameras and IR detection through site glass windows was performed. After a tenacious search; a 30 cm long crack was discovered in a weld at one of the ion pump port grates. Inaccessibility for welding from the outside and in a confined space; non-intrusive repairs were tried first but were unsuccessful. Ultimately; an expert welder entered the tank to weld the crack under unfamiliar welding conditions.

Plasma processing is a common technique for removing hydrocarbons from surfaces; which increases the work function and reduces the secondary emission coefficient. Unlike helium processing which relies on ion bombardment of the field emitters; plasma processing uses free oxygen produced in the plasma to break down the hydrocarbons on the surface of the cavity. The initial focus of the effort was processing C100 cavities by injecting RF power into the HOM coupler ports. Results from processing cryomodule in the cryomodule test bunker as well as vertical test results will be presented. We plan to start processing cryomodules in the CEBAF tunnel within the next year. The goal will be to improve the operational gradients and the energy margin of the linacs.

Free-electron laser coupling in a magnetic undulator is one of the best options for radiation generation in this frequency range; but slippage effects require the use of relatively long and low current electron bunches to drive the THz FEL; limiting amplification gain and output peak power. Here we use a circular waveguide in a 0.96 m strongly tapered helical undulator to match the radiation and e-beam velocities; allowing resonant energy extraction from an ultrashort 200 pC 5.5 MeV electron beam over an extended distance. E-beam energy measurements; supported by energy and spectral measurement of the THz FEL radiation; indicate an average energy efficiency of ~ 10%; with some particles losing > 20% of their initial kinetic energy.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/mozd2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/mozd2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/mozd2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOZD2,30

The attosecond 370 eV pump pulse is first generated via the Enhanced Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ESASE) method; then the attosecond 740 eV probe pulse is produced by re-amplifying the electron beam microbunching after the magnetic chicane. Due to the harmonic amplification; the minimal delay between pump-probe pulse pairs (limited by slippage between the light field and the electron bunch) can be shorter than 1 femtosecond. We use the angular streaking technique to measure temporal delays between pump/probe pulse pairs at multiple beamline configurations. When the delay chicane is turned off; the averaged delay is increased by ~150 attoseconds by adding one undulator module for probe pulses. Long delays can be set up by turning the delay chicane on. These experimental results are in agreement with start-to-end XFEL simulations. Looking toward future experiments; our sub-femtosecond pump/probe technique can be applied to observe electronic charge dynamics in molecular systems.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/mozd3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/mozd3.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/mozd3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOZD3,

November 2001.","Linear induction accelerators (LIAs) such as the DARHT at Los Alamos National Laboratory make use of the beam envelope equation to simulate the beam and design experiments. Accepted practice is to infer beam parameters using the solenoid scan technique with optical transition radiation (OTR) beam profiles. These scans are then analyzed with an envelope equation solver to find a solution consistent with the data and machine parameters (beam energy, current, magnetic field, and geometry). The most common code for this purpose with flash-radiography LIAs is xtr [1]. The code assumes the machine parameters are perfectly known and that beam profiles will follow a normal distribution about the best fit and solves by minimizing a chi-square-like metric. We construct a Bayesian model of the beam parameters allowing maching parameters, such as solenoid position, to vary within reasonable uncertainty bounds.

It focuses on energy-saving measures in accelerators; including permanent magnets; energy recovery; and superconductors; it has thus been referred to as a green accelerator. CBETA has become the world’s first Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) that accelerates through multiple turns and then recovers the energy in SRF cavities though multiple decelerating turns. The energy is then available to accelerate more beam. It has also become the first accelerator that operates 7 beams in the same large-energy aperture Fixed Field Alternating-gradient (FFA) lattice.

napac2022,,MOZE1,Demonstration of High-Gradient in a Cryo-Cooled X-Band Structure,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; We present an experimental demonstration of the high-gradient operation of an X-band; 11.424 GHz; 20-cells linear accelerator (linac) operating at a liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K. The tested linac was previously processed and tested at room temperature. Low-temperature operation increases the yield strength of the accelerator material and reduces surface resistance; hence a great reduction in cyclic fatigue could be achieved resulting in a large reduction in breakdown rates compared to room- temperature operation. Furthermore; temperature reduction increases the intrinsic quality factor of the accelerating cavities; and consequently; the shunt impedance leading to increased RF-to-beam efficiency and beam loading capabilities. We verified the enhanced accelerating parameters of the tested accelerator at cryogenic temperature using different measurements including electron beam acceleration up to a gradient of 150 MV/m; corresponding to a peak surface electric field of 375 MV/m. We also measured the breakdown rates in the tested structure showing a reduction of 2 orders of magnitude compared to their values at room temperature for the same accelerating gradient.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/moze1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/moze1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/moze1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOZE1,

A piezoelectric actuator with a resonance control algorithm can maintain the cavity frequency at the nominal level thus reducing the RF power. This study uses a double lever tuner with a piezoelectric actuator for compensation and another piezoelectric actuator to simulate the effects of the Lorentz force pulse.

In periods of joint operation; when both machines contain high intensity beam; radiative beam losses from MI and RR overlap on the enclosure’s beam loss monitoring (BLM) system; making it difficult to attribute those losses to a single machine. Incorrect diagnoses result in unnecessary downtime that incurs both financial and experimental cost. In this work; we introduce a novel neural approach for automatically disentangling each machine’s contributions to those measured losses. Using a continuous adaptation of the popular UNet architecture in conjunction with a novel data augmentation scheme; our model accurately infers the machine of origin on a per-BLM basis in periods of joint and independent operation.

LCLS-II will accelerate a 30 µA electron beam with a 1 MHz bunch rate with a new superconducting Continuous Waveform (CW) RF accelerator. The Average Current Monitor (ACM) is part of the Beam Containment System (BCS) for the LCLS-II accelerator. The Beam Containment System is a safety system that provides paths to safely shut the accelerator beam off under a variety of conditions. The Average Current Monitor is a beam diagnostic within the BCS that is used to verify that the accelerator is producing the appropriate current level and to limit beam power to allowed values to protect the machine and beam dumps. The average beam current is obtained by measuring the power level induced by the beam in a low Q cavity. By knowing the Q; the beta; and the coupling of the cavity; the instantaneous charge can be calculated; then integrating the instantaneous charge over one millisecond will yield the average current.

For CEC; the beam noise results in additional diffusion that counteracts cooling. In SASE FELs; a microwave instability starts from the initial noise in the beam and eventually leads to the beam microbunching yielding coherent radiation; and the initial noise in the FEL bandwidth plays a useful role.

Providing stable intensity; energy; and emittance is key since it directly affects downstream machines. To operate high current beam; accelerators must minimize uncontrolled particle loss; this is generally accomplished by minimizing beam emittance. Ambient temperature and humidity variations are known to affect resonance frequency of the accelerating cavities which induces emittance growth. In addition; the energy and phase space distribution of particles emerging from the ion source are subject to fluctuations. To counter these effects we are working on implementing dynamic longitudinal parameter optimization based on Machine Learning (ML).

These conductors are REBCO tape conductors; which can be wound into coils with no reaction after winding; and BISSCO cable conductors; which require reaction after winding and insulation after reaction in a process similar to Nb3Sn cables. Both conductors are expensive and the process after reacting is expensive. Some unknown factors that remain: Will either conductor degrade in current carrying capacity with repeated cycling like Nb3Sn cables do? The other two issues are problems for both types of HTS conductors and they are; 1) quench protection in the event of a normal region run-away and 2) dealing with the superconducting magnetization inherent with HTS cables and tapes.

This circuit; which is comprised of a series configuration of IGBT-based subcircuits; is suitable for driving the high-power vacuum-tube amplifiers that are typically used in RF accelerator systems. Each subcircuit can switch up to 3 kV; and the subcircuits can be stacked in series to extend the overall voltage capabilities of the switch. The circuit is designed to prevent overvoltaging any single transistor during switching transients or faults; regardless of the number of series subcircuits. Further; the circuit also includes the capability for rapid arc detection and suppression. Testing has shown effective switching at up to 100 A at 12 kV and for pulse repetition frequencies and durations in the range of 1-200 Hz and 10-50 µs; respectively. Additionally; the arc suppression circuitry has been shown to reliably limit arcs at 8-12 kV with a quench time of <1 µs and with a total energy of <0.2 J; minimizing the grid erosion in the vacuum-tube during an arc.,,reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/mopa61_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/mopa61.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/mopa61_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOPA61,179

However; flat beams are devastating at low energies due to space charge forces which are significantly enhanced in one plane. The same is true; although to a lesser degree; for non-symmetric elliptical beams. In order to mitigate this effect; circular mode beam optics can be used.

High (Q0) decreases the capital required to keep accelerators cold by reducing power loss. The performance of SRF cavities is largely governed by the surface composition of the first 100 nm of the cavity surface. Impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen have been observed to yield high Q0; but their precise roles are still being studied. Here; we compare the performance of cavities doped with nitrogen and oxygen in terms of fundamental material properties to understand how these impurities affect performance.

The cavity was designed to minimize the risk of cathode efficiency degradation due to multipacting or field emission and to operate with a high RF electric field at the cathode for low electron-beam emittance. Cavity design features include: (1) shaping of the cavity wall to reduce the strength of the low-field coaxial multipacting barrier; (2) four ports for electropolishing and high-pressure water rinsing; and (3) a fundamental power coupler (FPC) port located away from the accelerating gap. The design is oriented toward minimizing the risk of particulate contamination and avoid harmful dipole components in the RF field. The ANL 162 MHz FPC design for PIP-II is being adapted for the gun cavity. We will present the RF design of the cavity integrated with the FPC. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/mopa85_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/mopa85.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/mopa85_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOPA85,245

Such barriers may be troublesome; as RF conditioning with a fundamental power coupler (FPC) of typical coupling strength (external Q = 106 to 107) is generally difficult. For the FRIB \beta = 0.085 QWRs (80.5 MHz); the low barrier is observed at an accelerating gradient (Eacc) of ~10 kV/m; the operating Eacc is 5.6 MV/m. Theoretical and simulation studies suggested that the conditioning is difficult due to the relatively low RF power dissipated into multipacting rather than being a problem of the low barrier being stronger than other barriers. We developed a single-stub coaxial FPC matching element for external adjustment of the external Q by one order of magnitude. The matching element provided a significant reduction in the time to condition the low barrier. We will present theoretical and simulation studies of the low MP barrier and experimental results on MP conditioning with the single-stub FPC matching element.,"Funding: This is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science under Cooperative Agreement DE-SC0000661, the State of Michigan and Michigan State University.",reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/mopa86_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/mopa86.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/mopa86_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-MOPA86,249

An SRF gun is the most suitable injector for the high-energy upgrade of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS-II-HE); which will produce high-energy X-rays at high repetition rate. An SRF gun is being developed for LCLS-II-HE as a collaborative effort by FRIB; HZDR; ANL; and SLAC. The cavity operating frequency is 185.7 MHz; and the target accelerating field at the photocathode is 30 MV/m. The photocathode is replaceable. The cathode is held by a fixture (’cathode stalk’) that is designed for thermal isolation and particle-free cathode exchange. The stalk must allow for precise alignment of the cathode position; cryogenic or room-temperature cathode operating temperature; and DC bias to inhibit multipacting.

With requirements for improved stability; performance and user controls there was a need to upgrade the analog LLRF controller. The FRIB radio frequency (RF) group designed; developed and fabricated a new digital LLRF controller; with high-speed serial interface between system on chip field programmable gate array and fast data converters and capable of high frequency direct sampling; to meet the requirements of 644 MHz SC cavity and 1.013 GHz UEM RT cavity.

Plasma cleaning is being developed as a method to mitigate possible future degradation of QWR or HWR performance: in-situ plasma cleaning represents an alternative to removal and disassembly of cryomodules for refurbishment of each cavity via repeat etching and rinsing. Initial measurements were done on a QWR and an HWR with room-temperature-matched input couplers to drive the plasma via the fundamental mode. Subsequent plasma cleaning tests were done on two additional FRIB QWRs using the fundamental power coupler (FPC) to drive the plasma. When using the FPC; a higher-order mode (HOM) at 5 times the accelerating mode frequency was used to drive the plasma. Use of the HOM allowed for less mismatch at the FPC and hence lower field in the coupler relative to the cavity. A neon-oxygen gas mixture was used for plasma generation. Before and after cold tests showed a significant reduction in field emission X-rays after plasma cleaning.

napac2022,,TUXD1,Radiation Concerns and Mitigation Schemes for Accelerator Facility Components,Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Major accelerator facilities are limited in beam power not by their accelerators but by the beam intercepting device survivability. In some cases; the target must endure high power pulsed beam; leading to high cycle thermal shocks. Most of the time; the increased beam power creates significant challenges such as corrosion and radiation damage that causes harmful effects on the material and degrades their mechanical and thermal properties during irradiation. This can eventually lead to the failure of the material and drastically reduced lifetime of targets and beam intercepting devices. In order to operate reliable beam-intercepting devices in the framework of energy and intensity increase projects of the future; it is essential to develop a strong R&D program and have synergy with various expertise. Based on those strong R&D programs; several ways exist to mitigate radiation damage in material in order to increase lifetime of targets in accelerators.

To investigate the degradation of 1; 4-dioxane and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); widespread in wastewater and potential to be regulated in near future [1]; a beamline for electron-beam irradiation has been designed; installed and successfully commissioned at the UITF. A solenoid with a peak axial magnetic field of up to 0.28 T and a raster were used to obtain a Gaussian beam profile with a transverse standard deviation of ~15 mm. It was applied to irradiate 1; 4-dioxane sample filled in the target cell that was designed to let the entire sample receive significant irradiation doses. The dose distribution and absorbed dose; few studied in the existing publications; are necessary measures for the degradation mechanism investigation and have been innovatively achieved in this work using simulations; which were calibrated with opti-chromic dosimeter rods directly exposed to the electron beam.

As a result; there is a national need for new radioisotopes and ways to produce them. A computer program was created that evaluates the daughters for all known reactions of projectiles (gamma rays; protons or neutrons) with every stable target isotope by comparing the cross-sections for each reaction at a desired energy; and outputs a list of the potential daughter isotopes that are most likely to be generated. The program then evaluates the decay chains of these daughters to provide a list of the possible decay chains that contain the radioisotope of interest. By knowing the daughter production and decay chain for each isotope; it is possible to go from the desired radioisotope to the stable isotope that can be used as a target for its production. This project would facilitate the search for new pathways to creating useful theranostic isotopes.,"Funding: LR was supported by the U.S. NSF REU at Old Dominion University Grant No. 1950141.

This unique performance is realized by the use of a chromatic imaging system; which consists of four quadrupole lenses [1]. Chromatic imaging systems have a mono-energetic focal length. That means; if a target with areas of different energy losses is to be investigated; it is only possible to focus on one proton energy leaving other areas of interest blurred. A simple method of focusing multiple energies at once and thus increasing the depth-of-field is the use of multiple detector stations along the beam axis. Proton images captured at downstream detector positions can be combined into a single image using a method called ’focus stacking’. A complete cancellation of the position- and energy dependent 2nd order chromatic aberrations that mostly affect the current image quality of pRad [2] is only possible by using an achromatic imaging system. Following the proposals in early design studies at LANSCE [3] a new prototype achromatic system is currently being developed for a 25 MeV S-band electron accelerator.; *LA-UR-22-24725  [1] N.

In conventional electron sources the energy spread is limited by the emission process and typically on the order of a fraction of an eV. State-of-the-art energy resolution can only be achieved after significant losses in the monochromatization process. Here we propose to take advantage of photoemission from ultrashort laser pulses (~40 fs) so that after a longitudinal phase space manipulation that trades pulse duration for energy spread; the energy spread can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude. The scheme uses two RF cavities to accomplish this goal and can be implemented on a relatively short (~ 1m) beamline.

A new injector proposed for the LCLS-II HE is an example of this revolution; with the goal of increasing the photon energy achievable by LCLS-II to over 20 keV. We must now ask; what is the optimal cathode; temperature; and laser combination to enable this injector? There are many competing requirements. The cathode must be robust enough to operate in a superconducting injector; and must not cause contamination of the injector. It must achieve sufficient charge at high repetition rate; while minimizing the emittance. The wavelength chosen must minimize mean transverse energy while maintaining tolerable levels of multi-photon emission. The cathode must be capable of operating at high (~30 MV/m) gradient; which puts limits on both surface roughness and field emission.

A six orders of magnitude improvement [1] in the non-linear yield of metals has been experimentally demonstrated through this type of nanopatterning. Further; nanoscale lens structures may focus light below its free-space wavelength offering multiphoton photoemission from a region near 10 times smaller [2] than that achievable in typical photoinjectors. In this proceeding; we report on our efforts to characterize the brightness of two plasmonic cathode concepts: a spiral lens and a nanogroove array. We demonstrate an ability to engineer and fabricate nanoscale patterned cathodes by comparing their optical properties with those computed with a finite difference time domain (FDTD) code. The emittance and nonlinear yield of the cathodes are measured under ultrafast laser irradiation.

A key figure of merit for these applications is the electron beam brightness; which is inversely proportional to MTE. MTE can be limited by nanoscale surface roughness. Recently; we have demonstrated physically and chemically smooth Cs3Sb cathodes on Strontium Titanate (STO) substrates grown via co-deposition technique. Such flat cathodes could result from a more ordered growth. In this paper; we present RHEED data of co-deposited Cs3Sb cathodes on STO. Efforts to achieve epitaxial growth of Cs3Sb on STO are then demonstrated via RHEED. We find that films grown epitaxially on substrates like STO and SiC (previously used to achieve single crystalline Cs3Sb) exhibit QE higher than the polycrystalline Cs3Sb cathodes; by an order of magnitude below photoemission threshold. Given the larger QE; lower laser fluence could be used to extract high charge densities; thereby leading to enhanced beam brightness.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/tuyd5_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/tuyd5.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/tuyd5_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-TUYD5,289

The outstanding issue in practical quantum computing today is scaling up the system while maintaining interconnectivity of the qubits and low error rates in qubit operations to be able to implement error correction and fault-tolerant operations. Trapped ion qubits offer long coherence times that allow error correction. However; error correction algorithms require large numbers of qubits to work properly. We can potentially create many thousands (or more) of qubits with long coherence states in a storage ring. For example; a circular radio-frequency quadrupole; which acts as a large circular ion trap and could enable larger scale quantum computing.

Useful virtual accelerators rely on efficient and effective methodologies grounded in theory; simulation; and experiment. This paper uses an algorithm called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy); which has not previously been applied to beam physics. We believe the SINDy methodology promises to simplify the optimization of accelerator design and commissioning; particularly where space charge is important. We show how SINDy can be used to discover and identify the underlying differential equation system governing the beam moment evolution. We compare discovered differential equations to theoretical predictions and results from the PIC code WARP modeling.

The simulation set consists of a 3D electrostatic/magnetostatic simulation coupled to a 2D XY slice solver that propagates the beam through the proposed accelerator lattice for Scorpius; a next-generation flash X-ray radiography source. These simulations focus on the growth of azimuthal modes in the beam (e.g. Diocotron instability) that arise when physical ring distributions manifest in the beam either due to electron optics or solenoidal focusing and transport. The saturation mechanism appears to lead to the generation of halo particles and conversion down to lower mode numbers as the width of the ring distribution increases. The mode growth and saturation can contribute to the generation of hot spots on the target as well possible azimuthal asymmetries in the radiograph. Simulation results are compared to linear theory and tuning parameters are investigated to mitigate the growth of azimuthal modes in the Scorpius electron beam.; * LLNL-ABS-830595; Approved for public release.

napac2022,,TUZE6,Studies of Ion Instability Using a Gas Injection System,J.R. Calvey; M. Borland; L. Emery; P.S. Kallakuri; ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; Ion trapping occurs when a negatively charged beam ionizes residual gas inside an accelerator vacuum chamber; and the resulting ions become trapped in the beam potential. Trapped ions can cause a variety of undesirable effects; including coherent instability and incoherent emittance growth. Because of the challenging emittance and stability requirements of next generation light sources; ion trapping is a serious concern. To study this effect at the present APS; a gas injection system was designed and installed at two different locations in the ring. The system creates a controlled and localized pressure bump of nitrogen gas; so the resulting ion instability can be studied. Measurements were taken under a wide variety of beam conditions; using a spectrum analyzer; pinhole camera; and bunch-by-bunch feedback system. The feedback system was also used to perform grow-damp measurements; allowing us to measure the growth rate of individual unstable modes. This paper will present some of the results of these experiments.

Usually this is achieved by beam-based alignment (BBA). Assuming the quadrupole strength can be changed individually; one finds the BPM reading where changing a quadrupole’s strength does not alter the closed orbit. Since most quadrupoles are powered in series; they can only be varied independently if costly power supplies are added. For the EIC electron storage ring (ESR); we investigate whether sextupole BBA can be used instead. Individually powered sextupole BBA techniques already exist; but most sextupoles are powered in families and cannot be individually changed. We therefore developed a method where a localized bump changes the beam excursion in a single sextupole of a family; turning off all families that also have sextupoles in the bump. The bump amplitude at which the sextupole does not cause a closed orbit kick determines the sextupole’s alignment. This study was made to investigate the precision to which this method can be utilized.,,reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/tupa17_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/tupa17.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/tupa17_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-TUPA17,378

Significant bunch lengthening is observed in the PAR at high charge; which negatively affects beam capture in the booster.

A new 10-kW harmonic rf solid-state amplifier (SSA) was installed in 2021 to raise the gap voltage and improve bunch compression. The SSA has been operating reliably.

We find that such models can sometimes detect trip precursors in PS currents; voltages; and in the temperatures of magnets; capacitors and transistors (components of PSs).,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/tupa29_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/tupa29.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/tupa29_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-TUPA29,413

napac2022,,TUPA32,SCU Ends Configured as Phase Shifter,ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; Dipole correctors and phase shifters are usually needed in the interspace of a permanent magnet (PM)-based undulator array for purposes of beam steering and phase matching when the field strength is changing. Unlike the PM-based undulators; the superconducting undulator (SCU) can change its end field with the help of varying currents in the end coils. By setting the end coil currents the beam-steering and the phase-matching could be realized; thus eliminating the need for standalone correctors and phase shifters; saving the interspace as well as reducing the mechanical complexity of an undulator array. We developed a procedure for determining the SCU end coil currents and verified it by numerical simulations. The procedure as well as the simulation results are described in this paper.,"Funding: Work supported by LDRD funding from Argonne National Laboratory, provided by the Director, Office of Science, of the U.S. DOE under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.",reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/tupa32_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/tupa32.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/tupa32_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-TUPA32,420

An ANSYS calculated magnetic field was benchmarked with the measured field profile of existing SCUs. This paper presents calculations of magnetic field and field integrals of 0.5-m-long and 1.0-m-long planar SCUs with a new end correction scheme.

More or less; the fine tunability of the laser parameters are of extreme importance as we try to model further applications of the photoinjector. The laser pulse incident on the photocathode critically affects the electron bunch 3D phase space. Parameters such as the laser pulse transverse shape; total energy; and temporal profile must be controlled independently; any laser pulse variation over both short and long-time scales also requires correction. The ability to produce arbitrary laser intensity distributions enables better control of electron bunch transverse and longitudinal emittance by affecting the space-charge forces throughout the bunch. In an accelerator employing a photoinjector; electron optics in the beamline downstream are used to transport; manipulate; and characterize the electron bunch. The adjustment of the electron optics to achieve a desired electron bunch at the interaction point is a much better understood problem than laser adjustment; so this research emphasizes laser shaping.,,reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/tupa41_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/tupa41.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/tupa41_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-TUPA41,441

The task of replacing RICE was challenging because of its technology (late 1960’s); number of channels (>10; 000); unique characteristics (all-modules data takes; timed/flavored data takes) and that it was designed as an integral part of the whole accelerator. We discuss the history; RICE integral architecture; upgrade efforts; and the new system providing cutting-edge capabilities. The boundary condition was that upgrades only could be implemented during the annual four-month accelerator maintenance outage. This led to a multi-phased project which turned out to be about an 11-year effort.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/tupa62_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/tupa62.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/tupa62_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-TUPA62,482

Among the possible replacement topologies is the High Voltage Converter Modulator (HVCM); originally designed at LANSCE for use at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS); to be used as a pulsed high-voltage power supply for klystron-based RF transmitters. The HVCM topology uses high frequency transformers with resonant LC networks for efficient energy conversion and a frequency dependent gain; which permits the use of frequency modulation as a control variable to afford pulse flattening and excellent regulation as demonstrated at SNS.

The isotope mass differences translate directly to a spread in momentum; dp; relative to the design momentum p0. Momentum spread is converted to spread in the horizontal arrival location dx at a target chamber by the dispersion of the dipole magnet: dx = D(s)dp/p0. By placing a thin slit leading to a collection chamber at a location xc specific isotope mass is isolated by adjusting the dipole magnet strength or the beam energy. The arriving beam current at xc is associated with average isotope atomic mass; giving an isotope mass spectrum I(m) measured in mA. Although the EMIS is a compact system (5 m) setting up and automatically running at an optimal isotope separation profile I(m) profile is challenging due to time-variation of the complex source as well as un-modeled disturbances.

The ability to measure phase and amplitude of pulsed RF systems at accuracies of ± 0.1 degrees and ± 0.1 percent required for our systems is difficult; and custom-designed circuitry is required. The digital low-level RF upgrade at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center is continuing to progress with improved cavity phase measurements. The previous generation of the cavity phase and amplitude measurement system has a phase ambiguity; which requires repeated calibrations to ascertain the correct phase direction. The new phase measurement system removes the ambiguity and the need for field calibration while improving the range and precision of the cavity phase measurements.

Compared to the performance of the conventional C-chicane bunch compressor; the double C-chicane scheme exhibits the capability of utilizing the transverse momentum shift induced by the coherent synchrotron radiation in the second C-chicane to compensate that generated in the first C-chicane; resulting in a compressed electron bunch with minimized transverse momentum shift along the beam. It is also found that the double C-chicane scheme can be designed to significantly better preserve the beam emittance in the course of the bunch compression.

A primarily bunched electron beam from an inductive output tube (IOT) at 710 MHz first enters an idler cavity; where the longitudinal slope of the beam energy distribution is reversed. The beam then transits through an EPD section implemented by a short beam pipe with a negative high voltage bias; inside which the rate of increase of the first harmonic current is significantly enhanced.

This is an important effect for all applications where the projected energy spread is important. In particular; for time-resolved single shot electron microscopy; it is critical to keep the beam energy spread below 1·10-4 to avoid chromatic aberrations in the lenses. Higher harmonic RF cavities can be used to compensate for the RF-induced longitudinal phase space nonlinearities. Start-to-end simulations suggest that this type of compensation can reduce energy spread to the 1·10-5 level.

Concepts such as the ultra-compact free electron laser (UC-XFEL) and the Cool Copper Collider (C3) plan to obtain these gradients through the cryogenic operation (<77K) of normal conducting copper cavities. Breakdown rates; the most significant gradient limitation; are significantly reduced at these low temperatures; but the precise physics is complex and involves many interacting effects. High-power RF breakdown measurements at cryogenic temperatures are needed at the less explored C-band frequency (5.712 GHz); which is of great interest for the aforementioned concepts. On behalf of a large collaboration of UCLA; SLAC; LANL; and INFN; the first C-band cryogenic breakdown measurements will be made using a LANL RF test infrastructure.

It provides access to significantly higher accelerating gradients than traditional radio-frequency cavities. One impediment to realizing a DWA-powered accelerator is the issue of the transverse stability of the beams within the dielectric structure due to short-range wakefields. These short-range wakefields have a tendency to induce a phenomenon known as single-bunch beam breakup; which acts as its name implies and destroys the relevant beam. We attempt to solve this issue by leveraging the quadrupole mode excited in a planar dielectric structure and then alternating the orientation of said structure to turn an unstable system into a stable one.

One challenge to using transfer maps is to properly include radiation effects. The effect of radiation can be divided into deterministic and stochastic parts. While computation of the deterministic effect has been previously reported; handling of the stochastic part has not. In this paper; an algorithm for including the stochastic effect is presented including taking into account the finite opening angle of the emitted photons. A comparison demonstrates the utility of this approach. Generating maps which include radiation has been implemented in the PTC software library which is interfaced to the Bmad toolkit.,,reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/wexd3_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/wexd3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/wexd3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-WEXD3,548

One of the factors which may limit the high-intensity performance is the fast transverse instabilities caused by electron cloud effects. According to the experience in the Recycler; the electron cloud gradually builds up over multiple turns in the combined function magnets and can reach final intensities orders of magnitude greater than in a pure dipole. Since the Booster synchrotron also incorporates combined function magnets; it is important to discover any existence of an electron cloud. And if it does; its effects on the PIP-II era Booster and whether mitigating techniques are required. As the first step; the presence or absence of the electron cloud was investigated using a gap technique.

No external guiding or heating mechanisms are employed. The nanoparticle-assisted laser wakefield acceleration can control all the electron beam parameters: charge; energy spread; energy; emittance; and the number of bunches in the beam.

The plasma acceleration technique; providing unprecedented high gradients; is considered as a promising future technology. While important progress has been made in plasma-based electron acceleration in recent years; identifying a reliable acceleration technique for the positron counterpart would pave the way to a linear e+e− collider for high-energy physics applications. In this work; we show further studies of positron beam quality in moderately non-linear (MNL)* plasma wakefields. With a positron bunch of initial energy 1 GeV; emittance preservation can be achieved in optimised scenarios at 2.38 mm’mrad. In parallel; asymmetric beam collisions at the interaction point (IP) are studied to evaluate the current luminosity reach and provide insight to improvements required for positron acceleration in plasma. It is necessary to scale down the emittance of the positron bunch.

Further photoionization of the resultant Yb2+ ions by a circularly polarized laser injects the 4f14 electrons into this wake generating a highly spin-polarized beam. Combining time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulations with particle-in-cell simulations; we show that a sub-femtosecond; high-current (4 kA) electron beam with up to 56% net spin polarization can be generated and accelerated to 15 GeV in just 41 cm.

The diagnostic uses a small; ~0.1-m long undulator with mirrors that focus the undulator radiation onto an array of pyrometers. The mirrors both focus the radiation onto the pyrometer and remove the chirping effect that comes from the finite length of the undulator. Numerical and analytical models have been developed to calculate the radiation for a given bunch length; and a phase retrieval algorithm has been developed to extract the bunch profile from measured data. The diagnostic has been installed at the BELLA laser-plasma wakefield accelerator; and will be used to characterize the bunch length there.

The second IR and detector are needed to independently cross-check the results of the first detector; and to provide measurements with complementary acceptance. The available space in the existing RHIC IR8 and maximum fields achievable with NbTi superconducting magnet technology impose constraints on the 2nd IR performance. Since commissioning of the 2nd IR is envisioned in a few years after the first IR; such a long time frame allows for more R&D on the Nb3Sn magnet technology. Thus; it could provide a potential alternative technology choice for the 2nd IR magnets. Presently; we are exploring its potential benefits for the 2nd IR performance; such as improvement of the luminosity and acceptance; and are also assessing the technical risks associated with use of Nb3Sn magnets.

A second photogun delivers 180 keV beam for commissioning a SRF booster in a testbed accelerator; and a larger version delivers 300 keV magnetized beam in a test stand beam line. This contribution reports on the development of an unprecedented inverted-insulator with cable connector for reliably applying 500 kV DC to a future polarized beam photogun; to be designed for operating at 350 kV without field emission. Such a photogun design could then be used for generating a polarized electron beam to drive a spin-polarized positron source as a demonstrator for high energy nuclear physics at JLab. There are no commercial cable connectors that fit the large inverted insulators required for that voltage range.

An improved design of the 300 kV DC high voltage photogun at Jefferson Lab was incorporated toward overcoming the beam loss and space charge current limitation experienced in the original design. To reach the bunch charge goal of ~ few nC within 75 ps bunches; the existing DC high voltage photogun electrodes and anode-cathode gap were modified to increase the longitudinal electric field (Ez) at the photocathode. The anode-cathode gap was reduced to increase the Ez at the photocathode; and the anode aperture was spatially shifted with respect to the beamline longitudinal axis to minimize the beam deflection introduced by the geometric asymmetry of the inverted insulator photogun. The electrostatic design and beam dynamics simulations were performed to determine the required modification. Beam-based measurement from the modified gun confirmed the reduction of the beam deflection; which is presented in this contribution.,"Funding: This work is supported by the Department of Energy, under contract DE-AC05-06OR23177, JSA initiatives fund program, and the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/wepa17_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/wepa17.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/wepa17_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-WEPA17,655

To reduce contamination of the inner surfaces during assembly in a cleanroom; the whole string can be connected to a purge system; which maintains a constant overpressure of dry; clean nitrogen gas. Following successes of similar systems at XFEL and Fermilab; Jefferson Lab followed this example for the production of LCLS-II HE cryomodules. Implementing this system required new procedures; infrastructure; and hardware; as well as significant testing of the system before production began. This paper will summarize the implemented controls and procedures; including lessons learned from Fermilab; as well as the results of mock-up tests. Based on the latter; the system was used to assemble the first article string in April 2022; and was also used during a rework required due to issues with cold FPC ceramics two months later.

Two Wien spin rotators in the injector keV region are essential at CEBAF to establish longitudinal polarization at the end station target; and to flip the polarization direction by π rad to rule out false asymmetries. In a Wien filter; the homogeneous and independent electric and magnetic fields; along with the velocity vectors of the electrons that traverse it; form a mutually orthogonal system. The magnitude of the electrostatic field; established by biasing two highly-polished elec-trodes; defines the desired spin angle at the target yet deviates the beam trajectory due to the Lorentz force. The beam trajectory in the Wien is then re-established by adjusting the magnetic field; induced by an electromag-net encasing the device vacuum chamber. This contribu-tion describes the evolution design and high voltage testing of Wien filters for spin manipulation at increased beam energies in the keV injector region; required by high precision parity violation experiments like MOLLER.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/wepa20_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/wepa20.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/wepa20_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-WEPA20,662

The buildup of the vertical component of beam polarization can be measured using standard Mott polarimetry that is optimal at low electron energy.

Identifying an unstable cavity out of the hundreds of cavities installed at CEBAF is difficult and time-consuming. The present RF controls for the legacy cavities report at only 1 Hz; which is too slow to detect fast transient instabilities. A fast data acquisition system for the legacy SRF cavities is being developed which samples and reports at 5 kHz to allow for detection of transients. A prototype chassis has been installed and tested in CEBAF. An autoencoder based machine learning model is being developed to identify anomalous SRF cavity behavior. The model is presently being trained on the slow (1 Hz) data that is currently available; and a separate model will be developed and trained using the fast (5 kHz) DAQ data once it becomes available. This paper will discuss the present status of the new fast data acquisition system and results of testing the prototype chassis.

Field emission can occur when the cavities are set to high operating RF gradients and is an ongoing operational challenge. This is especially true in newer; higher gradient SRF cavities. Field emission results in damage to accelerator hardware; generates high levels of neutron and gamma radiation; and has deleterious effects on CEBAF operations. So; field emission reduction is imperative for the reliable; high gradient operation of CEBAF that is required by experimenters. Here we explore the use of deep learning architectures via multilayer perceptron to simultaneously model radiation measurements at multiple detectors in response to arbitrary gradient distributions. These models are trained on collected data and could be used to minimize the radiation production through gradient redistribution. This work builds on previous efforts in developing machine learning (ML) models; and is able to produce similar model performance as our previous ML model without requiring knowledge of the field emission onset for each cavity.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/wepa25_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/wepa25.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/wepa25_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-WEPA25,676

In this work; we present a new procedure of real-time fault prediction for superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) using deep learning. CEBAF has been afflicted by frequent downtime caused by SRF cavity faults. We perform fault prediction using pre-fault RF signals from C100-type cryomodules. Using the pre-fault signal information; the new algorithm predicts the type of cavity fault before the actual onset. The early prediction may enable potential mitigation strategies to prevent the fault. In our work; we apply a two-stage fault prediction pipeline. In the first stage; a model distinguishes between faulty and normal signals using a U-Net deep learning architecture. In the second stage of the network; signals flagged as faulty by the first model are classified into one of seven fault types based on learned signatures in the data. Initial results show that our model can successfully predict most fault types 200 ms before onset.

These strikes deposit extensive energy into the mercury and its steel vessel. Prediction of the resultant loading on the target is difficult when helium gas is intentionally injected into the mercury to reduce the loading and to mitigate the pitting damage on the vessel.

The FAST- GREENS experimental program aims at demonstrating 10 % extraction efficiency from a relativistic electron beam using four helical undulators operating in the high gain TESSA regime. The inter-undulator gap needs to be as short as possible (17 cm in the current plans) to maximize the output power. Within this short distance; we needed to fit two focusing quadrupoles; a variable strength phase shifter; a transverse profile monitor consisting of a YAG-OTR combination for co-aligning the electron beam and laser; and an ion pump. By making the quadrupoles tunable with a variable gradient; in combination with vertical displacement; we can meet the optics requirements of matching the beam transversely to the natural focusing of the undulators. The two quadrupoles in conjunction with the electromagnetic dipole also serve as a phase shifter to realign the radiation and the bunching before each undulator section.

One of the stages of fragment separation uses an RF deflecting cavity to provide time-of-flight separation.

Of particular interest are the alkali antimonides because of their ultra-high quantum efficiency (QE) and relatively low requirements for growth; and metallic materials such as Cu and Mg which have lower QE but are easier to maintain and have longer lifetime. The biggest challenge of using the alkali antimonide photocathode is that it has an extremely stringent requirement on vacuum and is destroyed rapidly by residual air in the system; while exposure of Mg and Cu in air also impacts the photocathode performance because of the oxidation. The photocathode can be protected against harmful gas molecules by using one or two monolayers of a 2D material such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Furthermore; hBN monolayers even have the potential to improve the QE of the photocathode when working as the encapsulation thin-film.

In order to achieve the maximum beam brightness; the electrons need to be emitted from photocathodes with the smallest possible mean transverse energy (MTE). Recent studies have looked at the effect that a graphene coating has on the quantum efficiency (QE) of the cathode [1]. However; there have not yet been any investigations into the effect that a graphene coating has on the MTE. Here we report on MTE and QE measurements of a graphene coated Cu(110) single crystal cathode at room and cryogenic temperatures. At room temperature; a minimum MTE of 25 meV was measured at 295 nm. This MTE remained stable at 25 meV over several days. At 77 K; the minimum MTE of 9 meV was measured at 290 nm. We perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to look at the effects of a graphene coating on a Cu(111) surface state.

napac2022,,WEPA67,Effects of Transverse Dependence of Kicks in Simulations of Microbunched Electron Cooling,BNL; Upton; New York; USA; SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Microbunched electron cooling (MBEC) is a cooling scheme in which a beam of hadrons to be cooled induces energy perturbations in a beam of electrons. These electron energy perturbations are amplified and turned into density modulations; which in turn provide energy kicks to the hadrons; tending to cool them. For simplification; previous work has modelled the electron-hadron interactions using a disc-disc model; assuming that the inter-particle kicks depend only on the longitudinal distances between individual hadrons and electrons. In reality; these kicks will also have a transverse dependence; which will impact the cooling process. We incorporate this transverse kick dependence into our simulations of the cooling process; allowing us to better understand the physics and provide improved design goals for the MBEC cooler for the Electron-Ion Collider.,,reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/wepa67_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/wepa67.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/wepa67_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-WEPA67,780

To expand this to all the beamlines as well as correct more frequently; a new slow orbit feedback program called unified orbit feedback (UOFB) was written from scratch that works with the fast orbit feedback transparently; while accumulated fast corrector strength is continuously shifted to the slow correctors and RF frequency is adjusted for circumference change. UOFB can lock 3 different types of local bumps to the target offsets/angles for days: those for insertion device (ID) sources with only ID RF beam position monitors (BPM) or mixtures of ID RF BPMs and X-ray BPMs; and those for bending magnet sources with arc BPMs between which orbit correctors; dipoles and quadrupoles exist.

That requirement has a significant impact on its radio frequency system (RF); in both the low-level rf control and the high-power klystron transmit-ters. Specifically; for the rf control; it requires the output vector modulation have enough bandwidth to be able to respond the transients by the MBM beam of 40~300 nS long. For the high-power rf transmitters; it requires the klystrons to operate in a near-linear region to be able to respond the linear rf control for the beam-loading compensation; which means a need of ~30% extra rf power overhead; compared to the single-bunch mode operations. The digital signal processing and the network configuration for the rf controllers are also the important areas in the implementation. The original system design was driven by the MBM beam operation requirements; and our system upgrade today continues to be guided by the same principles.,,reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/wepa76_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/wepa76.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/wepa76_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-WEPA76,813

Our approach first trains the CNN based on supervised learning to learn the correlations and physics constrains within a given accelerator system. The input of the CNN is a high dimensional collection of 2D phase space projections of the beam at the accelerator entrance together with a vector of accelerator parameters such as magnet and RF settings. The inputs are squeezed down to a low-dimensional latent space from which we generate the output in the form of projections of the beam’s 6D phase space at various accelerator locations. After training the CNN is applied in an unsupervised adaptive manner by comparing a subset of the output predictions to available measurements with the error guiding feedback directly in the low-dimensional latent space.

napac2022,,THXD6,A Quasi-Optical Beam Position Monitor,Euclid TechLabs; Solon; Ohio; USA; There is a strong demand for non-destructive electron Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) for non-perturbative diagnostics of the electron beam position. Challenges are related to the shortness of the electron beam and the noisy chamber environment that are typical for modern RF-driven and plasma-driven accelerators. We propose using a pair of identical high-quality quasi-optical resonators attached to opposite sides of the beam pipe. The resonators can introduce Photonic Band Gap (BPM) structures. These open resonators sustain very low numbers of high-quality modes. We intend to operate at the lowest mode among the others that are capable of being excited by the bunches. The mentioned mode has a coupling coefficient with the beam that depends on the distance between the bunch and the coupling hole. The lower this distance; the higher the coupling. Therefore; comparing the pick-up signals of both resonators with an oscilloscope; we can determine the beam position.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/thxd6_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/thxd6.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/thxd6_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-THXD6,846

napac2022,,THYD1,XFEL as a Low-Emittance Injector for a 4th-Generation Synchrotron Radiation Source,RIKEN SPring-8 Center; Hyogo; Japan; Low-emittance beam injection is required for the future SPring-8-II due to its small injection beam aperture. To meet this requirement; the SACLA linac has been used as a low-emittance injector since 2020 [1]. In order to perform the beam injection in parallel with XFEL operation; three accelerators are virtually constructed in a control system for the two XFEL beamlines and the beam injection; and thus the accelerator parameters can be independently tuned. Since the reference clock frequencies of the two accelerators are not related by an integer multiple; a new timing system was developed that achieves 3.8 ps (rms) synchronization. To maintain bunch purity better than 1e-8; which is routinely requested at SPring-8; an electron sweeper and an RF knock-out system are introduced for the SACLA injector and the SPring-8 storage ring. Although 0.1 nm-rad emittance of SACLA is increased by an order of magnitude at a transport line mainly due to quantum excitation of synchrotron radiation; it is still small enough for SPring-8-II. By shutting down an old dedicated injector complex; energy consumption has been significantly reduced; and it contributes to create a low-carbon society.; The speaker present this work on behalf of RIKEN-JASRI project team.

We question why some impurities improve RF performance while others hinder it. The purpose of this study is to characterize the impurity profile of niobium with a low residual resistance ratio (RRR) and correlate these impurities with the RF performance of low RRR cavities so that the mechanism of recent impurity-based improvements can be better understood and improved upon. Additionally; we performed surface treatments; low temperature baking and nitrogen-doping; on low RRR cavities to evaluate how the intentional addition of more impurities to the RF layer affects performance.

This technique uses a 1-D computer model of the linac to predict the cavities’ phases. The model has been accurately calibrated using the data of the 360-degree phase scans - a common procedure for phasing of linear accelerators. The model was validated by comparison with a conventional phase scan results.

The presented approach not just reduces the time and the effort required to tune the FRIB accelerator for new experiments every couple of weeks; but it also provides an easy recovery from cavity failures.

We recently demonstrated a diamond electrodeless electron beam halo monitor. That monitor was based on a thin piece of diamond (blade) placed in an open high-quality microwave resonator. The blade partially intercepted the beam. By measuring the change in RF properties of the resonator; one could infer the beam parameters. At Argonne Wakefield Accelerator we have tested 1D and 2D monitors. To enhance the sensitivity of our diamond sensor; we proposed applying a bias voltage to the diamond which can sustain the avalanche of free carriers. In experiment carried out with 120 kV; ~1 µA beam we showed that the response signal for the avalanche monitor biased with up to 5 kV voltage can be up to 100 times larger in comparison with the signal of the same non-biased device.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/thze3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/thze3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/thze3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-THZE3,904

The experiment employed a non-amplified configuration of OSC and achieved a longitudinal damping rate close to one order of magnitude larger than the beam’s natural damping due to synchrotron radiation. The integrated system demonstrated sub-femtosecond stability and a bandwidth of ~20 THz; a factor of ~2000-times higher than conventional microwave SC systems. Coupling to the transverse planes enabled simultaneous cooling of the beam in all degrees of freedom. This first demonstration of SC at optical frequencies serves as a foundation for more advanced experiments with high-gain optical amplification and advances opportunities for future operational OSC systems at colliders and other accelerator facilities.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/frxd1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/frxd1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/frxd1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-FRXD1,

Longitudinal manipulation usually require dedicated radio-frequency (RF) cavities and anisochronous beamlines (e.g.; chicane) to control beam’s time-energy correlation (called chirp). In this talk; a new method using a double emittance exchange (DEEX) beamline was demonstrated for the first time at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility. It allows control of the longitudinal phase space using relatively simple transverse manipulation techniques. This method enables various longitudinal manipulations such as tunable bunch compression; longitudinal chirp control; and nonlinearity compensation in a remarkably flexible manner. We report proof-of-principle experiment results demonstrating three key functions of the DEEX bunch compressor.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/talks/frxd2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/papers/frxd2.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2022/posters/frxd2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2022-FRXD2,

One potential explanation of this discrepancy is a lack of knowledge of the initial distribution of particles in six-dimensional (6D) phase space. A direct 6D measurement of an ion beam was recently performed at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Beam Test Facility (BTF); revealing nonlinear transverse-longitudinal correlations in the beam core that affect downstream evolution. Unfortunately; direct 6D measurements are limited in resolution and dynamic range; here; we discuss the use of three slits and one screen to measure a 5D projection of the 6D phase space distribution; overcoming these limitations at the cost of one dimension. We examine the measured 5D distribution before and after transport through the BTF and compare to particle-in-cell simulations.

The instability can be suppressed by artificially increasing the random energy spread of an electron beam; but this leads to unacceptably high energy spreads for future XFEL systems. One possibility of suppressing this instability is to use laser assisted bunch compression (LABC) instead of the second chicane in an XFEL system; thereby eliminating the cascaded chicane effect that magnifies the microbunching instability.

We group radiation effects into different categories: one of which is single-event effects (SEE). SEE are any measurable or observable change in state or performance of a microelectronic device; component; subsystem; or system resulting from a single energetic-particle strike. Today; SEE dominate radiation risks for many ground- and space-based systems. Engineers require knowledge of SEE susceptibility for devices and systems since it impacts both availability and reliability. Design teams frequently use particle accelerators to simulate ionizing radiation environments. The rapid growth of systems operating in harsh radiation environments has pushed accelerator facility access constraints to the breaking point. Investments in new radiation effects testing infrastructure have begun. Meanwhile; there remain unanswered questions about accelerator facility workforce and potential business model impacts on existing ecosystems.
