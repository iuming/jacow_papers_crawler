That monitor was based on a thin piece of diamond (blade) placed in an open high-quality microwave resonator. The blade partially intercepted the beam. By measuring the change in RF properties of the resonator",
        "one could infer the beam parameters. At Argonne Wakefield Accelerator we have tested 1D and 2D monitors. To enhance the sensitivity of our diamond sensor",
        "we proposed applying a bias voltage to the diamond which can sustain the avalanche of free carriers. In experiment carried out with 120 kV",
        "~1 µA beam we showed that the response signal for the avalanche monitor biased with up to 5 kV voltage can be up to 100 times larger in comparison with the signal of the same non-biased device."
