The design power of 700 kW was reached in early 2017 but further improvements have seen a new sustained peak power of 893 kW. Two of the main improvements include the shortening of the Main Injector ramp length as well optimizing the slip-stacking procedure performed in the Recycler to reduce the amount of uncaptured beam making its way into the Main Injector. These improvements will be discussed in this paper as well future upgrades to reach higher beam powers.",
