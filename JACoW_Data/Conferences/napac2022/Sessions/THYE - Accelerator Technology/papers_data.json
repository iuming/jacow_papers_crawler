Superconducting undulators (SCUs) hold great promise for XFELs as well. All operational devices are currently Nb Ti-based. Nb3Sn has the potential to further enhance the performance of SCUs. This paper will describe the technical challenges and progress to date of this technology.",

        "We present connectable designs of superconducting undulators (SCU) and cryomodules (CM) based on previous SCU and CM designs at Argonne National Lab. The new SCU and CM designs will allow us to connect one CM to the next to form a contiguous line of SCUs with no breaks between the cryomodules. The SCU design will have correctors and phase shifters integrated into the main SCU magnet core",
        "as well as external corrector magnets for trajectory corrections. There will also be a cryogenic magnetic quadrupole and a cold RF beam position monitor (BPM) integrated in the SCU CM. In addition to providing the usual FODO transverse focusing",
        "the quadrupole and BPM will be used for the beam-based alignment technique that is critical for X-ray FEL operation. In this paper",
        "we will present the conceptual design of the new SCU CM as well as results of FEL simulations using the SCUs as afterburners for the LCLS hard X-ray undulators."

        "diffusion of the native oxide into the niobium surface",
        "and thin films of alternate superconductors atop a niobium bulk cavity. We question why some impurities improve RF performance while others hinder it. The purpose of this study is to characterize the impurity profile of niobium with a low residual resistance ratio (RRR) and correlate these impurities with the RF performance of low RRR cavities so that the mechanism of recent impurity-based improvements can be better understood and improved upon. Additionally",
        "we performed surface treatments",
        "low temperature baking and nitrogen-doping",
        "on low RRR cavities to evaluate how the intentional addition of more impurities to the RF layer affects performance. We have found that low RRR cavities experience low temperature-dependent BCS resistance behavior more prominently than their high RRR counterparts. The results of this study have the potential to unlock a new understanding on SRF materials."
