        "Computation has seen dramatically increased speed over the past decade",
        "with the rise of device (GPU) computing. To make this increased computing capability more widely available",
        "there is a need to move it to the cloud",
        "where elastic and cheap resources are available. To make this capability more accessible",
        "there is a need for easily used codes",
        "usable after minimal training. This talk presents an approach to all three of these goals",
        "showing that accelerator computations can be made fast",
        "cheap",
        "and easy."
