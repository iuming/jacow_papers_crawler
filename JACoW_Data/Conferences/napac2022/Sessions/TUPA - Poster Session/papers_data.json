        "H− charge exchange (stripping) injection into the European Spallation neutron Source (ESS) Storage Ring requires a 90 mA H− ion source that delivers 2.9 ms pulses at 14 Hz repetition rate (duty factor ~4%) that can be extended to 28 Hz (df 8%). This can be achieved with a magnetron surface plasma H− source (SPS) with active cathode and anode cooling. The Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) magnetron SPS can produce an H− beam current of 100 mA with about 2 kW discharge power and can operate up to 0.7 % duty factor (average power 14 W) without active cooling. We describe how active cathode and anode cooling can be applied to the BNL source to increase the average discharge power up to 140 W (df 8%) to satisfy the needs of the ESS. We also describe the use of a short electrostatic LEBT as is used at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source to improve the beam delivery to the RFQ."

      "abstract": "A microtron can be an effective intense electron source. It can use less RF power than a linac to produce a similar energy because the beam will pass through the RF cavity several times. To produce a high-quality low-emittance beam with a microtron requires a magnetic system with a field uniformity $δ B/B<0.001. Field quality for a compact microtron with fewer turns is more difficult to achieve. In this study we describe the magnet for a compact S-band microtron that will achieve the necessary field requirements. The shaping of the magnet poles and shimming of the magnet iron at the outer extent of the poles will be employed to provide field uniformity. The extraction of the beam will be discussed. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

The resulting electron beam will be capable of depositing more than 150 MGy on machine protection collimators creating high-energy-density conditions. Work is underway to couple the beam dynamics code Elegant with the particle-matter interaction program MARS and the magnetohydrodynamics code FLASH to model the effects of whole beam dumps on the collimators. Loss distributions from Elegant are input to MARS which provide dose maps to FLASH. We also examine the propagation of downstream shower components after the beam interacts with the collimator. Electrons and positrons are tracked to determine locations of beam loss. Beam dump experiments conducted in the APS storage-ring",

The deformed collimator surface may lead to beam deposition in unexpected locations. A fan-out kicker is planned to mitigate the effects of whole beam dumps on the collimators."

The window test stand consists of two RF windows that create a vacuum chamber which allows the windows to be tested to the peak power levels used in the DTL. Initial results clearly indicated multipactoring due to the increase of pressure at specific regions of peak forward power levels. Temperature measured at various azimuthal locations on both windows showed increased multipactor heating on the downstream window versus the upstream window. We present the effect of the titanium nitride coating that is presently applied to windows on both multipactor and window temperature.

It provides access to significantly higher accelerating gradients than traditional radio-frequency cavities. One impediment to realizing a DWA-powered accelerator is the issue of the transverse stability of the beams within the dielectric structure due to short-range wakefields. These short-range wakefields have a tendency to induce a phenomenon known as single-bunch beam breakup",

We attempt to solve this issue by leveraging the quadrupole mode excited in a planar dielectric structure and then alternating the orientation of said structure to turn an unstable system into a stable one. We examine this issue computationally to determine the limits of stability and based on those simulations describe a future experimental realization of this strategy."
