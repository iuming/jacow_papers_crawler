          "abstract": "Accelerator laboratories belong to the largest research investments to be found regardless laboratory, research institute or country funding the initiatives. This impose a great responsibility on the researchers and engineers developing, building and updating research facilities. Accelerator development are important research projects and will affect many stakeholders regardless if it is a smaller upgrade of an RF system or development of a large scale FEL. Wet developing new systems project management is a core competence for every laboratory. Yet this is a knowledge area often ignored in favor skill development in areas closer to physics and technology. This can be a very expensive mistake as the value of proper project management cannot be underestimated. This half day training will give you insight in the basics of projects. What is a project and what does project management mean. And how can this be adopted in accelerator development. reference for this paper using",

The hybrid scheme consists of modular chromatic matching of periodic systems and beamlines. The first-order chromatically matched solutions are linearly parameterized with the local linear chromaticities that control the higher order chromatic beatings. The parameterization enables an efficient optimization of dynamic aperture. As a result",

            "Linear induction accelerators (LIAs) such as the DARHT at Los Alamos National Laboratory make use of the beam envelope equation to simulate the beam and design experiments. Accepted practice is to infer beam parameters using the solenoid scan technique with optical transition radiation (OTR) beam profiles. These scans are then analyzed with an envelope equation solver to find a solution consistent with the data and machine parameters (beam energy, current, magnetic field, and geometry). The most common code for this purpose with flash-radiography LIAs is xtr [1]. The code assumes the machine parameters are perfectly known and that beam profiles will follow a normal distribution about the best fit and solves by minimizing a chi-square-like metric. We construct a Bayesian model of the beam parameters allowing maching parameters, such as solenoid position, to vary within reasonable uncertainty bounds. Posterior distribution functions are constructed using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to evaluate the accuracy of the xtr solution uncertainties and the impact of finite precision in measurements."

The AWAKE experi-ment at CERN demonstrated during Run1 that thanks to the process of self-modulation an high energy (400 GeV) long (10 cm) proton bunch drive intense wakefield in plasma. Externally injected electrons were successfully accelerated to 2 GeV in a 10m plasma. The main aims of the AWAKE Run 2 phase are to demonstrate that a con-trolled self-modulation process can lead to stable acceler-ating gradient up to 1 GV/m preserving the emittance of injected electron bunches and to be scalable to plasma sources of 100s of meters and beyond for high energy. The AWAKE scheme aim to provide electron beams for particle physics experiments by the end of the Run2 phase. This contribution reports the main achievement of Run1 and summarises the programme of AWAKE Run 2 including possible applications of the AWAKE scheme to novel particle physics experiments."

Dipolar higher-order modes (HOMs) are a set of LRWs that are excited by off-axis beams. Two 4-channel HOM detectors were built to measure the beam-induced HOM signals for TESLA-type superconducting RF (SRF) cavities; they were tested at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility and are now installed at SLAC. The HOM detectors were designed to investigate LRW effects on the beam and to help with beam alignment. This paper presents preliminary results of HOM measurements at the first cryomodule (CM01) of the LCLS-II linac and describes the relevant hardware and setup of the experiment."

The Nb samples were electropolished at different surface temperatures ranging from 0 to 42 C. The results showed that the doped surface was susceptible to the sample temperature during EP. EP resulted in the surface pitting on the doped samples where the number density of pits increased at a higher temperature. The surface results were compared with the surface of cutouts from a 9-cell cavity which was 2/0 N-doped and electropolished.

LCLS-II will accelerate a 30 µA electron beam with a 1 MHz bunch rate with a new superconducting Continuous Waveform (CW) RF accelerator. The Average Current Monitor (ACM) is part of the Beam Containment System (BCS) for the LCLS-II accelerator. The Beam Containment System is a safety system that provides paths to safely shut the accelerator beam off under a variety of conditions. The Average Current Monitor is a beam diagnostic within the BCS that is used to verify that the accelerator is producing the appropriate current level and to limit beam power to allowed values to protect the machine and beam dumps.

The quickly evolving landscape continues to grow in both the breadth and depth of applications including physics modeling, anomaly detection, controls, diagnostics, and analysis. Consequently, laboratories, universities, and companies across the globe have established dedicated machine learning (ML) and data-science efforts aiming to make use of these new state-of-the-art tools. The current funding environment in the U.S. is structured in a way that supports specific application spaces rather than larger collaboration on community software. Here, we discuss the existing collaboration bottlenecks and how a shift in the funding environment, and how we develop collaborative tools, can help fuel the next wave of ML advancements for particle accelerators. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

          "abstract": "A 185.7 MHz superconducting quarter-wave resonator (QWR) was designed for the low emittance injector of the Linac Coherent Light Source high energy upgrade (LCLS-II-HE). The cavity was designed to minimize the risk of cathode efficiency degradation due to multipacting or field emission and to operate with a high RF electric field at the cathode for low electron-beam emittance. Cavity design features include: (1) shaping of the cavity wall to reduce the strength of the low-field coaxial multipacting barrier; (2) four ports for electropolishing and high-pressure water rinsing; and (3) a fundamental power coupler (FPC) port located away from the accelerating gap. The design is oriented toward minimizing the risk of particulate contamination and avoid harmful dipole components in the RF field. The ANL 162 MHz FPC design for PIP-II is being adapted for the gun cavity. We will present the RF design of the cavity integrated with the FPC. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

            "the low barrier is observed at an accelerating gradient (Eacc) of ~10 kV/m; the operating Eacc is 5.6 MV/m. Theoretical and simulation studies suggested that the conditioning is difficult due to the relatively low RF power dissipated into multipacting rather than being a problem of the low barrier being stronger than other barriers. We developed a single-stub coaxial FPC matching element for external adjustment of the external Q by one order of magnitude. The matching element provided a significant reduction in the time to condition the low barrier. We will present theoretical and simulation studies of the low MP barrier and experimental results on MP conditioning with the single-stub FPC matching element."

Plasma cleaning is being developed as a method to mitigate possible future degradation of QWR or HWR performance: in-situ plasma cleaning represents an alternative to removal and disassembly of cryomodules for refurbishment of each cavity via repeat etching and rinsing. Initial measurements were done on a QWR and an HWR with room-temperature-matched input couplers to drive the plasma via the fundamental mode. Subsequent plasma cleaning tests were done on two additional FRIB QWRs using the fundamental power coupler (FPC) to drive the plasma. When using the FPC",
            "a higher-order mode (HOM) at 5 times the accelerating mode frequency was used to drive the plasma. Use of the HOM allowed for less mismatch at the FPC and hence lower field in the coupler relative to the cavity. A neon-oxygen gas mixture was used for plasma generation. Before and after cold tests showed a significant reduction in field emission X-rays after plasma cleaning. Results will be presented."

A simple method of focusing multiple energies at once and thus increasing the depth-of-field is the use of multiple detector stations along the beam axis. Proton images captured at downstream detector positions can be combined into a single image using a method called ’focus stacking’. A complete cancellation of the position- and energy dependent 2nd order chromatic aberrations that mostly affect the current image quality of pRad [2] is only possible by using an achromatic imaging system. Following the proposals in early design studies at LANSCE [3] a new prototype achromatic system is currently being developed for a 25 MeV S-band electron accelerator.",

            "Reducing the energy spread of electron beams can enable breakthrough advances in electron energy loss spectroscopic investigations of solid state samples where characteristic excitations typically have energy scales on the order of meV. In conventional electron sources the energy spread is limited by the emission process and typically on the order of a fraction of an eV. State-of-the-art energy resolution can only be achieved after significant losses in the monochromatization process. Here we propose to take advantage of photoemission from ultrashort laser pulses (~40 fs) so that after a longitudinal phase space manipulation that trades pulse duration for energy spread",
            "the energy spread can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude. The scheme uses two RF cavities to accomplish this goal and can be implemented on a relatively short (~ 1m) beamline. Analytical predictions and results of 3D self consistent beam dynamics simulations are presented to support the findings."

This can be achieved with a magnetron surface plasma H− source (SPS) with active cathode and anode cooling. The Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) magnetron SPS can produce an H− beam current of 100 mA with about 2 kW discharge power and can operate up to 0.7 % duty factor (average power 14 W) without active cooling. We describe how active cathode and anode cooling can be applied to the BNL source to increase the average discharge power up to 140 W (df 8%) to satisfy the needs of the ESS. We also describe the use of a short electrostatic LEBT as is used at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source to improve the beam delivery to the RFQ."

It can use less RF power than a linac to produce a similar energy because the beam will pass through the RF cavity several times. To produce a high-quality low-emittance beam with a microtron requires a magnetic system with a field uniformity $δ B/B<0.001. Field quality for a compact microtron with fewer turns is more difficult to achieve. In this study we describe the magnet for a compact S-band microtron that will achieve the necessary field requirements. The shaping of the magnet poles and shimming of the magnet iron at the outer extent of the poles will be employed to provide field uniformity. The extraction of the beam will be discussed. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

The resulting electron beam will be capable of depositing more than 150 MGy on machine protection collimators creating high-energy-density conditions. Work is underway to couple the beam dynamics code Elegant with the particle-matter interaction program MARS and the magnetohydrodynamics code FLASH to model the effects of whole beam dumps on the collimators. Loss distributions from Elegant are input to MARS which provide dose maps to FLASH. We also examine the propagation of downstream shower components after the beam interacts with the collimator. Electrons and positrons are tracked to determine locations of beam loss. Beam dump experiments conducted in the APS storage-ring",

The deformed collimator surface may lead to beam deposition in unexpected locations. A fan-out kicker is planned to mitigate the effects of whole beam dumps on the collimators."

            "We have recently commissioned an RF window test stand for the Drift Tube Linear Accelerator (DTL) portion of the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). The window test stand consists of two RF windows that create a vacuum chamber which allows the windows to be tested to the peak power levels used in the DTL. Initial results clearly indicated multipactoring due to the increase of pressure at specific regions of peak forward power levels. Temperature measured at various azimuthal locations on both windows showed increased multipactor heating on the downstream window versus the upstream window. We present the effect of the titanium nitride coating that is presently applied to windows on both multipactor and window temperature. These results are discussed with respect to their impact on the LANSCE DTL performance."

            "Dielectric Wakefield Acceleration (DWA) is a promising technique for realizing the next generation of linear colliders. It provides access to significantly higher accelerating gradients than traditional radio-frequency cavities. One impediment to realizing a DWA-powered accelerator is the issue of the transverse stability of the beams within the dielectric structure due to short-range wakefields. These short-range wakefields have a tendency to induce a phenomenon known as single-bunch beam breakup",
            "which acts as its name implies and destroys the relevant beam. We attempt to solve this issue by leveraging the quadrupole mode excited in a planar dielectric structure and then alternating the orientation of said structure to turn an unstable system into a stable one. We examine this issue computationally to determine the limits of stability and based on those simulations describe a future experimental realization of this strategy."

            "We propose a design of an upgraded Mu2e experiment for the future Fermilab PIP-II era based on the muon collider front end. The consensus is that such an upgrade should provide a factor of 10 increase in the rate of stopping muons in the experimental target. The current Mu2e design is optimized for 8 kW of protons at 8 GeV. The PIP-II upgrade project is a 250-meter-long CW linac capable of accelerating a 2-mA proton beam to a kinetic energy of 800 MeV (total power 1.6 MW). This would significantly improve the Fermilab proton source to enable next-generation intensity frontier experiments. But using this 800 MeV beam poses challenges to the Mu2E experiment. Bright muon beams generated from sources designed for muon collider and neutrino factory facilities have been shown to generate two orders of magnitude more muons per proton than the current Mu2e production target and solenoid. In contrast to the current Mu2e",
            "the muon collider design has forward-production of muons from the target."

            "the development of MeV range ultrafast electron diffraction/microscopy (UED and UEM) has been identified as an enabling instrumentation. UEM or UED use low power electron beams with modest energies of a few MeV to study ultrafast phenomena in a variety of novel and exotic materials. SRF photoguns become a promising candidate to produce highly stable electrons for UEM/UED applications because of the ultrahigh shot-to-shot stability compared to room temperature RF photoguns. SRF technology was prohibitively expensive for industrial use until two recent advancements: Nb3Sn and conduction cooling. The use of Nb3Sn allows to operate SRF cavities at higher temperatures (4K) with low power dissipation which is within the reach of commercially available closed-cycle cryocoolers. Euclid is developing a continuous wave (CW)",

Non-uniform recrystallization of fine-grain Nb cavities after the post fabrication heat treatment leads to higher flux trapping during the cool down",
            "and hence the lower quality factor. We fabricated two 1.3 GHz single cell cavities from cold-worked niobium from different vendors and processed along with cavities made from SRF grade Nb. The flux expulsion and flux trapping sensitivity were measured after successive heat treatments in the range 800 to 1000°C. The flux expulsion from cold-worked fine-grain Nb cavities improves after 800°C/3h heat treatments and it becomes similar to that of standard fine-grain Nb cavities when the heat treatment temperature is higher than 900°C."

While the longitudinal wakefield has been well studied in the one-dimensional CSR theory and implemented in various simulation codes, transverse wakefields have received less attention. Following the recently developed two and three-dimensional CSR theory, we developed software packages in Python and Julia to simulate the 2D CSR effects. The Python packages, PyCSR2D and PyCSR3D, utilize parallel processing in CPU to compute the steady-state CSR wakes. The Julia package, CSR2D.jl, additionally computes the 2D transient CSR wakes with GPU compatibility. We applied these codes to simulate the 2D CSR effects in the LCLS-II and FACET-II particle accelerators at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory."

The objective for the TESLA cavity is to minimize HOM damping factors and for the SRF gun to minimize the surface electric and magnetic fields while maintaining its operating mode frequency at a prescribed value. The results demonstrate that the automatic simulation tool allows an efficient shape optimization procedure with minimal manual operations.

A 2-phase material model that incorporates the Rayleigh-Plesset (R-P) model is expected to address this complex multi-physics dynamics problem by including the bubble dynamics in the liquid mercury.

The detector will consist of a row of x-ray spectrometers adjacent to the DTL that will measure the spectrum of X-rays resulting from bremsstrahlung of electrons created in vacuum by the RF. Each spectrometer will monitor a specific gap between drift tubes",

The LYSO provides a tagged gamma source with three peaks that are used for calibration of the NaI. A prototype of the spectrometer was tested at the LANSCE DTL to validate the feasibility of measuring gamma spectra and performing self-calibration in situ. A summary of test results with the LANSCE prototype will be presented",

A large fraction of the high field magnets are expected to be of permanent magnet technology that will require precise magnetic measurements and field harmonics corrections. A new magnetic measurement bench has been built based on a printed circuit board (PCB) coil of 12 mm diameter and 270 mm active length. This PCB coil has the capabil-ity of measuring field quality to a level of 10 ppm of the main field up to the 15th harmonic with a sensitivity between 0.01 m2 and 0.02 m2 at the reference radius of 5 mm. This paper will describe the main features of the rotating coil bench and discuss the measurement results of a permanent-magnet Halbach quadrupole of 12.7 mm bore diameter. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

Our approach first trains the CNN based on supervised learning to learn the correlations and physics constrains within a given accelerator system. The input of the CNN is a high dimensional collection of 2D phase space projections of the beam at the accelerator entrance together with a vector of accelerator parameters such as magnet and RF settings. The inputs are squeezed down to a low-dimensional latent space from which we generate the output in the form of projections of the beam’s 6D phase space at various accelerator locations. After training the CNN is applied in an unsupervised adaptive manner by comparing a subset of the output predictions to available measurements with the error guiding feedback directly in the low-dimensional latent space. We show that our approach is robust to unseen time-variation of the input beam and accelerator parameters and a study of the robustness of the method to go beyond the span of the training data.",

Challenges are related to the shortness of the electron beam and the noisy chamber environment that are typical for modern RF-driven and plasma-driven accelerators. We propose using a pair of identical high-quality quasi-optical resonators attached to opposite sides of the beam pipe. The resonators can introduce Photonic Band Gap (BPM) structures. These open resonators sustain very low numbers of high-quality modes. We intend to operate at the lowest mode among the others that are capable of being excited by the bunches. The mentioned mode has a coupling coefficient with the beam that depends on the distance between the bunch and the coupling hole. The lower this distance",

We consider here the possibility for an alternative paradigm whereby the cathode surface is controlled to reduce the effective area of illumination and emission. We fabricated nanoblade metallic coated cathodes using common nanofabrication techniques.

The model has been accurately calibrated using the data of the 360-degree phase scans - a common procedure for phasing of linear accelerators.

The predictions applied to the linac are then verified by multiple time-of-flight energy measurements and the response of the beam position/phase monitors (BPMs) to an intentional energy and phase mismatch.

The integrated system demonstrated sub-femtosecond stability and a bandwidth of ~20 THz",

CCM will operate at the Lujan Center at LANSCE which is a 100-kW neutron and stopped pion source that delivers an 800-MeV proton beam onto a tungsten target at 20 Hz with a pulse width of 290 ns. The 10 ton liquid argon CCM detector is placed 23 m from the target and is instrumented with 200 fast nano-second 8\" PMT’s that can detect scattering events in time with the beam from as low as 10 keV thresholds up to 200 MeV. Initial data results will be shown demonstrating the power of the new experiment."

This and the development of the generator allowed for remote access to radionuclides and the expansion of nuclear medicine. In the 1970’s and 80’s major accelerator facilities operating at 100 MeV and higher were installed in many of the national labs and used for production of radionuclides at energies and currents not available on the small compact machines. These high energy accelerators have played an important role in supplying Radionuclides such as Sr-82 used in Sr/Rb generators for cardiac imaging and Ac-225 for cancer therapy. They continue to be advanced to further production yields by installing beam rastering systems that have allowed higher intensities and thus higher production yields. As well as adding mass separation techniques that enable novel radionuclides to be produced in quality suitable for use. These enhanced accelerator capabilities and the production of these novel radionuclides will be presented.",

This impose a great responsibility on the researchers and engineers developing, building and updating research facilities. Accelerator development are important research projects and will affect many stakeholders regardless if it is a smaller upgrade of an RF system or development of a large scale FEL. Wet developing new systems project management is a core competence for every laboratory. Yet this is a knowledge area often ignored in favor skill development in areas closer to physics and technology. This can be a very expensive mistake as the value of proper project management cannot be underestimated. This half day training will give you insight in the basics of projects.

        "We have developed a new chromatic compensation scheme for the electron storage ring with two low-beta interaction regions in the electron-ion collider. The hybrid scheme consists of modular chromatic matching of periodic systems and beamlines. The first-order chromatically matched solutions are linearly parameterized with the local linear chromaticities that control the higher order chromatic beatings. The parameterization enables an efficient optimization of dynamic aperture. As a result",

Accepted practice is to infer beam parameters using the solenoid scan technique with optical transition radiation (OTR) beam profiles. These scans are then analyzed with an envelope equation solver to find a solution consistent with the data and machine parameters (beam energy, current, magnetic field, and geometry). The most common code for this purpose with flash-radiography LIAs is xtr [1]. The code assumes the machine parameters are perfectly known and that beam profiles will follow a normal distribution about the best fit and solves by minimizing a chi-square-like metric. We construct a Bayesian model of the beam parameters allowing maching parameters, such as solenoid position, to vary within reasonable uncertainty bounds. Posterior distribution functions are constructed using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to evaluate the accuracy of the xtr solution uncertainties and the impact of finite precision in measurements."

The AWAKE experi-ment at CERN demonstrated during Run1 that thanks to the process of self-modulation an high energy (400 GeV) long (10 cm) proton bunch drive intense wakefield in plasma. Externally injected electrons were successfully accelerated to 2 GeV in a 10m plasma. The main aims of the AWAKE Run 2 phase are to demonstrate that a con-trolled self-modulation process can lead to stable acceler-ating gradient up to 1 GV/m preserving the emittance of injected electron bunches and to be scalable to plasma sources of 100s of meters and beyond for high energy. The AWAKE scheme aim to provide electron beams for particle physics experiments by the end of the Run2 phase. This contribution reports the main achievement of Run1 and summarises the programme of AWAKE Run 2 including possible applications of the AWAKE scheme to novel particle physics experiments."

A single cell clamped DDA structure recently achieved an accelerating gradient of 1{02} MV/m. A multi-cell clamped DDA structure has been designed and is being fabricated. Simulation results for this new structure show a 1{08} MV/m accelerating gradient with 400 MW of input power with a high shunt impedance and group velocity.

        "Long-range wakefields (LRWs) may cause emittance dilution effects. LWRs are especially unwanted at facilities with low emittance beams like the LCLS-II at SLAC. Dipolar higher-order modes (HOMs) are a set of LRWs that are excited by off-axis beams. Two 4-channel HOM detectors were built to measure the beam-induced HOM signals for TESLA-type superconducting RF (SRF) cavities; they were tested at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility and are now installed at SLAC. The HOM detectors were designed to investigate LRW effects on the beam and to help with beam alignment. This paper presents preliminary results of HOM measurements at the first cryomodule (CM01) of the LCLS-II linac and describes the relevant hardware and setup of the experiment."

A piezoelectric actuator with a resonance control algorithm can maintain the cavity frequency at the nominal level thus reducing the RF power. This study uses a double lever tuner with a piezoelectric actuator for compensation and another piezoelectric actuator to simulate the effects of the Lorentz force pulse. A double lever tuner has an advantage by increasing the stiffness of the cavity-tuner system thus reducing the effects of LFD.

The Beam Containment System is a safety system that provides paths to safely shut the accelerator beam off under a variety of conditions. The Average Current Monitor is a beam diagnostic within the BCS that is used to verify that the accelerator is producing the appropriate current level and to limit beam power to allowed values to protect the machine and beam dumps.

        "and BISSCO cable conductors",
        "which require reaction after winding and insulation after reaction in a process similar to Nb3Sn cables. Both conductors are expensive and the process after reacting is expensive. Some unknown factors that remain: Will either conductor degrade in current carrying capacity with repeated cycling like Nb3Sn cables do? The other two issues are problems for both types of HTS conductors and they are; 1) quench protection in the event of a normal region run-away and 2) dealing with the superconducting magnetization inherent with HTS cables and tapes. This paper will discuss the last two issues and maybe will provide a partial solution to these problems."

The quickly evolving landscape continues to grow in both the breadth and depth of applications including physics modeling, anomaly detection, controls, diagnostics, and analysis. Consequently, laboratories, universities, and companies across the globe have established dedicated machine learning (ML) and data-science efforts aiming to make use of these new state-of-the-art tools. The current funding environment in the U.S. is structured in a way that supports specific application spaces rather than larger collaboration on community software. Here, we discuss the existing collaboration bottlenecks and how a shift in the funding environment, and how we develop collaborative tools, can help fuel the next wave of ML advancements for particle accelerators. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

Most photocathodes require photon energies exceeding the nominal photon energy produced by the lasing medium. A common setup consists of an infrared (IR) laser system with nonlinear frequency conversion to the ultraviolet (UV). In this work",
        "we present the numerical modeling of a temporal shaping technique capable of producing electron bunches with linearly-ramped current profiles for application to collinear wakefield accelerators. Specifically",

The cavity was designed to minimize the risk of cathode efficiency degradation due to multipacting or field emission and to operate with a high RF electric field at the cathode for low electron-beam emittance. Cavity design features include: (1) shaping of the cavity wall to reduce the strength of the low-field coaxial multipacting barrier; (2) four ports for electropolishing and high-pressure water rinsing; and (3) a fundamental power coupler (FPC) port located away from the accelerating gap. The design is oriented toward minimizing the risk of particulate contamination and avoid harmful dipole components in the RF field. The ANL 162 MHz FPC design for PIP-II is being adapted for the gun cavity. We will present the RF design of the cavity integrated with the FPC. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

Theoretical and simulation studies suggested that the conditioning is difficult due to the relatively low RF power dissipated into multipacting rather than being a problem of the low barrier being stronger than other barriers. We developed a single-stub coaxial FPC matching element for external adjustment of the external Q by one order of magnitude. The matching element provided a significant reduction in the time to condition the low barrier. We will present theoretical and simulation studies of the low MP barrier and experimental results on MP conditioning with the single-stub FPC matching element."

Plasma cleaning is being developed as a method to mitigate possible future degradation of QWR or HWR performance: in-situ plasma cleaning represents an alternative to removal and disassembly of cryomodules for refurbishment of each cavity via repeat etching and rinsing. Initial measurements were done on a QWR and an HWR with room-temperature-matched input couplers to drive the plasma via the fundamental mode. Subsequent plasma cleaning tests were done on two additional FRIB QWRs using the fundamental power coupler (FPC) to drive the plasma. When using the FPC",
        "a higher-order mode (HOM) at 5 times the accelerating mode frequency was used to drive the plasma. Use of the HOM allowed for less mismatch at the FPC and hence lower field in the coupler relative to the cavity. A neon-oxygen gas mixture was used for plasma generation. Before and after cold tests showed a significant reduction in field emission X-rays after plasma cleaning. Results will be presented."

        "Reducing the energy spread of electron beams can enable breakthrough advances in electron energy loss spectroscopic investigations of solid state samples where characteristic excitations typically have energy scales on the order of meV. In conventional electron sources the energy spread is limited by the emission process and typically on the order of a fraction of an eV. State-of-the-art energy resolution can only be achieved after significant losses in the monochromatization process. Here we propose to take advantage of photoemission from ultrashort laser pulses (~40 fs) so that after a longitudinal phase space manipulation that trades pulse duration for energy spread",
        "the energy spread can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude. The scheme uses two RF cavities to accomplish this goal and can be implemented on a relatively short (~ 1m) beamline. Analytical predictions and results of 3D self consistent beam dynamics simulations are presented to support the findings."

This can be achieved with a magnetron surface plasma H− source (SPS) with active cathode and anode cooling. The Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) magnetron SPS can produce an H− beam current of 100 mA with about 2 kW discharge power and can operate up to 0.7 % duty factor (average power 14 W) without active cooling. We describe how active cathode and anode cooling can be applied to the BNL source to increase the average discharge power up to 140 W (df 8%) to satisfy the needs of the ESS.

It can use less RF power than a linac to produce a similar energy because the beam will pass through the RF cavity several times. To produce a high-quality low-emittance beam with a microtron requires a magnetic system with a field uniformity $δ B/B<0.001. Field quality for a compact microtron with fewer turns is more difficult to achieve. In this study we describe the magnet for a compact S-band microtron that will achieve the necessary field requirements. The shaping of the magnet poles and shimming of the magnet iron at the outer extent of the poles will be employed to provide field uniformity. The extraction of the beam will be discussed. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

The window test stand consists of two RF windows that create a vacuum chamber which allows the windows to be tested to the peak power levels used in the DTL. Initial results clearly indicated multipactoring due to the increase of pressure at specific regions of peak forward power levels. Temperature measured at various azimuthal locations on both windows showed increased multipactor heating on the downstream window versus the upstream window. We present the effect of the titanium nitride coating that is presently applied to windows on both multipactor and window temperature. These results are discussed with respect to their impact on the LANSCE DTL performance."

        "Dielectric Wakefield Acceleration (DWA) is a promising technique for realizing the next generation of linear colliders. It provides access to significantly higher accelerating gradients than traditional radio-frequency cavities. One impediment to realizing a DWA-powered accelerator is the issue of the transverse stability of the beams within the dielectric structure due to short-range wakefields. These short-range wakefields have a tendency to induce a phenomenon known as single-bunch beam breakup",
        "which acts as its name implies and destroys the relevant beam. We attempt to solve this issue by leveraging the quadrupole mode excited in a planar dielectric structure and then alternating the orientation of said structure to turn an unstable system into a stable one. We examine this issue computationally to determine the limits of stability and based on those simulations describe a future experimental realization of this strategy."

        "Fermilab Booster synchrotron requires an intensity upgrade from 4.5×1012 to 6.5×1012 protons per pulse as a part of Fermilab’s Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II). One of the factors which may limit the high-intensity performance is the fast transverse instabilities caused by electron cloud effects. According to the experience in the Recycler",
        "the electron cloud gradually builds up over multiple turns in the combined function magnets and can reach final intensities orders of magnitude greater than in a pure dipole. Since the Booster synchrotron also incorporates combined function magnets",
        "it is important to discover any existence of an electron cloud. And if it does",
        "its effects on the PIP-II era Booster and whether mitigating techniques are required. As the first step",
        "the presence or absence of the electron cloud was investigated using a gap technique. This paper presents experimental details and observations of the bunch-by-bunch tune shifts of beams with various bunch train structures at low and high intensities and simulation results conducted using PyECLOUD software."

The consensus is that such an upgrade should provide a factor of 10 increase in the rate of stopping muons in the experimental target. The current Mu2e design is optimized for 8 kW of protons at 8 GeV. The PIP-II upgrade project is a 250-meter-long CW linac capable of accelerating a 2-mA proton beam to a kinetic energy of 800 MeV (total power 1.6 MW). This would significantly improve the Fermilab proton source to enable next-generation intensity frontier experiments. But using this 800 MeV beam poses challenges to the Mu2E experiment. Bright muon beams generated from sources designed for muon collider and neutrino factory facilities have been shown to generate two orders of magnitude more muons per proton than the current Mu2e production target and solenoid. In contrast to the current Mu2e",

The design power of 700 kW was reached in early 2017 but further improvements have seen a new sustained peak power of 893 kW. Two of the main improvements include the shortening of the Main Injector ramp length as well optimizing the slip-stacking procedure performed in the Recycler to reduce the amount of uncaptured beam making its way into the Main Injector. These improvements will be discussed in this paper as well future upgrades to reach higher beam powers.",

UEM or UED use low power electron beams with modest energies of a few MeV to study ultrafast phenomena in a variety of novel and exotic materials. SRF photoguns become a promising candidate to produce highly stable electrons for UEM/UED applications because of the ultrahigh shot-to-shot stability compared to room temperature RF photoguns. SRF technology was prohibitively expensive for industrial use until two recent advancements: Nb3Sn and conduction cooling. The use of Nb3Sn allows to operate SRF cavities at higher temperatures (4K) with low power dissipation which is within the reach of commercially available closed-cycle cryocoolers.

The flux expulsion and flux trapping sensitivity were measured after successive heat treatments in the range 800 to 1000°C. The flux expulsion from cold-worked fine-grain Nb cavities improves after 800°C/3h heat treatments and it becomes similar to that of standard fine-grain Nb cavities when the heat treatment temperature is higher than 900°C."

While the longitudinal wakefield has been well studied in the one-dimensional CSR theory and implemented in various simulation codes, transverse wakefields have received less attention. Following the recently developed two and three-dimensional CSR theory, we developed software packages in Python and Julia to simulate the 2D CSR effects. The Python packages, PyCSR2D and PyCSR3D, utilize parallel processing in CPU to compute the steady-state CSR wakes. The Julia package, CSR2D.jl, additionally computes the 2D transient CSR wakes with GPU compatibility. We applied these codes to simulate the 2D CSR effects in the LCLS-II and FACET-II particle accelerators at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory."

The objective for the TESLA cavity is to minimize HOM damping factors and for the SRF gun to minimize the surface electric and magnetic fields while maintaining its operating mode frequency at a prescribed value. The results demonstrate that the automatic simulation tool allows an efficient shape optimization procedure with minimal manual operations. All simulations were performed on the NERSC supercomputer Cori system for solution speedup."

The multi-physics simulation results provided the information needed to compute the overall frequency change from the basic 2D model to the nominal frequency during operation. The Gun-2 cathode-to-anode gap distance will be made 1 mm longer than the nominal gap with the expectation that less than 1 mm will be machined off to meet the target frequency. In this paper",

Identifying an unstable cavity out of the hundreds of cavities installed at CEBAF is difficult and time-consuming. The present RF controls for the legacy cavities report at only 1 Hz",

A fast data acquisition system for the legacy SRF cavities is being developed which samples and reports at 5 kHz to allow for detection of transients. A prototype chassis has been installed and tested in CEBAF. An autoencoder based machine learning model is being developed to identify anomalous SRF cavity behavior. The model is presently being trained on the slow (1 Hz) data that is currently available",

This paper will discuss the present status of the new fast data acquisition system and results of testing the prototype chassis.

These strikes deposit extensive energy into the mercury and its steel vessel. Prediction of the resultant loading on the target is difficult when helium gas is intentionally injected into the mercury to reduce the loading and to mitigate the pitting damage on the vessel. A 2-phase material model that incorporates the Rayleigh-Plesset (R-P) model is expected to address this complex multi-physics dynamics problem by including the bubble dynamics in the liquid mercury. We present a study comparing the measured target strains in the SNS target station with the simulation results of the solid mechanics simulation framework.

A large fraction of the high field magnets are expected to be of permanent magnet technology that will require precise magnetic measurements and field harmonics corrections. A new magnetic measurement bench has been built based on a printed circuit board (PCB) coil of 12 mm diameter and 270 mm active length. This PCB coil has the capabil-ity of measuring field quality to a level of 10 ppm of the main field up to the 15th harmonic with a sensitivity between 0.01 m2 and 0.02 m2 at the reference radius of 5 mm. This paper will describe the main features of the rotating coil bench and discuss the measurement results of a permanent-magnet Halbach quadrupole of 12.7 mm bore diameter. reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-",

Our approach first trains the CNN based on supervised learning to learn the correlations and physics constrains within a given accelerator system. The input of the CNN is a high dimensional collection of 2D phase space projections of the beam at the accelerator entrance together with a vector of accelerator parameters such as magnet and RF settings. The inputs are squeezed down to a low-dimensional latent space from which we generate the output in the form of projections of the beam’s 6D phase space at various accelerator locations. After training the CNN is applied in an unsupervised adaptive manner by comparing a subset of the output predictions to available measurements with the error guiding feedback directly in the low-dimensional latent space. We show that our approach is robust to unseen time-variation of the input beam and accelerator parameters and a study of the robustness of the method to go beyond the span of the training data.",

        "There is a strong demand for non-destructive electron Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) for non-perturbative diagnostics of the electron beam position. Challenges are related to the shortness of the electron beam and the noisy chamber environment that are typical for modern RF-driven and plasma-driven accelerators. We propose using a pair of identical high-quality quasi-optical resonators attached to opposite sides of the beam pipe. The resonators can introduce Photonic Band Gap (BPM) structures. These open resonators sustain very low numbers of high-quality modes. We intend to operate at the lowest mode among the others that are capable of being excited by the bunches. The mentioned mode has a coupling coefficient with the beam that depends on the distance between the bunch and the coupling hole. The lower this distance",
        "the higher the coupling. Therefore",
        "comparing the pick-up signals of both resonators with an oscilloscope",
        "we can determine the beam position."

This technique uses a 1-D computer model of the linac to predict the cavities’ phases. The model has been accurately calibrated using the data of the 360-degree phase scans - a common procedure for phasing of linear accelerators. The model was validated by comparison with a conventional phase scan results. The predictions applied to the linac are then verified by multiple time-of-flight energy measurements and the response of the beam position/phase monitors (BPMs) to an intentional energy and phase mismatch.

It will also probe for Axion Like Particles (ALP’s) parameter space un-tested by previous experiments and cosmological constraints",
        "and test new interpretation of the legendary LSND and MiniBooNE excesses. CCM will operate at the Lujan Center at LANSCE which is a 100-kW neutron and stopped pion source that delivers an 800-MeV proton beam onto a tungsten target at 20 Hz with a pulse width of 290 ns. The 10 ton liquid argon CCM detector is placed 23 m from the target and is instrumented with 200 fast nano-second 8\" PMT’s that can detect scattering events in time with the beam from as low as 10 keV thresholds up to 200 MeV. Initial data results will be shown demonstrating the power of the new experiment."

      "abstract": "Since 1931 major advances have enabled the production of small compact cyclotrons to be installed at hospitals and pharmacies enabling the supply of short-lived radionuclides around the world. This and the development of the generator allowed for remote access to radionuclides and the expansion of nuclear medicine. In the 1970’s and 80’s major accelerator facilities operating at 100 MeV and higher were installed in many of the national labs and used for production of radionuclides at energies and currents not available on the small compact machines. These high energy accelerators have played an important role in supplying Radionuclides such as Sr-82 used in Sr/Rb generators for cardiac imaging and Ac-225 for cancer therapy. They continue to be advanced to further production yields by installing beam rastering systems that have allowed higher intensities and thus higher production yields. As well as adding mass separation techniques that enable novel radionuclides to be produced in quality suitable for use. These enhanced accelerator capabilities and the production of these novel radionuclides will be presented.",

        "We have seen anomalies due to radiation effects in electronic devices since the mid-1970s. We group radiation effects into different categories: one of which is single-event effects (SEE). SEE are any measurable or observable change in state or performance of a microelectronic device",

Engineers require knowledge of SEE susceptibility for devices and systems since it impacts both availability and reliability. Design teams frequently use particle accelerators to simulate ionizing radiation environments. The rapid growth of systems operating in harsh radiation environments has pushed accelerator facility access constraints to the breaking point. Investments in new radiation effects testing infrastructure have begun. Meanwhile",
        "there remain unanswered questions about accelerator facility workforce and potential business model impacts on existing ecosystems. We must maintain existing facility access as while building out new capabilities",
