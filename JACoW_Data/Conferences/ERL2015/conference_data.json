            "Energy recovery linac(ERL)-based free electron lasers(FELs) are promising candidates for high-power EUV sources. They can recover most acceleration energy from the electron beams and greatly reduce the dumped beam power and activation compared with those based on ordinary linear accelerators. We have investigated a feasible design of a 10-kW class ERL-FEL operated at 13.5 nm for EUV lithography applications. In this talk",

            "The recirculating superconducting accelerator S-DALINAC provides electron beams of up to 130 MeV for nuclear physics experiments at the University of Darmstadt since 1991. It consists of a 10 MeV injector and a 40 MeV main linac and reaches its final design energy using up to two recirculation paths. The superconducting main linac houses eight 20-cell SRF cavities operated at 3 GHz and 2 K. The very low threshold current of only a few μA for the occurrence of beam break up in addition with the recirculating linac design gives a unique opportunity to the ERL community for testing different strategies of avoiding beam break up experimentally at this accelerator and to benchmark beam dynamics simulations concerning this topic. To minimize the impact of HOMs on the recirculating electron bunches we will place skew quadrupole and sextupole magnets in our accelerator and test their effect on the threshold current. We will report on the status of beam dynamics simulations concerning their use in the accelerator and present actual calculations for the positioning of the skew quadrupoles. An outlook on the future activities at the S-DALINAC will be given."

This is accomplished by the use of an 1.3 GeV Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) and two FFAG arcs which recirculate the electron bunches 16 times through the (ERL) to achieve the top energy of 21.2 GeV to collide with the hadron beam. After the interaction the e-bunches decelerate down to injection energy of 12 MeV and are sent to the beam dump. In this talk we will discuss the 3D electromagnetic field calculations and the beam optics of the low energy FFAG cell using realistic field maps obtained from the 3d OPERA [2] calculations.

It consists of a 10 MeV injector and a 40 MeV main linac and reaches its final design energy using up to two recirculation paths. The superconducting main linac houses eight 20-cell SRF cavities operated at 3 GHz and 2 K. The very low threshold current of only a few μA for the occurrence of beam break up in addition with the recirculating linac design gives a unique opportunity to the ERL community for testing different strategies of avoiding beam break up experimentally at this accelerator and to benchmark beam dynamics simulations concerning this topic. To minimize the impact of HOMs on the recirculating electron bunches we will place skew quadrupole and sextupole magnets in our accelerator and test their effect on the threshold current. We will report on the status of beam dynamics simulations concerning their use in the accelerator and present actual calculations for the positioning of the skew quadrupoles. An outlook on the future activities at the S-DALINAC will be given."

      "abstract": "The proposed eRHIC [1] accelerator accelerates the electron bunches to a maximum energy of 21.2 GeV. This is accomplished by the use of an 1.3 GeV Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) and two FFAG arcs which recirculate the electron bunches 16 times through the (ERL) to achieve the top energy of 21.2 GeV to collide with the hadron beam. After the interaction the e-bunches decelerate down to injection energy of 12 MeV and are sent to the beam dump. In this talk we will discuss the 3D electromagnetic field calculations and the beam optics of the low energy FFAG cell using realistic field maps obtained from the 3d OPERA [2] calculations.
