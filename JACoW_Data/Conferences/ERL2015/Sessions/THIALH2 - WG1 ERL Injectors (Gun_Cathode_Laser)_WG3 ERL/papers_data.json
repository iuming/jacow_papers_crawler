        "For the planed Mainzer Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz a diagnostic test-beam-line has been build up. The beam-line comprises three analyzing stations to investigate space charge caused transverse emittance growth and helicity correlated asymmetries. Furthermore a circular deflecting cavity allows to measure the longitudinal bunch intensity profile. The components and the latest results will be described and an outlook towards further applications will be given."

Several theoretical models have been developed to estimate the ion creation and clearing rates. The data is well explained by two independent simulation codes that track the motion of ions trapped in the electric field generated by the beam."
