        "and by upper-limiting the normalized transverse emittance growth to the 0.1 micron level. Chromatic aberrations and nonlinearity in the particle longitudinal dynamics are reduced with sextupole magnets. Coherent synchrotron radiation-induced emittance growth is minimized with a proper choice of beam optics and compression factor per cell. The design is supported by analytical considerations that found confirmation in particle tracking results. In this article",

The longitudinal dynamics of eRHIC ERL is essential to ensure the energy recovery efficiency and prevention of beam loss. We will present the results of the start to end simulation study for eRHIC ERL",
