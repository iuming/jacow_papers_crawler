        "The generation of the mono energetic gamma beams using Compton source will be the main topic of this presentation. It will concentrate on the gamma energy range at the giant dipole resonance for the nuclear photofission of 238U to generate rare neutrino reach nuclei. The combination of power efficiency of ERL and Compton based gamma source generating most of its power at the top energy make such source a very attractive solution. The target in the Compton sources",
        "the laser beam",
        "is indestructible. This is in contrast",
        "with a Bremsstrahlung target that will not survive any attempt to generate a hundred kilowatt in a sub millimeter gamma ray beam. Different options with laser sources from FEL to a laser enhancement cavity will be considered."
