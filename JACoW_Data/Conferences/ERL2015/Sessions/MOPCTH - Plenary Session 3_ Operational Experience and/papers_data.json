        "the first CW beams of 20 MeV were successfully transported through the recirculation loop in February 2014*. Since then",
        "various accelerator studies have been carried out. We have so far succeeded in recirculating CW beams of 30 uA through the loop with very-small beam losses. Initial emittance measurements were carried out in the recirculation loop. We also carried out commissioning of a X-ray source using the laser Compton scattering**. During these studies",

        "Energy recovery linac(ERL)-based free electron lasers(FELs) are promising candidates for high-power EUV sources. They can recover most acceleration energy from the electron beams and greatly reduce the dumped beam power and activation compared with those based on ordinary linear accelerators. We have investigated a feasible design of a 10-kW class ERL-FEL operated at 13.5 nm for EUV lithography applications. In this talk",
