The facility is laid out in a 3-pass racetrack configuration as is envisaged for the high energy ERL of the LHeC. Construction is planned in stages",
        "which would also allow the study of the beam dynamics and the operational aspects of an ERL at different levels of energy gain and energy recovery. The facility is conceived to allow at a later stage to become a scientific instrument for other applications. These applications include: 1) a beam facility for detector R&D",
        "2) the study of controlled beam induced quenches in superconducting magnets and wires 3) the use as CW free-electron lasers by adding a wiggler in a straight section 4) the use as Compton γ-ray source by adding a laser."
