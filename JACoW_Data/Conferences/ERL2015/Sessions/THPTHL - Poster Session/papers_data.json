        "In order to generate high brightness and high-current electron beams for BERLinPro",
        "an SRF photoinjector is being developed at HZB. Normal conducting CsK2Sb cathodes will be used due to their high QE at visible wavelengths and fast response time. We report on the commissioning of a preparation and analysis system that allows investigation of the surface and bulk chemical composition of the cathodes using XPS and ion scattering. In addition",
        "the design of an UHV transport system for cathodes is presented."
