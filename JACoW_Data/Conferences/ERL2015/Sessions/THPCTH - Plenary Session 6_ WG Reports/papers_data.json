        "2015. It was the sixth in the series of international workshops covering accelerator physics and technology of Energy Recovery Linacs. The workshop was organized into five working groups. Working group 2 (WG2) covered beam dynamics and optics issues of ERLs in operation as well as of proposed and future ones. Key aspects of some representatively selected talks together with the outcome of the working group discussion are summarized in this report."
