The project goal is the generation of a 50-MeV high current (100 mA) electron beam with an emittance (normalized) below 1 mm mrad and a pulse length of 2 ps rms or less. The planning phase of the project is completed and the design phase of most of the components is finished with procurement under way. The construction of the building started in February 2015. The status of the various subprojects and planned activities will be given."
