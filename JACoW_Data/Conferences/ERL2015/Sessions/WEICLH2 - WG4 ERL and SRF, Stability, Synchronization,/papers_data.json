        "proposed at BNL",
        "requires superconducting RF cavities",
        "which are able to support high average current beams. Two types of ERL lattices were designed for eRHIC. The first one is a conventional lattice",
        "and the other one is a non-scaling FFAG lattice",
        "which was proposed recently. For the conventional lattice with up to eight ERL passes",
        "a 704 MHz 5-cell BNL3 cavity was designed",
        "fabricated and tested vertically at BNL. The FFAG-based eRHIC design requires a high-current low-frequency SRF energy recovery linac with up to 16 passes. A 422 MHz 5-cell cavity (BNL4) was designed for for this lattice. This paper addresses development of the SRF cavities for eRHIC",
        "including the cavity design",
        "fabrication and test results. Beam-break-up (BBU) analysis for these cavities is presented as well. An HOM damping scheme for achiving low higher-order-modes’ impedance is proposed. HOM couplers were designed for these high current SRF cavities. HOM coupler prototypes were fabricated and tested.",

        "we adopt a circulator ring to reuse the electron bunches. The electron bunches will recirculate for 25 turns",
        "thus the current in the ERL can be reduced by a factor of 25. An ultra-fast kicker is required for this circulator ring",
        "with pulse width less than 2.1 ns and high repetition frequency. JLab started an LDRD proposal to develop such a kicker. Our approach is to generate a series harmonic mode with RF resonant cavities",
        "thus every 25th bunch will be kicked while all the other bunches un-kicked. Here we present a design of a simplified prototype with every 10th bunch kicked",
        "using 4 cavities to generate 10 harmonic modes. Cavity structure is optimized to get the highest shunt impedance",
        "thus the total power dissipated on 4 cavities for copper material is only 87.72 W",
        "two to three orders of magnitude lower than a strip-line kicker."
