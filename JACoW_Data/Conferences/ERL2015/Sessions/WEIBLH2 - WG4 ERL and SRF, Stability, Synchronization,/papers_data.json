        "Cornell University has finished building a 10 m long superconducting accelerator module as a prototype of the main linac of a proposed ERL facility. This module houses 6 superconducting cavities- operated at 1.8 K in continuous wave (CW) mode - with individual HOM absorbers and one magnet/ BPM section. In pushing the limits",
        "a high quality factor of the cavities (2•1010) and high beam currents (100 mA accelerated plus 100 mA decelerated) were targeted. We will review the design shortly and present the results of the components tested before the assembly. This includes data of the quality-factors of all 6 cavities that we produced and treated in-house",
        "the HOM absorber performance measured with beam on a test set-up as well as testing of the couplers and the tuners."

        "We developed ERL injector cryomodule and main linac for Compact ERL (cERL) project. The injector cryomodule includes three 2-cell L-band superconducting cavities. The main linac cryomodule includes two 9-cell L-band superconducting cavities. After construction of cERL injector and recirculaton loop",
        "beam operation was started with 20 MeV beam and after precise beam tuning",
        "energy recovery operation was achieved with more than 80uA. Injector and main linac cavity were stable for ERL beam operation with Digital LLRF system. Field emission is the severe problem for main linac and heating of HOM coupler is the problem for injector. We mainly describe the cavity performances of two cERL cryomodules during long-term beam operation."

        "slotted cavity was proposed in 2010. And the test prototype cavity made of pure niobium was fabricated in 2014. The room temperature RF test shows the cavity has extreme low HOM impedance and very high HOM damping. 4.2 K vertical test was done in March",
