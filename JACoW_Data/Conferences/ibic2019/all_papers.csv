During the so-called Phase B; the accelerator is operating with a high current pulsed proton and deuteron. The Phase B operation has the goals of fulfilling an exhaustive characterization of equipment and machine parameters in pulsed beam operation up to 5 MeV and 125 mA at Low Duty Cycle. The LIPAc beam diagnostics are aimed to demonstrate at this first stage of the commissioning the correct performance of the accelerator and are used for a complete characterization of the accelerator matching and tuning parameters. The characterization and calibration of beam diagnostics developed are providing relevant feedback of the accelerator operation. Measurements of the centroid position; beam profile; energy; intensity or emittance have been acquired and analyzed.

In the new high intensity hadron facilities even low energy beam can damage or activate the materials so the detection of small losses in this region is very important. A new type of neutron beam loss monitor has been developed specifically targeting this region; where only neutrons and photons can be produced and where typical BLM; based on charged particle detection; could not be appropriate because of the photon background due to the RF cavities. The BLM proposed is based on gaseous Micromegas detectors; designed to be sensitive to fast neutrons and with little sensitivity to photons. Development of the detectors presented here has been done to fulfil the requirements of ESS and they will be part of the ESS-BI systems. The detector has been presented in previous editions of the conference.

In order to describe the behavior of all electron bunches completely and accurately; a precisely bunch-by-bunch charge monitor has been developed at SSRF. Method called two-point equilibrium sampling is introduced to avoid the influence of longitudinal oscillation on the sampling point; thanks to this; the resolution of the BCM was below 0.2 pC. Utilizing the advantages of BCM’s high refresh rate and high resolution; the system can meet the requirement of monitor the bunch-by-bunch beam lifetime; measure touschek lifetime and vacuum lifetime.

Frascati; Frascati (Roma); Italy; In this work the design of a passive cavity beam intensity monitor to be used in the TOP-IMPLART medical proton linac for the on-line measurement of beam current is presented. It will be used to monitor the beam between modules and at the linac exit. TOP-IMPLART produces a pulsed proton beam with 3 us duration at 200 Hz repetition rate with a current between 0.1 uA and 50 uA. The current required for medical applications is less than 1 uA and has to be known with an accuracy better than 5%. Large dynamic range and space constraints make the use of usual non-interceptive beam diagnostics unfeasible. The proposed system consists of a resonant cavity working in the TM010 mode; generating an electromagnetic field when the beam enters the cavity; a magnetic pickup senses an RF pulse whose amplitude is proportional to the current. The RF pulse is amplified and subsequently detected with zero-biased Schottky diodes. The cavity operates in vacuum when used in the inter-module space. The work reports also the results of preliminary measurements done on an copper prototype in air at the exit of the TOP-IMPLART linac to test the sensitivity of the system on the actual 35 MeV proton beam.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/moco02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/moco02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/moco02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-MOCO02,41
ibic2019,,MOCO03,Estimation of Longitudinal Profiles of Ion Bunches in the LHC Using Schottky-Based Diagnostics,K. Łasocha; D. Alvespresenter; CERN; Meyrin; Switzerland; The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Schottky monitors have been designed to measure various parameters of relevance to beam quality; namely tune; momentum spread and chromaticity. We present another application of this instrument - the evaluation of longitudinal bunch profiles. The relation between the distribution of synchrotron amplitudes within the bunch population and the longitudinal bunch profile is derived from probabilistic principles. Our approach; limited to bunched beams with no intra-bunch coherent motion; initially fits the cumulative power spectral density of acquired Schottky spectra with the underlying distribution of synchrotron amplitudes. The result of this fit is then used to reconstruct the bunch profile using the derived model. The results obtained are verified by a comparison with measurements from the LHC Wall Current Monitors.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/moco03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/moco03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/moco03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-MOCO03,45

This involves co-existing electron bunches with significant variations of bunch-length; bunch charge as well as charge density. Among many other boundary conditions; this calls for bunch resolved measurements with sub-ps time resolution and micrometer spatial resolution. Currently; we are constructing a diagnostic platform connected to three new dipole beamlines for visible light as well as THz measurements. The mid-term aim is a 24/7 use of beam-diagnostic tools and the development of advanced methods for specific purposes. Recently; we have set-up a sub-ps streak camera* and we are investigating other innovative methods for bunch-length** as well as lateral size determination using visible light*** at the first of our new diagnostic dipole beamlines.

This is achieved by combining a high-droop current transformer with low-noise sample-and-hold electronics. Thanks to a fast response time on the microseconds level the system can be applied not only to CW beams but also macropulses. Pulse repetition rates may range from 10MHz to 500MHz; rendering CWCT and BCM-CW-E suitable for a wide variety of accelerators.

All parameters of the LINAC which influence the RF power (as e.g. the high voltage at modulator) as well as the number of charged particles in a bunch to be accelerated (as e.g. via gun emission) also change the beam energy. To measure the energy during the preparation or optimization of a beam; a Multi-Leaf Faraday Cup (MLFC) was developed. This MLFC allows the measurement of energy and pulse charge in real time; so the influence of the manipulated variables on energy and beam power can be immediately assessed. The MLFC consists of 128 electrically isolated Al plates where the thickness of the entire stack is sufficient to stop a 50 MeV electron beam. After each beam pulse; the charge collected by the Al plates is recorded sequentially. The MLFC was calibrated with monoenergetic electron beams at output of a magnetic spectrometer. Then the MLFC was installed at the end of the accelerator structure. From the recorded charge distributions; the corresponding energy is determined in real time and displayed for each beam pulse.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/mopp004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/mopp004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/mopp004_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-MOPP004,67

ibic2019,,MOPP009,Retrieving Beam Current Waveforms from ACCT Output Using Experimental Response Function for Use in Long Pulse Accelerators,Y. Hirata; J. Franco Campos; A. Kasugai; QST; Aomori; Japan; Current transformers (ACCT/DCCT) are used as non-interceptive means of beam current measurement in many accelerators. In the case of long pulse to CW accelerators for fusion neutron sources such as IFMIF; A-FNS; etc.; current measurement using current transformers for pulses with around 10-100 ms or longer suffer such problems as drooping and the measurement accuracy is deteriorated. So; improving the accuracy for long pulse beams is highly required. We have proposed a method for retrieving the beam currents from the ACCT output using the transfer function obtainable from simple experiments. It was confirmed from numerical calculation that beam currents longer than a second could be theoretically retrieved*. The effects of associated circuits and cables such as stray capacitance; inductance and magnetic materials nearby are inherently included in the transfer function. We are working for implementing this method into FPGA. For calculation convenience; the transfer function is converted into a form of impulse function and the convolution with the digitized ACCT output is to be carried out to retrieve the beam current.

A vacuum chamber for the new DCCT was designed based on a circular duct with an inner diameter of 100 mm and has a structure housing a toroidal core inside of electromagnetic shields. The geometry of the ceramic break for interrupting the wall current flow was optimized using a three-dimensional electromagnetic field simulator; and the break was fabricated considering some technical limitations. Both ends of the ceramic break were short-circuited in a high-frequency manner by a sheet-like capacitive structure to suppress the radiation of unneeded higher-order modes (HOMs) into the core housing. The ceramic break is also equipped with water-cooling pipes on metal sleeves brazed to the both ends to efficiently remove the heat generated by HOMs. The new DCCT chamber has been used already in user operation without any problems. A temperature rise near the ceramic break is still approximately six degrees Celsius; even when a 50-mA isolated bunch is stored.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/mopp010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/mopp010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/mopp010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-MOPP010,91

BLMs installed in the SASE undulator intersections show high signals at electron energy higher 16 GeV or photon energy higher 14 keV due to background synchrotron radiation which directly affects the PMT. The amplitude of this signal can get that high that; also without using any scintillating material; the BLMs get blind for real losses. Also different lead arrangements did not shield the signal sufficiently. First tests show that a Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) is not affected.

Beamline detectors operating in the 100-1000Hz regime are becoming common; and the X-ray beam stability demanded by beamlines is thus of comparable bandwidths. In this paper we present a feedback system operating at these bandwidths; using a diagnostic instrument permanently installed in the X-ray beam path to measure the error in beam position at the sample point; and fast air-cored magnets to apply a small modulation to the electron beam to compensate. Four magnets are used to generate electron beam bumps through an ID straight. This modulation of the beam away from the nominal orbit is small; less than 10 microns; but should be sufficient to compensate for the bulk of the X-ray motion observed at the sample. It is small enough that the impact on the machine will be negligible.

Experimental needs and radiation protection apply strict requirements on the beam quality control and regulation of the spill. The objective of the Spill Regulation System (SRS) is to maintain the intensity uniformity of a stream of ~25K pulses as 1012 protons are extracted at 590.08kHz over a 43msec spill period. To meet the specified performance; two regulation elements will be driven simultaneously: a family of three zero-harmonic quadrupoles (tune ramp quads) and a RF Knock-Out (RFKO) system.

Although the beam quality of LWFA is still significantly lower than provided by conventional accelerators; with persistent progress seen in the area of laser plasma acceleration; they have a great potential to be considered the new generation drivers for FELs and even colliders. A new LWFA based FEL project called ""LUIS"" is currently being commissioned at ELI-beamlines in Czech Republic. LUIS aims to demonstrate a stable generation of X-ray photons with a wavelengths of 6 nm and lower; suitable for user applications. Electron beam diagnostics are absolutely crucial for achieving LUIS’s aims. Low charge; poor beam stability and other beam properties inherent for a LWFA require rethinking and adaptation of the conventional diagnostic tools and; in some cases; development of new ones. In this paper we provide an overview of the electron beam instrumentation in LUIS with a focus on the current challenges and some discussion of the foreseen future developments.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/mopp035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/mopp035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/mopp035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-MOPP035,184

The driver linac is divided into several sections: low energy superconducting linac SCL1 for stable ions and SCL3 for rare isotopes; charge stripper section; and high energy superconducting linac (SCL2). Various types of beam diagnostic devices such as beam current monitor; beam position monitor; beam profile monitor; beam phase monitor; and beam loss monitor; etc. are required for the setting of accelerator parameters; the monitoring and control of beam acceleration and transport; and improvement of accelerator system. The arrangement of beam diagnostic devices was initially based on the result of beam dynamics calculation; and now the overall layout becomes almost settled. More than 600 devices will be installed for commissioning and normal operation.

The proton beam irradiation facilities could provide the proton beam and the available proton energy range is from 20 MeV to 100 MeV. The proton irradiation is performed in the air; therefore; the intensity and profile and position of provided proton beam should be measured in the air. For in-situ beam intensity and profile monitoring; in-air type ACCT; the large area transmission ionization chamber and multi-wire grid were adopted to the new experimental set-up for the proton beam irradiation test.

The 4-GeV; 120-kW beam has a maximum rate of nearly 1 MHz and can be switched pulse-by-pulse to either of two undulators; to generate hard and soft x rays. Two detector types measure beam losses. Point beam-loss monitors (PBLMs) set limits at critical loss points: septa; beam stoppers and dumps; halo collimators; protection collimators (which normally receive no loss); and zones with weak shielding. PBLMs are generally single-crystal diamond detectors; except at the gun; where a scintillator on a PMT is more sensitive to the low-energy (1 MeV) beam. Long beam-loss monitors (LBLMs) use 200-m lengths of radiation-hard optical fiber; each coupled to a PMT; to capture Cherenkov light from loss showers. LBLMs protect the entire 4-km path from gun to beam dump and locate loss points. In most regions two fibers provide redundancy and view the beam from different angles.

ibic2019,,TUBO03,Challenges in Continuous Beam Profile Monitoring for MW-Power Proton Beams,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; Continuous beam profile monitoring of the high-power proton beam is essential for protection of beamline equipment; as well as for producing high-quality physics results; in fixed-target extraction beamlines. Challenges in continuous profile monitoring include degradation of materials after long-term exposure to the proton beam; as well as beam loss due to that material intercepting the beam; which can additionally cause activation of nearby equipment. An overview of various profile monitoring techniques used in high-power neutrino extraction beamlines; issues faced so far at beam powers up to several hundred kW; and some possible future profile monitoring solutions for MW-class beamlines will be shown.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tubo03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tubo03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tubo03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUBO03,253

Ionization electrons (or ions) are transported by an electrostatic field onto an imaging detector; where the spatial distribution of detected electrons is a direct measure of the transverse beam profile. The detector typically consists of one or more Micro-Channel Plates (MCP’s) to amplify the signal; followed by either a phosphor screen and camera; or pickup electrodes. A long-standing problem is the ageing of the MCP’s; which limits the accuracy of the beam profile measurement. A new technique to detect ionization electrons has been developed at CERN; which uses a hybrid pixel detector to detect single ionisation electrons. This allows the application of counting statistics to the beam profile measurement. It will be shown that a meaningful beam profile can be extracted from only 100 electrons. Results from the new instrument will be presented; which demonstrate the ability to measure the beam profile of single bunches turn-by-turn; which offers new opportunities for beam diagnostic insights.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tubo04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tubo04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tubo04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUBO04,257
ibic2019,,TUCO01,Terahertz-Based Sub-femtosecond Metrology of Relativistic Electron Beams,TUB; Beijing; People’s Republic of China; High brightness; ultrashort electron beams are driving various advanced scientific instruments. As we push the limits of electron beams in the time domain; the challenges include not only generating the shortest possible pulse durations; but also precisely controlling or characterizing the timing of electron beams relative to optical pulses. The optical pulses can be for example the pump laser in ultrafast electron diffraction; or the drive laser in external-injection laser plasma accelerators; etc. It is not feasible to characterize the timing between electron and laser pulses to fs level using an rf-based approach; due to the phase jitter of rf sources relative to lasers. With a laser-generated THz streaking field; the timing of electron beams can be determined at sub-fs level and the pulse duration at single fs level on a shot-by-shot basis. Showing that THz compression can significantly reduce the pulse duration and intrinsically stabilize the timing jitter of electron beams. We believe that time-domain manipulation of relativistic electron beams using laser-generated THz can significantly boost the performance of electron beam-based instruments for ultrafast science.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tuco01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tuco01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tuco01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUCO01,

In current work we conducted experiments on CCR generation; observation and it further spectral analysis at 0.1-30 THz spectral range. All experimental work was at CLARA (beam area 1) facility (~50 MeV beam energy at up to 10 Hz pulse repetition rate with sub-ps bunch length). Inside of vacuum chamber we developed movable platform where both VCR and TR target were placed; which is allows us to observe both effects during one accelerator run. For spectral analysis we used Martin-Pupplet interferometer as it provides higher signal to noise ratio and allows us to perform instabilities normalisation. As a result we will demonstrate a selection of interferograms and spectrums (as well as reconstructed longitudinal beam profiles) for different machine setups and distances between charged particle beam and Cherenkov target.

For a beam-based feedback control of the linear accelerator; bunch arrival-time monitors are required that are capable of reaching measurement resolutions better than the stated timing stability goals. We report on our electro-optical bunch arrival-time monitors now achieving a time resolution better than 3 fs. This new level of precision is a first step towards the ultimate goal of reaching sub-femtosecond timing stability. The system has also been upgraded to allow for multi-beam line operation with large variations of the bunch arrival times for the different pulse trains.

A transport line; comprising quadrupole lenses; rebuncher cavities; beam correctors and sufficient beam instrumentation has been built to deliver the beam from the GSI 1.4 MeV/u High Charge Injector (HLI) to the Advanced Demonstrator; which offers a test environment for SC CW multigap cavities. In order to achieve proper phase space matching; the beam from the HLI must be characterized in detail. In a dedicated machine experiment the bunch shape has been measured with a non destructive bunch shape monitor (BSM). The BSM offers a sufficient spatial resolution to use it for reconstruction of the energy spread. Therefore; different bunch projections were obtained by altering the voltage of two rebunchers. These measurements were combined with dedicated beam dynamics simulations using the particle tracking code Dynamion.

Due to only a couple of picoseconds time measurement range of this system; large timing changes might cause the monitor to fail. To remove any ambiguity and for health status monitoring a high-speed direct-sampling FPGA mezzanine card (FMC) and an analogue RF front-end was added. The circuitry has lower precision than the electro-optical based BAM; but it can determine bunch arrival time with respect to a reference signal over a large time range; i.e. of the order of 1 ms. After restarts or larger energy changes during operation; the electron bunch arrival time may have been changed by tens or even hundreds of picoseconds; which causes that the BAM is out of its operation range and needs to be recalibrated. With the solution developed; the BAM gets the coarse bunch timing from the digitizer and adjusts its optical delay lines accordingly. This allows for finding the operation point fast and automatically. Performance data of the fast direct-sampling digitizer FMC and first measurement data from FLASH will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tupp002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tupp002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tupp002_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUPP002,275

This system was designed to be highly flexible and scalable to meet the variety of equipment and configurations at ATLAS. The current FGPA-based system is reliable and fast; but is very difficult to maintain and upgrade. Particular attention was paid to the signal distribution to promote standard cable connections; minimize the usage of terminal blocks; and reduce the time to troubleshoot problematic channels. The system monitors the status of fast acting relays for interlock or control purposes; and utilizes RS-485 communication to gather lower priority information such as pump speeds or vacuum pressure readouts.

At modern linac based electron machines with ultrashort bunches as the European XFEL in Hamburg (Germany); scintillators help to overcome the limitation of standard OTR based monitors imposed by the emission of coherent radiation. The XFEL injector section is equipped with four off-axis screens allowing to perform online beam profile diagnostics; i.e. a single bunch out of a bunch train is kicked onto the screen and the profile is analyzed. However; during user operation a decrease of the SASE level was observed in cases that one of the of-axis screens was used. The observation is explained by charging of the scintillator screen: each deflected bunch hitting the screens causes ionization and charging of the screen. The scintillator as good insulator keeps the charge for some time such that the non-deflected part of the bunch-train feels their Coulomb force and experiences a kick; resulting in a drop of the SASE level. This report summarizes the observations at the European XFEL and introduces a simple model for quantification of this effect.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tupp011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tupp011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tupp011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUPP011,308

The reason is that a standard OTR beam profile monitor with a few micrometers space resolution cannot be used for measurements of ultrashort bunch profiles due to coherent effects in the OTR emission process [***]. We have developed an approach which allows calculating the propagation of coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) through a standard optical system consisting of a focusing lens and a spatial resolving detector placed in the image plane. Strict summation of the OTR fields emitted coherently by electrons inside the bunch and its focusing onto the detector plane allows obtaining a COTR image of the bunch profile. With the assumption of a Gaussian transverse bunch profile it is shown that the resulting image has a typical ""ring"" shape; characteristics of which are depended on the bunch transverse rms size and optical system parameters.; * E.

Transverse projected emittance measurements are carried out by a single-slit scan technique in order to suppress space charge effects at an energy of ~20 MeV. Previous slice emittance measurements; which employed the emittance measurement in conjunction with a transverse deflecting structure; suffer from limited time resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to a long drift space from the mask to the observation screen. Recent experimental studies at PITZ show improvement of the temporal resolution and SNR by utilizing quadrupole magnets between the mask and the screen.

We used the same COTR suppression geometry that we had already implemented on our intra undulator screens and YAG:Ce as scintillating material. Screen based transverse profile diagnostics provide single shot measurements with a typical resolution of the order of tens of microns mainly due to refraction effects; geometry and other physical material properties.

The SFP is a profile and position monitor; whose sensitive part is made up of two harps of scintillating fibers. Each fiber is readout by a cell of a photodiode array. The SFP has been developed from the Scintillating Fibers Harp (SFH) detector; the monitor presently installed along the CNAO extraction lines. The passage to the SFP results in a significant advantage in terms of cost; dimension; acquisition rate speed and flexibility. On 19th May 2019 the first beam was extracted in the CNAO experimental room and first in line beam measurement was performed with the SFP.

The beryllium extraction mirrors used for the synchrotron radiation (SR) monitors at KEKB suffered from heat distortion due to incident SR; leading to systematic changes in magnification with beam current; and necessitating continuous monitoring and compensation of such distortions in order to correctly measure the beam sizes.* To minimize such mirror distortions; quasi-monocrystalline CVD diamond mirrors have been designed and installed at SuperKEKB.** Diamond has a very high heat conductance and a low thermal expansion coefficient. With such mirrors it is hoped to reduce the beam current-dependent magnification to the level of a few percent at SuperKEKB. Preliminary measurements of mirror distortion during SuperKEKB commissioning show very promising results with regard to thermal performance; though full beam currents have not yet been stored in the SuperKEKB rings. Measurements of the thermal deformation of the diamond mirrors will be presented in this paper; along with a description of the design of the mirrors and their mounts; and issues encountered during commissioning.; *M.

Wire scanners are employed to measure Twiss parameters and to adjust beam optics conditions. Screen monitors also play important roles for single-shot measurements. However; the beam size became more than 10-times smaller compared with that of the KEKB injection. Beam tests have been performed in order to evaluate materials for high-precision transverse beam-size measurements at the injector. The main purpose of the beam tests is to quantitatively investigate the saturation effect of each screen material for generating the scintillation light; which is strongly depending on the beam-charge density. Several scintillating screen materials including YAG:Ce; LYSO:Ce; BGO and aluminum ceramic have been tested with high energy and high charge-density electron beams. The results are compared with that obtained by the OTR measurement. The saturation of the luminescence was confirmed for all crystals and evaluated in the charge density of 0.5-1.5 nC/mm2.

After injection; the beam widths of the first ~20 bunched beams are analysed to correct the Quadruple oscillation. While only a few dozen profiles are required for this correction; the present IPM auto-matically measures all bunched beams; more than 2·106 bunches from injection to the extraction; because the present IPM operates using DC. This system is unde-sirable due to the limited lifetime of the Micro Channel Plate (MCP) detector; the more particles the MCP senses; the more it loses gain flatness and thus lifetime. To improve this situation; a gated IPM system has been developed; in which the High Voltage (HV) is operated in pulse mode. Results of performance analysis of a new HV power supply; improvement of the electrodes; and particle-tracking simulation considering the space-charge-electric field of the bunched beam are de-scribed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tupp020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tupp020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tupp020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUPP020,343

It is possible to measure the transverse moments of beams from the induced voltages. A beam size is calculated from these in two locations with different values of beta functions. Beam-monitors such as a Flying Wire Monitor and an Ionization Profile Monitor (IPM) are already installed. However; the two monitors have issues in measuring higher intensity beams. The former is that the wire gets easily burned out and the latter is that there is a sign of the saturation by a space charge effect. Therefore; these aim at measuring the sizes of high intensity proton beams up to 4.2·10+13 protons/bunch; which corresponds to 1.3 MW in 1.16 s cycle operation of the MR. Furthermore; with high accuracy measurements; the injection mismatch from the RCS is to be decreased. In the beam test in February 2019; the signal-noise ratio (SNR) of this monitor in bunch-by-bunch measurements was nearly 40 dB and lower than the SNR > 50 dB which is comparable to IPM. To improve the SNR; we developed new LPFs for anti-aliasing and improved signal processing. In addition; the second monitor will be installed in August 2019 and tested with beams in November.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tupp021_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tupp021.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tupp021_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUPP021,347

One of the important developments is to improve the transport system of the injection beam line. The transport efficiencies tend to decrease as beam intensities increase. To solve this problem; we developed the calculation method to trace a beam trajectory with a four-dimensional (4D) beam emittance measured by pepper-pot emittance monitor (PEM) as initial value. The reason for using the 4D beam emittance is that the transport system has rotating quadrupole magnets and solenoid coils; and that the space charge effect can be introduced. The beams through a pepper-pot mask can be detected on the potassium bromide fluorescent plate inclined 45 degree to the beam to be recorded by digital camera using developed PEM. We compared the calculated beam trajectory with the measurement of other beam diagnostics and quantified the degree of fit. It has been found that the degree of fit is improved by changing fiducial points on the fluorescent plate and optimizing the thickness of the fluorescent agent and the exposure time and gain of the digital camera.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tupp022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tupp022.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tupp022_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUPP022,351

Thus it was difficult to measure the beam profile of francium hidden by these ions. We installed two beam profile monitor consisted of the micro-channel plate and phosphor screen. If we stop the beam after the beam injection to the monitor in sufficient time; we can only observe the fluorescence of the alpha particle emitted by francium atoms on the surface of the plates.

The Branch of URSC - ISDE and FLNR of JINR have created and operate the only in Russia test facilities based on the FLNR JINR accelerators allowing for heavy ion irradiation over a large area up to 200x200 mm. During simultaneous irradiation of several electronic components with heavy ions; it is necessary to ensure the device under test (DUT) location within the area of minimal nonuniformity. This problem is being solved by pretest determination of the irradiation field nonuniformity for each type of ion (Ne; Ar; Kr; Xe; Bi) and nonuniformity validation every 12 hours. Fluence is determined by a metrologically certified method using track detectors. In order to visualize the irradiation field nonuniformity; additional experiments were carried out with the irradiation of track detec-tors covering the entire irradiation area for each ion species. Based on the data obtained; a map of nonuniformity was plotted; which allows us to conclude that nonuniformity does not exceed 10% in the most frequently used areas of the irradiation field (100x150 mm) during SEE testing.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tupp030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tupp030.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tupp030_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUPP030,381

To this end; we have designed a suite of instruments which provide measurement of the beam characteristics in a drift space a few meters from the target. Two of these instruments; the APTerure Monitor (APTM) and the GRID are presented. The APTM is designed to measure the fraction of beam going through the defined aperture; its time acquisition ranges from intra-pulse at µs sampling rate to many pulses over seconds. The GRID measures the projected horizontal and vertical profiles; sampling the pulse at 1MHz. A prototype of these two instruments has been designed and installed in the 3NBT dump line of J-PARC. They are designed to test functionality of these instruments in a similar environment as ESS. The 3NBT Dump line at J-PARC presents such an environment.

To allow for detailed benchmarking studies; an IPM has been installed in Extracted Proton Beamline 1 (EPB1); enabling comparison with secondary emission (SEM) grid measurements. However; the IPM measurements taken in EPB1 show increased levels of profile broadening at operational beam intensities; which are not reproduced by SEM measurements or simulation.

Due to the reduction in beam emittance expected for the many fourth generation machine upgrades; the spatial resolution of the pinhole camera must be improved accordingly. It is well known that there are many contributions to the point spread function. However; a significant contribution arises from diffraction by the pinhole aperture. Given that diffraction is dependent on the spectral distribution of the incident synchrotron radiation; the spatial resolution can be improved by using a monochromatic beam. For optimal performance; the photon energy should be matched to the pinhole aperture size. Here we investigate the spatial resolution of the pinhole camera as a function of photon energy using a multi-layer monochromator.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/tupp038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/tupp038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/tupp038_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-TUPP038,417

Beam propagation off axis in these cavities can result in both long-range and short-range transverse wakefields which can lead to emittance dilution within the macropulses and micropulses; respectively. Two configurations of a Hamamatsu C5680 streak camera viewing a downstream OTR screen were utilized to track centroid shifts during the macropulse (framing mode) for the long-range case and during the micropulse for the short-range case (~10-micron spatial resolution and 2-ps temporal resolution). Steering off axis before CC1; resulted in a 100-kHz bunch centroid oscillation within the macropulse that was detected by the downstream rf BPMs and the streak camera*. At 500 pC/b; 50b; and 4-mrad off-axis vertical steering into CC2; we observed an ~ 100-micron head-tail centroid shift in the streak camera image y(t) profiles which we attributed to a short-range wakefield effect.

So far; this system has used only visible light cameras; which are optimal for orbit measurements but do not provide turn-by-turn temporal resolution needed for beam dynamics analysis. Current electrostatic BPM system; while capable of turn-by-turn acquisition; will be pushed to its limits of accuracy and linearity by the requirements of planned nonlinear integrable optics experiments; and furthermore does not provide transverse profile data. To address these drawbacks; we present in this paper the design of a turn-by-turn BPM system based on a multi-anode photomultiplier detector.

Re-matching the enlarged beam phase space into successive re-circulation arcs minimizes this emittance growth but requires knowledge of the actual beam distribution. This is now accomplished through quadrupole scans using wire profile monitors; the most time-consuming activity in our setup process.

The highest bunch repetition rate is 4.5 MHz; this corresponds to a minimum time separation of 222 ns. The measurement of the beam properties for each bunch in a train is required.

All BPM types (button, re-entrant and cavity) fulfill this requirement except a few button BPMs installed inside of the cold accelerator module, where Pile-Up from the train can be observed. To identify the cause of this effect we measured the S-parameters during a shutdown of the accelerator, compared it with a similar BPM at the FLASH accelerator but located in a warm section and finally measured the spectrum of the button signal during beam operation.

The recombination after the pickup results in an interference pattern that changes as a bunch passes by; due to the electro-optic response of the crystal to the image field. This technique enhances the sensitivity to the field and improves control of the working point. Results from high intensity beams at the SPS are presented. These include a comparison between two different interferometric configurations that were tested on different pickups with similar beam conditions. The stability is assessed by frequency scanning interferometry during beam operation.,"Funding: Work supported by UK STFC grants ST/N001583/1, JAI at Royal Holloway University of London and CERN.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/weao04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/weao04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/weao04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-WEAO04,457

Despite the advertised advantages in terms of system manageability; high availability; backplane performance and supply of high quality COTS modules by industry; the standard still lacks a greater acceptance in the accelerators community. This paper reports on the deployment of MicroTCA.4 systems at Sirius light source; which comprised the development and manufacturing of several open hardware modules; development of a generic gateware/software framework and re-implementation of MMC IPMI firmware as an open source project. A special focus will be given to the difficulties found; unforeseen expansions of the system and general architectural aspects.

Requirements for the BPM system are a high single-pass BPM resolution of better than 100 µm for a 100 pC injected bunch to achieve first-turn steering in the commissioning of the upgraded ring and a highly stable COD BPM within 5 µm error for 1 month to maintain the optical axis of brilliant x-rays for users [**]. We designed an rf front-end rear transition module (RTM) having band-pass filters; low-noise amplifiers; step attenuators; and calibration tone generators. The rf signal is detected by a 16-bit 370 MSPS high-speed digitizer advanced mezzanine card (AMC) developed for the new low-level rf system of SPring-8 [***]. The firmware of the FPGA on the digitizer AMC was newly developed to implement various functions of the BPM system. We evaluated the readout system at a laboratory and then tested at the present SPring-8 storage ring with a prototype BPM head for the SPring-8 upgrade. We confirmed that the new readout system satisfies the requirements for the single-pass BPM resolution and the COD BPM stability.; * SPring-8-II Conceptual Design Report; http://rsc.riken.jp/pdf/SPring-8-II.pdf  ** H.

The most important support for the operators is to assist the beam setup and controlling with reinforcement learning using artificial neural networks. A particle accelerator has a very large parameter space with often hidden relationships between them. Therefore neural networks are a suited instrument to use for approximating the needed value function which represents the value of a certain action in a certain state. Different neural network structures and their training with reinforcement learning are currently tested with simulations. Also there are different candidates for the reinforcement learning algorithms such as Deep-Q-Networks (DQN) or Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradient (DDPG).

The transverse (and longitudinal) tune response is measured by sweeping an excitation across the range of possible tune frequencies and synchronously measuring the IQ response. The multi-pole resonator model is a good fit to the measured behaviour; but the fitting process is surprisingly challenging. Problems include noisy measurements; very complex beam responses in the presence of increasing chromaticity; poor data when the beam is close to instability; and a number of challenges with the stability of the algorithm. The tune fitting algorithm now in use at Diamond has been developed and refined over many years. It is finally stable enough to work reliably throughout most beam operating conditions. The algorithm involves alternating peak finding and non-linear fitting; with a fairly naive mathematical approach; the main focus is on providing reliable results.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/weco03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/weco03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/weco03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-WECO03,490

While such measurement condition is challenging; a position resolution of 3 micrometer in one standard deviation was successfully achieved with beam-based tests. The self-calibration system is also installed in order to compensate gain drifts for each input channel with an accuracy down to 0.1%; by using test pulses going through stripline heads between 50-Hz beam pulses.

This method is called Virtual Pepper-Pot (VPP); because key principles of the pepper-pot mask scheme are applied. The latter approach is of limited use in high-brightness photo injectors; because of technical reasons. At PITZ a slit scan method instead is the standard tool for reconstruction of horizontal and vertical phase spaces. The VPP method extends the slit scan technique with a special post-processing. The 4D transverse phase space is reconstructed from a pepper-pot like pattern that is generated by crossing each measured horizontal slit beamlet with all measured vertical slit beamlets. All elements of the 4D transverse beam matrix are calculated and applied to obtain the 4D transverse emittance; 4D kinematic beam invariant and coupling factors. The proposed technique has been applied to experimental data from the PITZ photo injector optimization for 0.5 nC bunch charge.

For efficient transmutation of the MA; a precise pre-diction of neutronics of ADS is required. In order to obtain the neutronics data for the ADS; the Japan Pro-ton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) has a plan to build the Transmutation Physics Experimental Facility (TEF-P); in which a 400-MeV negative proton (H−) beam will be delivered from the J-PARC linac. Since the TEF-P requires a stable proton beam with a power of less than 10 W; a stable and meticulous beam extraction method is required to extract a small amount of the proton beam from the high power beam of 250 kW. To fulfil this requirement; the Laser Charge Exchange (LCE) method has been developed. To demonstrate the long beam pulse extraction using the bright continuous laser beam with a power of 196 W; we installed the LCE device at the end of a 3-MeV linac.

As well as with transverse optics; the settings for the RF cavities have to be established and phase and amplitude seen by the beam must be determined in order to guarantee a stable motion in the longitudinal plane. This work presents an extension of the most widely used phase scan method; relying on time-of-flight; using only transverse positions measured at a few selected BPMs downstream of the cavity being scanned. In principle; the method can be applied both to normal conducting and SC. The suggested method is fast and relatively simple and is capable to provide the values for the cavity transverse misalignment (offsets and tilts) at the same time. It can be a useful part of the initial longitudinal beam tuning.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/wepp033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/wepp033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/wepp033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-WEPP033,605
ibic2019,,WEPP034,Optics-Measurement-Based BPM Calibration,A. García-Tabarés Valdivieso; R. Tomás; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Beam position monitors (BPMs) are key elements in accelerator operation; providing essential information about different beam parameters that are directly related to the accelerator performance. In order to obtain an accurate conversion from an induced voltage to the center of charge position; the BPMs have to be calibrated prior to its installation in the accelerator. This calibration procedure can only be performed when the accelerator is in a period of non-activity and does not completely reproduce the exact conditions that occur during the machine operation. Discrepancies observed during the optics measurements at the Large Hadron Collider and the Proton Synchrotron Booster show that the impact of the BPM calibration factors on the optics functions was greater than expected from the design values and tolerances. Measurement of the optics functions allows obtaining extra information on BPM calibration together with its associated uncertainty and resolution. The optics measurement based calibration allows further developing new techniques for computing optics functions that are biased by a possible miss-calibration such as beta function; dispersion function and beam action.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/wepp034_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/wepp034.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/wepp034_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-WEPP034,610

However; this way of particles acceleration and generation is not widely used yet due to an unstable particle flux caused by electric breakdowns or crystal impurities leading to temporal discontinuity of pyroelectric current. A sinusoidal mode of the temperature change demonstrated stable oscillations of the pyroelectric current on the polar surface with typical frequency being of the order of 1-50 mHz and the amplitude being about 1-10 nA for samples with area of several cm2. In vacuum it leads to generation of high electric field; which oscillates with the same frequency. Estimated amplitude of electric field is order of 105 V/cm. The possibilities of using such mode of temperature change to obtain a quasi-stable X-ray and electron source are considered.

By using dielectric radiators that emit photons when in proximity to charged particle beams; one can design devices to measure beam properties such as position; direction and size. The Booster To Storage-ring (BTS) test stand at Diamond Light Source provides a 3 GeV electron beam for diagnostics research.

The instability is typically associated with threshold beam currents. Energy spread and bunch length are increasing above the thresholds. Recently; a terahertz (THz) detector was installed at the cell 22 infrared (IR) beamline at NSLS-II storage ring to study the micro-bunch instabilities. The IR beamline has wide aperture allowing long-wavelength synchrotron radiation or microwave signal propagate to the end station; where the detector was installed. The detector output signal has been analyzed using oscilloscope; spectrum analyzer and FFT real-time spectrum analyzer.

ibic2019,,WEPP039,Single-Shot Diagnostics of Microbunched Electrons in Laser-Driven Plasma Accelerators and Free-Electron Lasers,Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Private Address; Silver Spring; USA; The need for single-shot diagnostics of the periodic longitudinal density modulation of relativistic electrons at the resonant wavelength (microbunching) in a free-electron laser (FEL) or at broadband visible wavelengths as in a laser-driven plasma accelerator (LPA) has been reaffirmed. In the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL case; statistical fluctuations in the microbunching occur in the startup-from-noise process. In the LPA; the plasma itself is chaotic and varies shot to shot. Fortunately; we have shown that coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) techniques; can assess beam size; divergence; spectral evolution; and z-dependent gain (100; 000) of microbunched electrons in a past SASE FEL experiment at 530 nm*. Recently; the application to LPAs has been demonstrated with single-shot near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) COTR imaging done at the exit of an LPA for the first time**. In this case few-micron beam sizes and extensive fringes due to sub-mrad divergences were measured based on point-spread-function effects and an analytical model for COTR interferometry; respectively. A proposed diagnostics application at 266 nm to pre-bunched beams is also described.; *A.H. Lumpkin et al.; Phys. Rev. Lett. 88; No.23; 234801 (2002).  **A.H. Lumpkin; M. LaBerge; D.W.

ibic2019,,WEPP040,Optimization of Antiproton Capture for Antihydrogen Creation in the ALPHA Experiment,S.S. Fabbri; W. Bertsche; UMAN; Manchester; United Kingdom; At the ALPHA Experiment at CERN; thin foils of material are used to slow down and trap antiprotons in a Penning trap; where they can be used for antihydrogen creation and measurements. Historically; over 99% of antiprotons are lost during the capture process as a result of the 5.3 MeV initial kinetic energy of the beam delivered by the Antiproton Decelerator. This places a limit early on in the achievable number of antihydrogen. ELENA is a new storage ring coming online which will lower this initial kinetic energy of the beam to 100 keV; requiring experiments to update their infrastructure. We present Monte Carlo and particle tracking simulation results for the optimization of the new degrading foil material; thickness; and location in the ALPHA catching Penning trap. From these results; we expect an upper capture efficiency of roughly 50 %. We further propose techniques for manipulating; detecting and extracting on the anticipated larger-numbered antiproton plasmas. These methods and associated hardware developments will allow performing antiproton experiments with significantly higher efficiency in ALPHA and other similar antiproton-based experiments.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/talks/wepp040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/papers/wepp040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2019/posters/wepp040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2019-WEPP040,637
