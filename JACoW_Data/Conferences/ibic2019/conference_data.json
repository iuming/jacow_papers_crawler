It will be used to monitor the beam between modules and at the linac exit. TOP-IMPLART produces a pulsed proton beam with 3 us duration at 200 Hz repetition rate with a current between 0.1 uA and 50 uA. The current required for medical applications is less than 1 uA and has to be known with an accuracy better than 5%. Large dynamic range and space constraints make the use of usual non-interceptive beam diagnostics unfeasible. The proposed system consists of a resonant cavity working in the TM010 mode",

The RF pulse is amplified and subsequently detected with zero-biased Schottky diodes. The cavity operates in vacuum when used in the inter-module space. The work reports also the results of preliminary measurements done on an copper prototype in air at the exit of the TOP-IMPLART linac to test the sensitivity of the system on the actual 35 MeV proton beam."

The geometry of the ceramic break for interrupting the wall current flow was optimized using a three-dimensional electromagnetic field simulator",

Both ends of the ceramic break were short-circuited in a high-frequency manner by a sheet-like capacitive structure to suppress the radiation of unneeded higher-order modes (HOMs) into the core housing. The ceramic break is also equipped with water-cooling pipes on metal sleeves brazed to the both ends to efficiently remove the heat generated by HOMs. The new DCCT chamber has been used already in user operation without any problems. A temperature rise near the ceramic break is still approximately six degrees Celsius",

The system aims for a bandwidth of several 100 Hz and robustness against the variation of the response matrix and the beam rigidity during the ramp. The architecture of the system and the results of the first beam-based test of the COFB hardware are presented. As a first step",
            "the orbit correction is performed over the entire ramp using the response matrix corresponding to injection energy only taking the beam rigidity into account. Experimental observations of the bandwidth limitations arising from the temporal delay of the steerer power supplies and the spatial model variation during the ramp are compared with simulations. It is found that the temporal and the spatial model mismatch have similar effect on the achievable bandwidth of the COFB."

            "Transverse beam profile diagnostics based on Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) is a routine technique at most modern electron linear accelerators (linacs) which is difficult to implement for FEL beams [*] and LWPA accelerators [**]. The reason is that a standard OTR beam profile monitor with a few micrometers space resolution cannot be used for measurements of ultrashort bunch profiles due to coherent effects in the OTR emission process [***]. We have developed an approach which allows calculating the propagation of coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) through a standard optical system consisting of a focusing lens and a spatial resolving detector placed in the image plane. Strict summation of the OTR fields emitted coherently by electrons inside the bunch and its focusing onto the detector plane allows obtaining a COTR image of the bunch profile. With the assumption of a Gaussian transverse bunch profile it is shown that the resulting image has a typical \"ring\" shape",

One of the important developments is to improve the transport system of the injection beam line. The transport efficiencies tend to decrease as beam intensities increase. To solve this problem",
            "we developed the calculation method to trace a beam trajectory with a four-dimensional (4D) beam emittance measured by pepper-pot emittance monitor (PEM) as initial value. The reason for using the 4D beam emittance is that the transport system has rotating quadrupole magnets and solenoid coils",
            "and that the space charge effect can be introduced. The beams through a pepper-pot mask can be detected on the potassium bromide fluorescent plate inclined 45 degree to the beam to be recorded by digital camera using developed PEM. We compared the calculated beam trajectory with the measurement of other beam diagnostics and quantified the degree of fit. It has been found that the degree of fit is improved by changing fiducial points on the fluorescent plate and optimizing the thickness of the fluorescent agent and the exposure time and gain of the digital camera."

The highest bunch repetition rate is 4.5 MHz; this corresponds to a minimum time separation of 222 ns. The measurement of the beam properties for each bunch in a train is required. Therefore the beam position monitor (BPM) system needs to separate the signals from each bunch. All BPM types (button, re-entrant and cavity) fulfill this requirement except a few button BPMs installed inside of the cold accelerator module, where Pile-Up from the train can be observed. To identify the cause of this effect we measured the S-parameters during a shutdown of the accelerator, compared it with a similar BPM at the FLASH accelerator but located in a warm section and finally measured the spectrum of the button signal during beam operation. As a result, resonances were found at about 2.46 GHz with relatively high quality factor that remains within the frequency range accepted by the electronics.",

Here stable THz pulses are generated by optical rectification of a fraction of the plasma generating high energy laser pulses in a nonlinear lithium niobate crystal. Then the generated THz pulses will energy modulate the electron bunches shot to shot before the plasma to achieve the required time resolution.

          "abstract": "Numerous advanced applications of X-ray free-electron lasers require pulse durations and time resolutions in the order of only a few femtoseconds or better. The generation of these pulses to be used in time-resolved experiments require synchronization techniques that can simultaneously lock all necessary components to a precision in the range of a few fs only. The CW operated electron accelerator ELBE at the Helmholtzzentrum Dresden Rossendorf uses a all-optical synchronization system to ensure a timing stability on the few 10 fs scale. ELBE requires a minimum beam pipe diameter of 43mm that limits the achievable output voltage of the pickup structure to drive the attached electro-optical modulator. This contribution presents a concept for a novel high-bandwidth arrival time monitor with sufficient output signal for the attached EOMs for very low charges as a part of the all-optical synchronization system at ELBE. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The VPP method extends the slit scan technique with a special post-processing. The 4D transverse phase space is reconstructed from a pepper-pot like pattern that is generated by crossing each measured horizontal slit beamlet with all measured vertical slit beamlets. All elements of the 4D transverse beam matrix are calculated and applied to obtain the 4D transverse emittance",

It will be used to monitor the beam between modules and at the linac exit. TOP-IMPLART produces a pulsed proton beam with 3 us duration at 200 Hz repetition rate with a current between 0.1 uA and 50 uA. The current required for medical applications is less than 1 uA and has to be known with an accuracy better than 5%. Large dynamic range and space constraints make the use of usual non-interceptive beam diagnostics unfeasible. The proposed system consists of a resonant cavity working in the TM010 mode",
        "generating an electromagnetic field when the beam enters the cavity; a magnetic pickup senses an RF pulse whose amplitude is proportional to the current. The RF pulse is amplified and subsequently detected with zero-biased Schottky diodes. The cavity operates in vacuum when used in the inter-module space. The work reports also the results of preliminary measurements done on an copper prototype in air at the exit of the TOP-IMPLART linac to test the sensitivity of the system on the actual 35 MeV proton beam."

The geometry of the ceramic break for interrupting the wall current flow was optimized using a three-dimensional electromagnetic field simulator",

Both ends of the ceramic break were short-circuited in a high-frequency manner by a sheet-like capacitive structure to suppress the radiation of unneeded higher-order modes (HOMs) into the core housing. The ceramic break is also equipped with water-cooling pipes on metal sleeves brazed to the both ends to efficiently remove the heat generated by HOMs. The new DCCT chamber has been used already in user operation without any problems.

        "Transverse beam profile diagnostics based on Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) is a routine technique at most modern electron linear accelerators (linacs) which is difficult to implement for FEL beams [*] and LWPA accelerators [**]. The reason is that a standard OTR beam profile monitor with a few micrometers space resolution cannot be used for measurements of ultrashort bunch profiles due to coherent effects in the OTR emission process [***]. We have developed an approach which allows calculating the propagation of coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) through a standard optical system consisting of a focusing lens and a spatial resolving detector placed in the image plane. Strict summation of the OTR fields emitted coherently by electrons inside the bunch and its focusing onto the detector plane allows obtaining a COTR image of the bunch profile. With the assumption of a Gaussian transverse bunch profile it is shown that the resulting image has a typical \"ring\" shape",

The beams through a pepper-pot mask can be detected on the potassium bromide fluorescent plate inclined 45 degree to the beam to be recorded by digital camera using developed PEM.

      "abstract": "The European XFEL facility is in operation with a maximum of 2700 bunches in one train. The highest bunch repetition rate is 4.5 MHz; this corresponds to a minimum time separation of 222 ns. The measurement of the beam properties for each bunch in a train is required. Therefore the beam position monitor (BPM) system needs to separate the signals from each bunch. All BPM types (button, re-entrant and cavity) fulfill this requirement except a few button BPMs installed inside of the cold accelerator module, where Pile-Up from the train can be observed. To identify the cause of this effect we measured the S-parameters during a shutdown of the accelerator, compared it with a similar BPM at the FLASH accelerator but located in a warm section and finally measured the spectrum of the button signal during beam operation. As a result, resonances were found at about 2.46 GHz with relatively high quality factor that remains within the frequency range accepted by the electronics.",

        "At Diamond Light Source we compute the horizontal and vertical tunes by fitting a simple multi-pole resonator model to the measured electron beam frequency response. The transverse (and longitudinal) tune response is measured by sweeping an excitation across the range of possible tune frequencies and synchronously measuring the IQ response. The multi-pole resonator model is a good fit to the measured behaviour",
        "but the fitting process is surprisingly challenging. Problems include noisy measurements",
        "very complex beam responses in the presence of increasing chromaticity",
        "poor data when the beam is close to instability",
        "and a number of challenges with the stability of the algorithm. The tune fitting algorithm now in use at Diamond has been developed and refined over many years. It is finally stable enough to work reliably throughout most beam operating conditions. The algorithm involves alternating peak finding and non-linear fitting",
        "with a fairly naive mathematical approach; the main focus is on providing reliable results."

The generation of these pulses to be used in time-resolved experiments require synchronization techniques that can simultaneously lock all necessary components to a precision in the range of a few fs only. The CW operated electron accelerator ELBE at the Helmholtzzentrum Dresden Rossendorf uses a all-optical synchronization system to ensure a timing stability on the few 10 fs scale. ELBE requires a minimum beam pipe diameter of 43mm that limits the achievable output voltage of the pickup structure to drive the attached electro-optical modulator. This contribution presents a concept for a novel high-bandwidth arrival time monitor with sufficient output signal for the attached EOMs for very low charges as a part of the all-optical synchronization system at ELBE. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

In order to fully utilize the potential of ultra-short electron bunches while probing the novel acceleration techniques (e.g. external injection in LWFA)",

In this paper we present the first results on the synchronization of the near-infrared photocathode laser to the RF source with the residual timing jitter performance of ~10 fs rms. These results were obtained using a conventional laser-to-RF synchronization setup employing heterodyne detection of an RF signal generated by impinging the laser pulses to a fast photodetector. In addition",
