        "ultrashort electron beams are driving various advanced scientific instruments. As we push the limits of electron beams in the time domain",
        "the challenges include not only generating the shortest possible pulse durations",
        "but also precisely controlling or characterizing the timing of electron beams relative to optical pulses. The optical pulses can be for example the pump laser in ultrafast electron diffraction",
        "or the drive laser in external-injection laser plasma accelerators",
        "etc. It is not feasible to characterize the timing between electron and laser pulses to fs level using an rf-based approach",
        "due to the phase jitter of rf sources relative to lasers. With a laser-generated THz streaking field",
        "the timing of electron beams can be determined at sub-fs level and the pulse duration at single fs level on a shot-by-shot basis. Showing that THz compression can significantly reduce the pulse duration and intrinsically stabilize the timing jitter of electron beams. We believe that time-domain manipulation of relativistic electron beams using laser-generated THz can significantly boost the performance of electron beam-based instruments for ultrafast science."

        "observation and it further spectral analysis at 0.1-30 THz spectral range. All experimental work was at CLARA (beam area 1) facility (~50 MeV beam energy at up to 10 Hz pulse repetition rate with sub-ps bunch length). Inside of vacuum chamber we developed movable platform where both VCR and TR target were placed",
        "which is allows us to observe both effects during one accelerator run. For spectral analysis we used Martin-Pupplet interferometer as it provides higher signal to noise ratio and allows us to perform instabilities normalisation. As a result we will demonstrate a selection of interferograms and spectrums (as well as reconstructed longitudinal beam profiles) for different machine setups and distances between charged particle beam and Cherenkov target. By using mathematical analysis it has been shown that CLARA bunch length was about 1.2 ps."

        "bunch arrival-time monitors are required that are capable of reaching measurement resolutions better than the stated timing stability goals. We report on our electro-optical bunch arrival-time monitors now achieving a time resolution better than 3 fs. This new level of precision is a first step towards the ultimate goal of reaching sub-femtosecond timing stability. The system has also been upgraded to allow for multi-beam line operation with large variations of the bunch arrival times for the different pulse trains. The characteristics of the bunch arrival-time monitor system and limitations of the state-of-the-art design will be discussed."
