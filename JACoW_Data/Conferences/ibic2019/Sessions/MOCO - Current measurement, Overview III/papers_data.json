        "Beam current and lifetime are the most important parameters to characterize the beam and machine quality of an electron storage ring. In order to describe the behavior of all electron bunches completely and accurately",
        "a precisely bunch-by-bunch charge monitor has been developed at SSRF. Method called two-point equilibrium sampling is introduced to avoid the influence of longitudinal oscillation on the sampling point",
        "thanks to this",
        "the resolution of the BCM was below 0.2 pC. Utilizing the advantages of BCM’s high refresh rate and high resolution",
        "the system can meet the requirement of monitor the bunch-by-bunch beam lifetime",

        "In this work the design of a passive cavity beam intensity monitor to be used in the TOP-IMPLART medical proton linac for the on-line measurement of beam current is presented. It will be used to monitor the beam between modules and at the linac exit. TOP-IMPLART produces a pulsed proton beam with 3 us duration at 200 Hz repetition rate with a current between 0.1 uA and 50 uA. The current required for medical applications is less than 1 uA and has to be known with an accuracy better than 5%. Large dynamic range and space constraints make the use of usual non-interceptive beam diagnostics unfeasible. The proposed system consists of a resonant cavity working in the TM010 mode",
        "generating an electromagnetic field when the beam enters the cavity; a magnetic pickup senses an RF pulse whose amplitude is proportional to the current. The RF pulse is amplified and subsequently detected with zero-biased Schottky diodes. The cavity operates in vacuum when used in the inter-module space. The work reports also the results of preliminary measurements done on an copper prototype in air at the exit of the TOP-IMPLART linac to test the sensitivity of the system on the actual 35 MeV proton beam."
