        "towards the ultimate of diffraction limited condition in a short wavelength range of hard x-rays. This talk will overview the diagnostic requirements for DLSRs. For highlighted crucial diagnostic subjects",
        "the talk will review the current performance of state-of-the-art diagnostic instruments. The talk will also show strategies to bridge the gaps achieving the diagnostic goals of the coming future light sources as well as technical challenges for the breakthrough."
