The generation of these pulses to be used in time-resolved experiments require synchronization techniques that can simultaneously lock all necessary components to a precision in the range of a few fs only. The CW operated electron accelerator ELBE at the Helmholtzzentrum Dresden Rossendorf uses a all-optical synchronization system to ensure a timing stability on the few 10 fs scale. ELBE requires a minimum beam pipe diameter of 43mm that limits the achievable output voltage of the pickup structure to drive the attached electro-optical modulator. This contribution presents a concept for a novel high-bandwidth arrival time monitor with sufficient output signal for the attached EOMs for very low charges as a part of the all-optical synchronization system at ELBE. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

A sinusoidal mode of the temperature change demonstrated stable oscillations of the pyroelectric current on the polar surface with typical frequency being of the order of 1-50 mHz and the amplitude being about 1-10 nA for samples with area of several cm2. In vacuum it leads to generation of high electric field",
