srf2019,,THTU3,Practical Aspects of SRF Cavity Testing and Operations,JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA,"Over the past 30 years we have done about 6500 cold cavity tests on more than 800 different cavities at Jefferson Lab. Most of these tests were done with voltage controlled oscillator based phase locked loop systems. More recently we converted most of our systems to digital low level RF based systems. In addition to doing many of these test myself, I have been involved with the development, construction and commissioning of several cavity test systems and the software used to control them. My hope today is to provide you with a basic understanding of the RF systems necessary to perform these tests. I hope you leave here with an understanding of the importance of calibration processes and the control and understanding of potential error sources. I will also provide some information relating to the practical aspects of operating SRF cavities in real machines.

Due the high operational costs; other materials are currently being considered. Nb3Sn coatings have been investigated over the past several decades; motivated by potentially higher operating temperatures. More recently niobium has been doped with nitrogen to improve the quality factor (Q). Currently; a need for better understanding still exists for both mechanisms. EBSD has been shown to be a viable technique to determine the crystallographic orientation and the size of the Nb3Sn grains. The EBSD maps obtained show a bimodal distribution of grain sizes with smaller Nb3Sn grains found present near the Nb3Sn/Nb interface. In addition to the Nb3Sn coatings; N-doped niobium coupons were analyzed by EBSD and found that the coupon had preferred surface orientation. The EBSD analysis was found to be vital as specific grains could be targeted in SIMS to better understand the diffusion of nitrogen with respect to crystal orientation.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THP017 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp001.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP001,

A possible way to meet the requirements is the so-called nitrogen infusion procedure. However; a fundamental understanding and a theoretical model of this method are still missing. The approach shown here is based on sample R&D; with the goal to identify key parameters of the process and establish a stable; reproducible recipe. To understand the underlying processes of the surface evolution; which gives improved cavity performance; advanced surface analysis techniques (e.g. SEM/EDX; TEM; XPS; TOF-SIMS) are utilized. Additionally; a small furnace just for samples was set up to change and explore the parameter space of the infusion recipe. Results of these analyses; their implications for the cavity R&D and next steps are presented.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-MOP023 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 30 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp002.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP002,

Demands for higher energy and more efficient linear accelerators; however; have strained the capabilities of bulk Nb close to its fundamental limit. Several routes have been proposed using thin film novel superconductors (e.g. Nb3Sn); SIS multilayer; and N-doping. Beta-NMR techniques are more suitable for the characterization of Meissner state in these materials; due to the capability of soft-landing radioactive ions on the nanometer scale of London penetration depth; as compared to micrometer probe of the muSR technique. Upgrade of the existing beta-NQR beamline; combined with the capability of high parallel magnetic field (200 mT) are the scope of the beta-SRF facility which has been fully funded. All hardware required for the upgrade has also been procured. The status of the commissioning; which is currently in phase I; is reported here; together with the future schedule of phase II with the fully installed beta-SRF beamline.

Both of these influences can be described by a second order differential equation of the mechanical vibration modes of the cavity. In this paper we consider three dominant mechanical modes of the system and develop a control scheme based on input-output linearization. It is shown through simulation studies that the proposed control technique can successfully the suppress microphonic noise due to the SRF cavity¿s dynamics.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THP074 paper received ※ 22 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp004.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP004,

Compared with traditional evaporation and sputtering; electrochemical coating has the advantages on process simplicity; low cost and mass production. However; the conventional electroplating; because of its low growth temperature and aqueous reaction environment; tends to produce porous; loosely bonded; and often contaminated film. All these properties result in excessive pinning center and deteriorate the superconducting radio frequency cavities performance. In this paper; a new method including multi-layer electroplating and heat treatment is used to deposit Nb3Sn thin film on top of copper substrates. Important growth parameters; e.g. electrical current density; layer thickness ratio; and annealing temperature are studied. The morphology of the film surfaces was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the structure of the film was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that a flat and uniform Nb3Sn layer on copper can be obtained; and the thickness is about 7 micron.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP076 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp005.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP005,

In this contribution; a summary of results from an investigation into DC magnetron sputtered NbN thin films deposited onto copper substrates is presented. The copper substrates were prepared using a mechanical polishing process; followed by a chemical etching process. The NbN films were prepared in a large scale commercial coating system. A high and low value for the substrate temperature; process pressure; bias voltage; cathode power; nitrogen gas percentage; and the working gas type; using either Argon or Krypton; constitute the parameters of this study. The base pressure of the system prior to deposition was 5x107 hPa for all coatings.

Currently twelve superconducting CH-cavities are considered which will be split into four different cryostats. Each cavity will be equipped with dynamic bellow tuners. After successful beam tests with CH0 as well as last surface preparations and ongoing rf tests with CH1 and CH2; CH3 to CH11 will be designed. Based on the successful test results; individual optimizations are carried out on the cavity design.

Nowadays chemical etching is the only surface treatment used to prepare SRF surface made of Nb. However the operational cost of chemical facilities is high and these present a very bad ecological footprint. The search of an alternative technique could make the construction of these future large scale facilities possible. Metallographic polishing (MP) is a candidate not only for bulk Nb treatment; but could also provide the mirror-finished substrate for alternative SRF thin films deposition. Recent R&D studies; conducted at IPNO & IRFU; focused on the development of 2-steps MP procedure of Nb flat samples. Roughness of polished surface has been proven better than standard EP treatment and less polluted than CBP. MP provides on flat surfaces a high removal rate (above 1 µm/min) and high reproducibility. The paper will describe the optimized method and present all the surface analysis performed. The first RF characterization of a polished disk will be presented.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THP002 paper received ※ 20 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 30 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp011.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP011,

We find features occurring in frequency versus temperature (FvsT) data near Tc that seem to vary with surface processing. Emphasis is placed on one of the observed features: a dip in the superconducting resonant frequency below the normal conducting value which is prominent in nitrogen doped cavities and appears to be a signature of nitrogen doping. This gives further insights on the mechanisms responsible for the large increase in performance of cavities subject to this surface treatment. The magnitude of this dip in frequency is studied and related to possible physical parameters such as the concentration of impurities near the surface and the design resonant frequency of the cavity. A possible explanation for the meaning of this dip is discussed; namely; that it is a result of strong coupling between electrons and phonons within the resonator.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-MOP031 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 30 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp016.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP016,

This combined with the obvious advantages of using higher critical temperature superconductors and thin film depositions leads to interest in the RF characterization of such materials. A TE mode niobium sample host cavity was used to characterize the RF performance of 5"" (12.7 cm) diameter sample plates as a function of field and temperature at 4 GHz. Materials studied include MgB2 and thin film atomic layer deposition (ALD) NbN and NbTiN on Nb substrates.

It is therefore likely that defects on the order of the coherence lengths will cause early flux penetration well before the theorized superheating field of an ideal superconducting surface.

To avoid changes on the SC which has been used for the tests; all RF cryogenic experiments have been carried out by using a cylinder in the center of a 1-cell cavity drift tube to increase the field magnitude at the connection. This cylinder has been designed and optimised by RF simulations to provide a field density at the connection twice as high as at a chosen reference point near the iris. Hence also a test SC with a comparatively low gradient can be used without causing field restrictions.

Therefore; an accurate technique is needed to measure the penetration of the magnetic field directly. The conventional magnetometers are inconvenient for thin superconducting film measurements because these measurements are strongly influenced by orientation; edge and shape effects. In order to measure the onset of field penetration in bulk; thin films and multi-layered superconductors; we have designed; built and calibrated a system combining a small superconducting solenoid capable of generating surface magnetic field higher than 500 mT and Hall probe to detect the first entry of vortices. This setup can be used to study various promising alternative materials to Nb; especially SIS multilayer coatings on Nb that have been recently proposed to delay the vortex penetration in Nb surface. In this paper; the system will be described and calibration will be presented.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THP050 paper received ※ 20 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 30 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp030.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp030_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP030,

Mechanisms of flux pinning depend on the materials treatment and cool-down conditions. A magnetic field scanning system using flux-gate magnetometers and Hall probes has been designed and built to allow measuring the local magnetic field of trapped vortices normal to the outer surface of 1.3 GHz single-cell SRF cavities at cryogenic temperatures. Such system will allow inferring the key information about the distribution and magnitude of trapped flux in the SRF cavities for different material; surface preparations and cool-down conditions.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP052 paper received ※ 22 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 30 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp031_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp031.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp031_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP031,
srf2019,,SUSP033,Nonlinear Dynamics and Dissipation of Vortex Lines Driven by Strong RF Fields,M.R.P. Walive Pathiranage; A.V. Gurevich; ODU; Norfolk; Virginia; USA; Trapped vortices can contribute significantly to a residual surface resistance of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities but the nonlinear dynamics of flexible vortex lines driven by strong rf currents has not been well understood. Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension; vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases; Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields. These results suggest that trapped vortices can contribute to the extended Q(H) rise observed on the SRF cavities.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP055 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 05 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp033.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP033,

It is a superconducting (sc); continuous wave (cw) heavy ion linac that comprises novel Crossbar H-mode (CH) cavities. In April 2017 and November/December 2018 the first sc CH-cavity of the linac was tested with beam. The first operations of the cavity showed; that the prototype of the rf power coupler needs to be further improved. A new version of the coupler is being designed at the HIM. Further development will mainly be focused on the heat input into the cryostat caused by the coupler. Also the coupler will have a modular design. This improves the accessibility and maintenance of the coupler. Various cryogenic and rf tests are foreseen; to provide a reliable; fail-safe coupler for the HELIAC. For an enhanced coupler test stand a movable reflector has been designed and built. With its movable semi-reflective element; it allows to operate the test stand in a resonance mode. In addition; the movable reflector can vary the coupling factor.

The state-of-the-art vapor diffusion approach for Nb3Sn deposition observed surface roughness; thin grain regions; and misfit dislocations which negatively affect the RF performance. The Sn deficiency and non-uniformity at the nucleation stage of vapor deposition is believed to be the fundamental reason to cause these roughness and defects issues. Thus; we propose to pre-deposit a uniform Sn film on the Nb substrate; which is able to provide sufficient Sn source during the following heat treatment for Nb3Sn nucleation and growth. Here; we demonstrated successful electrodeposition of a low-roughness; dendrite-free; excellent-adhesion Sn film on the Nb substrate. More importantly; we further achieved a uniform; low-roughness (Ra = 66 nm); pure-stoichiometric Nb3Sn film through thermal treatment of this electroplated Sn film in the furnace. Additionally; we provide preliminary results of laser annealing as a post treatment for epitaxial grain growth and roughness reduction.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-MOP014 paper received ※ 22 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 30 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp036_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp036.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp036_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP036,

Thin alternating layers of superconductors and insulators (SIS) can potentially increase Hvp. Magnetometry is commercially available but consists of limitations; such as SQUID measurements apply a field over both superconducting layers; so Hvp through the sample cannot be measured. If SIS structures are to be investigated a magnetic field must be applied locally; from one plane of the sample; with no magnetic field on the opposing side to allow Hvp to be measured. A magnetic field penetration experiment has been developed at Daresbury laboratory; where a VTI has been created for a cryostat where Hvp of a sample can be measured. The VTI has been designed to allow flat samples to be measured to reduce limitations such as edge effects by creating a DC magnetic field smaller than the sample. A small; parallel magnetic field is produced on the sample by the use of a ferrite yoke. The field is increased to determine Hvp by using 2 hall probes either side of the sample.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THP048 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 30 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/susp037_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/susp037.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/susp037_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-SUSP037,

By measuring the longitudinal projection of the bunch with a Feschenko Monitor (Beam Shape Monitor); the bunch profile was obtained.

srf2019,,MOFAB5,Status and Challenges of the MYRRHA SRF Linac,SCK•CEN; Mol; Belgium; The MYRRHA project aims at realizing a demonstrator Accelerator Driven System (ADS); of which the essential goal is to provide an optimized path towards transmutation. This allows to greatly reduce the burden of long lived nuclear waste originating from fission power plants. The specific ADS application requires a CW driver linac with an exceptionally high beam-MTBF of 250 hours; a beam failure corresponding to a beam trip longer than 3 s. The key feature for obtaining this level of reliability is fault tolerance. It is essentially provided through the serial redundancy that the highly modular structure of the superconducting linac combined with adequate operational margins offers. Phase 1 of MYRRHA will see the construction of the 100 MeV linac based on one family of β=0.37 superconducting 2-gap spoke cavities. The evaluation of the fault tolerance mechanism will be a major topic of this linac’s exploitation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/mofab5_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/mofab5.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/mofab5_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-MOFAB5,

Since 2001 it is operated as a user facility; providing more than 5500 hours of beam time each year. The electron accelerator is based on four superconducting 9-cell TESLA cavities that are driven in full CW operation to accelerate an average current of 1 mA up to beam energies of 40 MeV. The first part of the talk will summarize our experiences of operating TESLA cavities in CW. In detail; this includes their performance and attempts to improve it; as well as investigations on limitations. Additionally; we will discuss several issues that are related to the high average RF as well as beam power and we will present appropriate measures to protect the machine. In this regard; a resonant ring for RF component tests up to 100 kW was set up. The second part of the talk will focus on the development and operation of our SRF guns that are designed to produce short bunches with high charges and repetition rates of 1 MHz and beyond.

European XFEL is one of these installations providing up to ~30.000 bunches per second; more than a factor 100 higher than other facilities. High repetition rate FEL experiments allow to open new science opportunities and thus drive the accelerator development. These facilities rely on SRF technology to enable high repetition rates; either by using pulsed RF (FLASH; European XFEL) or so-called continuous-wave (cw) RF (LCLS-II; SHINE). European XFEL has started user operation in 2017 after 8 yrs of construction. The facility is designed to serve several science instruments quasi-simultanously using its delivery of up to ~30.000 bunches per second using a 10 Hz burst pattern. These bunches can be distributed to presently 3 (future 5) FEL sources serving 6 to 10 science instruments.

A comparison of the field dependence of the surface resistance after N-infusion with a recent theoretical model that extends the calculation of the BCS surface resistance to high rf fields suggests an increase in the quasiparticles¿ relaxation time with increasing infusion temperature; which could be due to a decreasing density of subgap states.

The BCS theory has been used widely to estimate the surface resistance and to direct the technology. However; recent research results show that the behavior of the surface resistance further deviates from the BCS theory. So far the study on surface resistance was performed usually with cavities of single frequency which limited the study of frequency dependent surface resistance. The Center for Accelerator Science at Old Dominion University has designed and built several half wave coaxial cavities to study the frequency; temperature; and RF field dependence of surface resistance. TRIUMF in Canada also joined this line of research using such multi frequency quarter wave and half wave coaxial cavities. This type of multi mode cavity will allow us to systematically study the parameters affecting surface resistance on the same cavity surface.

In 2018; the software and hardware in the digital low level RF systems were configured such that a fault would trigger an acquisition process which records waveform records of 17 of the RF signals for each of the 8 cavities within the cryomodule for subsequent analysis. These waveforms are especially useful in C100 cryomodules as there is a 10% mechanical coupling between adjacent cavities. When one cavity has a fault and the gradient is reduced quickly; it will mechanically deform due relaxation of the Lorentz force effects. This deformation change causes perturbations in the adjacent cavities which; in turn; causes a cascade of cavity faults that are difficult to understand without the time domain data. This contribution will describe the types of faults encountered during operation and their signatures in the time domain data; as well as how is being used to modify the setup of the machine and implement improvements to the cryomodules.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/weteb3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/weteb3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/weteb3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-WETEB3,763

This results in time consuming and costly operation. Early into the development stages the actual cavity system may not even be available. It is therefore highly desirable to pre-evaluate these systems under realistic conditions prior to final testing with the SRF cavities. We devised an FPGA-based ""virtual cavity"" that takes a regular low-level RF input and generates the signals for RF-power reflection; transmission and detuning that mimic the response of a real cavity system. As far as the user is concerned; the response is the same as for a real cavity.

At HZB; RF-surface resistance measurements were performed with a Quadrupole Resonator (QPR) and an S-I-S’ sample (75 nm NbTiN on 15 nm AlN insulator on bulk Nb) prepared at JLab. Measurements were performed at 414; 845; and 1286 MHz at sample temperatures from 2 K up to well above the transition temperature of NbTiN of ~17.3 K. The Rs exhibits an unexpected temperature dependence: Rather than rising monotonically; as expected from BCS theory; a local maximum is observed. There is a temperature range where Rs decreases with increasing temperature. Such behavior indicates that an additional interaction between the superconducting layers may have to be included in the surface resistance model. Measurements of the baseline Nb sample prior to coating exhibited no such behavior; hence systematic measurement errors can be excluded as the explanation. The maximum field was limited by a hard magnetic quench near 20 mT; close to Hc1 of NbTiN; suggesting that the sample is limited by early flux penetration.,,A-M. Valente-Feliciano,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/thfua1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/thfua1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/thfua1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THFUA1,800

In this structure; the principal parameter that limits the performance of the cavity is the critical magnetic field or effective Hc1 at which vortices begin penetrating into the superconductor layer. This is predicted to depend on the combination of the film thickness. We made samples that have a NbN/SiO2 thin-film structure on a pure Nb substrate with several layers of NbN film deposited using DC magnetron sputtering method.

It is shown that the interplay of the broadening of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) peaks and a decrease of a quasiparticle gap caused by the RF currents produces a minimum in Rs(H0) and an extended rise of the quality factor Q(H0) with the RF field. Paramagnetic impurities shift the minimum in Rs(H0) to lower fields and can reduce Rs(H0) in a wide range of H0. Subgap states in the DOS can give rise to a residual surface resistance while reducing Rs at higher temperatures. A proximity-coupled normal layer can shift the minimum to either low and high fields and can reduce Rs below that of an ideal surface. The field dependence of Q(H0) can be very sensitive to the materials processing. The nonlinear RF losses can be minimized by tuning pairbreaking effects using impurity management or surface nanostructuring.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/thfua4_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/thfua4.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/thfua4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THFUA4,

Samples representing different stages of Nb3Sn formation have been produced and examined to elucidate the effects of nucleation; growth; process conditions; and impurities. Nb3Sn films from few hundreds of nm up to ~15 µm were grown and characterized using AFM; SEM/EDS; XPS; EBSD; SIMS; and SAM. Microscopic examinations of samples suggest the mechanisms behind Nb3Sn thin film nucleation and growth. RF measurements of coated cavities were combined with material characterization of witness samples to adapt the coating process in ""Siemens"" coating configuration. Understanding obtained from sample studies; applied to cavities; resulted in Nb3Sn cavity with quality factor 2 ×1010 at 15 MV/m accelerating gradient at 4 K; without ""Wuppertal"" Q-slope.

For this reason superconducting materials alternative to niobium are being considered. One of the most promising among them is the Nb3Sn alloy. The higher critical temperature and field makes it very attractive for SRF applications. The coating of superconducting Nb3Sn films on a copper substrate has been optimized at CERN. Few micron thick films with excellent structural and morphological properties are prepared via DC magnetron sputtering of stoichiometric targets. While DC superconducting properties were measured along with the optimization of the coating methods; the RF performances were still unknown. In this talk we shall report on the results from the first complete RF characterization of such films. The surface resistance Rs is estimated as a function of both temperature and RF peak magnetic field at three different frequencies by means of the quadrupole resonator at CERN.

srf2019,,THFUB4,Effect of Inhomogeneous Disorder on the Superheating Field of SRF Cavities,NU; Evanston; Illinois; USA; Recent advances in surface treatments of Niobium SRF cavities have led to increased Q-factors and maximum surface field. This poses theoretical challenges to identify the mechanisms responsible for performance enhancements. I report theoretical results for the effects of inhomogeneous surface disorder on the superheating field.* We find that inhomogeneous disorder; such as that introduced by infusion of Nitrogen into the surface layers of Niobium SRF cavities; can increase the superheating field above the maximum for superconductors in the clean limit or with homogeneously distributed disorder. Disorder increases the penetration of screening current; but also suppresses the maximum supercurrent. Inhomogeneous disorder in the form of an impurity diffusion layer biases this trade-off by increasing the penetration of the screening currents into cleaner regions with larger critical currents; thus limiting the suppression of the screening current to a thin dirty region close to the surface. Our results suggest that the impurity diffusion layers play a role in enhancing the maximum accelerating gradient of Nitrogen treated Niobium SRF cavities.,Funding: The research of the authors is supported by National Science Foundation Grant PHY-1734332 and the Northwestern-Fermilab Center for Applied Physics and Superconducting Technologies.,* https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04057,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/thfub4_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/thfub4.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/thfub4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-THFUB4,

However most of the defects observed in the Nb layers originate from defects inherited from the substrate itself [2]. Two routes are used to manufacture Cu cavities. The first one consists of forming the half-cells independently by either spinning or electro-hydroforming. The latter are then joined together and to the cut-offs by electron-beam welding. The second one is a seamless process in which the cell is entirely spun around a mandrel and then electron-beam welded to the cut-offs. Both approaches require welding; leading to potential formation of porosities. We propose an innovative route; inspired from a technology used to form small diameter vacuum chambers [3]. The cavity is formed by electrodeposition of Cu on a sacrificial mandrel whose surface state will determine the inner cavity¿s surface quality. The strength of the process relies on the total absence of welding. We present the values obtained for Young Modulus; Ultimate Tensile Stress; roughness and RRR on dedicated samples.

The gun is designed to deliver electrons with a kinetic energy of up to 2 MeV. Electrons are generated by illuminating a high quantum efficiency (QE) K2CsSb photoemission layer with a green laser operating at a wavelength of 532 nm. The gun was able to generating 3 nC bunches at 1.7 MeV. The design goals; fabrication; performance and operational experience are reported here.,Funding: This work is funded by the DOE FOA (No. DE-FOA-0000632) and National Science Foundation (Award No. PHY-1415252).,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/frcab5_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/frcab5.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/frcab5_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-FRCAB5,
srf2019,,FRCAB6,The Effect of Helium Processing and Plasma Cleaning for Low Beta HWR Cavity,S.C. Huang; Q.W. Chu; Y. He; C.L. Li; A.D. Wu; S.X. Zhang; IMP/CAS; Lanzhou; People’s Republic of China; The commissioning of the 25 MeV high power and high intensity proton Linac demo for CiADS showed that the performance of the SRF cavities was mainly limited by field emission inside the cavities. Therefore; the techniques of helium processing and reactive oxygen plasma cleaning have been developed to mitigate field emission issues. We performed an experiment with a low beta HWR cavity exposed to air directly and processed by helium and reactive oxygen. In this paper; the details of the experiment will be described; the efficiency of helium processing and plasma cleaning will be compared and discussed,,use link to see paper's listing under its alternate paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/frcab6_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/frcab6.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/frcab6_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-FRCAB6,

Besides the determination of accelerating gradient and quality factor; additional sensors and diagnostic methods are used to obtain more information about the cavity behaviour and the test environment. The second sound system is a tool for spatially resolved quench detection via oscillating super-leak transducers; they record the second sound wave; generated by the quench of the superconducting Niobium. The mounting of the sensors was improved to reduce systematic uncertainties and results of a recent master thesis are presented in the following. Different reconstruction methods are used to determine the origin of the waves. The precision; constraints and limits of these are compared. To introduce an external reference and to qualify the different methods a calibration tool was used. It injects short heat pulses to resistors at exact known space and time coordinates. Results obtained by the different algorithms and measurements with the calibration tool are presented with an emphasis on the possible spatial resolution and the estimation of systematic uncertainties of the methods.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/talks/frcab8_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/papers/frcab8.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/srf2019/posters/frcab8_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-FRCAB8,
