            "Over the past 30 years we have done about 6500 cold cavity tests on more than 800 different cavities at Jefferson Lab. Most of these tests were done with voltage controlled oscillator based phase locked loop systems. More recently we converted most of our systems to digital low level RF based systems. In addition to doing many of these test myself, I have been involved with the development, construction and commissioning of several cavity test systems and the software used to control them. My hope today is to provide you with a basic understanding of the RF systems necessary to perform these tests. I hope you leave here with an understanding of the importance of calibration processes and the control and understanding of potential error sources. I will also provide some information relating to the practical aspects of operating SRF cavities in real machines. Hopefully, A complete set of equations necessary for calculating the cavity parameters and can be found on the website for this conference as an addendum to this talk."

Emphasis is placed on one of the observed features: a dip in the superconducting resonant frequency below the normal conducting value which is prominent in nitrogen doped cavities and appears to be a signature of nitrogen doping. This gives further insights on the mechanisms responsible for the large increase in performance of cavities subject to this surface treatment. The magnitude of this dip in frequency is studied and related to possible physical parameters such as the concentration of impurities near the surface and the design resonant frequency of the cavity. A possible explanation for the meaning of this dip is discussed",

This combined with the obvious advantages of using higher critical temperature superconductors and thin film depositions leads to interest in the RF characterization of such materials. A TE mode niobium sample host cavity was used to characterize the RF performance of 5\" (12.7 cm) diameter sample plates as a function of field and temperature at 4 GHz. Materials studied include MgB2 and thin film atomic layer deposition (ALD) NbN and NbTiN on Nb substrates. These higher critical temperature superconductors all having coherence lengths on the order of a few nm. It is therefore likely that defects on the order of the coherence lengths will cause early flux penetration well before the theorized superheating field of an ideal superconducting surface.

Hence also a test SC with a comparatively low gradient can be used without causing field restrictions.

It is a mulit-turn ERL for particle and nuclear physics experiments. As the centerpiece for acceleration a turn-key solution was chosen. Two modified ELBE/Rossendorf-type cryomodules will accelerate the electrons up to 25 MeV per turn. The modules will be operated in cw at an accelerating gradient of 12.5 MV/m. The modifications comprise of an integration of a piezo tuner system and a better thermal connection of the HOM antennas for allowing high beam current in cw operation. Site acceptance tests of both modules have been carried out at the Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) and by now the first cryomodule was successfully operated at design gradient and could be accepted. This talk will cover the experiences with a turn-key solution made by industry and will show the results of the site acceptance tests."

It is essentially provided through the serial redundancy that the highly modular structure of the superconducting linac combined with adequate operational margins offers. Phase 1 of MYRRHA will see the construction of the 100 MeV linac based on one family of β=0.37 superconducting 2-gap spoke cavities. The evaluation of the fault tolerance mechanism will be a major topic of this linac’s exploitation."

It is shown that the interplay of the broadening of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) peaks and a decrease of a quasiparticle gap caused by the RF currents produces a minimum in Rs(H0) and an extended rise of the quality factor Q(H0) with the RF field. Paramagnetic impurities shift the minimum in Rs(H0) to lower fields and can reduce Rs(H0) in a wide range of H0. Subgap states in the DOS can give rise to a residual surface resistance while reducing Rs at higher temperatures. A proximity-coupled normal layer can shift the minimum to either low and high fields and can reduce Rs below that of an ideal surface. The field dependence of Q(H0) can be very sensitive to the materials processing. The nonlinear RF losses can be minimized by tuning pairbreaking effects using impurity management or surface nanostructuring."

            "Nb thin film SRF cavities have demonstrated for many years their strong potential as being an alternative to bulk Nb cavities [1]. However most of the defects observed in the Nb layers originate from defects inherited from the substrate itself [2]. Two routes are used to manufacture Cu cavities. The first one consists of forming the half-cells independently by either spinning or electro-hydroforming. The latter are then joined together and to the cut-offs by electron-beam welding. The second one is a seamless process in which the cell is entirely spun around a mandrel and then electron-beam welded to the cut-offs. Both approaches require welding",
            "leading to potential formation of porosities. We propose an innovative route",
            "inspired from a technology used to form small diameter vacuum chambers [3]. The cavity is formed by electrodeposition of Cu on a sacrificial mandrel whose surface state will determine the inner cavity¿s surface quality. The strength of the process relies on the total absence of welding. We present the values obtained for Young Modulus",

        "Over the past 30 years we have done about 6500 cold cavity tests on more than 800 different cavities at Jefferson Lab. Most of these tests were done with voltage controlled oscillator based phase locked loop systems. More recently we converted most of our systems to digital low level RF based systems. In addition to doing many of these test myself, I have been involved with the development, construction and commissioning of several cavity test systems and the software used to control them. My hope today is to provide you with a basic understanding of the RF systems necessary to perform these tests. I hope you leave here with an understanding of the importance of calibration processes and the control and understanding of potential error sources. I will also provide some information relating to the practical aspects of operating SRF cavities in real machines. Hopefully, A complete set of equations necessary for calculating the cavity parameters and can be found on the website for this conference as an addendum to this talk."

        "which is the radiation pressure induced by a high radio frequency (RF) field",
        "and environmental mechanical vibrations that induce undesirable interference signals referred to as microphonics. Both of these influences can be described by a second order differential equation of the mechanical vibration modes of the cavity. In this paper we consider three dominant mechanical modes of the system and develop a control scheme based on input-output linearization. It is shown through simulation studies that the proposed control technique can successfully the suppress microphonic noise due to the SRF cavity¿s dynamics.",

        "The multilayer thin film structure of the superconductor has been proposed by A. Gurevich to enhance the maximum gradient of SRF cavities. The lower critical field Hc1 at which the vortex start penetrating the superconducting material will be improved by coating Nb with thin film superconductor such as NbN. It is expected that the enhancement of Hc1 depends on the thickness of each layer. In order to determine the optimum thickness of each layer and to compare the measurement results with the theoretical prediction proposed by T. Kubo",

Emphasis is placed on one of the observed features: a dip in the superconducting resonant frequency below the normal conducting value which is prominent in nitrogen doped cavities and appears to be a signature of nitrogen doping. This gives further insights on the mechanisms responsible for the large increase in performance of cavities subject to this surface treatment. The magnitude of this dip in frequency is studied and related to possible physical parameters such as the concentration of impurities near the surface and the design resonant frequency of the cavity.

        "Cutting edge SRF technology is likely approaching the fundamental limitations of niobium cavities operating in the Meissner state. This combined with the obvious advantages of using higher critical temperature superconductors and thin film depositions leads to interest in the RF characterization of such materials. A TE mode niobium sample host cavity was used to characterize the RF performance of 5\" (12.7 cm) diameter sample plates as a function of field and temperature at 4 GHz. Materials studied include MgB2 and thin film atomic layer deposition (ALD) NbN and NbTiN on Nb substrates. These higher critical temperature superconductors all having coherence lengths on the order of a few nm. It is therefore likely that defects on the order of the coherence lengths will cause early flux penetration well before the theorized superheating field of an ideal superconducting surface. Superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) multilayers have been proposed as a mechanism of arresting these early penetration flux avalanches and are therefore studied here as well",

Hence also a test SC with a comparatively low gradient can be used without causing field restrictions.

The given BBU threshold current values are calculated by the method of beam energy gain averaging on phases of dipole mode fields. BBU instability behaviors in cases of applying the cavities in Linacs as well in Energy Recovery Linacs (ERLs) are considered. The BBU influence on beam emittance degradation is demonstrated.

It is a mulit-turn ERL for particle and nuclear physics experiments. As the centerpiece for acceleration a turn-key solution was chosen. Two modified ELBE/Rossendorf-type cryomodules will accelerate the electrons up to 25 MeV per turn. The modules will be operated in cw at an accelerating gradient of 12.5 MV/m. The modifications comprise of an integration of a piezo tuner system and a better thermal connection of the HOM antennas for allowing high beam current in cw operation. Site acceptance tests of both modules have been carried out at the Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) and by now the first cryomodule was successfully operated at design gradient and could be accepted. This talk will cover the experiences with a turn-key solution made by industry and will show the results of the site acceptance tests."

These properties enable muon spin rotation (muSR) as a precise probe for local magnetism. muSR has been used to characterize SRF materials since 2010. At TRIUMF a so called surface beam implants muons at a material dependent depth of about 150 µm in the bulk. A dedicated spectrometer was developed for field of first vortex penetration and pinning strength measurements of SRF materials in parallel magnetic fields of up to 300 mT. A low energy beam available at PSI implants muons at variable depth in the London layer allowing for direct measurements of the London penetration depth from which the lower critical field and the superheating field can be calculated. This facility is limited to parallel magnetic fields of up to 25 mT. Here",

        "There is a lot of excitement about ultra-compact laser plasma accelerators (LPA)",
        "and they are being praised as the enabling technology for next-generation accelerators and light-sources. However many questions remain among \"non-experts\" outside the field: What performance can realistically be expected? Will LPA-based facilities be indeed as compact and relatively inexpensive as is being advertised? Are reliable user facilities feasible in the next couple of decades and is it realistic that such facilities will someday be able to replace conventional and SRF-based accelerators? Or will laser-plasma acceleration be a complementary technology",

It is shown that the interplay of the broadening of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) peaks and a decrease of a quasiparticle gap caused by the RF currents produces a minimum in Rs(H0) and an extended rise of the quality factor Q(H0) with the RF field. Paramagnetic impurities shift the minimum in Rs(H0) to lower fields and can reduce Rs(H0) in a wide range of H0. Subgap states in the DOS can give rise to a residual surface resistance while reducing Rs at higher temperatures. A proximity-coupled normal layer can shift the minimum to either low and high fields and can reduce Rs below that of an ideal surface. The field dependence of Q(H0) can be very sensitive to the materials processing. The nonlinear RF losses can be minimized by tuning pairbreaking effects using impurity management or surface nanostructuring."

        "Nb thin film SRF cavities have demonstrated for many years their strong potential as being an alternative to bulk Nb cavities [1]. However most of the defects observed in the Nb layers originate from defects inherited from the substrate itself [2]. Two routes are used to manufacture Cu cavities. The first one consists of forming the half-cells independently by either spinning or electro-hydroforming. The latter are then joined together and to the cut-offs by electron-beam welding. The second one is a seamless process in which the cell is entirely spun around a mandrel and then electron-beam welded to the cut-offs. Both approaches require welding",

        "inspired from a technology used to form small diameter vacuum chambers [3]. The cavity is formed by electrodeposition of Cu on a sacrificial mandrel whose surface state will determine the inner cavity¿s surface quality. The strength of the process relies on the total absence of welding. We present the values obtained for Young Modulus",

It injects short heat pulses to resistors at exact known space and time coordinates. Results obtained by the different algorithms and measurements with the calibration tool are presented with an emphasis on the possible spatial resolution and the estimation of systematic uncertainties of the methods."
