      "abstract": "Nowadays linac accelerating RF systems design is usually done by the finite difference method. It provides high accuracy of calculations and freedom in topology choosing, but may draw considerable amounts of computer resources with long calculation times. Alternative to this method, equivalent circuit method exists. The basic idea of this method is to build a lumped element circuit, which with certain approximation acts as an original accelerating cell. It drastically reduces the number of equations to solve. This method is long known but usually only used for the particular accelerating structures when speed of calculation is a key-factor. Present paper describes a way to numerically simulate transition processes in arbitrary coupled accelerating cells using the equivalent circuit method. This approach allows simulating transitional processes in accelerating structures significantly faster and allows doing so for structures with high quality factor and many cells - a hard task for conventional transient solvers based on the finite difference method.",

        "A four gap OFHC copper rebuncher is developed at SNRC as a research study and a risk reduction for the MEBT of SARAF Phase II proton/ deuteron linac. The rebuncher is designed to bunch a 5 mA CW beam at 176 MHz. The required cavity voltage according to beam dynamics evaluation is 150 kV with a beam aperture diameter of 40 mm at a beam energy of 1.3 MeV/u with a Q value of 8000. Considering utilizing this cavity for enhancing the beam energy",
        "the cooling configuration is explored for a cavity voltage of 300 kV",
        "consuming 20 kW dissipated power",
        "at a peak electric field of 16 MV/m",
        "equivalent to the Kilpatrick limit. The electro magnetic study conducted with the CST RF simulation package was reproduced at ANSYS HFSS. The simulated dissipated power along the rebuncher for 20 kW forward power injected through the coupler port with the HFSS driven model were assigned to the ANSYS Fluent model to explore the resulted temperature map. Several evolved cooling configurations were studied",
        "including cooling of the drift tubes. In this configuration the temperature rise along the cavity is in the range of 30 K. A detailed design of the four gap rebuncher is following this study."

The horizontal space for MEBT elements is limited because two beam lines merge at 18-degree angle. The MEBT includes two compact quarter-wave RF bunchers and four short quadrupoles with steerers",
        "all within the length of about 1 m. The beam size in the MEBT is large",
        "comparable to the beam-pipe aperture",

Our results indicate significant emittance growth in MEBT not predicted by the standard beam dynamics codes. Its origin is traced mainly to the quadrupole edge fields; the buncher RF fields also contribute noticeably. Proposed design modifications improve the MEBT performance."

        "including a more recent one addressing static fluxes arising from magnetic components near a 5-cell cavity. This paper reports on a preliminary study of the dynamic fluxes generated by a thermal current. Such a thermal current arises from the Seebeck effect and flows in closed loops formed by a niobium cavity and its surrounding tuner rods and liquid helium vessel that are made of stainless-steel. The behaviors of magnetic fluxes in response to various thermal profiles on a 5-cell CEBAF cavity with integrated tuner rods were studied in a JLAB VTA dewar. An outcome of this study is a proposed cool-down procedure for eliminating the thermal current generated magnetic fluxes around 5-cell cavities placed in CEBAF tunnels. This procedure may be useful to improve cavity Q0 in a cost-effective manner",
        "which in turn saves cryogenic expenditures for sustaining CEBAF operation."
