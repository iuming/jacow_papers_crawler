        "The KEK injector linac has delivered electrons and positrons for particle physics and photon science experiments for more than 30 years. It is planned to inject electron and positron beams with energies from 2.5 GeV to 7 GeV pulse-by-pulse at 50 Hz into the dual ring SuperKEKB collider and two light source storage rings. As the beam quality requirement from SuperKEKB is demanding",
        "the beam orbit and optics conditions have to be maintained precisely. To that end 64 newly designed pulsed magnets were installed. Quadrupole magnets with the inductance of 1 mH are driven by power supplies with pulses up to 330 A and 0.5 ms",
        "which recover the energy stored in coils up to 65%. Orbit corrector magnets with the inductance of 3 mH are driven with bipolar pulsed power supplies up to 10 A. Those power supplies are controlled under the event-based synchronized controls and monitored pulse-by-pulse",
        "and are confirmed to have the stability over weeks within 0.1%. The details of the design and the operational performance will be reported."
