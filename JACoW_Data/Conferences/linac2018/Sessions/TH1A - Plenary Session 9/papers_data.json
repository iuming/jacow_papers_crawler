        "The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) at RAL has studied the ionization cooling of muons. Several million individual particle tracks have been recorded passing through a series of focusing magnets in a number of different configurations and a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride absorber. Measurement of the tracks upstream and downstream of the absorber has shown the expected effects of the 4D emittance reduction. This invited talk presents and discusses these results",

        "The Advanced Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment (AWAKE) aims at studying plasma wake field generation and electron acceleration driven by proton bunches. It is a proof-of-principle R&D experiment at CERN and the world’s first proton driven plasma wake field acceleration experiment. The experiment uses the 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS which travels through a 10 m long Rb-vapour plasma cell where it gets self-modulated and generates the plasma wake fields. Eventually an electron beam is injected externally to probe the wake-fields. AWAKE will has completed several experimental campaigns starting in 2016. Results from the initial characterization of the plasma cell and measurements of the seeded self-modulation of the proton beam will be presented. Experiments to accelerate externally injected electrons using the proton driven plasma wake fields will start in 2018 and first results will be reported."

Moving to THz frequencies could potentially allow larger bunches to be captured and accelerated. Here the THz is generated via Cherenkov radiation in a non-linear dielectric from a laser pulse. Two schemes are proposed either by accelerating in a dielectric waveguide or by creating a travelling focus in the THz allowing direct acceleration.
