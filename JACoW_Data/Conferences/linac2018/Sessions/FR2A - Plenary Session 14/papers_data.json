        "MEBT and a superconducting linac section which consists of three cryomodules built by IMP based on HWR cavity at 162.5 MHz frequency and one cryomodule built by IHEP based on SPOKE cavity at 325 MHz. Stable proton beam acceleration with CW 2 mA/10 MeV has been demonstrated successfully at IMP by 12 HWR cavities with two cryomodules operating at 4.5 k. Beam commissioning with pulsed 10 mA/25 MeV and CW 0.2 mA/25 MeV has been conducted. A lot of efforts have been made to achieve a long-term stable CW beam operation during the beam commissioning. Hours continuous operation without beam trip at CW 0.2 mA/18 MeV was achieved. Recently the low level RF control system and other sub-systems are under refurbishment and the next goal of beam commissioning is CW 1 mA/25 MeV. This talk will present development and the latest beam commissioning results of the 10’25 MeV superconducting proton linac and the lessons learned.",
