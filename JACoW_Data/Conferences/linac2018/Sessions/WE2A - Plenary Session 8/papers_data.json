For the past two years LANL’s Accelerator Operations & Technology Division has executed a $6.4M improvement project for the Isotope Production Facility. The goals were to reduce the programmatic risk and enhance facility reliability while at the same time pursuing opportunities to increase general isotope production capacity. This has led to some exciting innovations. In this paper we will discuss the engineering designs for an upgraded beam raster system",
        "a new beam diagnostics capabilities and our new collimator",
        "which is both adjustable and ’active’ (beam current and temperature measurements). We will report on results obtained and lessons learned from the commissioning phase and initial production run.",
