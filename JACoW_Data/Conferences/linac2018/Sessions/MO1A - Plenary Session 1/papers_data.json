        "an 80MeV DTL linac",
        "and a 1.6GeV Rapid Cycling Syn-chrotron (RCS). In August 2017 the first 1.6GeV proton beam hit on the tungsten target and production neutrons were monitored. This paper will report the major steps and results of the machine commissioning and beam commissioning of the CSNS front end and linac. In the first section",
        "a brief introduction of the CSNS accelerator design and present status will be presented. Then",
        "we will share our commissioning experience in the front end and the DTL linac in the following sections."
