        "low emittance and low energy spread electron bunches is nowadays a critical requirement for accelerators in plasma wave or for femto-second light sources. A new longitudinal compression scheme",
        "based on velocity and ballistic bunching tech-niques in presence of space charge forces",
        "allows to enter in a peculiar regime",
        "so-called laminar bunching (LB). In this regime",
        "the bunch is longitudinally compressed",
        "at the expense of its transverse size",
        "and the over-bunching is forbidden by the laminarity: going to the minimal longi-tudinal dimension the bunch is adiabatically frozen and transversally refocused. Furthermore this technique heats slightly the uncorrelated energy spread resulting in elec-tron distributions that",
        "in case of bending paths",
        "does not require Laser Heater devices."
