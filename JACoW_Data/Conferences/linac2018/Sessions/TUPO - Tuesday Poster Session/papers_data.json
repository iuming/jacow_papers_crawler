LUE-200 electron Linac consits of two disk loaded travelling wave accelerating structure with the operating frequency of 2856 MHz and power compression SLED-type system. The limits by the accelerated beam current are defined for different pulse durations of the beam current and RF power. The calculated results are discussed and compared with the measurements. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The extent of this rework varied greatly. At the end of production four accelerating modules could not be qualified in time before the tunnel installation was to be finished in September 2016. Meanwhile the cavity strings of two of these accelerating modules have been disassembled in the DESY clean room. The cavities have been retreated at DESY either by additional high pressure water rinsing or BCP flash chemical treatment. All cavities were vertically tested and 15 out of 16 were qualified for the reassembly of the cavity strings. One accelerating module will be reassembled completely and tested until the end of 2018; the other will follow in the first half of 2019. We report on retreatment procedures and performance of these cavities."

        "Superconducting cavities with two beam pipes had been proposed in the past for energy recovery linac applications. The relatively complex geometry of those cavities presented a serious challenge for fabrication and surface processing. Main concerns have now been overcome with the production and successful RF testing of a new elliptical twin-axis cavity proposed by Jefferson Lab and optimized by the Center for Accelerator Science at Old Dominion University in the frame of a DoE accelerator stewardship program. The cavity design provides uniform accelerating or decelerating fields for both beams. This paper describes the cavity design",
        "fabrication experience",
        "and the first cold RF test results and explores potential applications especially for Jefferson Lab s EIC (JLEIC)."

A uniform distribution of nucleation centers is essential to the uniformity of Nb3Sn films. In this paper we report several experimental phenomena on the Sn nucleation on Nb surface. Better nucleation in the downstream of the pumping direction was observed. Influence of SnCl2 partial pressure inhomogeneity was studied. Samples with higher SnCl2 partial pressure have denser nucleation",

VEP parameters for 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavities are being studied using a nine-cell coupon cavity and our unique Ninja cathode. The investigated VEP parameters heretofore were applied on a 1.3 GHz Tesla shape nine-cell superconducting RF cavity for bulk removal of 100 µm followed by fine removal of 20 and 10 µm. The interior surface was found to be smooth and shiny after the VEP process. Our recently developed dual flow technique",
        "in which the EP acid is flown separately in the Ninja cathode housing and cavity",
        "yielded lower asymmetry in removal along the cavity length. The cavity was tested in a vertical cryostat after the final VEP process. The cavity achieved 28.3 MV/m at Q0 value of 6.7x109. The cavity performance was almost the same as in the baseline vertical test performed after the HEP process."

The annealing serves activation process by removing the oxide layer. The in-situ nitrogen infusion system was prepared to investigate whether nitrogen infusion effect or something changes happen in the case of applying nitrogen infusion technique without removing the oxide layer. It can only introduce nitrogen into a cavity during 120 C low temperature baking and transport a cavity to the vertical test system without exposure to the atmosphere. We tried to infuse nitrogen to a single cell by keeping 120 C and 48 hours with 3 Pa nitrogen. The cavity was annealed in another furnace and applied high pressure rinsing before nitrogen infusion. The vertical test result was same Q as the normal 120 C baking without nitrogen. It suggests that oxide layer prevents infusion of nitrogen. In this poster",

For a successful operation of the GBS a high brightness low emittance electron beam is of crucial importance. The warm RF linac is designed in two stages - one with the beam up to 300 MeV",
        "and another one about 720 MeV. The S-band photo-injector is combined with a C-band linac. The beam is transported by transfer lines to the interaction points. In this paper we report the results of computer simulations of the electron beam transport in the low energy linac and transfer line up to the low energy interaction point (IP1). The simulation model makes it possible to predict the beam parameters to be recuperated in case of failure of any magnetic or accelerating elements as well as it enables to determine the optimal parameters of replaced components. It will be used for the development of the Gamma Beam System in the future."

        "the accelerator community is increasingly looking at novel accelerating techniques to overcome these limitations. Moving from the RF to the THz frequency range",
        "higher acceleration gradients of high energy beams can be achieved in compact structures. Beam dynamics studies are crucial as part of the design of novel accelerating structures to maximise the output beam current as well as the accelerating gradient. In this paper we present beam dynamics simulations through dielectric lined waveguide structures using novel techniques to simulate broadband signals for particle tracking studies in RF-Track. The beam parameters through the structure are optimised and we study the dynamics of general broadband accelerating structures."

In order to improve the dosimetry of radiation which products received and to prevent loss of the attacked- beams to the edge of products, the exact evaluation of scanning length is necessary . One of the other challenges of the scanning beam is the lack of uniformity in dosimetry of received radiation . The scanning beam does not collide in parallel to the products, which is also a challenge to accelerator efficiency. To improve dosimetry of received radiation, the use of trajectory correction magnets is suggested. These magnets correct the beams that do not scan in parallel. Also, using the Monte Carlo code, the dosing rate of received radiation to products is simulated and compared in two non-uniform and uniform modes (corrected by trajectory correction magnets. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
