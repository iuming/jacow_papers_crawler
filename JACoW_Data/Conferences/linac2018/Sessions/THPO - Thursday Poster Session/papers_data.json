        "an energy spread compression structure is designed to match the RF acceptance of damping ring. A longitudinal bunch length control is also necessary to meet the energy spread requirement in the linac by a bunch compressor system after the damping ring. Both designs for damping ring and energy/bunch compressors are discussed in this paper."

All merger designs in established and upcoming machines involve significant bending of the injected beam ’ even using a so-called straight merger bends the injected beam several degrees. We propose a merger which reduces the bending of the injected beam by an order of magnitude. By passing both beams through a septum magnet followed by an rf separator cavity with a superimposed dipole magnetic field",

      "abstract": "One of the main research instruments at the institute for nuclear physics at the TU Darmstadt is the recirculating superconducting linear accelerator S‑DALINAC. Many improvements were implemented since the first recirculated beam in 1991. One of the major enhancement is the upgrade from a twice to a thrice recirculating scheme in 2015/2016. With this upgrade the operation mode can be changed between a conventional accelerating operation and energy recovery linac (ERL) mode by an 180° rf phaseshift of the beam done via a path length variation of the arcs in the second recirculation. ERL operation was not possible when the rf control system for the superconducting structures was set up in 2010. Therefore the current rf control system is not optimized for this kind of operation and so it had to be tested during ERL operation in order to also demonstrate its capability of this operation mode. In August 2017 a first once recirculating ERL operation was achieved. During this operation measurements regarding the rf control stability and the demand of rf power were done. This contribution is discussing this measurements and possible improvements for future energy recovery beam times. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

These multiple parts are staked and brazed into a complete structure. We consider an alternative approach: precision milling of multiple cells and couplers into metal blocks that comprise halves or quadrants of the complete structure. We successfully produced a 12~GHz Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) main linac accelerating structure prototype using this method. A previous prototype was designed as an open structure with a gap between cell irises. Here we describe a different approach",

      "abstract": "Based on the positive results of the unmodulated 325 MHz Ladder-RFQ prototype from 2013 to 2016, we developed and designed a modulated 3.3 m Ladder-RFQ*. The unmodulated prototype Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. The RFQ was high power tested at the GSI test stand. It accepted 3 times the RF power level needed in operation**. That level corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 µs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project. This particular high frequency creates difficulties for a 4-ROD type RFQ, which triggered the development of a Ladder RFQ with its higher symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is a suitable candidate for that frequency. For the present design duty cycles are feasible up to 5%. The basic design and tendering of the RFQ has been successfully completed in 2016. Manufacturing will be completed in August 2018. We will show the the finalization of manufacturing as well as first low level RF measurements of the Ladder RFQ. *Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 874 (2017) 012048 **Proceedings of",
