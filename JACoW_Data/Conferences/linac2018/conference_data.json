It provides high accuracy of calculations and freedom in topology choosing, but may draw considerable amounts of computer resources with long calculation times. Alternative to this method, equivalent circuit method exists. The basic idea of this method is to build a lumped element circuit, which with certain approximation acts as an original accelerating cell. It drastically reduces the number of equations to solve. This method is long known but usually only used for the particular accelerating structures when speed of calculation is a key-factor. Present paper describes a way to numerically simulate transition processes in arbitrary coupled accelerating cells using the equivalent circuit method. This approach allows simulating transitional processes in accelerating structures significantly faster and allows doing so for structures with high quality factor and many cells - a hard task for conventional transient solvers based on the finite difference method.",

This paper reports on a preliminary study of the dynamic fluxes generated by a thermal current. Such a thermal current arises from the Seebeck effect and flows in closed loops formed by a niobium cavity and its surrounding tuner rods and liquid helium vessel that are made of stainless-steel. The behaviors of magnetic fluxes in response to various thermal profiles on a 5-cell CEBAF cavity with integrated tuner rods were studied in a JLAB VTA dewar. An outcome of this study is a proposed cool-down procedure for eliminating the thermal current generated magnetic fluxes around 5-cell cavities placed in CEBAF tunnels. This procedure may be useful to improve cavity Q0 in a cost-effective manner",

            "ADAM (Application of Detectors and Accelerators to Medicine) is a CERN spin-off company currently working on the construction and testing of the LIGHT (Linac for Image-Guided Hadron Therapy) machine. LIGHT is an innovative high-frequency linac based proton therapy system designed to accelerate protons up to 230 MeV: it consists of three different linac sections i.e. a 750 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) accelerating the beam up to 5 MeV; a 3 GHz Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac (SCDTL) up to 37.5 MeV; and a 3 GHz Coupled Cavity Linac (CCL) section up to 230 MeV. The compact and modular design is based on cutting edge technologies developed for particle colliders and adapted to the needs of hadron therapy beams. The LIGHT development machine is currently being built at CERN and this paper describes its design aspects and its different stages of installation and commissioning."

            "For the European XFEL 102 accelerating modules were built and tested. Several accelerating modules had to be reworked due to different kinds of non-conformities. The extent of this rework varied greatly. At the end of production four accelerating modules could not be qualified in time before the tunnel installation was to be finished in September 2016. Meanwhile the cavity strings of two of these accelerating modules have been disassembled in the DESY clean room. The cavities have been retreated at DESY either by additional high pressure water rinsing or BCP flash chemical treatment. All cavities were vertically tested and 15 out of 16 were qualified for the reassembly of the cavity strings. One accelerating module will be reassembled completely and tested until the end of 2018; the other will follow in the first half of 2019. We report on retreatment procedures and performance of these cavities."

            "higher temperature operation and potentially higher accelerating gradients (~ 96 MV/m) compared to conventional niobium. This material is formed by vaporizing Sn in a high temperature vacuum furnace and letting the Sn absorb into a Nb substrate to form a 2-3 um Nb3Sn layer. Current Nb3Sn cavities produced at Cornell achieve Q ~ 1010 at 4.2 K and 17 MV/m. Here we present a summary of the current performance of Nb3Sn cavities at Cornell and recent progress in improving the accelerating gradient."

            "Vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique have been successfully developed for 1.3 GHz niobium (Nb) single cell cavity to achieve a smooth surface with uniform removal and better RF performance as achieved after horizontal EP (HEP) process. VEP parameters for 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavities are being studied using a nine-cell coupon cavity and our unique Ninja cathode. The investigated VEP parameters heretofore were applied on a 1.3 GHz Tesla shape nine-cell superconducting RF cavity for bulk removal of 100 Âµm followed by fine removal of 20 and 10 Âµm. The interior surface was found to be smooth and shiny after the VEP process. Our recently developed dual flow technique",

            "yielded lower asymmetry in removal along the cavity length. The cavity was tested in a vertical cryostat after the final VEP process. The cavity achieved 28.3 MV/m at Q0 value of 6.7x109. The cavity performance was almost the same as in the baseline vertical test performed after the HEP process."

The annealing serves activation process by removing the oxide layer. The in-situ nitrogen infusion system was prepared to investigate whether nitrogen infusion effect or something changes happen in the case of applying nitrogen infusion technique without removing the oxide layer. It can only introduce nitrogen into a cavity during 120 C low temperature baking and transport a cavity to the vertical test system without exposure to the atmosphere. We tried to infuse nitrogen to a single cell by keeping 120 C and 48 hours with 3 Pa nitrogen. The cavity was annealed in another furnace and applied high pressure rinsing before nitrogen infusion. The vertical test result was same Q as the normal 120 C baking without nitrogen. It suggests that oxide layer prevents infusion of nitrogen. In this poster",

In this paper we report the results of computer simulations of the electron beam transport in the low energy linac and transfer line up to the low energy interaction point (IP1). The simulation model makes it possible to predict the beam parameters to be recuperated in case of failure of any magnetic or accelerating elements as well as it enables to determine the optimal parameters of replaced components. It will be used for the development of the Gamma Beam System in the future."

In order to improve the dosimetry of radiation which products received and to prevent loss of the attacked- beams to the edge of products, the exact evaluation of scanning length is necessary . One of the other challenges of the scanning beam is the lack of uniformity in dosimetry of received radiation . The scanning beam does not collide in parallel to the products, which is also a challenge to accelerator efficiency. To improve dosimetry of received radiation, the use of trajectory correction magnets is suggested. These magnets correct the beams that do not scan in parallel. Also, using the Monte Carlo code, the dosing rate of received radiation to products is simulated and compared in two non-uniform and uniform modes (corrected by trajectory correction magnets. reference for this paper â» https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The algorithm takes the charge information obtained from beam diagnostic systems e.g. Beam Position Monitors (BPM) and information from the timing system. The BLC is a part of the LLRF controller implemented in the FPGA. The article presents the implementation of the algorithm in the FPGA and shows the results achieved with the BLC in the European XFEL."

It is a proof-of-principle R&D experiment at CERN and the worldâs first proton driven plasma wake field acceleration experiment. The experiment uses the 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS which travels through a 10 m long Rb-vapour plasma cell where it gets self-modulated and generates the plasma wake fields. Eventually an electron beam is injected externally to probe the wake-fields. AWAKE will has completed several experimental campaigns starting in 2016. Results from the initial characterization of the plasma cell and measurements of the seeded self-modulation of the proton beam will be presented. Experiments to accelerate externally injected electrons using the proton driven plasma wake fields will start in 2018 and first results will be reported."

            "One of the most critical design considerations for an energy recovery linac (ERL) is how to merge the injected bunch onto the linac axis with minimal beam degradation. All merger designs in established and upcoming machines involve significant bending of the injected beam â even using a so-called straight merger bends the injected beam several degrees. We propose a merger which reduces the bending of the injected beam by an order of magnitude. By passing both beams through a septum magnet followed by an rf separator cavity with a superimposed dipole magnetic field",
            "the injected beam bends minimally within the cavity",
            "while the recirculated beam bends to align with the linac axis. Here we describe the concept in detail and present simulation results to demonstrate the advantages of such a design",
            "particularly for magnetized beams or minimal energy separation between the injected and recirculated beams. Measurements from an experiment at CBETA evaluating the beam dynamics of the rf separator are presented and compared with simulation results."

          "abstract": "One of the main research instruments at the institute for nuclear physics at the TU Darmstadt is the recirculating superconducting linear accelerator SâDALINAC. Many improvements were implemented since the first recirculated beam in 1991. One of the major enhancement is the upgrade from a twice to a thrice recirculating scheme in 2015/2016. With this upgrade the operation mode can be changed between a conventional accelerating operation and energy recovery linac (ERL) mode by an 180Â° rf phaseshift of the beam done via a path length variation of the arcs in the second recirculation. ERL operation was not possible when the rf control system for the superconducting structures was set up in 2010. Therefore the current rf control system is not optimized for this kind of operation and so it had to be tested during ERL operation in order to also demonstrate its capability of this operation mode. In August 2017 a first once recirculating ERL operation was achieved. During this operation measurements regarding the rf control stability and the demand of rf power were done. This contribution is discussing this measurements and possible improvements for future energy recovery beam times. reference for this paper â» https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

One of them was troubles of high voltage power supply of klystrons. The other category is related to vacuum property in accelerating cavities. The vacuum pumps were reinforced at the RFQ#1 in 2009. The cleaning of the inside surface of some acceleration cavities were performed after the big earthquake in 2011. The cooling water flow rate drop had been a long-time issue. We modified a cooling system to take better flow balances. As a result of these improvement",

The unmodulated prototype Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. The RFQ was high power tested at the GSI test stand. It accepted 3 times the RF power level needed in operation**. That level corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 Âµs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project. This particular high frequency creates difficulties for a 4-ROD type RFQ, which triggered the development of a Ladder RFQ with its higher symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is a suitable candidate for that frequency. For the present design duty cycles are feasible up to 5%. The basic design and tendering of the RFQ has been successfully completed in 2016. Manufacturing will be completed in August 2018. We will show the the finalization of manufacturing as well as first low level RF measurements of the Ladder RFQ. *Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 874 (2017) 012048 **Proceedings of",

            "In recent state-of -arts accelerators like an X-ray free electron laser",
            "the electron beam performance of a linear accelerator demands a low emittance of ~ 2mm mrad. To obtain the low-emittance",
            "such a 500kV thermionic-gun at SACLA and a photocathode rf gun generating 0.5~1MeV electron beams had been developed. Although the photocathode rf gun is compact",
            "it is necessary to prepare a highly stabilized",
            "large and complicated laser system. The 500-kV thermionic-gun of SACLA injector has also to prepare a technically difficult and large high voltage system. Hence",

            "as extension of the established technology. This system quickly accelerates the electron up to 500keV to preserve the low emittance and to cancel a grid focusing effect by the space charge force of the beam. By using a particle tracking code",

Stable proton beam acceleration with CW 2 mA/10 MeV has been demonstrated successfully at IMP by 12 HWR cavities with two cryomodules operating at 4.5 k. Beam commissioning with pulsed 10 mA/25 MeV and CW 0.2 mA/25 MeV has been conducted. A lot of efforts have been made to achieve a long-term stable CW beam operation during the beam commissioning. Hours continuous operation without beam trip at CW 0.2 mA/18 MeV was achieved. Recently the low level RF control system and other sub-systems are under refurbishment and the next goal of beam commissioning is CW 1 mA/25 MeV. This talk will present development and the latest beam commissioning results of the 10â25 MeV superconducting proton linac and the lessons learned.",

        "The European Spallation Source under construction in Lund (Sweden) uses a 2 GeV-5MW pulsed superconducting linac as proton driver. Normal conducting accelerating structures are used up to 92 MeV and superconducting structures up to 2 GeV. Most linac components are designed and procured as in-kind contributions by institutes/laboratories in the European partner countries. Installation of the Ion source delivered by INFN-Catania started end 2017. Installation of more components and infrastructure progresses at a high pace. Commissioning of the normal conducting linac section will take place in parallel with installation of the superconducting section. Beam commissioning of the superconducting section will be done starting in 2021",
        "interlaced with the installation of additional high beta cryomodules. Beam will be sent to the target in 2022",
        "initially at an energy of 1.3 GeV. Start of the User Programme is scheduled in 2023",
        "when some neutron instruments will be ready and end of construction is in 2025",
        "with the full set of instruments operational. This paper reports the status of linac components construction",

        "we mounted 9.3GHz X-band LINAC designed by KERI on the 360 degree-rotatable O-arm system",
        "which allows efficient integration of a diagnostic tool with a radiotherapy equipment. After mounting",
        "the X-ray profile and percentage depth dose were measured by following the quality assurance using the AAPM TG-51",
        "142 protocol. The beam profile symmetry was estimated to be 102.4% with Â±3% tolerance. The X-ray dose was also measured by rotating the O-arm to confirm the stability of the mounted X-band LINAC. As a result",
        "the standard deviation of the X-ray dose was shown to be 0.016 while rotating. Therefore",
        "we demonstrate the feasibility of our O-arm X-band LINAC system for use in highly effective radiotherapy with simultaneous CT image guidance."

      "abstract": "Nowadays linac accelerating RF systems design is usually done by the finite difference method. It provides high accuracy of calculations and freedom in topology choosing, but may draw considerable amounts of computer resources with long calculation times. Alternative to this method, equivalent circuit method exists. The basic idea of this method is to build a lumped element circuit, which with certain approximation acts as an original accelerating cell. It drastically reduces the number of equations to solve. This method is long known but usually only used for the particular accelerating structures when speed of calculation is a key-factor. Present paper describes a way to numerically simulate transition processes in arbitrary coupled accelerating cells using the equivalent circuit method. This approach allows simulating transitional processes in accelerating structures significantly faster and allows doing so for structures with high quality factor and many cells - a hard task for conventional transient solvers based on the finite difference method.",

        "many activities have been recently projected with accelerator-based neutron generation. In the iBNCT (Ibaraki BNCT) project",
        "the accelerator is consisted with a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) and an Alvarez type drift-tube linac (DTL). Protons extracted from an ion source are accelerated up to 3 MeV and 8 MeV",

        "but the most significant difference is the higher duty factor to have a sufficient epithermal neutron flux for BNCT. We have started the commissioning from the end of 2016",
        "and the beam current of 1.3 mA with a repetition of 50 Hz has been achieved with an acceptable stability. Further beam commissioning and reinforcement of the vacuum and cooling water system will be performed toward higher beam current. In this contribution",

The horizontal space for MEBT elements is limited because two beam lines merge at 18-degree angle. The MEBT includes two compact quarter-wave RF bunchers and four short quadrupoles with steerers",

        "including a more recent one addressing static fluxes arising from magnetic components near a 5-cell cavity. This paper reports on a preliminary study of the dynamic fluxes generated by a thermal current. Such a thermal current arises from the Seebeck effect and flows in closed loops formed by a niobium cavity and its surrounding tuner rods and liquid helium vessel that are made of stainless-steel. The behaviors of magnetic fluxes in response to various thermal profiles on a 5-cell CEBAF cavity with integrated tuner rods were studied in a JLAB VTA dewar. An outcome of this study is a proposed cool-down procedure for eliminating the thermal current generated magnetic fluxes around 5-cell cavities placed in CEBAF tunnels. This procedure may be useful to improve cavity Q0 in a cost-effective manner",

These seam-less coated quarter wave resonators have shown some of the highest Q-values of all HIE-ISOLDE cavities in the acceptance tests. Furthermore",

        "For the European XFEL 102 accelerating modules were built and tested. Several accelerating modules had to be reworked due to different kinds of non-conformities. The extent of this rework varied greatly. At the end of production four accelerating modules could not be qualified in time before the tunnel installation was to be finished in September 2016. Meanwhile the cavity strings of two of these accelerating modules have been disassembled in the DESY clean room. The cavities have been retreated at DESY either by additional high pressure water rinsing or BCP flash chemical treatment. All cavities were vertically tested and 15 out of 16 were qualified for the reassembly of the cavity strings. One accelerating module will be reassembled completely and tested until the end of 2018; the other will follow in the first half of 2019. We report on retreatment procedures and performance of these cavities."

        "Bulk Niobium (Nb) SRF (superconducting radio frequency) cavities are currently the preferred method for acceleration of charged particles at accelerator facilities around the world. Since the SRF phenomena occurs within a shallow depth of 40 nm (for Nb)",
        "a proposed option has been to deposit a superconducting Nb thin film on the interior of a cavity made of a suitable alternative material such as copper or aluminum. While this approach has been attempted in the past using DC magnetron sputtering (DCMS)",
        "such cavities have never performed at the bulk Nb level. However",

        "The quality factor of the nitrogen-doped SRF cavities for the LCLS-II project are strongly impacted by cool down speed. A sufficiently fast cool down speed can produce large thermal gradient across a cavity and sufficiently expel magnetic flux when the cavity wall passes from the normal-conducting to the superconducting state. However",
        "instrumentation in LCLS-II production cryomodules has been kept at a minimum",
        "and additional information during the cool down of the modules is therefore desirable. In this work",

The investigated VEP parameters heretofore were applied on a 1.3 GHz Tesla shape nine-cell superconducting RF cavity for bulk removal of 100 Âµm followed by fine removal of 20 and 10 Âµm. The interior surface was found to be smooth and shiny after the VEP process. Our recently developed dual flow technique",

        "The nitrogen infusion is the new surface treatment technique for improving the RF loss and the maximum accelerating gradient of superconducting cavity. In this process",
        "it is important to be carried out continuously both the 800 C annealing in vacuum and 120 C nitrogen infusion without exposure to the atmosphere. The annealing serves activation process by removing the oxide layer. The in-situ nitrogen infusion system was prepared to investigate whether nitrogen infusion effect or something changes happen in the case of applying nitrogen infusion technique without removing the oxide layer. It can only introduce nitrogen into a cavity during 120 C low temperature baking and transport a cavity to the vertical test system without exposure to the atmosphere. We tried to infuse nitrogen to a single cell by keeping 120 C and 48 hours with 3 Pa nitrogen. The cavity was annealed in another furnace and applied high pressure rinsing before nitrogen infusion. The vertical test result was same Q as the normal 120 C baking without nitrogen. It suggests that oxide layer prevents infusion of nitrogen. In this poster",
        "the in-situ nitrogen infusion system and vertical test results will be reported."

      "abstract": "The output beam of a high-power linear accelerator, used for industrial purposes, is irradiated on products and scanning them. In order to improve the dosimetry of radiation which products received and to prevent loss of the attacked- beams to the edge of products, the exact evaluation of scanning length is necessary . One of the other challenges of the scanning beam is the lack of uniformity in dosimetry of received radiation . The scanning beam does not collide in parallel to the products, which is also a challenge to accelerator efficiency. To improve dosimetry of received radiation, the use of trajectory correction magnets is suggested. These magnets correct the beams that do not scan in parallel. Also, using the Monte Carlo code, the dosing rate of received radiation to products is simulated and compared in two non-uniform and uniform modes (corrected by trajectory correction magnets. reference for this paper â» https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Several million individual particle tracks have been recorded passing through a series of focusing magnets in a number of different configurations and a liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride absorber. Measurement of the tracks upstream and downstream of the absorber has shown the expected effects of the 4D emittance reduction. This invited talk presents and discusses these results",

It is a proof-of-principle R&D experiment at CERN and the worldâs first proton driven plasma wake field acceleration experiment. The experiment uses the 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS which travels through a 10 m long Rb-vapour plasma cell where it gets self-modulated and generates the plasma wake fields. Eventually an electron beam is injected externally to probe the wake-fields. AWAKE will has completed several experimental campaigns starting in 2016. Results from the initial characterization of the plasma cell and measurements of the seeded self-modulation of the proton beam will be presented. Experiments to accelerate externally injected electrons using the proton driven plasma wake fields will start in 2018 and first results will be reported."

Moving to THz frequencies could potentially allow larger bunches to be captured and accelerated. Here the THz is generated via Cherenkov radiation in a non-linear dielectric from a laser pulse.

All merger designs in established and upcoming machines involve significant bending of the injected beam â even using a so-called straight merger bends the injected beam several degrees. We propose a merger which reduces the bending of the injected beam by an order of magnitude. By passing both beams through a septum magnet followed by an rf separator cavity with a superimposed dipole magnetic field",

      "abstract": "One of the main research instruments at the institute for nuclear physics at the TU Darmstadt is the recirculating superconducting linear accelerator SâDALINAC. Many improvements were implemented since the first recirculated beam in 1991. One of the major enhancement is the upgrade from a twice to a thrice recirculating scheme in 2015/2016. With this upgrade the operation mode can be changed between a conventional accelerating operation and energy recovery linac (ERL) mode by an 180Â° rf phaseshift of the beam done via a path length variation of the arcs in the second recirculation. ERL operation was not possible when the rf control system for the superconducting structures was set up in 2010. Therefore the current rf control system is not optimized for this kind of operation and so it had to be tested during ERL operation in order to also demonstrate its capability of this operation mode. In August 2017 a first once recirculating ERL operation was achieved. During this operation measurements regarding the rf control stability and the demand of rf power were done. This contribution is discussing this measurements and possible improvements for future energy recovery beam times. reference for this paper â» https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

One of them was troubles of high voltage power supply of klystrons. The other category is related to vacuum property in accelerating cavities. The vacuum pumps were reinforced at the RFQ#1 in 2009. The cleaning of the inside surface of some acceleration cavities were performed after the big earthquake in 2011. The cooling water flow rate drop had been a long-time issue. We modified a cooling system to take better flow balances. As a result of these improvement",

      "abstract": "Based on the positive results of the unmodulated 325 MHz Ladder-RFQ prototype from 2013 to 2016, we developed and designed a modulated 3.3 m Ladder-RFQ*. The unmodulated prototype Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. The RFQ was high power tested at the GSI test stand. It accepted 3 times the RF power level needed in operation**. That level corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 Âµs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project. This particular high frequency creates difficulties for a 4-ROD type RFQ, which triggered the development of a Ladder RFQ with its higher symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is a suitable candidate for that frequency. For the present design duty cycles are feasible up to 5%. The basic design and tendering of the RFQ has been successfully completed in 2016. Manufacturing will be completed in August 2018. We will show the the finalization of manufacturing as well as first low level RF measurements of the Ladder RFQ. *Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 874 (2017) 012048 **Proceedings of",

        "The GSI UNILAC together with SIS18 will serve as injector for the future FAIR. A modified 1.4~MeV/u gas stripper setup has been developed",
        "aiming at an increased yield into the particular desired charge state. The setup delivers short pulses of high gas density in synchronization with the beam pulse. This provides a higher gas density. Different gases as stripping targets were tested. Measurements with various isotopes and gas densities were conducted to investigate the stripping properties. High intensity beams of 238U4+ were successfully stripped using hydrogen as stripping gas. The stripping efficiency was significantly increased while the beam quality remained suitable. The new stripper setup and major results achieved during the development are presented. Problems with the fast valves arose while they were used for a longer duration. Another revision of the setup took place to exchange the valves. In parallel",
        "the installation of the required infrastructure for regular operation of the gas stripper using hydrogen was planned."

Stable proton beam acceleration with CW 2 mA/10 MeV has been demonstrated successfully at IMP by 12 HWR cavities with two cryomodules operating at 4.5 k. Beam commissioning with pulsed 10 mA/25 MeV and CW 0.2 mA/25 MeV has been conducted. A lot of efforts have been made to achieve a long-term stable CW beam operation during the beam commissioning. Hours continuous operation without beam trip at CW 0.2 mA/18 MeV was achieved. Recently the low level RF control system and other sub-systems are under refurbishment and the next goal of beam commissioning is CW 1 mA/25 MeV. This talk will present development and the latest beam commissioning results of the 10â25 MeV superconducting proton linac and the lessons learned.",
