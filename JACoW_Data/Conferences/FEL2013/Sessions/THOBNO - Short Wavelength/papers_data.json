        "superconducting linear accelerator. The facility is being designed to produce high peak and high average brightness coherent soft x-rays in the wavelength range of 1-12 nm",
        "with shorter wavelengths accessible in harmonics or in expansion FELs. The facility performance requirements are based on a wide spectrum of scientific research objectives",
        "requiring high flux",
        "narrow-to-wide bandwidth",
        "broad wavelength tunability",
        "femtosecond pulse durations",
        "and two-color pulses with variable relative timing and polarization",
        "all of which cannot be encompassed in one FEL design. In addition",
        "the cost of the facility requires building in a phased approach with perhaps three initial FELs and up to 9-10 FELs in the long term. We describe three very unique and complimentary FEL designs here as candidates for the first NGLS configuration."

        "by properly correlating the electron energy with transverse position one can approximately satisfy the FEL resonance condition for all electrons. Motivated by recent work in the high-gain regime***",
        "we investigate the utility of a TGU for low gain FELs at x-ray wavelengths. We find that a TGU may make an XFELO realizable in the largest ultimate storage rings now under consideration (e.g.",
