        "Recently two-color XFEL operation with a relative wavelength separation of 30 % has been achieved at SACLA in hard x-rays. In the two-color operation at SACLA",
        "a simple and lucid scheme is employed",
        "namely the first and second halves of the undulators are set at different K values. To make a time delay between the two-color photon pulses",
        "a magnetic chicane is installed between the two undulator sections to detour the electron beam. Since the two-color pulses are emitted from the same electron bunch",
        "there is no time jitter and the delay can be finely adjusted up to 40 fs. Two wavelengths can be freely selected in hard x-rays. The photon pulse length of the single-color operation measured by an autocorrelation technique is less than 10 fs (FWHM). The two-color operation of SACLA",
        "which provides femtoseconds-short pulses with a GW-level peak power",
        "is an ideal light source for x-ray pump x-ray probe experiments."
