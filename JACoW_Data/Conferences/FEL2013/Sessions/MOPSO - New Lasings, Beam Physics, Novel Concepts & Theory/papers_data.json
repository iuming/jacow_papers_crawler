        "We present a new method that uses CCD images of the FERMI electron beam at the dump spectrometer after the undulator to determine various electron beam and external seed laser properties. By taking advantage of the correlation between time and electron beam energy for a quasi-linearly chirped electron beam and the fact that the FERMI seed laser pulse (~180 fs) is much shorter than the electron beam duration (~1 ps)",
        "measurements of the e-beam pulse length and temporally local energy chirp and current are possible. Moreover",
        "the scheme allows accurate determination of the timing jitter between the electron beam and the seed laser",
        "as well as a measure of the latter's effective pulse length in the FEL undulators. The scheme can be also provide an independent measure of the energy transferred from the electron beam to the FEL output radiation. We describe the proposed method as well as some experimental results obtained at the seeded FERMI FEL."

Thomson scattering of THz pulses on ultrathin electron layers with only 50 MeV energy can generate for example 170 as long single-cycle pulses at 80 nm wavelength with 0.1 nJ energy. Coherent undulator radiation of ultrathin electron layers with 450 MeV energy can generate single-cycle radiation in the 20 nm – 1000 nm wavelength range.

The model neglects a so called resonant mode wakefield and has an (integrable) singularity at the origin which makes difficult its use in practical simulations. In this work we generalize the longitudinal wake of a sinusoidally modulated wall to include the effect of the resonant mode. This also removes the singularity of the wake at the origin. The new wake is used to evaluate the roughness wakefield effect in the undulator of SwissFEL.",

After the FEL the electron beam is merged again with the hadron one and the amplified electric field in the electron beam acts back on each hadron resulting",
