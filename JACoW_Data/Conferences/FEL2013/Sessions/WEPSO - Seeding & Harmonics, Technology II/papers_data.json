The energy modulated electrons will then be bunched in the dispersive section and will radiate in the second undulator. We will detect the second harmonic of the HHG radiation around 50 nm. This experiment has several challenges never tried before: co-propagation of the electron beam and the drive laser",

The commissioning will show if this kind of in-line chamber has advantages with respect to more traditional approaches with optical beam transport.

The optical delay is less than 1 ps. The design is based upon a fully coherent treatment of the SASE FEL beam propagating from the upstream SASE undulator through the entire seeding monochromator system. This approach guides the design optimization in order to preserve the transverse beam profile entering the seeding undulator to ensure maximum efficiency."

Electron optics demagnify the modulation period and then an emittance exchange line translates the modulation to the longitudinal direction resulting in coherent bunching at x-ray wavelength. The predicted output radiation at 1 keV from a 7 MeV electron beam reaches 10 nJ or 6X108 photons per shot and is fully coherent in all dimensions",

Their combination allows obtaining a dramatic increase the XFEL output peak power and a shortening of the photon pulse duration to levels sufficient for performing bio-imaging of single protein molecules at the optimal photon-energy range between 3 keV and 5 keV. We show here that it is possible to achieve up to a 100-fold increase in peak-power of the X-ray pulses at the European XFEL: the X-ray beam would be delivered in 10 fs-long pulses with 50 mJ energy each at a photon energy around 4 keV. We confirm by simulations that one can achieve diffraction before destruction with a resolution of 0.25 nm resolution."
