        "During the month of October 2012 the commissioning of the light source FEL-2 at FERMI was successfully concluded. Fermi FEL-2 is the first seeded FEL operating with a double stage cascade in the \"fresh bunch injection\" mode*. The two stages are two high gain harmonic generation FELs where the first stage is seeded by the 3rd harmonic of a Ti:Sa laser system",
        "which is up converted to the 4th-6th harmonic. The output of the first stage is then used to seed the second stage. A final wavelengths of 10.8 nm was obtained as the 24th harmonic of the seed wavelength at the end of the two frequency conversion processes",
        "demonstrating that the FEL is capable of producing single mode narrow bandwidth pulses with an energy of several tens of microjoules.",

        "The superconducting RF photoinjector (SRF gun) operating with a 31/2-cell niobium cavity and Cs2Te photocathodes is installed at the ELBE radiation center. The gun provides beams for ELBE as well as in a separate diagnostics beam line for beam parameter measurements. Since 2012 a new UV driver laser system developed by MBI has been installed for the SRF gun . It delivers CW or bust mode pulses with 13 MHz repetition rate or with reduced rates of 500",

        "A new super-radiant THz source has successfully been put into operation at the ELBE radiation source. The facility combines a broad-band transition or diffraction radiation source with an 8 period undulator. Both sources are inherently synchronized by generating radiation from the same electron bunch. This",
        "together with the possibility to operate the machine in CW with repetition rates of 100kHz to 13MHz makes the new source a very versatile tool for a broad range of experiments",
        "particularly for THz based electron bunch diagnostics. With the low beam energy (our first experiments were done at 28 MeV) the bunch compression becomes a major challenge. We have generated coherent radiation with wavelengths as short as 200 microns indicating a compression of a major fraction of the bunch into a pulse with 200 fs bunchlength. Our design target is a compression down to 100 fs and to reach 100 micron wavelength (3THz)."
