        "Design and simulation of CAEP THz free electron laser (FEL) have been carried out using our 3D-OSIFEL code. The main work focuses on the optimization to different parameters of optical resonator and wiggler. The wiggler peak field strength and electron beam energy have been selected with eleven frequencies ranging from 1 THz to 3 THz. The gain and power of resonator are calculated",
        "which are corresponding to eleven frequencies. It can be seen by simulation results that when facility works at 2.6 THz",
        "the gain and output power are the highest in the frequency range from 1 THz to 3 THz. So the experiment may be conducted at this frequency first. When the device works toward 1 THz",
        "the slippage length and the loss of optical resonator will increase due to the increase of the radiation wavelength",
        "which results in the reduction of the gain and output power. So experiment running at 1THz could be challenged and the scheme of elliptical hole-coupling optical resonator is proposed to solve the problem. The simulation results show that the elliptical hole-coupling output is effective and applicable for the THz FEL and the output power can be increased by more than 30%."

        "for some applications",
        "such a pulse structure spoils the time resolution. To improve the pulse characteristics of KU-FEL for ultrafast spectroscopy we have developed a simple two-stage optical system after the FEL output. In the first stage we introduce double plasma shutters for the ultrafast switching-on/off of a pulse train. In the second stage we introduce a bulk nonlinear material with several mm thickness to broaden the FEL spectrum through self-phase modulation so that we do not have to scan the FEL wavelength during the measurement. A combined use of this two-stage optical system and the single-shot spectral measurement technique we have recently developed for the mid-infrared wavelength region [2]",
