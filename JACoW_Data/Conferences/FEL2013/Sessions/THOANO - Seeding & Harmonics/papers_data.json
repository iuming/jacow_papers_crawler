        "We performed the higher-order harmonic (HH) seeded FEL operation at a 61.2 nm fundamental wavelength",
        "using a seeding source of HH pulses from a Ti:sapphire laser at the SCSS (EUV-FEL) accelerator. It is important for the HH seeded FEL scheme to synchronize the seeding laser pulses to the electron bunches. We constructed the relative arrival timing monitor based on Electro-Optic sampling (EOS). Since the EOS-probe laser pulses were optically split from HH-driving laser pulses",
        "the arrival time difference of the seeding laser pulses",
        "with respect to the electron bunches",
        "were measured bunch-by-bunch. This non-invasive EOS monitor made uninterrupted",
        "real-time monitoring possible even during the seeded FEL operation. The EOS system was used for the arrival timing feedback with a few-hundred-femtosecond adjustability for continual operation of the HH-seeded FEL. By using the EOS-locking system",
        "the HH seeded FEL was operated over half a day with a 20-30% hit rate. The output pulse energy reached 20uJ at the 61.2 nm wavelength. A user experiment was performed by using the seeded EUV-EL and a clear difference between the SASE-FEL and the seeded FEL was observed."

        "High brightness electron beams necessary for high gain FEL usually require a laser heater in order to increase the local energy spread in the low energy part of the machine that can mitigate the microbunching instabilities developing in the compressors and in the rest of the linac. Microbunching suppression is essential for FEL operations both in SASE and in seeded mode since it can strongly affect the final electron beam properties. In the case of HGHG",
        "due to the seeding mechanism",
        "the FEL process is extremely sensitive to the amount of energy spread at the undulator entrance",
        "and the FEL output may depend to the amount of heating. In this work we characterize the dependence of the FEL output as a function of the laser heater intensity in the case of FERMI FEL-1. Results also show that for a non Gaussian distribution of the electron beam energy the HGHG may produce significant radiation with an energy spread significantly higher than what expected for a simple Gaussian distribution."
