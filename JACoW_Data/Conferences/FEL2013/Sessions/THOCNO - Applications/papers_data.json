The proposed project takes the advantage of our expertise acquired from the previous R&D on high-power lasers and high current ERL accelerator to design an advanced source with photon energy ranging from 10s of eV (soft X-ray) up to MeV (Gamma-ray) and high photon flux on the level of 1010~1013 photons/second. We will show the feasibility study for achieving the expected parameters under the existing machine conditions",
        "and will investigate the possibility to further extend the photon energy and flux with practical machine upgrades and modifications. With such an addition to JLab FEL facility",
        "its photon capability of the JLab FEL facility would cover the broadest spectrum ever",

        "The generation of two-color FEL pulses by the same electron bunch at FERMI-FEL has opened unprecedented opportunity for jitter-free FEL pump-FEL probe time resolved coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) experiments in order to access spatial aspects in dynamic processes. This possibility was first explored in proof-of-principle resonant CDI experiments using specially designed sample consisting of Ti grating. The measurements performed tuning the energies of the FEL pulses to the Ti M-absorption edge clearly demonstrated the time dependence of Ti optical constants while varying the FEL-pump intensity and probe time delay. The next planned CDI experiments in 2013 will explore transient states in multicomponent nanostructures and magnetic systems",
