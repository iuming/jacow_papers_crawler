            "The PAL-XFEL adopts a de-chirper system to remove the residual beam chirps with wakefield in corrugated pipes for the soft X-ray FEL line which is branched at 3 GeV point of the 10-GeV linac and does not have enough length of accelerating structures. The corrugated structure which is about 20 m long is designed to have the rectangular geometry and adjust the gap from 2 to 30 mm. We carried out the elegant code simulations using the wake formulas of G. Stupakov and K. Bane for the rectangular geometry to find the optimum parameters of corrugation using longitudinal wakes as well as to find the tolerance of vertical offset using transverse wakes. A 1-m long test de-chirper module is being designed and will be tested experimentally in July 2013 at the injector test facility in Pohang Accelerator Laboratory",

According to our numerical calculations it is possible to generate as short as 10 nm long electron layers if a single-period modulator undulator with period length significantly shorter than the resonant one is used and the undulator parameter is only K=0.25. Thomson scattering of THz pulses on ultrathin electron layers with only 50 MeV energy can generate for example 170 as long single-cycle pulses at 80 nm wavelength with 0.1 nJ energy. Coherent undulator radiation of ultrathin electron layers with 450 MeV energy can generate single-cycle radiation in the 20 nm – 1000 nm wavelength range. The corresponding pulse energy and pulse duration vary in the 10 pJ – 2 nJ and 47 as – 2.1 fs ranges",

The model neglects a so called resonant mode wakefield and has an (integrable) singularity at the origin which makes difficult its use in practical simulations. In this work we generalize the longitudinal wake of a sinusoidally modulated wall to include the effect of the resonant mode. This also removes the singularity of the wake at the origin. The new wake is used to evaluate the roughness wakefield effect in the undulator of SwissFEL.",

A careful estimate of the transport of the dark current is crucial in order to minimize radiation damage to the components and activation of the machine. This paper describes the generation and the transport of dark current from the SwissFEL photo injector downstream of the accelerator. The analysis is based on numerical simulations and experimental measurements performed at the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility (SITF). In the simulations the charge distribution is generated by an emission model based on the Fowler-Nordheim equation taking into account the filling time of the cavity and then tracked through the machine. This model has been used to analyze the impact of a low energy collimation system upstream of the first travelling wave accelerating structure on the dark current transport. A slit with several apertures has been installed in the SITF to benchmark the simulations and to verify the impact of the wakefields on the nominal beam."

The dominant sources of slice misalignments for FELs are the incoherent and coherent synchrotron radiation within bunch compressors as well as transverse wake fields in the accelerating cavities. This is of particular importance for over-compression which is required for one of the key operation modes for the SwissFEL planned at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The centroid shift is corrected using corrector magnets in dispersive sections",

First and second order corrections are achieved by pairs of sextupole and quadrupole magnets in the horizontal plane while skew quadrupoles correct to first order in the vertical plane.

Compression in the linac is done in two double achromats which implies a positive R56 unlike the commonly used chicane compressor scheme with negative R56. Compression using the achromats scheme requires the electron bunch to be accelerated on a falling RF slope resulting in an energy chirp that longitudinal wakefields will boost along the linac. This permits a stronger compression. In this proceeding we will present how the longitudinal wakefields interact with the bunch compression in the double achromat scheme compared with the chicane compression case. Focus is brought on how the unique MAX IV linac lattice is fully capable to cope with the high demands of an FEL injector. The charge related electron beam jitter in both set-ups will also be investigated.",

            "Zeuthen Site (PITZ) is one of the leading producers of high brightness electron beams for linac based Free Electron Lasers (FELs) with a specific focus on the requirements of FLASH and the European XFEL. The main activities at PITZ are devoted to the detailed characterization and optimization of electron sources yielding to an extremely small transverse beam emittance. The cathode laser pulse shaping is considered as one of the key issues for the high brightness photo injector. Beam dynamics simulations show that the injector performance could be further improved by replacing the typical cylindrically shaped PITZ bunches by uniformly filled 3D ellipsoidal shaped electron beams. A set of numerical simulations were performed to study the beam dynamics of uniformly filled 3D ellipsoidal bunches with 1 nC charge in order to find an optimum PITZ machine setup which will yield the best transverse emittance. Simulation results comparing both options of cylindrical and 3D ellipsoidal beams are also presented and discussed."

We calculate the probability density distribution of the maximum power of the radiation pulses for different levels of shot noise. It turns out that the temporal coherence quickly increases as the noise level reduces. We also show that the FEL based on coherent spontaneous emission produces almost Fourier transform limited pulses and the time-bandwidth product is mainly determined by the bunch length and the interaction distance in an undulator. We also propose a scheme that permits the formation of electron bunches with a reduced level of noise and a high gradient of the current at the bunch tail to enhance coherent spontaneous emission.

            "the gain and output power are the highest in the frequency range from 1 THz to 3 THz. So the experiment may be conducted at this frequency first. When the device works toward 1 THz",

So experiment running at 1THz could be challenged and the scheme of elliptical hole-coupling optical resonator is proposed to solve the problem. The simulation results show that the elliptical hole-coupling output is effective and applicable for the THz FEL and the output power can be increased by more than 30%."

Their combination allows obtaining a dramatic increase the XFEL output peak power and a shortening of the photon pulse duration to levels sufficient for performing bio-imaging of single protein molecules at the optimal photon-energy range between 3 keV and 5 keV. We show here that it is possible to achieve up to a 100-fold increase in peak-power of the X-ray pulses at the European XFEL: the X-ray beam would be delivered in 10 fs-long pulses with 50 mJ energy each at a photon energy around 4 keV. We confirm by simulations that one can achieve diffraction before destruction with a resolution of 0.25 nm resolution."

This SDU will enable time-resolved x-ray pump / x-ray probe experiments as well as sequential diffractive imaging on a femtosecond to picosecond time scale. The wavefront of the x-ray FEL pulses will be split by an edge of a silicon mirror coated with Mo/B4C and W/B4C multilayers. Both partial beams will then pass variable delay lines. For different wavelengths the angle of incidence onto the multilayer mirrors will be adjusted in order to match the Bragg condition. Hence",

            "The generation of two-color FEL pulses by the same electron bunch at FERMI-FEL has opened unprecedented opportunity for jitter-free FEL pump-FEL probe time resolved coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) experiments in order to access spatial aspects in dynamic processes. This possibility was first explored in proof-of-principle resonant CDI experiments using specially designed sample consisting of Ti grating. The measurements performed tuning the energies of the FEL pulses to the Ti M-absorption edge clearly demonstrated the time dependence of Ti optical constants while varying the FEL-pump intensity and probe time delay. The next planned CDI experiments in 2013 will explore transient states in multicomponent nanostructures and magnetic systems",

The primary goal of this work was to explore CSR output and effect on the beam with variation of the bunch compression in the IR chicane. This experiment also provides a valuable opportunity to benchmark existing CSR models in a system that may not be fully represented by a 1-D CSR model. Here we present results from this experiment and compare to initial simulations of CSR in the magnetic compression chicane of the machine. Finally",

According to our numerical calculations it is possible to generate as short as 10 nm long electron layers if a single-period modulator undulator with period length significantly shorter than the resonant one is used and the undulator parameter is only K=0.25. Thomson scattering of THz pulses on ultrathin electron layers with only 50 MeV energy can generate for example 170 as long single-cycle pulses at 80 nm wavelength with 0.1 nJ energy. Coherent undulator radiation of ultrathin electron layers with 450 MeV energy can generate single-cycle radiation in the 20 nm – 1000 nm wavelength range.

In this work we generalize the longitudinal wake of a sinusoidally modulated wall to include the effect of the resonant mode. This also removes the singularity of the wake at the origin.

The FEL array requires a beam spreader system which can distribute individual electron bunches from the linac to each independently configurable beamline. We propose a new spreader system using RF deflecting cavities to deflect electron bunches as an alternative design to the fast kicker scheme. This RF approach offers more stable deflection amplitude while removing the limitations on the bunch repetition rate characteristic of the kicker approach. In this work",

This paper describes the generation and the transport of dark current from the SwissFEL photo injector downstream of the accelerator. The analysis is based on numerical simulations and experimental measurements performed at the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility (SITF). In the simulations the charge distribution is generated by an emission model based on the Fowler-Nordheim equation taking into account the filling time of the cavity and then tracked through the machine. This model has been used to analyze the impact of a low energy collimation system upstream of the first travelling wave accelerating structure on the dark current transport. A slit with several apertures has been installed in the SITF to benchmark the simulations and to verify the impact of the wakefields on the nominal beam."

The dominant sources of slice misalignments for FELs are the incoherent and coherent synchrotron radiation within bunch compressors as well as transverse wake fields in the accelerating cavities. This is of particular importance for over-compression which is required for one of the key operation modes for the SwissFEL planned at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The centroid shift is corrected using corrector magnets in dispersive sections",

Compression in the linac is done in two double achromats which implies a positive R56 unlike the commonly used chicane compressor scheme with negative R56. Compression using the achromats scheme requires the electron bunch to be accelerated on a falling RF slope resulting in an energy chirp that longitudinal wakefields will boost along the linac. This permits a stronger compression. In this proceeding we will present how the longitudinal wakefields interact with the bunch compression in the double achromat scheme compared with the chicane compression case. Focus is brought on how the unique MAX IV linac lattice is fully capable to cope with the high demands of an FEL injector. The charge related electron beam jitter in both set-ups will also be investigated.",

The main activities at PITZ are devoted to the detailed characterization and optimization of electron sources yielding to an extremely small transverse beam emittance. The cathode laser pulse shaping is considered as one of the key issues for the high brightness photo injector. Beam dynamics simulations show that the injector performance could be further improved by replacing the typical cylindrically shaped PITZ bunches by uniformly filled 3D ellipsoidal shaped electron beams. A set of numerical simulations were performed to study the beam dynamics of uniformly filled 3D ellipsoidal bunches with 1 nC charge in order to find an optimum PITZ machine setup which will yield the best transverse emittance. Simulation results comparing both options of cylindrical and 3D ellipsoidal beams are also presented and discussed."

These studies involved the implementation of a Hamamatsu C5680 streak camera with dual sweep capabilities and the transport of optical transition radiation (OTR) generated at an upstream Cu mirror and of coherent spontaneous emission radiation (CSER) generated in the undulator to the streak camera location outside of the linac tunnel.

One of the tasks at PITZ is the detailed characterization of longitudinal properties of the produced electron bunches. The measurements of the electron bunch longitudinal phase space can be done by tomographic methods using measurements of the momentum spectra by varying the electron bunch energy chirp. At PITZ the energy chirp of the electron bunch can be changed by varying the RF phase of the accelerating structure downstream the gun. The resulting momentum distribution can be measured in a dispersive section installed downstream the accelerating structure. The idea of the measurement and the tomographic reconstruction technique is described in this paper.

        "and commissioning is planned to start in the second quarter of 2014. The 3 GeV linac will be used as a full energy injector for the two storage rings",
        "and as a high brightness driver for a Short Pulse linac light source. The linac has been deigned to also handle the high demands of an FEL injector. The long term strategic plan for the MAX IV laboratory includes an extension of the linac to 5 GeV and an X-ray FEL. In this paper we present the both design concept and status of the MAX IV linac along with parameters of the 3 GeV high quality electron pulses. We also present the first design and simulation results of the upgrade to a 5 GeV X-ray FEL driver."

We calculate the probability density distribution of the maximum power of the radiation pulses for different levels of shot noise. It turns out that the temporal coherence quickly increases as the noise level reduces. We also show that the FEL based on coherent spontaneous emission produces almost Fourier transform limited pulses and the time-bandwidth product is mainly determined by the bunch length and the interaction distance in an undulator. We also propose a scheme that permits the formation of electron bunches with a reduced level of noise and a high gradient of the current at the bunch tail to enhance coherent spontaneous emission.

We propose a novel scheme which may result in the next generation Compton source for soft X-rays.

The multi-stream beam distribution is created within a single bunch through EEHG mechanism which results in well separated bands with close energies. The wavelength of the microbunching caused by the two-stream instability strongly depends on the beam parameters and can be reduced down to soft X-ray wavelengths that are not achievable with other mechanisms.

We propose a different approach based on the use of a Vlasov equation composed by two contributions accounting for the Liouville and diffusive part of the interaction. The equation is solved using simplectic integration procedures which provide an effective method of solution",

Their combination allows obtaining a dramatic increase the XFEL output peak power and a shortening of the photon pulse duration to levels sufficient for performing bio-imaging of single protein molecules at the optimal photon-energy range between 3 keV and 5 keV. We show here that it is possible to achieve up to a 100-fold increase in peak-power of the X-ray pulses at the European XFEL: the X-ray beam would be delivered in 10 fs-long pulses with 50 mJ energy each at a photon energy around 4 keV. We confirm by simulations that one can achieve diffraction before destruction with a resolution of 0.25 nm resolution."

The fluctuation of the electron beam position has been observed in horizontal and vertical directions. The origin of the beam position fluctuation is not clarified. In horizontal direction",

        "we have been working to extend the tunable range of the FEL [4]. By replacing the original 1.6-m undulator into a 1.8 m one",
        "the tunable range was expanded from 10-13 to 5-15 μm in January 2012. Then we fabricated a new undulator duct to reduce the minimum undulator gap from 20 to 15 mm. At 15-mm gap",
        "the FEL gain can be expected to be twice as high as that at 20 mm gap. Commissioning of the new duct will be done in the end of this April. In this presentation",
        "we will report on the result of the commissioning such as tunable range of KU-FEL and the estimated FEL gain",

We report the latest results obtained at FERMI that uses the two-stage HGHG scheme for generation of FEL pulses in the soft x-ray. A characterization of the FEL performance in terms of power",
