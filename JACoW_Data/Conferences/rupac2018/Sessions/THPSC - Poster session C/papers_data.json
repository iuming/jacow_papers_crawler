New RF-cavity of 13-th harmonic was installed during the booster upgrade in 2013-2015 to increase top energy to 1 GeV. The complex work on synchrotron radiation output modernization was performed",

        "the resolution was studied. The bunch length dependence was measured for different RF cavity voltages while beam current changes and compared with the potential well distortion model. Good agreement with theory proved system operability. In addition the results of bunch length current dependence obtained by dissector at VEPP-2000 collider were compared with streak-camera measurements being in a good agreement. The synchrotron tune dependence on RF-cavity voltage was measured both at BEP and VEPP."

Single optical fiber section can cover the entire accelerator instead of using a large number of local beam loss monitors. Timing of optical signal gives the location of the beam losses along the beamline. In this paper summary of the monitor application at the BINP Injection Complex is given.

        "As the accelerated objects in work the possibility of use of separate domains of a ferromagnetic is considered. Also perhaps an existence of solid-state communication of domains is possible. Acceleration is carried out at the expense of a gradient of the base magnetic field. The magnetic field of ferromagnetics creates a longitudinal potential well in the base magnetic field. The gradient of the base magnetic field does not exceed a gradient of this potential well and does not allow the accelerated objects to go beyond its limits. Depth of a potential well can be increased at the expense of the electron stream which is in this potential well. He does not leave area of a well too",
        "being reflected from its walls. There is some semblance of the moving adgezator used at coherent acceleration of protons by electronic rings. A certain similarity of repetition of the idea of acceleration of protons electronic rings due to acceleration of electronic rings external fields is possible. It can be as magnetic fields with the corresponding gradient of a longitudinal field",
        "and electric fields also. Some kind of combination of coherent acceleration of neutral domains of a ferromagnetic by the magnetic and electric field turns out. Estimates show that at number of atoms about 10 in 14 degrees their acceleration to 1 MEV apart approximately in 1 meter is possible. The sizes of domains are about 10 in minus fifth degree of meter. Longitudinal magnetic fields are in range of 1 Tesla.",

All researches have to develop their own numerical codes or have to use the analytical formulas which are obtained only for the small number of targets with approximations of infinity dimensions and far field zone. In this report we present the code for calculation of DR characteristics from metal targets with finite dimensions and finite distance to detector. The calculation approach in this code is based on the generalized surface current method. Above method is suitable for the targets with the ideal conductivity (metal target case) and applicable for diffraction and transition radiation (TR)",
