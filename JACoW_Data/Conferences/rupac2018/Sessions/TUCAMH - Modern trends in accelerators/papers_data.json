        "The AWAKE experiment at CERN has demonstrated plasma wakefield acceleration driven by a high-energy proton beam. The proton beam self-modulates in the plasma into the train of short micro-bunches and excites the plasma wave that traps and accelerates a bunch of externally injected electrons. The measured energy of accelerated electrons (up to 2 GeV)",
        "the micro-bunch structure",
        "and the proton beam divergence after the plasma section agree with theoretical predictions."
