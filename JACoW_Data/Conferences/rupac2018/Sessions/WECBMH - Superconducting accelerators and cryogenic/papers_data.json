For strong transverse focusing a special final focus system consisted of four superconducting large-aperture high-gradient quadrupole magnets will be installed at the end of the HED@FAIR beam line. Design and main characteristics of the quadrupole are discussed. Stress - strain dependence of the quadrupole superconducting cable and electrical strength of the cable insulation are measured. Results of mechanical and thermal calculation of main parts of the quadrupole are presented.",
