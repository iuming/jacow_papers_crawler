Accelerator is based on coaxial half-wave RF cavity. Electrons gain required energy by several passing of accelerating cavity. The paper presents the results of electron dynamics computer simulation with space charge influence. Injection parameters to accelerating cavity are determined. These parameters provide sufficient conditions to achieve required electron energy and minimal beam current losses. According to calculations to achieve 1.5 MeV electron energy gain RF power no less than 165 kW is required. First tests of the facility were performed with RF power up to 180 kW. The measured electron beam energy after one pass is 1.5 MeV. Then the electron beam is returned to the accelerating cavity by the recycling beam system. The measured electron beam energy after the second pass is 3 MeV. The electron energy spectrum and the average beam current were determined on each acceleration stage. The estimation of the transverse beam dimensions was additionally performed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

      "abstract": "Recently the first section of a standalone superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) heavy ion Linac as a demonstration of the capability of 217 MHz multi gap Crossbar H-mode structures (CH) has been commissioned and extensively tested with beam at GSI. The demonstrator set up reached acceleration of heavy ions up to the design beam energy and beyond. The required acceleration gain of 0.5 MeV/u was achieved with heavy ion beams even above the design mass to charge ratio at maximum available beam intensity and full beam transmission. This contribution presents further development and optimization of the HIM/GSI cw-Linac. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

An inner banding is used in contrast with traditional collars. 4. The whole structure is bonded by a film adhesive VK-36",

The accurate measurement of AC losses is important for a comparison choice among different HTS conductors and for estimations of the total level of losses into final magnet too. This article presents the measurement of transport AC losses (i.e. the losses in magnetic field which is generated by the alternating transport current) in HTS coils. Two model HTS coils with the racetrack geometry have been fabricated from 2nd generation HTS conductor supplied by two vendors. The measurement was performed by electrical method at the sinusoidal current with the amplitude up to 32 A and at the frequencies lain into interval from 5 up to 100 Hz.

It is based on IBA (Belgium) Cyclone 70 proton cyclotron with proton energy up to 70 MeV and beam current up to 750 uA. The proton beam is split into two halves to provide simultaneous operation of two target stations. NRC KI - IHEP develops the design of the target station to produce nuclides Sr82 and Ge68 by the 70 MeV proton beam with current up to 375uA (2.3x1015 proton/s). The present work is devoted to selection of target station materials to minimize the induced radioactivity of equipment during isotopes production. The main source of this radioactivity is a flux of secondary neutrons cre-ated from proton-nuclear interactions with target materials. The nucleon-nucleus interactions and the transport of particles in substances were simulated by package of Monte Carlo codes",

Modeling results of induced radioactivity accumulation on the typical particle canal downstream internal target by Monte Carlo method are given. The wide set of various material specimens was espoused during one U-70 run in vicinity of internal target and specific radioactivity of identified long-lived nuclides was measured. Decay curves of ambient dose and specific radioactivity were calculated and analyzed for all activated specimens. Some fragments of U-70 equipment from radioactive waste storage also were investigated and specific radioactivity of their long-lived nuclides were measured. Unexpectedly 44Ti with 60 years half-life was identified in some cooper and stainless steel fragments. Production cross sections of 44Ti (and other nuclides) on copper were evaluated after irradiation by 50 GeV protons. These data can be used to provide radiation safety when working with radioactive elements of accelerator equipment",
