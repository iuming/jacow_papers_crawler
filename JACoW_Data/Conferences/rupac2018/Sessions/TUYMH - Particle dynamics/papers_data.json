        "crystalline deflectors of different lengths and different bending angles have also found application to provide experimental physical installations with ion beams. The report overviews recent results of activity in implementing crystal deflectors to extract proton and ion beams for the fixed-target experiments at the U-70 synchrotron of IHEP of National Research Centre \"Kurchatov Institute\".",

        "in multibunch mode one can provide collision of four bunches and space charge compensation. One can say",
        "that this configuration consists of electron storage ring with electron-electron collisions and the positron storage ring with positron-positron collisions. The new scheme may solve the well-known problem of separating instabilities of the four-beam compensation."
