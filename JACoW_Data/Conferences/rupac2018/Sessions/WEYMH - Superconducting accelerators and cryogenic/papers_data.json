        "The international FAIR project will provide particle beams with high intensity. It is planed to accelerate ions of all natural elements of the periodic table as well as antiprotons. The heart of the complex facility is the SIS100 synchrotron with a magnetic rigidity of 100 T*m and a circumference of 1080 m. The procurement of its fast cycling superconducting magnets is already started in 2017/18. After a short overview of the overall project progress we present the already obtained experience on the dipoles series production. In addition the first results and further planning of magnet production and testing of the main quadrupoles and corrector magnets",
