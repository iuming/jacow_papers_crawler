        "Status of the development of the 2.5 MV electron cooling system for the NICA collider is reported. The goal of the system is to cool both ion beams during experiment. Cooling of beams during collision prevents grows of beam emittance by compensation of heating effects (intra-beam scattering",

Numerical algorithm describing the charged particle dynamics and the envelope of the stored particle bunch in a trap with electro-magnetic field is developed and used. The stability of charged particle motion is analyzed. The results are applied to the case of the PMS trap with rotating electric field. An example of optimization of the PMS trap parameters is presented. reference for this paper using",

We present numerical studies on beam quality optimization in a laser-plasma accelerator with external injection from an RF linac. This acceleration scheme is planned to be tested experimentally within the framework of the ATHENAe project at the SINBAD facility at DESY",

        "cost-efficient accelerator technology with a sufficient beam quality for various applications in Helmholtz centers and beyond. Start-to-end simulations show that the normalized transverse emittance can be preserved by tailoring the longitudinal density profile of the plasma entrance and exit with smooth vacuum-plasma and plasma-vacuum transitions. Moreover",
        "the injection of an electron beam in the proper phase of the laser-driven plasma wave and its short length with respect to the plasma wavelength allow the relative energy spread of the beam to be decreased during the acceleration process. The effect of the injection phase on the accelerated beam quality is investigated through tolerance studies on the arrival time jitter between the electron beam and the external laser."
