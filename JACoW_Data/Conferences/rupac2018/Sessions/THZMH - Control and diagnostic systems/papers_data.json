      "abstract": "Methods of processing a digital signal proportional to the longitudinal intensity of ions in bunches during their acceleration in synchrotrons are discussed. The method of computerized tomography is used for reconstruction a longitudinal two-dimensional distribution function of ions in the bunch from the data on its profiles depending on synchrotron motion of particles. Examples of tomographic studies of ion beams at the Nuclotron are presented.",
