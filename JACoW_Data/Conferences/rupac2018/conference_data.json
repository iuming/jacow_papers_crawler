VEPP-2000 with SND and CMD-3 detectors carried out two successful data-taking runs after new BINP injection complex was commissioned. The 2016/2017 run was dedicated to high energy range (640-1000 MeV per beam) while the 2017/2018 run was focused at 275-600 MeV/beam energies. With sufficient positron production rate and upgraded full-energy booster the collider luminosity was limited by beam-beam effects",

Thorough machine tuning together with new ideas introduced to suppress flip-flop allowed to establish new world record for beam-beam parameter and bunch-by-bunch luminosity values at specific beam energies. The achieved luminosity increased 2-5 times in a whole energy range in comparison to phase-1 operation (2010-2013)."

Next experiments are the collecting data at maximal beam energy for gamma-gamma physics and Y-mesons study. The first luminosity at Y(1S) meson (~4.75 GeV) is obtained. For maximal luminosity at high energy the new electron positron injector is used. To obtain maximal beam energy of 5.2 GeV upgrade of RF system and power supply system of VEPP-4M is performing. The laser polarimeter is used to measure the beam energy with resonance depolarization at high energy of VEPP-4M.

            "The installation of superconducting insertion device on storage ring gives an opportunity to increase the photon flux in the required range of synchrotron radiation spectrum and shift the photon spectrum to hard X-ray region. During more than 30 years BINP developed the superconducting insertion devices for generation of synchrotron radiation. More than 20 superconducting wigglers which were produced by BINP are used on many storage rings around the world. Each of them was optimized for the individual requirements of the experiments and taking into account the characteristics of the storage rings. However all the device can be conditionally divided into several groups with similar features: high field wigglers (up to 7.5 T) with long period (140-200 mm)",
            "middle field (2.5-4.2 T) with middle period (46-64 mm) and low field (2-2.1 T) with short period (30-34 mm). The superconducting wiggler cryostats which are developed in BINP are operated not only with zero liquid helium consumption but even with a lower relative to the atmosphere pressure despite of additional heat load from the electron beam and from the current of ~1000 A for supplying of superconducting magnet. This allows not only to avoid a helium loss but also to increase the level of the magnetic field due to the shifting of the critical parameters of superconducting wire. The features of magnetic and cryogenics systems of the superconducting wigglers produced in BINP are presented in this report."

          "abstract": "The equation of Hill finds application in the different fields of science and technology, including accelerating technique. The known approaches assume the analysis of stability of the decision after definition of eigenvalues of a matrix of transition from initial values of couple of fundamental decisions to their values through the period of the function defining an oscillation frequency of amplitudes of decisions. Fundamental decisions are defined by the numerical solution of differential equations for amplitude and a phase received immediately from the equation of Hill. The different way of analytical submission of fundamental solutions of the equation of Hill and numerical approach to its decision is given in work. In it matrix approach to a task and the simplified algorithm of its decision corresponding to it is used. The received results are compared to results of the solution of the equation of Hill in the traditional way. On some plane the solution of the equation of Hill will be displayed in the form of closed curves with the repeating sites. At the same time curves will be not periodic if a change of a phase is incommensurable with 2Pi. If the solution of the equation of Hill is not limited, it will be displayed in the form of two spirals. Zero of some integral can judge stability of the decision on equality Thus, the specified technique of the solution of the equation of Hill allows along with finding of couple of fundamental decisions to define their stability. reference for this paper using",

One of the disadvantages is the appearance of hot lesions in the proximal region beyond the borders of the target volume. It lowers the dose conformity to the target volume and the treatment quality. One of the possible solutions of this problem is a multi-layer energy filter proposed by Sakae Takeji et al. The idea of this device is to change its geometry depending on the required modulation width of the spread-out Bragg peak. However",

The new device is called Composite Ridge Filter. It combines the traditional ridge filter with an additional absorbing material to control the beam intensity and regulate SOPB (Spread-out Bragg peak) modulation width. In our previous study we have calculated the geometry for 95% isodose spherical contour irradiation and it was tested with Monte-Carlo simulation. Now we have improved the technique of geometry findings and prepare the experimental tests with proton beams of INR linac."

Because of the high radiobiological danger of neutron radiation, especially fast neutrons, their contribution to the total beam flux substantially increases the dose received by the patient. We conducted studies of the braking gamma quanta and neutrons flows directly at the place of the patient's treatment at a distance of 1 m from the virtual source of gamma quanta with a radiation field size of 20x20 cm2. The use of direct spectrometric methods for measuring the flux of gamma quanta and neutrons in this case is extremely difficult due to the high flux density (according to some estimates ~1012 particles*cm-2*s). Therefore, for solving this problem, we used the photoactivation method. Registration of gamma quanta and neutrons was carried out using (gamma, n) and (n, gamma)-reactions. The natural tantalum 181Ta as one of the most studied nuclei in both photonuclear reactions and in reactions with neutrons in a wide energy range, was used as a detecting target. For the experiment, two Varian Trilogy medical accelerators with different operating life were used: accelerator 1 with long operating life (boundary energy 18 MeV) accelerator 2 with short operating life (boundary energy 20 MeV). reference for this paper using",

Monitoring of fast neutrons at modern accelerator and experimental facilities is very important to keep radiation damage of electronic components under control. One more step towards fast neutron measurements with thermal neutron counters in moderators is reported here. A set of neutron transport simulations is done to optimize moderator/radiator/absorber assemblies for higher sensitivity to neutrons with energies above 100 kev along with much lower sensitivity at lower energies. The resulting pair of the main and complementary monitors is designed."

Accelerator is based on coaxial half-wave RF cavity. Electrons gain required energy by several passing of accelerating cavity. The paper presents the results of electron dynamics computer simulation with space charge influence. Injection parameters to accelerating cavity are determined. These parameters provide sufficient conditions to achieve required electron energy and minimal beam current losses. According to calculations to achieve 1.5 MeV electron energy gain RF power no less than 165 kW is required. First tests of the facility were performed with RF power up to 180 kW. The measured electron beam energy after one pass is 1.5 MeV. Then the electron beam is returned to the accelerating cavity by the recycling beam system. The measured electron beam energy after the second pass is 3 MeV. The electron energy spectrum and the average beam current were determined on each acceleration stage. The estimation of the transverse beam dimensions was additionally performed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

RFQ may be independent accelerator or as part of injection system into DTL of high energy. There are considered compact RFQ with high operating frequency (for example frequencis of P-diapason). So magnetic focusing is absent mathematical methods of control theory are used for optimization of RFQ vane geometry to obtain exit beam parameters suitable for further acceleration. It is possible separate acceleration a few type of ions in single RFQ channel or simultaneous acceleration if (case of heavy ions) ion currents are very small. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The current amplitude instability from pulse to pulse is ensured at a level better than 10-3. The stability of the amplitude of the magnetic field in the lenses can be improved to a value of 100 ppm by introducing additional feedback over the field of the magnet using the integrating ADC VsDC produced by BINP. The developed source meets both the requirements for stability of output parameters and automation requirements for integration into modern accelerator systems."

          "abstract": "The possibility of production of the coils based on high-temperature superconductors (HTS) for accelerator applications is now under preliminary study in many accelerator centres and laboratories. The alternating magnetic field in these magnets causes an energy dissipation (AC losses). The accurate measurement of AC losses is important for a comparison choice among different HTS conductors and for estimations of the total level of losses into final magnet too. This article presents the measurement of transport AC losses (i.e. the losses in magnetic field which is generated by the alternating transport current) in HTS coils. Two model HTS coils with the racetrack geometry have been fabricated from 2nd generation HTS conductor supplied by two vendors. The measurement was performed by electrical method at the sinusoidal current with the amplitude up to 32 A and at the frequencies lain into interval from 5 up to 100 Hz. The measurement scheme and results are presented. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

It is based on IBA (Belgium) Cyclone 70 proton cyclotron with proton energy up to 70 MeV and beam current up to 750 uA. The proton beam is split into two halves to provide simultaneous operation of two target stations. NRC KI - IHEP develops the design of the target station to produce nuclides Sr82 and Ge68 by the 70 MeV proton beam with current up to 375uA (2.3x1015 proton/s). The present work is devoted to selection of target station materials to minimize the induced radioactivity of equipment during isotopes production. The main source of this radioactivity is a flux of secondary neutrons cre-ated from proton-nuclear interactions with target materials. The nucleon-nucleus interactions and the transport of particles in substances were simulated by package of Monte Carlo codes",

Modeling results of induced radioactivity accumulation on the typical particle canal downstream internal target by Monte Carlo method are given. The wide set of various material specimens was espoused during one U-70 run in vicinity of internal target and specific radioactivity of identified long-lived nuclides was measured. Decay curves of ambient dose and specific radioactivity were calculated and analyzed for all activated specimens. Some fragments of U-70 equipment from radioactive waste storage also were investigated and specific radioactivity of their long-lived nuclides were measured. Unexpectedly 44Ti with 60 years half-life was identified in some cooper and stainless steel fragments. Production cross sections of 44Ti (and other nuclides) on copper were evaluated after irradiation by 50 GeV protons. These data can be used to provide radiation safety when working with radioactive elements of accelerator equipment",

Energy spread value of the beam is an important parameter in a choice of energy step during measurement of e+e− -> hadrons cross sections as well as it has a strong influence on the statistic collection time required for the scanning of narrow resonances like planned for the nearest future scan of Upsilon(2s) meson. Thus",

The paper presents measurements of the beam energy spread at the VEPP-4M electron-positron collider in its complete energy range.

          "abstract": "A distributed optical fiber based beam loss monitor has been implemented for the Budker INP Injection Complex designed to accelerate and store electron and positron beams up to 500 MeV. The principle of the device operation consists in detecting the Cherenkov radiation generated in an optical fiber by relativistic charged particles produced in an electromagnetic shower when beam hits the accelerator vacuum chamber wall. Single optical fiber section can cover the entire accelerator instead of using a large number of local beam loss monitors. Timing of optical signal gives the location of the beam losses along the beamline. In this paper summary of the monitor application at the BINP Injection Complex is given. Methods to improve monitor spatial resolution are discussed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Also perhaps an existence of solid-state communication of domains is possible. Acceleration is carried out at the expense of a gradient of the base magnetic field. The magnetic field of ferromagnetics creates a longitudinal potential well in the base magnetic field. The gradient of the base magnetic field does not exceed a gradient of this potential well and does not allow the accelerated objects to go beyond its limits. Depth of a potential well can be increased at the expense of the electron stream which is in this potential well. He does not leave area of a well too",

VEPP-2000 with SND and CMD-3 detectors carried out two successful data-taking runs after new BINP injection complex was commissioned. The 2016/2017 run was dedicated to high energy range (640-1000 MeV per beam) while the 2017/2018 run was focused at 275-600 MeV/beam energies. With sufficient positron production rate and upgraded full-energy booster the collider luminosity was limited by beam-beam effects",

Thorough machine tuning together with new ideas introduced to suppress flip-flop allowed to establish new world record for beam-beam parameter and bunch-by-bunch luminosity values at specific beam energies. The achieved luminosity increased 2-5 times in a whole energy range in comparison to phase-1 operation (2010-2013)."

Moreover",
        "the injection of an electron beam in the proper phase of the laser-driven plasma wave and its short length with respect to the plasma wavelength allow the relative energy spread of the beam to be decreased during the acceleration process. The effect of the injection phase on the accelerated beam quality is investigated through tolerance studies on the arrival time jitter between the electron beam and the external laser."

        "The electron positron collider VEPP-4M finished low energy luminosity run (up to 1.9 GeV). New experimental stage will be performed with the beam acceleration in VEPP-4M. The experiment of the adron cross section measure in 17 points from 2.5 to 3.5 GeV beam energy was started in December 2017. One of two scans of the experiment (8 points) is made. Next experiments are the collecting data at maximal beam energy for gamma-gamma physics and Y-mesons study. The first luminosity at Y(1S) meson (~4.75 GeV) is obtained. For maximal luminosity at high energy the new electron positron injector is used. To obtain maximal beam energy of 5.2 GeV upgrade of RF system and power supply system of VEPP-4M is performing. The laser polarimeter is used to measure the beam energy with resonance depolarization at high energy of VEPP-4M. Synchrotron radiation experiments in hard X-ray mode are performed at 4.5 GeV with new hybrid 2 T wiggler."

During more than 30 years BINP developed the superconducting insertion devices for generation of synchrotron radiation. More than 20 superconducting wigglers which were produced by BINP are used on many storage rings around the world. Each of them was optimized for the individual requirements of the experiments and taking into account the characteristics of the storage rings. However all the device can be conditionally divided into several groups with similar features: high field wigglers (up to 7.5 T) with long period (140-200 mm)",
        "middle field (2.5-4.2 T) with middle period (46-64 mm) and low field (2-2.1 T) with short period (30-34 mm). The superconducting wiggler cryostats which are developed in BINP are operated not only with zero liquid helium consumption but even with a lower relative to the atmosphere pressure despite of additional heat load from the electron beam and from the current of ~1000 A for supplying of superconducting magnet. This allows not only to avoid a helium loss but also to increase the level of the magnetic field due to the shifting of the critical parameters of superconducting wire. The features of magnetic and cryogenics systems of the superconducting wigglers produced in BINP are presented in this report."

        "The process of the generation and acceleration of an electron bunches by a laser pulse of ultrarelativistic intensity that interacts with underdense plasma target with an upramp density profile followed by a plateau has been studied. Numerical simulation has clearly demonstrated that the generation of electron bunches by a laser pulse is a consequence of 1D wave breaking to occur sharply at the up-ramp-plateau transition. The process of electron self-injection into the accelerating wake wave starts with an electron that initially occurred at a distance from the edge of the plateau equal to the amplitude of its longitudinal oscillations. This electron becomes a leader",
        "that is",
        "the first particle in the head part of the bunch trapped in the wake wave. The major fraction of electrons trapped in the wake wave are electrons that initially occurred in front of the electron leader. The fraction of electrons trapped in the wake",

The known approaches assume the analysis of stability of the decision after definition of eigenvalues of a matrix of transition from initial values of couple of fundamental decisions to their values through the period of the function defining an oscillation frequency of amplitudes of decisions. Fundamental decisions are defined by the numerical solution of differential equations for amplitude and a phase received immediately from the equation of Hill. The different way of analytical submission of fundamental solutions of the equation of Hill and numerical approach to its decision is given in work. In it matrix approach to a task and the simplified algorithm of its decision corresponding to it is used. The received results are compared to results of the solution of the equation of Hill in the traditional way. On some plane the solution of the equation of Hill will be displayed in the form of closed curves with the repeating sites. At the same time curves will be not periodic if a change of a phase is incommensurable with 2Pi. If the solution of the equation of Hill is not limited, it will be displayed in the form of two spirals. Zero of some integral can judge stability of the decision on equality Thus, the specified technique of the solution of the equation of Hill allows along with finding of couple of fundamental decisions to define their stability. reference for this paper using",

One of the disadvantages is the appearance of hot lesions in the proximal region beyond the borders of the target volume. It lowers the dose conformity to the target volume and the treatment quality. One of the possible solutions of this problem is a multi-layer energy filter proposed by Sakae Takeji et al. The idea of this device is to change its geometry depending on the required modulation width of the spread-out Bragg peak. However",
        "in that case regions of overdose appear inside the target due to the lack of the correct beam intensity regulation. We suggest another design of a tool for depth dose formation. The new device is called Composite Ridge Filter. It combines the traditional ridge filter with an additional absorbing material to control the beam intensity and regulate SOPB (Spread-out Bragg peak) modulation width. In our previous study we have calculated the geometry for 95% isodose spherical contour irradiation and it was tested with Monte-Carlo simulation. Now we have improved the technique of geometry findings and prepare the experimental tests with proton beams of INR linac."

      "abstract": "During radiotherapy using bremsstrahlung gamma quanta with energies greater than 8 MeV, nuclear reactions with neutron emission take place on the brake target and structural materials of a linear accelerator. Because of the high radiobiological danger of neutron radiation, especially fast neutrons, their contribution to the total beam flux substantially increases the dose received by the patient. We conducted studies of the braking gamma quanta and neutrons flows directly at the place of the patient's treatment at a distance of 1 m from the virtual source of gamma quanta with a radiation field size of 20x20 cm2. The use of direct spectrometric methods for measuring the flux of gamma quanta and neutrons in this case is extremely difficult due to the high flux density (according to some estimates ~1012 particles*cm-2*s). Therefore, for solving this problem, we used the photoactivation method. Registration of gamma quanta and neutrons was carried out using (gamma, n) and (n, gamma)-reactions. The natural tantalum 181Ta as one of the most studied nuclei in both photonuclear reactions and in reactions with neutrons in a wide energy range, was used as a detecting target. For the experiment, two Varian Trilogy medical accelerators with different operating life were used: accelerator 1 with long operating life (boundary energy 18 MeV) accelerator 2 with short operating life (boundary energy 20 MeV). reference for this paper using",

Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the structure of a polymer material before and after irradiation of each layer. Atomic emission microscope was used to study the surface of a film. Evolution of the film surface characteristics can lead to a change in the barrier properties of film material used for packaging in the food industry. Investigation of polymer film treated with fast electrons showed stable results on dispersion at doses up to 18 kGy."

The paper presents the results of electron dynamics computer simulation with space charge influence. Injection parameters to accelerating cavity are determined. These parameters provide sufficient conditions to achieve required electron energy and minimal beam current losses. According to calculations to achieve 1.5 MeV electron energy gain RF power no less than 165 kW is required. First tests of the facility were performed with RF power up to 180 kW. The measured electron beam energy after one pass is 1.5 MeV. Then the electron beam is returned to the accelerating cavity by the recycling beam system. The measured electron beam energy after the second pass is 3 MeV. The electron energy spectrum and the average beam current were determined on each acceleration stage.

        "the transport channel Buster-Nuclotron beam is creating in BINP. A powerful precision source with an output current up to 10 kA and an energy in the pulse up to 23 kJ is designed to power impulse dipole magnets and channel septum magnets. The presented article describes a pulsed source for magnetic lenses with a maximum output voltage up to 2 kV and a maximum output current up to 10 kA. The current amplitude instability from pulse to pulse is ensured at a level better than 10-3. The stability of the amplitude of the magnetic field in the lenses can be improved to a value of 100 ppm by introducing additional feedback over the field of the magnet using the integrating ADC VsDC produced by BINP. The developed source meets both the requirements for stability of output parameters and automation requirements for integration into modern accelerator systems."

Modeling results of induced radioactivity accumulation on the typical particle canal downstream internal target by Monte Carlo method are given. The wide set of various material specimens was espoused during one U-70 run in vicinity of internal target and specific radioactivity of identified long-lived nuclides was measured. Decay curves of ambient dose and specific radioactivity were calculated and analyzed for all activated specimens. Some fragments of U-70 equipment from radioactive waste storage also were investigated and specific radioactivity of their long-lived nuclides were measured. Unexpectedly 44Ti with 60 years half-life was identified in some cooper and stainless steel fragments. Production cross sections of 44Ti (and other nuclides) on copper were evaluated after irradiation by 50 GeV protons.

They cover the total range of operating beam intensities and energies of the circulating of proton and ion beams. The scheme of the scanners is based on a rotary brushless servomotor produced by the \"Faulhaber\" company. The speed of the fork with the carbon fiber is 16 m/s. The rotation mechanism and the control electronics was done to take into account the available radiation levels at the locations of the wire scanners.

Energy spread value of the beam is an important parameter in a choice of energy step during measurement of e+e− -> hadrons cross sections as well as it has a strong influence on the statistic collection time required for the scanning of narrow resonances like planned for the nearest future scan of Upsilon(2s) meson.

      "abstract": "A distributed optical fiber based beam loss monitor has been implemented for the Budker INP Injection Complex designed to accelerate and store electron and positron beams up to 500 MeV. The principle of the device operation consists in detecting the Cherenkov radiation generated in an optical fiber by relativistic charged particles produced in an electromagnetic shower when beam hits the accelerator vacuum chamber wall. Single optical fiber section can cover the entire accelerator instead of using a large number of local beam loss monitors. Timing of optical signal gives the location of the beam losses along the beamline. In this paper summary of the monitor application at the BINP Injection Complex is given. Methods to improve monitor spatial resolution are discussed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Acceleration is carried out at the expense of a gradient of the base magnetic field. The magnetic field of ferromagnetics creates a longitudinal potential well in the base magnetic field. The gradient of the base magnetic field does not exceed a gradient of this potential well and does not allow the accelerated objects to go beyond its limits. Depth of a potential well can be increased at the expense of the electron stream which is in this potential well. He does not leave area of a well too",
        "being reflected from its walls. There is some semblance of the moving adgezator used at coherent acceleration of protons by electronic rings. A certain similarity of repetition of the idea of acceleration of protons electronic rings due to acceleration of electronic rings external fields is possible. It can be as magnetic fields with the corresponding gradient of a longitudinal field",
        "and electric fields also. Some kind of combination of coherent acceleration of neutral domains of a ferromagnetic by the magnetic and electric field turns out. Estimates show that at number of atoms about 10 in 14 degrees their acceleration to 1 MEV apart approximately in 1 meter is possible. The sizes of domains are about 10 in minus fifth degree of meter. Longitudinal magnetic fields are in range of 1 Tesla.",

All researches have to develop their own numerical codes or have to use the analytical formulas which are obtained only for the small number of targets with approximations of infinity dimensions and far field zone. In this report we present the code for calculation of DR characteristics from metal targets with finite dimensions and finite distance to detector. The calculation approach in this code is based on the generalized surface current method. Above method is suitable for the targets with the ideal conductivity (metal target case) and applicable for diffraction and transition radiation (TR)",
