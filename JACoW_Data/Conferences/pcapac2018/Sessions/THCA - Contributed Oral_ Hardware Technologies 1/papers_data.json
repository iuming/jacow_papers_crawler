        "With its four accelerator facilities the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) has already several decades of control system Input Output Computer (IOC) experience. The technology is moving forward fast. The older hardware is becoming obsolete: it is slow",
        "consumes too much power",
        "does not match new computing",
        "networking and bus technologies",
        "and replacements can no longer be purchased as models have been discontinued. All this forces us to opt for a new \"standard\" IOC platform with increasing regularity. What used to be twenty years",
        "became ten",
        "and is now tending towards five years. Here we present past and possible future IOC platforms which we are investigating. Feedback from the conference would be highly appreciated."

Experimental physics and industrial control system (EPICS) was selected as the data communication system for all of these µTCA boards.

The measured one-σ jitter of the output signals from the slave PC has been achieved less than 100 ps."
