      "abstract": "In this paper image processing system for secondary emission of electrons in electron beam welding facility is described. System runs on Intel Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for digital processing. Time-sensitive algorithms are designed in VHDL and dataflow DSL Caph. Seam finder algorithm and data filters are written in Caph. The system is designed to filter high-frequency noise and estimate seam location for its automatic correction within 2 us. General algorithms for hardware control and data visualization are described with the interface to the FPGA-based part.",

        "At the Centre for Proton Therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institut we treat cancer patients using a fixed beam line and two gantries. The latter use a step-and-shoot technique to deliver dose covering the treatment volume with a grid of weighted proton bunches. Dose delivery for tumours moving under respiration (e.g. lung) is however challenging and not routinely performed because of the interplay between target and beam motions. At the Gantry 2 unit",
        "we are implementing a novel continuous beam modulation concept called line scanning",
        "aiming at realizing a faster dose delivery to allow for effective organ motion mitigation techniques such as rescanning and gating. The current should stabilise within 100 us",
        "which is tough due to the non-linearity of the system and latency of the monitors. In this work we implemented a gain scheduled controller and a predictor by modelling the accelerator in Simulink and developing a controller using the frequency domain robust method. We used Mathwork’s HDL Coder functionality to generate VHDL code that was implemented in an FPGA in the gantry control system. Latency",
        "overshoot and dosimetric performance improved considerably compared to a classic PID."

We can manipulate the devices with adaptive tuning algorithms to compensate for varying electromagnetic forces throughout motion scans. By correcting positional feedback with encoder compensation and redefining motion programs",
