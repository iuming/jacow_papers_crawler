        "The Vulcan Neodymium-Glass High-Power Laser Facility at the Central Laser Facility in the UK has been operational for over 40 years providing a world-leading and high-profile service to International researchers in the field of Plasma Physics. Over that time the Facility has had many modifications and enhancements to the buildings",

        "synchronisation and timing systems. As the laser systems have developed and the user experiments have continued to become much more complex and demanding",
        "many new operational conditions have been required. The use of four independent laser oscillators with different properties - including temporal",
        "spectral and operating frequencies - have meant that the optical and electrical multiplexing and the timing and synchronisation systems have all had to be adapted and extended to cope with these additional needs. However",
        "these changes have resulted in the build-up of the overall system jitter to ± 250 ps between long (ns) and short (ps) optical pulses and this is a limiting factor for time-critical experiments. This paper will present some of the key changes and improvements that have recently been made.",
