        "The ELI Beamlines facility is a Petawatt laser facility in the final construction and commissioning phase in Czech Republic. In fully operation phase",
        "four lasers will be used to control beamlines in six experimental halls. In this paper we describe Ultra fast and distributed data acquisition system as was defined in ELI Beamlines. The data acquisition system is divided into two levels: central and local level. The central level data acquisition system defines a special Tier 0 RAM buffer. This buffer is based on special multi node data acquisition server which shares memory of all its nodes into one continuous space over low latency network technologies (Mellanox Infinband/Intel OmniPath). The main role of the Tier 0 buffer is to acquire first bunch and provide load balancing of incoming data. These data comes from many sources distributed along the experimental technologies. The local data acquisition system is then responsible for connection of local detectors to central data acquisition server through ROCE interface. The connection is done directly when supported or indirectly using local data acquisition computers (for PCIe etc.)."

The ETL program based on Spark migrates data to HDFS from RDB Channel Archiver and the EPICS Archiver Appliance continuously and store them in Parquet format. The distributed data analysis engine based on Impala greatly improves the performance of data retrieval and reduces the response time of queries. In this paper",
