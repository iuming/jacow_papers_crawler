On the one end; the focus is on lower level communication technology; platforms; and standards that aim to enable machine-to-machine communications. On the other end; people have been searching for the killer devices that would transform our lives. Clearly; one is the ""Internet"" perspective; while the other is the ""Things"" perspective. In this talk; instead of taking the words ""Internet of Things"" literally; we focus on the combined effects of devices on environments.

pcapac2018,,WEPI1,EtherCAT Driver and Tools for EPICS and Linux at PSI,PSI; Villigen PSI; Switzerland; EtherCAT bus and interface are widely used for external module and device control in accelerator environments at PSI; ranging from modulator and undulator communication and control; over motion control; basic I/O control; all the way to Machine Protection System for the new SwissFEL accelerator. A combined EPICS/Linux driver package has been developed at PSI; to allow for simple and mostly automatic setup of various EtherCAT configurations. The driver is capable of automatic scan of the existing devices and modules; followed by self-configuration and finally autonomous operation of the EtherCAT bus real-time loop. Additionally; the driver package supports the user PLC to manipulate EtherCAT data in real time; implements fast real-time (single cycle) slave-to-slave communication (skipping EPICS layer or PLC completely); features guaranteed one-shot trigger signals otherwise not supported by EPICS and much more. All the standard EtherCAT functions are supported; including the complete reprogramming of slave configurations and configuration generation for programmable slaves; such as EL6692 and EL6695 network bridges.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCaPAC2018-WEP01 paper received ※ 08 October 2018       paper accepted ※ 16 October 2018        issue date ※ 21 January 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/talks/wepi1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/papers/wepi1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/posters/wepi1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2018-WEPI1,

BLISS provides a global approach to run synchrotron experiments; thanks to hardware integration; Python sequences and an advanced scanning engine. As a Python package; BLISS can be easily embedded into any Python application and data management features enable online data analysis. In addition; BLISS ships with tools to enhance scientists user experience and can easily be integrated into TANGO based environments; with generic TANGO servers on top of BLISS controllers. BLISS configuration facility can be used as an alternative TANGO database.

pcapac2018,,WEPI3,A General Solution for Complex Vacuum System Controls,"G. Bischof; A. M. Barbour; B. A. Sobhani; A. Walter; BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; At the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) there are many different ultra-high vacuum system configurations on the unique beamline end-stations. The proposed controls solution attempts to capture the requirements of all of these configurations with a single standard logic and graphical user interface. Additional design considerations include: resource management for multiple users; providing a high level of abstraction to simplify operation for users; providing a high level of flexibility to do non-standard operations; minimizing shock from pressure differentials when opening valves; supporting a variety of pumps; and maximizing pump lifetime. At NSLS-II it was determined that all vacuum configurations can be captured by the composition of three standard objects: a ""rough vacuum group""; and ""high vacuum group""; and a ""smart vacuum manifold"" which implements a blocking queue. These objects can be flexibly linked together to meet the needs of the beamline experiments. This solution is platform independent; but implemented and tested here using Pfeiffer vacuum pumps; Allen Bradley PLC; EPICS; and Control System Studio (CSS).; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS",,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCaPAC2018-WEP03 paper received ※ 10 October 2018       paper accepted ※ 16 October 2018        issue date ※ 21 January 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/talks/wepi3_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/papers/wepi3.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/posters/wepi3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2018-WEPI3,

Each detector power-supply control system runs several hundred software instances consisting of many different components in parallel on a large scale; broadly distinguishable as servers and clients. Our accumulated experience during LHC runs proves that some complex control issues are impossible to detect using stand-alone components on a small scale only. Furthermore; new components must be developed well before the electron-ics becomes available; without impact on operations. Moreover; during LS2; the improved and now widely established Open Protocol Communication Unified Ar-chitecture (OPC-UA) replaces OPC-DA as middleware protocol. For these reasons; we developed a simulation environment to emulate the real; and valuable; CAEN power-supply electronics underneath the OPC-UA serv-ers. This distributed simulation is configurable to mimic and exceed the nominal conditions during production and provides a repeatable setup for validation. This paper discusses the functionality and use of this simulation service.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCaPAC2018-WEP04 paper received ※ 05 October 2018       paper accepted ※ 15 October 2018        issue date ※ 21 January 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/talks/wepi4_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/papers/wepi4.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/posters/wepi4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2018-WEPI4,

In big organizations like CERN; where different teams play the roles of operators; scientists and instrumentation specialists; providing a unique or static user interface usually results in a situation of dissatisfaction of everyone. On the other hand; providing distinct user interfaces for each type of user increases the development and maintenance effort and makes software evolution heavier. The approach taken for the design and development of GUIs for radiation and environment protection at CERN addressed this issue by integrating user interface changes as an embedded software functionality. Key users were provided with a tool to build; deploy and maintain their own tailor-made user interfaces; in a graphical way and without the necessity of learning any kind of programming or scripting languages. Other benefits observed from this solution include reduction of the resources spent on the support and maintenance and increase of the frequency of GUIs updates; executed without compromising the underlying control system.

This is even more true in the case of scientific facilities for which you typically deal with many custom devices and legacy code. In these cases; it is useful to consider the Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach that consists in lessen the planning phase and give more emphasis on an adaptive process; so that software prototypes can be successfully used in addition to or in place of design specifications. LabVIEW* is a typical RAD-oriented development tool and is widely used in technical laboratories where many stand-alone programs are developed to manage devices under construction or evaluation. An original system that allows software clients to use external LabVIEW drivers is presented. This system; originally created for the !CHAOS Control System**; is entirely written in LabVIEW and is based on JSON messages -transmitted on a WebSocket communication- driving LabVIEW VIs through dynamic calls. This system is completely decoupled from the client and is therefore suitable for any Control System.; *LabVIEW: http://www.ni.com ** L. Catani et al; Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 15; 112804 (2012).

However; knowing how to build the model is not enough; if you wish your research can reach to a wider audience; it would be important to know the correct approach to deliver the learned model into a production environment. In this keynote speech; I will address how to bring machine learning model into the production environment from the perspective of a data scientist and engineer.

For the usage of these signals around the experimental station; long RF cables from the accelerator timing station; divider modules and delay modules must be deployed. These installations need a lot of cost and require a lot of efforts to adjust the timing by experts. To lower these costs and efforts; the revolution frequency; which is ~209 kHz at the SPring-8 storage ring; and tag information distribution system has been studied based on a high precision time synchronization technology over a network. In this study; the White Rabbit* (WR) technology is adopted. The proof of concept system has been built; which consists of a master PC; a slave PC and two WR switches. The master PC detects the zero-address signal and distributes the time stamps with tag information to the slave PC. Then the slave PC generates the ~209 kHz signals synchronized with the target bunch by adding the offset time by software. The measured one-σ jitter of the output signals from the slave PC has been achieved less than 100 ps.,,* https://www.ohwr.org/projects/white-rabbit,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/talks/thca4_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/papers/thca4.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/posters/thca4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2018-THCA4,131

The dominant architecture consists of local units of controllers/ modules (programmed in IEC61131-3 languages); which operate mostly autonomously from a SCADA layer. While some vendors provide low-level stacks to encourage growth of their ecosystems; PLC programming remains largely within a closed; proprietary world. In this paper; we introduce a different way of thinking about PLC hardware. Working with the open stacks intended for the design of new EtherCAT (Beckhoff) / Powerlink (B&R) modules; we built an abstract C+± API to control the existing ones. These industrial ethernet busses can be propagated using standard network hardware; so any RT-Linux system can now control any PLC module from anywhere in our facility using high-level languages (C++; LabVIEW). This way; PLC modules are seamlessly integrated into our distributed TANGO-based control system.

Accelerator controls and IoT have several aspects in common - small payloads; low latency; dashboard/synoptic data presentation format are some examples. The IoT now provides several open-source projects which can provide a partial implementation of one or more accelerator controls software features. Because development is typically a lower priority for accelerator controls groups; there is a valid case to try and utilise the free efforts of others for the benefit of accelerator controls.

O. Musgrave; P.B.M. Oliveira; STFC/RAL; Chilton; Didcot; Oxon; United Kingdom; The Vulcan Neodymium-Glass High-Power Laser Facility at the Central Laser Facility in the UK has been operational for over 40 years providing a world-leading and high-profile service to International researchers in the field of Plasma Physics. Over that time the Facility has had many modifications and enhancements to the buildings; the laser hardware and to the computerised control; synchronisation and timing systems. As the laser systems have developed and the user experiments have continued to become much more complex and demanding; many new operational conditions have been required. The use of four independent laser oscillators with different properties - including temporal; spectral and operating frequencies - have meant that the optical and electrical multiplexing and the timing and synchronisation systems have all had to be adapted and extended to cope with these additional needs. However; these changes have resulted in the build-up of the overall system jitter to ± 250 ps between long (ns) and short (ps) optical pulses and this is a limiting factor for time-critical experiments. This paper will present some of the key changes and improvements that have recently been made.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCaPAC2018-THP12 paper received ※ 27 September 2018       paper accepted ※ 15 October 2018        issue date ※ 21 January 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/talks/thpi1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/papers/thpi1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/posters/thpi1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2018-THPI1,

For this reason; we have been preparing for the development of the MPS with the start of the RAON accelerator construction. For effective MPS operation and stable accelerator operation; we divided the MPS into four subsystems: fast protection system; slow interlock system; run permit system; and post-mortem system. Among them; the FPGA-based fast protection system and the PLC-based slow interlock system have been tested by prototypes and are currently working on the mass production. The run permit system and the post-mortem system are also undergoing basic design and software development.

Reliable operation of the insertion devices is important to users of beamlines. The most unpredictable fault is due to a soft error in optical absolute encoders due to radiation. There are several solutions to avoid such faults; e.g. by increasing the distance of the encoder from the beam; by a lead shield cover and finally by adopting an auxiliary position sensing devices to help recovery from a fault. Efforts to improve operational reliability of the TPS ID controls will be discussed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCaPAC2018-THP06 paper received ※ 10 October 2018       paper accepted ※ 15 October 2018        issue date ※ 21 January 2019 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/talks/thpi6_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/papers/thpi6.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2018/posters/thpi6_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2018-THPI6,
