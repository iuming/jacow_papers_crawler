        "High harmonic generation (HHG) is a well-established technology to produce attosecond pulses in VUV wavelengths. So far HHG sources have been driven by femtosecond solid-state lasers not FELs",
        "because it has been believed that FELs have no ability to provide carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) stabilized few-cycle pulses essential to the HHG. Here",
        "we propose a scheme to CEP stabilized few-cycle pulses from a FEL oscillator. Operated at a mid-infrared wavelength",
        "the proposed method is able to drive a HHG photon source to produce isolated attosecond pulses at photon energies above 1 keV with a repetition > 10 MHz. The FEL-HHG photon source will open a door to full-scale experiments of attosecond X-ray pulses and push ultrafast laser science to the zeptosecond regime [1].",

        "We suggest an efficient XFELO having a new non-stationary out-coupling scheme. It consisted of two undulator sections located in sequence with a free space gap in-between. The first section is a conventional uniform undulator",
