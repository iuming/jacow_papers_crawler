        "started in January 2018",
        "is to design a hard X-ray FEL facility beyond today's state of the art",
        "using the latest concepts for bright electron photo injectors",
        "very high-gradient X-band structures operating at 12 GHz",
        "and innovative compact short-period undulators. A consortium of 21 leading European institutions",
        "including industry",
        "together with 3 non-European institutes",
        "are partnering up to achieve this ambitious goal. An overview of the project with the main organizational aspects and the expected outcomes will be reported.",
