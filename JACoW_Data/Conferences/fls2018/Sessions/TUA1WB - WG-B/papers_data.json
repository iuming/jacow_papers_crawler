        "Next-generation storage ring-based light sources will be based on the multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice",
        "as successfully demonstrated in MAX-IV. Such designs promise substantial brightness improvements compared to third-generation light sources",
        "while there is likely to be a trade-off between the optimized brightness",
        "available dynamic aperture for injection and local momentum acceptance related to beam lifetime. Different injection schemes have been proposed for these designs with different requirements on the ring dynamic aperture. In fact",
        "the choice of injection schemes will significantly affect the figure of merit in the lattice optimisation and even the overall design of the facility. This talk will survey these injection schemes",
        "their merits and challenges",
        "and the R&D efforts involved.",

        "emittance growth due to intrabeam scattering (IBS) is a serious concern. To mitigate the IBS",
        "a double rf system is used to lengthen the beam bunches. In the double RF system",
        "the performance of bunch lengthening is limited by the transient beam-loading effect which is induced by bunch gaps in the fill pattern. Even if the superconducting (SC) harmonic cavities (HCs) are used",
        "the performance of bunch lengthening is limited when the bunch gap is large. To improve their performances",
        "we propose the use of a single \"kicker\" cavity having low loaded Q. The \"kicker\" cavity provides an rf voltage that is comparable to the fluctuating rf voltages in the main and harmonic cavities",
        "and mitigates the phase shift of beam bunches over the bunch train",
        "while keeping its required generator power modest. As a results of our numerical investigation",
