        "the magnetic field and the coercivity can be enhanced",
        "enabling shorter periods with high magnetic fields. The first full scale (2 m long",
        "18 mm period) hybrid cryogenic undulator [1] using PrFeB [2] magnets operating at 77 K was installed at SOLEIL in 2011. Photon spectra measurements",
        "in good agreement with the ex-pectations from magnetic measurements",
        "were used for precise alignment and taper optimization. The second and third 18 mm PrFeB cryogenic undulators",
        "modified to a half-pole/magnet/half-pole structure",
        "were optimized without any magnet or pole shimming after assembly but mechanical sortings and some geometrical corrections had been done before assembly. A systematic error on individual magnets on the third U18 was also compensated. In-situ measurement benches",
        "including a Hall probe and a stretched wire to optimize the undulator field at room and cryogenic temperature are presented. An upgrade of these in-situ benches will be detailed with the fabrication of a 15 mm 3 m long PrFeB cryogenic undulator at SOLEIL.",
