        "Normal conducting RF gun as well as DC gun and superconducting RF gun are the potential technologies for generation of high-brightness beam for the CW XFELs. This talk will firstly review the three gun technologies in term of beam performances",
        "advantages and disadvantages. LCLS-II has chosen normal conducting RF gun for the CW photoinjector. We will then update LCLS-II injector design",
        "construction",
        "and commissioning which is expected to start in March 2018.",

        "LCLS-II is a new xFEL facility under construction at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory with a superconducting electron linac designed to operate up to §I{1.2}{MW} of beam power. This generates more serious beam hazards than the typical sub-kW linac operation of the existing xFEL facility",
        "Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). SLAC uses a set of safety controls termed the Beam Containment System (BCS) to limit beam power and losses to prevent excessive radiation in occupied areas. The high beam power hazards of LCLS-II necessitate the development of new BCS devices and a larger scale deployment than previously done at LCLS. We present the new radiation hazards introduced by LCLS-II and the design development for the BCS.",
