The RF power transmitter can either be a high-power klystron (1 MW klystron) feed all RF cavities or a combination of low power IOTs or solid-state amplifiers feed each cavity.

        "The upgrade of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL to a diffraction limited storage ring (ALS-U) is an approved project that is currently in the conceptual design phase. There is a focused R&D program to develop critical components of the ALS-U design. The design includes swap-out on-axis injection with a fast stripline kicker as the key enabling technology. The development of the kicker and the associated pulser will be presented as well as results from installation and beam tests at the ALS.",
