        "NSLS-II developed and built RF BPM receivers that have been used in the past three years during commissioning of 200 MeV linac",
        "3 GeV booster and storage ring and now are in routine operations. Recently we completed an upgrade of BPM DFE Digital Front End gaining benefits of a Xilinx Zynq FPGA. This FPGA includes a hard dual-core ARM A9 processor which will permit more advanced signal processing routines",
        "faster ethernet communication",
        "as well as resources to implement a pilot tone based active calibration",
        "eliminating the need of thermal controlled racks. In the past year we procured a Libera Brilliance Plus BPM electronics unit to benchmark the outcome of our upgrade with respect to one of the best commercially available solutions. This presentation is focused on comparison of performance between NSLS-II RF BRM version 2 with the Libera unit focusing on the following performance parameters: Long term stability for 10Hz",
        "as well as characterization of FA",
        "TBT and ADC Raw data set. We conclude our presentation by outlining future directions in upgrading NSLS-II RF BPM AFE",
        "DFE and high-level controls to enable breakthrough in the area of diagnostics of charged particle beams.",
