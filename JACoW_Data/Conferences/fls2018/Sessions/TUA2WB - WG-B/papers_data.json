        "A 3-GeV synchrotron light source has been designed as a future light source in Thailand. The storage ring is designed utilising Double Triple Bend Achromat (DTBA) lattice to achieve beam emittance below 1 nm·mrad",
        "maximum beam current of 300 mA and two straight sections per cell. A full energy linac is a promising choice as the storage ring injector due to its potential to be operated as the storage ring injector and an injector for a short pulse facility. The linac can be upgraded to a soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) facility by extending an undulator section. The design of the linac injector consists of a pre-injector based on a photocathode RF gun",
        "two main linacs based on high gradient S-band structures",
        "and two bunch compressors. The high gradient S-band structure with the accelerating gradient of 35-40 MV/m is suitable to achieve the beam energy of 3 GeV within the injector length of about 150 m. The bunch compressors are included for generating 100-fs electron bunches for the short pulse facility. This paper presents designs and simulation results of the storage ring and the linac injector of Thailand new light source.",

        "An analysis of lattice configurations up to 10 bend achromat is presented aiming towards diffraction limited ring based light source. The described analysis can apply to any type of a ring based light source however for practical reasons we consider Elettra that has been operating for users for 24 years; to stay competitive for world-class photon science in the future a massive upgrade of the storage ring is needed. The optimum solution is based on certain design criteria",
        "constraints regarding certain accelerator components and their implications on beam dynamics and user requirements. The space available for insertion devices as well as the impact of anti-bends on the design is also addressed. Two proposed realistic lattices are further discussed taking into account different criteria and user requirements. Those lattices reduce the emittance of the present machine by more than one order of magnitude but at the same time respect many other criteria such as realistic magnet gradients",
