        "In this talk we shall attempt to make an overview the general trend in storage rings optimized for the next-generation light sources",
        "in the context of having as a result an important impact on beam collective effects. Reduction of the beam chamber cross section to attain strong magnetic fields for the ultra-low emittance optics is particularly highlighted. A series of collective effects and beam instabilities that are likely to get enhanced shall be reviewed. Some of the recent related theoretical",
        "numerical and experimental studies shall be introduced",
        "along with methods that are considered to be effective in mitigating the former undesirable effects.",
