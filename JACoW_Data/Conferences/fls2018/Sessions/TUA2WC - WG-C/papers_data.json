        "The ERC Advanced Grant COXINEL aims at demonstrating free electron laser amplification",
        "at a resonant wavelength of 200 nm",
        "based on a laser plasma acceleration source. To achieve the amplification",
        "a 10 m long dedicated transport line was designed to manipulate the beam qualities. It starts with a triplet of permanent magnet with tunable gradient quadrupoles (QUAPEVA) that handles the highly divergent electron beam",
        "a demixing chicane with a slit to reduce the energy spread per slice",
        "and a set of electromagnetic quadrupoles to provide a chromatic focusing in a 2 m long cryogenic undulator. Electrons of energy 176 MeV were successfully transported throughout the line",
        "where the beam positioning and dispersion were controlled efficiently thanks to a specific beam based alignment method",
        "as well as the energy range by varying the slit width. Observations of undulator radiation for different undulator gaps are reported.",
