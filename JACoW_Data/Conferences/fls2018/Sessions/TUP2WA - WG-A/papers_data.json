        "Echo enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) has been recognized as a possible solution to extend the tuning range of externally seeded FELs to wavelength as short as few nm. Previous experiments have confirmed the capabilities to produce bunching at very high harmonic but they have been done only at long wavelength. An experiment to demonstrate EEHG operations at high harmonic and short wavelength is planned at FERMI. With few modifications to the FERMI FEL-2 layout",
        "EEHG will be studied and performances will be compared to other seeding schemes such as high gain harmonic generation (HGHG). Attention will be focused to the spectral purity and to the sensitivity of EEHG and HGHG to microbunching instabilities.",

Performance of the optimized longitudinal phase space will be studied using a transverse deflecting structure in early 2018. With the optimized electron beam",
        "HXRSS simulations have been performed for the lower (~3 keV) and the upper (~14 keV) photon energy range planned for the HXRSS operation. The locations of the two HXRSS stages have been studied and chosen to optimize the performance of the upper photon energy with an insignificant effect on the lower one. We will present the longitudinal phase space optimization for the 100 pC case as well as the expected performance of the HXRSS with the optimized set-up.",
