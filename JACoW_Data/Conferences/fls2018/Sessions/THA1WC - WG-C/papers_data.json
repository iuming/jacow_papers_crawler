        "Many research and applications areas require photon sources capable of producing extreme ultra-violet (EUV) to gamma-ray beams with reasonably high fluxes and compact footprints. We explore the feasibility of a compact energy-recovery linac EUV free electron laser (FEL)*",
        "and of a multi-MeV gamma-rays source based on inverse Compton scattering from a high intensity UV FEL emitted by the electron beam itself. In the latter scenario",
        "the same electron beam is used to produce gamma-rays in the 10-20 MeV range and UV radiation in the 1015 eV range",
