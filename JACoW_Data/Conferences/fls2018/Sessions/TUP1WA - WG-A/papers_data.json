        "Sub-fs X-ray pump/probe capabilities hold great promise for understanding the role of coherent electron dynamics in molecules and solids. At the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) for hard X-ray energies the sub-fs regime can be reached by shortening the electrong bunch and operating the FEL in the single-spike SASE FEL limit. In the soft X-ray region",
        "achieving sub-fs pulses requires bandwidth broadening by means of an enhanced SASE scheme. In this talk I will present recent results on the generation of sub-fs X-ray pulses at LCLS and discuss the path to time-resolved experiments with attosecond time resolution",

        "for the possibility of acquiring single shot images before the Coulomb explosion of the sample takes place. Such a condition is met by an FEL operating in superradiant regime when the pulse has a self-similar shape deriving from the combined dynamics of saturation and slippage of the radiation over fresh electrons. We show that the peak of the pulse moves at superluminal speed similarly to the case of pulses propagation in anomalous dispersive active media and it is followed by a long pedestal resulting from the complex dynamics occurring in the tail after saturation. We analyze the dynamical conditions leading to the formation of the main pulse and the following tail and we study the correlation of the tail structure with the longitudinal phase space of the e-beam",
