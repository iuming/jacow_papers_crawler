One is Photon Factory (PF). This is the first storage-ring light source in X-ray region in Japan; and the user-run started in 1983. The ring energy is 2.5 GeV; and the emittance has been reduced to 36 nm·rad from 460 nm·rad through some improvements. Another is Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR). The ring energy is 6.5 GeV; and the single-bunch operation and hard X-ray are featured. The user-run started in 1987; and the emittance is 293 nm·rad. The magnetic lattice is almost the same as the original one. Now we consider the future plans of KEK light sources. One is the fully new facility applying DQBA lattice; named KEK-LS. The circumstance is 571 m; and the emittance is 315 pm·rad @ 3 GeV and 500 mA. In parallel with that; two plans of the only replacements of the lattices reusing existing tunnels of PF and PF-AR are considered.

Different injection schemes have been proposed for these designs with different requirements on the ring dynamic aperture.

The storage ring is designed utilising Double Triple Bend Achromat (DTBA) lattice to achieve beam emittance below 1 nm·mrad; maximum beam current of 300 mA and two straight sections per cell. A full energy linac is a promising choice as the storage ring injector due to its potential to be operated as the storage ring injector and an injector for a short pulse facility. The linac can be upgraded to a soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) facility by extending an undulator section. The design of the linac injector consists of a pre-injector based on a photocathode RF gun; two main linacs based on high gradient S-band structures; and two bunch compressors. The high gradient S-band structure with the accelerating gradient of 35-40 MV/m is suitable to achieve the beam energy of 3 GeV within the injector length of about 150 m. The bunch compressors are included for generating 100-fs electron bunches for the short pulse facility. This paper presents designs and simulation results of the storage ring and the linac injector of Thailand new light source.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.; Basovizza; Italy; An analysis of lattice configurations up to 10 bend achromat is presented aiming towards diffraction limited ring based light source. The described analysis can apply to any type of a ring based light source however for practical reasons we consider Elettra that has been operating for users for 24 years; to stay competitive for world-class photon science in the future a massive upgrade of the storage ring is needed. The optimum solution is based on certain design criteria; constraints regarding certain accelerator components and their implications on beam dynamics and user requirements. The space available for insertion devices as well as the impact of anti-bends on the design is also addressed. Two proposed realistic lattices are further discussed taking into account different criteria and user requirements. Those lattices reduce the emittance of the present machine by more than one order of magnitude but at the same time respect many other criteria such as realistic magnet gradients; magnets with magnetic length equal to the physical length; drift space enough for radiation extraction; large available space for insertion devices; minimal shift of the beam lines etc.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; J.R. Calvey; M. Borland; ANL; Argonne; Illinois; USA; Ions are produced in an accelerator when the beam ionizes residual gas inside the vacuum chamber. If the beam is negatively charged; ions can become trapped in the beam's potential; and their density will increase over time. Trapped ions can cause a variety of undesirable effects; including instability and emittance growth. Typically; simulation of ion effects is done using a ""weak-strong"" model; in which the ions are modeled using macroparticles; but the beam is assumed to be a fixed Gaussian distribution; with only centroid motion allowed. This type of model necessarily neglects incoherent beam effects; such as decoherence; emittance growth; and tune spread. Recently; an IONEFFECTS element has been incorporated into the particle tracking code ELEGANT. The code has been parallelized; and allows for modeling intra-bunch effects; in combination with other elements. Ion effects have been modeled for the APS-U storage ring and Particle Accumulator Ring; using both a weak-strong code and ELEGANT.

fls2018,,TUA2WB02,Multi-Bend Lattice Analysis Towards a Diffraction Limited Ring Based Light Source,"Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.; Basovizza; Italy; An analysis of lattice configurations up to 10 bend achromat is presented aiming towards diffraction limited ring based light source. The described analysis can apply to any type of a ring based light source however for practical reasons we consider Elettra that has been operating for users for 24 years; to stay competitive for world-class photon science in the future a massive upgrade of the storage ring is needed. The optimum solution is based on certain design criteria; constraints regarding certain accelerator components and their implications on beam dynamics and user requirements. The space available for insertion devices as well as the impact of anti-bends on the design is also addressed. Two proposed realistic lattices are further discussed taking into account different criteria and user requirements. Those lattices reduce the emittance of the present machine by more than one order of magnitude but at the same time respect many other criteria such as realistic magnet gradients; magnets with magnetic length equal to the physical length; drift space enough for radiation extraction; large available space for insertion devices; minimal shift of the beam lines etc.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; J.R. Calvey; M. Borland; ANL; Argonne; Illinois; USA; Ions are produced in an accelerator when the beam ionizes residual gas inside the vacuum chamber.

Recently we completed an upgrade of BPM DFE Digital Front End gaining benefits of a Xilinx Zynq FPGA. This FPGA includes a hard dual-core ARM A9 processor which will permit more advanced signal processing routines; faster ethernet communication; as well as resources to implement a pilot tone based active calibration; eliminating the need of thermal controlled racks. In the past year we procured a Libera Brilliance Plus BPM electronics unit to benchmark the outcome of our upgrade with respect to one of the best commercially available solutions. This presentation is focused on comparison of performance between NSLS-II RF BRM version 2 with the Libera unit focusing on the following performance parameters: Long term stability for 10Hz; as well as characterization of FA; TBT and ADC Raw data set.

fls2018,,TUP2WD01,Next Generation X-Ray Beam Position Monitor Development for the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade,ANL; Argonne; Illinois; USA; Current undulator XBPMs in the Advanced Photon Source (APS) can handle limited beam power and have strong bend magnet background. The next generation XBPM will separate the power-handling elements from the signal detectors using x-ray fluorescence from aperture components and x-ray scattering from low-Z blades. They showed distinct design advantages: (1) The water-cooled aperture components greatly enhance power-handling capacity; up to the APS-U 20-kW undulators. (2) Additional x-ray optics; such as pinhole-camera; enables center-of-mass; gap-independent measurements. (3) Proper beam-intercepting elements tailor the XBPM spectral properties and suppress the background; improving undulator measurement accuracy. (4) Using limiting apertures as the XBPM allows aiming the undulator beam reliably at the aperture during user operations; eliminating the common alignment issue between the aperture and the XBPM.

fls2018,,TUA1WC01,Progress on High Peak Current Laser Wakefield Electron Acceleration,HZDR; Dresden; Germany; Not only beam quality of laser wakefield accelerated electron beams but parameter control has been improved in recent years by individual optimization of electron injection and acceleration. We here present novel results of a scheme called tailored self-truncated ionization injection that allows for independent tuning of the injected bunch charge and the acceleration conditions; and results in unprecedented charges of up to 0.5 nC or peak currents exceeding 10s of kA with typical quasi monoenergetic spectra. Beam loading is demonstrated to improve beam parameters if properly controlled. Such bunches are ideal drivers for various radiation sources and potentially for lab-scale beam driven plasma wakefield accelerators.; J.

For the demonstration of the HXRSS; short electron beam bunches (FWHM ≤ 50 fs) are preferred to mitigate spatio-temperal coupling effect and to fit to the seeding bump width. In preparation for the commissioning of the HXRSS; beam dynamics simulations have been performed to optimize the longitudinal phase space for a 100 pC electron beam with 5 kA peak current. Performance of the optimized longitudinal phase space will be studied using a transverse deflecting structure in early 2018. With the optimized electron beam; HXRSS simulations have been performed for the lower (~3 keV) and the upper (~14 keV) photon energy range planned for the HXRSS operation. The locations of the two HXRSS stages have been studied and chosen to optimize the performance of the upper photon energy with an insignificant effect on the lower one. We will present the longitudinal phase space optimization for the 100 pC case as well as the expected performance of the HXRSS with the optimized set-up.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,Slides TUP2WA04 [8.959 MB] reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/talks/tup2wa04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/papers/tup2wa04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/posters/tup2wa04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FLS2018-TUP2WA04,

These facilities are in need of a high-precision timing distribution system; which can synchronize various microwave and optical sub-sources across multi-km distances with attosecond precision. Here; we report on a synchronous laser-microwave network that permits attosecond precision across km-scale distances. This was achieved by developing new ultrafast timing metrology devices and carefully balancing the fiber nonlinearities and fundamental noise contributions in the system. New polarization-noise-suppressed balanced optical crosscorrelators and free-space-coupled balanced optical-microwave phase detectors for improved noise performance have been implemented. Residual second- and third-order dispersion in the fiber links are carefully compensated with additional dispersion-compensating fiber to suppress link-induced Gordon-Haus jitter and to minimize output pulse duration; the link power is stabilized to minimize the nonlinearity-induced jitter as well as to maximize the signal to noise ratio for locking.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,Funding: This work was supported by DESY and the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement No. 609920.,Slides WEA1PL03 [5.888 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FLS2018-WEA1PL03 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/talks/wea1pl03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/papers/wea1pl03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/posters/wea1pl03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FLS2018-WEA1PL03,79

So far HHG sources have been driven by femtosecond solid-state lasers not FELs; because it has been believed that FELs have no ability to provide carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) stabilized few-cycle pulses essential to the HHG. Here; we propose a scheme to CEP stabilized few-cycle pulses from a FEL oscillator. Operated at a mid-infrared wavelength; the proposed method is able to drive a HHG photon source to produce isolated attosecond pulses at photon energies above 1 keV with a repetition > 10 MHz. The FEL-HHG photon source will open a door to full-scale experiments of attosecond X-ray pulses and push ultrafast laser science to the zeptosecond regime [1].; [1] R. Hajima and R. Nagai; Phys. Rev.

In intersections the electron velocity is faster than it inside an undulator and the optical phase is detuned. The detune effect is also from the undulator fringe field where electron longitudinal speed also deviates from the oscillation condition. The total detune effect is compensated by a magnetic device called phase shifter; which is correspondingly set for a specific undulator gap. In this paper we introduce the method to set the phase shifter gap for each K parameter according to the measured magnetic field.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; S. Di Mitri; S. Spampinati; Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A.; Basovizza; Italy; Suppression of microbunching instability (MBI) along high brightness electron beam delivery systems is a priority for Free Electron lasers (FELs) aiming at very narrow bandwidth.

A lattice for SSMB based on longitudinal strong focusing is under design in Tsinghua University. To generate and maintain micro-bunching in a storage ring in this scenario; the momentum compaction has to be small. A lattice with low momentum compaction factor is presented in this work. The lattice of the current design consists of two MBA cells with isochronous unit cells to minimize local and global momentum compaction; and two straight sections for insertion devices.

The first prototype U50 was built with six periods; 50mm each period. It was PPM type. The next prototype U20 hybrid device based on NdFeB-Cobalt steel was built with aim to produce 0.24T to 0.05T in 10-20mm gap. The undulator is a 20mm period and there are 25 periods. The next one is U50-II PPM structure with 20 periods.

The average power is more than 10 W and the micro-pulse power is more than 0.1 MW.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FLS2018-WEP2PT050 reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/talks/wep2pt050_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/papers/wep2pt050.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fls2018/posters/wep2pt050_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FLS2018-WEP2PT050,154
fls2018,,THA1WA01,Fast Simulation of FEL Linacs with Collective Effects,DESY; Hamburg; Germany; The demands of FELs on beam quality are a challenge. From the source via accelerators; bunch compressors; collimation system to and through undulators; self effects play an important role for the design and operation of such machines. Unfortunately it is not possible to solve the coupled problem of Maxwell's equations and equations of motion for bunches of 10-6 to 10-3 meter length in machines with a dimension of 100 to 1000 meters. Therefore simplifying concepts as space charge fields; space charge optics; wakes and coherent synchrotron radiation are widely in use. There are even models for parasitic micro-bunch instabilities for wavelengths clearly below one micrometer. Although the individual models are well developed and efficient; it is still difficult to combine them in single program that simulates a machine from the source to the end.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; K.Q. Zhang; C. Feng; D. Wang; SINAP; Shanghai; People's Republic of China; Soft x-ray self-seeding has been proved to be a feasible method to improve the longitudinal coherence of high gain free-electron laser. However; a pedestal-like sideband in the spectrum has been observed in the experiment; which generally limits the purity of the radiation pulse and the user's application. The previous theoretical study indicates that the pedestal-like sideband is mainly induced by microbunching instability generated from LINAC. In this paper; three dimensional simulations have been performed to confirm the analytical results and show the formation process of the spectral sideband. A probable method is proposed to eliminate the pedestal-like sideband by simply inserting a magnetic chicane before the self-seeding FEL undulator.

fls2018,,THP1WB01,Survey of Collective Effects in Next-Generation Light Source Rings,SOLEIL; Gif-sur-Yvette; France; In this talk we shall attempt to make an overview the general trend in storage rings optimized for the next-generation light sources; in the context of having as a result an important impact on beam collective effects. Reduction of the beam chamber cross section to attain strong magnetic fields for the ultra-low emittance optics is particularly highlighted. A series of collective effects and beam instabilities that are likely to get enhanced shall be reviewed. Some of the recent related theoretical; numerical and experimental studies shall be introduced; along with methods that are considered to be effective in mitigating the former undesirable effects.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; O. Tanaka; N. Nakamura; T. Obina; K. Tsuchiya; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; Four In-Vacuum Undulators (IVU) were recently installed to Photon Factory (PF) at KEK. The estimate of their impedance and kick factors is a very important issue; because they could considerably increase the total impedance of PF. Moreover; the coupling impedance of the IVUs could lead to the beam energy loss; changes in the bunch shape; betatron tune shifts and; finally; to the various beam instabilities. Using the simulation tool (CST Particle Studio); longitudinal and transverse impedances of the IVUs were evaluated and compared to analytical formulas and measurement results. The study provides guidelines for mitigation of unwanted impedance; for an accurate estimate of its effects on the beam quality and beam instabilities and for the impedance budget of a newly designed next-generation machine which has many IVUs and small-aperture beam pipes.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; ANL; Argonne; Illinois; USA; The next generation of high-brightness storage rings typically require a higher-harmonic rf system to increase the bunch length and improve lifetime. The modified longitudinal dynamics has important implications for multi-bunch stability; since bunch lengthening also changes the synchrotron frequency both by lowering its mean (which reduces stability); and by increasing its variation with amplitude (which gives rise to Landau damping).

fls2018,,THP1WB02,Impedance Evaluation of PF In-Vacuum Undulator (IVU) with Theories and Simulations and Experimental Confirmation of them by the Tune Measurement,O. Tanaka; N. Nakamura; T. Obina; K. Tsuchiya; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; Four In-Vacuum Undulators (IVU) were recently installed to Photon Factory (PF) at KEK. The estimate of their impedance and kick factors is a very important issue; because they could considerably increase the total impedance of PF. Moreover; the coupling impedance of the IVUs could lead to the beam energy loss; changes in the bunch shape; betatron tune shifts and; finally; to the various beam instabilities. Using the simulation tool (CST Particle Studio); longitudinal and transverse impedances of the IVUs were evaluated and compared to analytical formulas and measurement results. The study provides guidelines for mitigation of unwanted impedance; for an accurate estimate of its effects on the beam quality and beam instabilities and for the impedance budget of a newly designed next-generation machine which has many IVUs and small-aperture beam pipes.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; ANL; Argonne; Illinois; USA; The next generation of high-brightness storage rings typically require a higher-harmonic rf system to increase the bunch length and improve lifetime.

fls2018,,THP2WB01,Survey and Outlook for Short-Pulse Schemes in Storage Rings,HZB; Berlin; Germany; Whereas the generation of photon pulses in the fs or even sub-fs regime is governed by single pass accelerators; the usage of short photon pulses in the ps to sub-ps regime with high repetition rates up to the MHz level and the very high stability provided by storage rings is still of growing interest. In this talk an overview of schemes to generate adequate phase space distributions of the electron bunches for the generation of short photon pulses is given. In particular electron-laser and electron-electron interactions for slicing; as well as manipulation schemes of the transversal and longitudinal beam dynamics; as low alpha-operation; the variable pulse length storage ring scheme; or two-frequency crab cavities; are addressed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; C.-X. Tang; X.J. Deng; W.-H. Huang; T. Rui; TUB; Beijing; People's Republic of China; A. Chao; D.F. Ratner; SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; J. Feikes; J. Li; M. Ries; HZB; Berlin; Germany; C. Feng; B.C. Jiang; X.F. Wang; SINAP; Shanghai; People's Republic of China; MIT; Cambridge; Massachusetts; USA; PTB; Berlin; Germany; Steady State Microbunching (SSMB) is an electron stor- age ring based scheme proposed by Ratner and Chao to generate high average power coherent radiation and is one of the promising candidates to address the need of kW level EUV source for lithography.

fls2018,,THA2WC01,Ultra-short Period High Field Undultators for Compact Light Sources,"Kyoto University; Kyoto; Japan; Generation of strong periodic magnetic field in short period is important technology for future advanced light sources such as free electron lasers and synchrotron radiation facilities. However; the period length and K-value of undulators are limited by the maximum energy product of permanent magnet or engineering critical current density of superconducting wire in general. In order to overcome these technological limit; use of bulk superconductor has been proposed. The critical current densities of rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) exceeds 10 kA/mm2 at low temperature. This value is about 10 times higher than the engineering critical current density of superconducting wire. The maximum trapped magnetic field by REBCO bulk superconductor exceeds 17 T *; **. If this high density supercurrent are fully handled; ultra-short period high field undulator is realized. In this presentation; I will introduce several approaches of bulk superconductor undulators and summarize the merit and the drawback of them; then the potential of the bulk superconductors will be discussed.; * M.

Photon spectra measurements; in good agreement with the ex-pectations from magnetic measurements; were used for precise alignment and taper optimization. The second and third 18 mm PrFeB cryogenic undulators; modified to a half-pole/magnet/half-pole structure; were optimized without any magnet or pole shimming after assembly but mechanical sortings and some geometrical corrections had been done before assembly. A systematic error on individual magnets on the third U18 was also compensated. In-situ measurement benches; including a Hall probe and a stretched wire to optimize the undulator field at room and cryogenic temperature are presented.
