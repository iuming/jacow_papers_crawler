        "A 2.45 GHz ' 0.1 T microwave discharge Proton Source has been designed and assembled at INFN-LNS for the European Spallation Source (PS-ESS) in order to produce pulsed beams of protons up to 74 mA nominal current",
        "at 75 keV of energy",
        "with a transverse emittance containing 99 % of the nominal proton current below 2.25 π mm mrad and a beam stability of ± 2 %. The challenging performances of the machine have triggered specific studies on the maximization of the proton fraction inside the plasma and of the overall plasma density",
        "including dedicated modelling of the wave-to-plasma interaction and ionization processes. The plasma conditioning phase started in July and excellent RF to plasma coupling",
        "more than 99.5% is evident since the beginning. Reflected power fluctuation less than 0.05 % was measured providing a great starting point to reach the beam stability requested by the ESS accelerator."
