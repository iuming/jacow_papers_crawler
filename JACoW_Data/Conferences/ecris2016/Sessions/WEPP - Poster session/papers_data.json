        "with the development of the SILHI source which routinely produces tens mA of proton beam. Several industrial difficulties led to a very long IPHI RFQ construction process. The 352 MHz RFQ conditioning is presently in progress. Before the completion of the conditioning in CW mode",
        "tests with pulsed proton beam have been decided. As a consequence",
        "the SILHI source recently produced very short H+ beam pulses in order to allow the first IPHI beam acceleration. Such very short pulses",
        "in the range of few hundred microseconds",
        "allowed analyzing the beam loading of the RFQ cavity as well as conditioning the middle energy diagnostic. This article will focus on the source parameters and beam characteristics in the low energy beam line leading to the best RFQ transmission."

One of the contribution of Irfu/SACM at CEA-Saclay to the FAIR linear proton accelerator concerns the development and construction of the ion source and the low energy line. The 2.45 GHz microwave ion source will deliver a 100 mA H+ beam pulsed at 4 Hz with an energy of 95 keV. A low energy beam transport (LEBT) line based on a dual solenoids focusing scheme allows the injection of the proton beam into the radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) within an acceptance of 0.3π mm.mrad (norm.",

        "The fixed target experiment NA61 in the North Area of the SPS at CERN studies phase transitions in strongly interacting matter using the primary beams available from the CERN accelerator complex (protons and lead ions). In order to explore a wider range of energies and densities a primary argon beam was requested for the physics run in 2015. The GTS-LHC ECR ion source was running for many months during 2013 and 2014 to study the source behaviour and to setup the accelerator chain with argon ions. This paper reports the long term effects of the argon operation on the GTS-LHC ion source and the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT). Heavy sputtering inside the source caused a degradation of the plasma chamber and metal coating of insulators inside the beam extraction system. Iron ions could be found in the extracted beam. Also the pumping performance of ion getter pumps in the LEBT degraded significantly. Additional preventive maintenance was necessary to be able to run for long periods without risking serious damage to the ion source."

      "abstract": "Negative hydrogen ECRIS plasma is confined by NdFeB permanent magnet antenna around cylindrical cavity wall. Measured axial and radial magnetic field is benchmarked with the simulated data. Four axially magnetized ring magnets of remanance flux density of 1.17T is simulated using bounded current ampere's law technique. Gradient of radial and axial magnetic flux density is calculated to estimate lighter ions leaking out of the plasma wall sheath region. The peak values of radial magnetic field gradient between plasma sheath region and cavity outer wall surface increases from 0.1x107 A/m2 to -0.2x107 A/m2 respectively. Axial magnetic field gradient along inner ECR chamber wall increases from -2.1x107 A/m2 to 2.5x107 A/m2 .ECR contour dimensions of 875 Gauss which corresponds to microwave plasma resonating frequency of 2.45GHz is of thickness ~1mm and having major and minor radius of 30mm and 28mm respectively. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "Existing heavy ion facilities such as the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University rely on Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion sources as injectors of highly charged ion beams. Long ion confinement times are necessary to produce dense populations of highly charged ions because of steadily decreasing ionization cross sections with increasing charge state. To further understand ion extraction and confinement we are using a fast sputtering technique first developed at Argonne National Laboratory [1] to introduce a small amount of uranium metal into the plasma at a well-defined time. In addition we utilize an axial x-ray apparatus [2] to characterize the hot electron plasma population via its bremsstrahlung emission."

An alternative low-cost method to study the microwave emission in narrow frequency bands is to apply band-pass waveguide filters and microwave sensitive diodes. The microwave emission from the plasma of the JYFL 14 GHz ECRIS has been studied with both methods. The results of the experiments are compared and their interpretation is discussed. It is demonstrated that the method based on filters and diodes can provide useful information about the microwave emission spectra induced by electron cyclotron instabilities."

A microwave field of the order of 1.3 x105 V/m is obtained at the center of plasma chamber cavity for an input microwave power of 500W. Microwave radiated plasma has a maximum density of 9.04 x1016 / m3 after some microwave periods (0.01s).The steady state peak electron temperature is around 3eV under 1 mbar pressure of argon gas. Most of power deposition takes place on the ECR surface which is the 875G contour resonating with the electron frequency. Steady state argon plasma results show that beyond critical plasma density of 7.4x1016 / m3 most of the microwave power is deposited at the plasma edge. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
