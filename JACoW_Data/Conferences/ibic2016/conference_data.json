The AC stability requirement is to correct rms beam motion to 10 \\% the rms beam size at the insertion device source points from 0.01 to 1000 Hz. The vertical plane represents the biggest challenge for AC stability which is required to be 400 nm rms for a 4 micron vertical beam size. In addition long term drift over a period of 7 days is required to be 1 micron or less at insertion device BPMs and 2 microns for arc bpms.

These new BPM electronics and power supplies will not have the fast 10 KHz data broadcast capability of the components of the present system. So we plan to implement an hybrid slow/ fast correction scheme on the SR of the EBS in order to reuse the present fast orbit correction system on a reduced set of the BPMs and correctors and combine this fast orbit correction with an orbit correction performed at a slower rate using the full set of BPMs and correctors. We have made simulations to predict the efficiency of this scheme for the EBS and tested on the present ring a similar orbit correction scheme using only 160 BPMs and 64 correctors for the fast corrections . We present the results of our simulations and experiments."

          "abstract": "The Advanced Photon Source (APS) is currently in the preliminary design phase for the multi -bend achromat (MBA) lattice upgrade. Beam stability is critical for the MBA and will require long term drift defined as beam motion over a seven-day timescale to be no more than 1 micron at the insertion device locations and beam angle change no more than 0.5 micro-radian. Mechanical stability of beam position monitor (BPM) pickup electrodes mounted on insertion device vacuum chambers place a fundamental limitation on long-term beam stability for insertion device beamlines. We present the design and implementation of using prototype mechanical motion system (MMS) instrumentation for quantifying this type of motion specifically in the APS accelerator tunnel and experiment hall floor under normal operating conditions. The MMS presently provides critical position information on the vacuum chamber and BPM support systems. Initial results of the R&D prototype systems have demonstrated that the chamber movements far exceed the long-term drift tolerance specified for the APS Upgrade MBA storage ring. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

We have analyzed these BLM failures and correlated the integrated received dose with any special conditions of each BLM location which might have led to their breakdown. We also show studies of beam losses in the insertion devices, with particular attention to the results in the multipole wiggler (MPW), where the vacuum chamber is (suspected to be) misaligned and high BLM counts are detected.",

The light-field streak camera is a promising methods for the photon pulse length measurement that uses the electric field of an IR/THz laser to streak the photoelectrons*. This contribution presents a simulation of the performance of a streak camera using a single-cycle THz pulse**. The simulation recreates the photoionization process and generates electron spectra in presence of the THz field and without it. Using these spectra the photon pulse lengths are calculated and compared to the initial values. Most of the parameters used in the simulation are chosen based on experiments performed earlier.*** This contribution presents the simulation method and the obtained results. It validates the pulse length calculation analysis method and estimates the expected measurement accuracy and precision for the THz streak camera measurement technique. The simulations were done for different FEL pulse lengths ranging from about 1 fs to 40 fs both in soft and hard X-ray range. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

The network linked research into lasers and accelerators to develop advanced particle sources, new accelerating schemes, and in particular beyond state-of-the-art beam diagnostics. This contribution summarizes the research results in laser-based beam diagnostics for accelerators and light sources. It discusses the achievable resolution of laser-based velocimeters to measure the velocity of particle beams, the resolution limits of bunch shape measurements using electro-optical crystals, position resolution of laser wire scanners, and limits in energy measurements using Compton backscattering at synchrotron light sources. Finally, it also provides a summary of past and future events organized by the network and shows how an interdisciplinary research program can provide comprehensive training to a cohort of early career researchers.",

In past systems the gratings were used sequentially and so several bunches were required to generate a single profile",

The goal of the JEDI collaboration (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) is to measure the EDM of charged particles. The measurement of EDMs of charged hadrons can be performed in storage rings by observing a polarization build-up proportional to the EDM. Due to the smallness of the effect many systematic effects leading to a fake build-up have to be studied. A first step on the way for an EDM measurement is the investigation of systematic errors at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron). One part of these studies is the control of the beam orbit with high precession. Therefore a concept of new Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) based on magnetic pick-up coils are used. The main advantage of the coil design is the high response to bunched beam frequency signal and the compactness of the coil itself. First measurement results of such a BPM accelerator environment will be presented."

The system is composed of forty identical detector units formed by a cylindrical Quartz radiator directly coupled to a Photomultiplier. These units are installed at a radius of 1.8m and a distance of 20.6 m from the CMS interaction point. The fast and direction-sensitive signal allows to measure incoming MIB particles while suppressing the much more abundant collision products and albedo particles",

            "development of a simple method for beam halo diagnostics is highly desirable. The first testing of CR-39 solid-state nuclear track dosimeters for beam halo measurement were performed at the SARAF phase I accelerator with a few MeV proton beams. Beam pulses of 90 nA peak intensity of shortest possible duration (15 ns) were used for direct irradiation of standard CR-39 personal dosimetry tags. Other irradiations were done with beam pulses of 200 ns duration and of 1 mA peak intensity. Specially prepared large area CR-39 plates with central hole for the beam core transport were used in these tests. Weak beam structures were clearly observed in the both types of irradiation. The tests showed feasibility of beam halo measurements down to resolution level of a single proton. The optimum CR-39 etching conditions were established. The advantages and drawback of the method are discussed."

This can potentially cause critical components to fail unexpectedly or denature over time, causing disruption for users of the ISIS facility or a loss of accuracy on a number of systems. To study the long term effects of ionising radiation on ISIS systems and electronics, the total dose received by such components must be recorded. A semiconductor based online Total Ionisation Dosimeter (TID) was developed to do this, using pin diodes and Radiation sensing Field Effect Transistors (RadFETs) to measure the total ionisation dose. Measurements are made by feeding the TIDs with a constant current, with the threshold voltage on each device increasing in relation to the amount of radiation that it has received. This paper will look at preliminary offline results using off the shelf Field Effect Transistors (FETs) and diodes, before discussing the development of the RadFET online monitor and the results it has gathered thus far. Finally the paper will look at future applications and studies that this type of monitor will enable.",

Optimization of the accelerator availability is a strong motivation to avoid such kind of issues. Still, even at large accelerator labs like CERN, release cycles of many accelerator components are managed in a \"deploy and pray\" manner. In this paper we will give a short general overview on testing strategies used commonly in software development projects and illustrate their application on accelerator components, both hardware and software.

In the S-DALINAC Polarized Injector SPIN polarized electrons with a polarization of up to 86% can be produced. The polarization can be measured with two already mounted Mott polarimeters in the injector beamline where the electrons can have energies of up to 10 MeV. To allow polarization measurements behind the main accelerator a Moeller polarimeter suitable for energies between 50 MeV and 130 MeV is currently being developed. The rather low and variable beam energies result in a big and also variable scattering angle distribution. Combined with strict spatial boundary conditions at the designated mounting area necessitate a very compact set-up for the polarimeter. In addition to an overview over the planned polarimeter we will present drafts of the target chamber",

The standard kick beam and measured phase evolution of the head and tail of a given bunch has been tried at RHIC. Additionally a more exotic approach to measure the head versus tail phase difference has been tried. In this approach we used a BBQ pickup and kicker with the input stripline signal to the BBQ mixed with a nano second pulse timed to the head and tail of the bunch.

            "The ELBE center of high power radiation sources at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf combines a superconducting CW linear accelerator with Terawatt- and Petawatt-level laser sources. Key experiments rely on precise timing and synchronization between the different radiation pulses. An online single shot monitoring system has been set up in order to measure the timing between the high-power Ti:Sa laser DRACO and electron bunches generated by the conventional SRF accelerator. This turnkey timing system is suitable for timing control of Thomson scattering X-ray sources and external injection of electron bunches into a laser wakefield accelerator. It uses a broadband RF pickup to acquire a probe of the particle bunch's electric field and modulates a fraction of the high power laser pulse in a fast electro-optical modulator. The amplitude modulation gives a direct measure for the timing between both beams. Using this setup a resolution of <200 fs RMS has been demonstrated. The contribution will show the prototype",

            "The Gamma Beam Source (ELI-GBS) is a high brightness electron LINAC that is being built at the ELI Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) facility in Romania. The ELI-GBS aims to produce high quality gamma beam through Compton Backscattering. A train of 32 bunches at 100Hz with a nominal charge of 250pC is accelerated up to 740 MeV. Two interaction points with an IR Laser beam produces the gamma beam at two different energies. In order to measure the electron beam spot size and the beam properties",
            "the LINAC is equipped with several optical transition radiation (OTR) profile monitors. Those OTR screens must sustain the thermal and mechanical stress due to the energy deposited by the bunches. We present a numerical (ANSYS) study of the thermo-mechanical issues due to beam energy deposition in the screens; our analysis will cover both the steady state and transient regime."

Non-invasive Profile Monitors at ESS measure the transverse profile of the high power proton beam. As such the NPM for the LEBT is not different from NPM designed for other sections of the ESS linac, however, it received the requirement to measure the position of the beam accurately with respect to the centre of the vacuum chamber, representing the reference orbit. This particular requirement led to implement a specific design to provide absolute position measurement to the system. In the following we will first describe the design and the associated functionalities, and then we will present the performance measurements of this built system, fully integrated into the control system. Finally we will discuss the performance in comparison to the initial requirements. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

The real-time processing of the electron beam parameters is a necessary procedure to optimize the key characteristics of the source using feedback loops. The frequency of electron beam cycling in the synchrotron storage ring is about 1 MHz. In multi-bunch mode electrons are grouped into a series of bunches. The bunch repetition frequency depends on the total number of bunches and usually reaches hundreds of MHz. The actual problem is to study the separate bunch dimensions behavior under multi-bunch beam instabilities. To solve this problem a turn-to-turn electron beam profile monitor is developed for Siberia-2 synchrotron light source. The linear avalanche photodiodes array is applied to imaging. The apparatus is able to record a transversal profile of selected bunches and analyze the dynamics of beam during 106 turns. The recent experimental results obtained with the diagnostics are described.",

Stripline electrodes collect electrons that would otherwise impact the beam-pipe surface. The striplines are placed behind an array of small holes in the beam-pipe wall in order to shield them from the beam-induced electromagnetic pulse. There are three striplines placed near one of the pole tips so that they cover a roughly 0.43 radian azimuth. The beam-pipe chamber has also been designed so that microwave measurements of the electron cloud density can be performed. Beam position monitor buttons have been included for excitation and reception of microwaves and the chamber has been designed so that the resonant microwaves are confined to be within the 56 cm length of the quadrupole field. This paper provides some details of the design including CST Microwave Studio time domain simulation of the stripline detectors and eigenmode simulation of the resonant chamber. The detector is installed in the Cornell Electron Storage Ring and is part of the test accelerator program for the study of electron cloud using electron and positron beams from 2 to 5 GeV.",

            "the main assumption for the Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB) controller design is that the corrector magnets all have the same dynamic response. In this paper",
            "a procedure to measure the frequency responses of the corrector magnets on the Diamond Storage Ring is presented and the magnet responses are measured and compared in order to assess whether this assumption is valid. The measurements are made by exciting a single corrector magnet with a sinusoidal input and measuring the resulting sinusoidal movement on the electron beam using electron Beam Position Monitors (eBPMs). The input excitation is varied from 10 Hz to 5 kHz using a 10 mA sine wave. The amplitude ratio and the phase difference between the input excitation and the beam position excitation are determined for each input frequency and the procedure is repeated for several magnets. Variations in both gain and phase across magnets are discussed in this paper and the effect of such variations on the performance of the FOFB controller performance is determined."

            "tungsten blades are used to form the pinhole aperture due to the opacity of tungsten to x-rays in the keV spectral range. The physical properties of tungsten also make it difficult to work. To achieve the 25 micron x 25 micron aperture size required for high resolution measurements it is necessary to mount these tungsten blades in an assembly whereby the pinhole aperture size is defined by precisely machined shims. Here we propose to replace the tungsten blade and shim arrangement with machined molybdenum blades and evaluate the performance of the resulting imaging system."

            "Synchrotron radiation based emittance diagnostics at modern 3rd generation light sources is mainly based on beam profile imaging in the X-ray region in order to overcome the resolution limit imposed by diffraction. A possibility to circumvent this limitation is to probe the spatial coherence with a double-slit interferometer in the optical spectral region [*]. The light source PETRA III at DESY is using this type of interferometer since several years in order to resolve vertical emittances of about 10 pm.rad. The device is set up behind a 30m long optical beamline",

The AC stability requirement is to correct rms beam motion to 10 \\% the rms beam size at the insertion device source points from 0.01 to 1000 Hz. The vertical plane represents the biggest challenge for AC stability which is required to be 400 nm rms for a 4 micron vertical beam size.

Beam stability is critical for the MBA and will require long term drift defined as beam motion over a seven-day timescale to be no more than 1 micron at the insertion device locations and beam angle change no more than 0.5 micro-radian. Mechanical stability of beam position monitor (BPM) pickup electrodes mounted on insertion device vacuum chambers place a fundamental limitation on long-term beam stability for insertion device beamlines. We present the design and implementation of using prototype mechanical motion system (MMS) instrumentation for quantifying this type of motion specifically in the APS accelerator tunnel and experiment hall floor under normal operating conditions. The MMS presently provides critical position information on the vacuum chamber and BPM support systems. Initial results of the R&D prototype systems have demonstrated that the chamber movements far exceed the long-term drift tolerance specified for the APS Upgrade MBA storage ring. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

        "an innovative methodology has been developed to directly observe signal variations corresponding to nanometric displacements of the BPM cavity with respect to a conductive stretched wire. The cavity BPM of this R&D study operates at the TM110 dipole mode frequency of 15GHz. The concepts and details of the RF stretched wire BPM test-bench to achieve the best resolution results are presented",

The light-field streak camera is a promising methods for the photon pulse length measurement that uses the electric field of an IR/THz laser to streak the photoelectrons*. This contribution presents a simulation of the performance of a streak camera using a single-cycle THz pulse**. The simulation recreates the photoionization process and generates electron spectra in presence of the THz field and without it. Using these spectra the photon pulse lengths are calculated and compared to the initial values. Most of the parameters used in the simulation are chosen based on experiments performed earlier.*** This contribution presents the simulation method and the obtained results. It validates the pulse length calculation analysis method and estimates the expected measurement accuracy and precision for the THz streak camera measurement technique. The simulations were done for different FEL pulse lengths ranging from about 1 fs to 40 fs both in soft and hard X-ray range. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

This contribution summarizes the research results in laser-based beam diagnostics for accelerators and light sources. It discusses the achievable resolution of laser-based velocimeters to measure the velocity of particle beams, the resolution limits of bunch shape measurements using electro-optical crystals, position resolution of laser wire scanners, and limits in energy measurements using Compton backscattering at synchrotron light sources. Finally, it also provides a summary of past and future events organized by the network and shows how an interdisciplinary research program can provide comprehensive training to a cohort of early career researchers.",

        "which can be strongly increased by the cavity radio frequency power when it is phase-correlated with the electrons. Such photons present a real problem for Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) systems since no discrimination can be made between cavity contributions and beam loss contributions. Therefore",

Simulations show that detection efficiencies > 8 % are achievable for neutrons with energies between 1 eV and 10 MeV."

The goal of the JEDI collaboration (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) is to measure the EDM of charged particles. The measurement of EDMs of charged hadrons can be performed in storage rings by observing a polarization build-up proportional to the EDM. Due to the smallness of the effect many systematic effects leading to a fake build-up have to be studied. A first step on the way for an EDM measurement is the investigation of systematic errors at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron). One part of these studies is the control of the beam orbit with high precession. Therefore a concept of new Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) based on magnetic pick-up coils are used. The main advantage of the coil design is the high response to bunched beam frequency signal and the compactness of the coil itself. First measurement results of such a BPM accelerator environment will be presented."

Using the four well matched (phase and amplitude) bunch induced RF-signals in combination with a low jitter master clock and commercial data acquisition cards allow beam position measurements on a bunch to bunch basis with micrometer resolution. Experimental results obtained at BESSY II and MLS demonstrates the achieved performance of the setup and will be discussed in detail."

        "development of a simple method for beam halo diagnostics is highly desirable. The first testing of CR-39 solid-state nuclear track dosimeters for beam halo measurement were performed at the SARAF phase I accelerator with a few MeV proton beams. Beam pulses of 90 nA peak intensity of shortest possible duration (15 ns) were used for direct irradiation of standard CR-39 personal dosimetry tags. Other irradiations were done with beam pulses of 200 ns duration and of 1 mA peak intensity. Specially prepared large area CR-39 plates with central hole for the beam core transport were used in these tests. Weak beam structures were clearly observed in the both types of irradiation. The tests showed feasibility of beam halo measurements down to resolution level of a single proton. The optimum CR-39 etching conditions were established. The advantages and drawback of the method are discussed."

This can potentially cause critical components to fail unexpectedly or denature over time, causing disruption for users of the ISIS facility or a loss of accuracy on a number of systems. To study the long term effects of ionising radiation on ISIS systems and electronics, the total dose received by such components must be recorded. A semiconductor based online Total Ionisation Dosimeter (TID) was developed to do this, using pin diodes and Radiation sensing Field Effect Transistors (RadFETs) to measure the total ionisation dose. Measurements are made by feeding the TIDs with a constant current, with the threshold voltage on each device increasing in relation to the amount of radiation that it has received. This paper will look at preliminary offline results using off the shelf Field Effect Transistors (FETs) and diodes, before discussing the development of the RadFET online monitor and the results it has gathered thus far. Finally the paper will look at future applications and studies that this type of monitor will enable.",

Optimization of the accelerator availability is a strong motivation to avoid such kind of issues. Still, even at large accelerator labs like CERN, release cycles of many accelerator components are managed in a \"deploy and pray\" manner. In this paper we will give a short general overview on testing strategies used commonly in software development projects and illustrate their application on accelerator components, both hardware and software. Finally, several examples of CERN systems will be shown on which these techniques were or will be applied (LHC Beam-Based Feedbacks and LHC Luminosity Server) and describe why it is worth doing so."

In the S-DALINAC Polarized Injector SPIN polarized electrons with a polarization of up to 86% can be produced. The polarization can be measured with two already mounted Mott polarimeters in the injector beamline where the electrons can have energies of up to 10 MeV. To allow polarization measurements behind the main accelerator a Moeller polarimeter suitable for energies between 50 MeV and 130 MeV is currently being developed. The rather low and variable beam energies result in a big and also variable scattering angle distribution. Combined with strict spatial boundary conditions at the designated mounting area necessitate a very compact set-up for the polarimeter. In addition to an overview over the planned polarimeter we will present drafts of the target chamber",

The standard kick beam and measured phase evolution of the head and tail of a given bunch has been tried at RHIC. Additionally a more exotic approach to measure the head versus tail phase difference has been tried. In this approach we used a BBQ pickup and kicker with the input stripline signal to the BBQ mixed with a nano second pulse timed to the head and tail of the bunch. In this way we hoped to force the BBQ to sample the head or tail of the bunch depending on the pulse timing. We report on the results and challenges which each approach presented.",

Non-invasive Profile Monitors at ESS measure the transverse profile of the high power proton beam. As such the NPM for the LEBT is not different from NPM designed for other sections of the ESS linac, however, it received the requirement to measure the position of the beam accurately with respect to the centre of the vacuum chamber, representing the reference orbit. This particular requirement led to implement a specific design to provide absolute position measurement to the system. In the following we will first describe the design and the associated functionalities, and then we will present the performance measurements of this built system, fully integrated into the control system.

      "abstract": "The electron beam quality determines the main synchrotron radiation characteristics therefore beam diagnostics is of great importance for synchrotron radiation source performance. The real-time processing of the electron beam parameters is a necessary procedure to optimize the key characteristics of the source using feedback loops. The frequency of electron beam cycling in the synchrotron storage ring is about 1 MHz. In multi-bunch mode electrons are grouped into a series of bunches. The bunch repetition frequency depends on the total number of bunches and usually reaches hundreds of MHz. The actual problem is to study the separate bunch dimensions behavior under multi-bunch beam instabilities. To solve this problem a turn-to-turn electron beam profile monitor is developed for Siberia-2 synchrotron light source. The linear avalanche photodiodes array is applied to imaging. The apparatus is able to record a transversal profile of selected bunches and analyze the dynamics of beam during 106 turns. The recent experimental results obtained with the diagnostics are described.",

The monochromatic rf signal is inputted to the kicker and we induce an oscillation by kicking the beam. The amplitude of the quadrupole oscillation will depend on the number of particles having a certain tune. In the beam test at J-PARC MR",
        "the dipole kicker was used as a quadrupole kicker by exciting the two facing electrodes in-phase. We measured the response to the kick at several frequencies. We observed that the amplitude depends on the kicker frequency and the number of particles per bunch. This demonstrates that the quadrupole oscillation can be induced by a kicker and the possibility of measuring the number of a particular tune particle from the response. We will present the result of the beam test and our prospect and the comparison between the experimental result and a numerical calculation."

Before entering the 30 MeV main accelerator the low energetic electron beam passes both a normal-conducting injector beamline preparing the beam's 3 GHz time structure as well as a superconducting 10 MeV injector beamline for preacceleration. Since the superconducting injector accelerates on-crest while the main accelerator accelerates off-crest the beam phase is crucial for the efficiency of the acceleration process and the minimization of the energy spread. Due to thermal drifts of the normal-conducting injector cavities this injection phase varies by about 0.2 degree over a timescale of an hour. In order to compensate for these drifts",

The future of RHIC ion runs will include new RF conditions as well as a wider dynamic range in intensity. Plans for the use of electron beams",

        "have also driven this architecture toward a highly configurable approach. The RF input section has been designed such that jumpers can be changed to allow a single board to provide ion or electron optimized analog filtering. These channels are sampled with four 14-bit 400MSPS A/D converters. The SoC's ARM processor allows a Linux OS to run directly on the module along with a controls system software interface. The FPGA is used to process samples from the ADCs and perform position calculations. A suite of peripherals including dual Ethernet ports",

Stripline electrodes collect electrons that would otherwise impact the beam-pipe surface. The striplines are placed behind an array of small holes in the beam-pipe wall in order to shield them from the beam-induced electromagnetic pulse. There are three striplines placed near one of the pole tips so that they cover a roughly 0.43 radian azimuth. The beam-pipe chamber has also been designed so that microwave measurements of the electron cloud density can be performed. Beam position monitor buttons have been included for excitation and reception of microwaves and the chamber has been designed so that the resonant microwaves are confined to be within the 56 cm length of the quadrupole field. This paper provides some details of the design including CST Microwave Studio time domain simulation of the stripline detectors and eigenmode simulation of the resonant chamber. The detector is installed in the Cornell Electron Storage Ring and is part of the test accelerator program for the study of electron cloud using electron and positron beams from 2 to 5 GeV.",

The input excitation is varied from 10 Hz to 5 kHz using a 10 mA sine wave. The amplitude ratio and the phase difference between the input excitation and the beam position excitation are determined for each input frequency and the procedure is repeated for several magnets. Variations in both gain and phase across magnets are discussed in this paper and the effect of such variations on the performance of the FOFB controller performance is determined."

A device performs interferometry between two broadband wake signals generated by a single short particle bunch. The mentioned wakes are excited by two consequent small gaps in beam channel. A field pattern formed by interference of the mentioned two coherent wake signals is registered by means of detector arrays placed at outer side of beam channel. The detectors are assumed to be low-cost integrating detectors (pyro-detectors or bolometers) so that integration time is assumed to be much bigger than bunch length. Because RF signals come from gaps to any detector with different time delays which depend on particular detector coordinate",

Silicon carbide-coated carbon fibre wires are used in profile monitors throughout the ISIS accelerator. One such SEM grid is currently installed close to the target in EPB2 and is intercepted by the 800 MeV proton beam at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Future profile measurements will require another of these monitors to be installed close to the target in EPB1; intercepted with a repetition rate of 40 Hz. Wires intercepting the ion beam are heated due to the deposition of beam-energy. Thermal simulations for the higher repetition rate were performed using ANSYS and a numerical code. The numerical code was then expanded to include various beam",

        "the negative hydrogen ion beam is acceralated to be 400 MeV. Repitition rate will be increased to be from 25 Hz to 50 Hz. The half of 400 MeV beams are injected to the downstream scynchlotoron (RCS) and the other half will be transported to the planned experimental laboratory of the accelerator driven transmutation facility. One of the important issues for the high-current and high-brilliance accelerators is to understand the beam dynamics. The wire scanner monitor is reliably operated in many accelerator facilities around the world. Because the heat loading on a wire is getting increaced in high-current beam tuning",
        "we focused to use a laser wire system. Ionization potential of the negative hydrogen ion is 0.75 eV and one electron is easily detached by a laser beam whose wavelength is adjusted by the Doppler-shift to a large cross-section point. In addition",
        "we propose to use a new multi-laser-wire system. In the new system",
        "we use a pair of concave millors with different diameters to make multi-paths of laser beam",
        "and the beam waists of the laser paths are aligned in principle. In the paper",
        "we propose the multi-laser-wire system and its application."
