        "Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) violate parity and time reversal symmetries. Assuming the CPT-theorem",
        "this leads to CP violation",
        "which is needed to explain the matter over antimatter dominance in the Universe. So far no direct EDM measurement for charged hadrons have been performed. The goal of the JEDI collaboration (Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations) is to measure the EDM of charged particles. The measurement of EDMs of charged hadrons can be performed in storage rings by observing a polarization build-up proportional to the EDM. Due to the smallness of the effect many systematic effects leading to a fake build-up have to be studied. A first step on the way for an EDM measurement is the investigation of systematic errors at the storage ring COSY (COoler SYnchrotron). One part of these studies is the control of the beam orbit with high precession. Therefore a concept of new Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) based on magnetic pick-up coils are used. The main advantage of the coil design is the high response to bunched beam frequency signal and the compactness of the coil itself. First measurement results of such a BPM accelerator environment will be presented."

Using the four well matched (phase and amplitude) bunch induced RF-signals in combination with a low jitter master clock and commercial data acquisition cards allow beam position measurements on a bunch to bunch basis with micrometer resolution. Experimental results obtained at BESSY II and MLS demonstrates the achieved performance of the setup and will be discussed in detail."

        "development of a simple method for beam halo diagnostics is highly desirable. The first testing of CR-39 solid-state nuclear track dosimeters for beam halo measurement were performed at the SARAF phase I accelerator with a few MeV proton beams. Beam pulses of 90 nA peak intensity of shortest possible duration (15 ns) were used for direct irradiation of standard CR-39 personal dosimetry tags. Other irradiations were done with beam pulses of 200 ns duration and of 1 mA peak intensity. Specially prepared large area CR-39 plates with central hole for the beam core transport were used in these tests. Weak beam structures were clearly observed in the both types of irradiation. The tests showed feasibility of beam halo measurements down to resolution level of a single proton. The optimum CR-39 etching conditions were established. The advantages and drawback of the method are discussed."

This can potentially cause critical components to fail unexpectedly or denature over time, causing disruption for users of the ISIS facility or a loss of accuracy on a number of systems. To study the long term effects of ionising radiation on ISIS systems and electronics, the total dose received by such components must be recorded. A semiconductor based online Total Ionisation Dosimeter (TID) was developed to do this, using pin diodes and Radiation sensing Field Effect Transistors (RadFETs) to measure the total ionisation dose. Measurements are made by feeding the TIDs with a constant current, with the threshold voltage on each device increasing in relation to the amount of radiation that it has received. This paper will look at preliminary offline results using off the shelf Field Effect Transistors (FETs) and diodes, before discussing the development of the RadFET online monitor and the results it has gathered thus far. Finally the paper will look at future applications and studies that this type of monitor will enable.",

        "The Optimization of Medical Accelerators (OMA) is the aim of a new European Training Network that has received 4 ME of funding within the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Union. OMA joins universities, research centers and clinical facilities with industry partners to address the challenges in treatment facility design and optimization, numerical simulations for the development of advanced treatment schemes, and beam imaging and treatment monitoring. This contribution presents an overview of the network's research into beam diagnostics and imaging. This includes investigations into applying detector technologies originally developed for high energy physics experiments (such as VELO, Medipix) for medical applications; integration of prompt gamma cameras in the clinical workflow; identification of optimum detector configurations and materials for high resolution spectrometers for proton therapy and radiography; ultra-low charge beam current monitors and diagnostics for cell studies using proton beams. It also summarizes the network-wide training program consisting of Schools, Topical Workshops and Conferences that will be open to the wider medical and accelerator communities."

The oPAC project received 6 M€ of funding within the EU's 7th Framework Programme. This has allowed to successfully train 23 Fellows since 2011. The network joins more than 40 institutions from all around the world, including research centers, universities and private companies. One of the project's largest work packages covers research in beam diagnostics. This includes advanced instrumentation for synchrotron light sources and medical accelerators, enhanced beam loss monitoring technologies, ultra-low emittance beam size diagnostics, diagnostics for high intensity beams, as well as the development of electronics for beam position monitors. This contribution presents an overview of the research outcomes from the diagnostics work package and the demonstrated performance of each monitor. It also shows how collaborative research helps achieving beyond state-of-the-art solutions and acts as an ideal basis for researcher training. Finally, an overview of the scientific events the network has been organizing for the wider accelerator community is given.",

Optimization of the accelerator availability is a strong motivation to avoid such kind of issues. Still, even at large accelerator labs like CERN, release cycles of many accelerator components are managed in a \"deploy and pray\" manner. In this paper we will give a short general overview on testing strategies used commonly in software development projects and illustrate their application on accelerator components, both hardware and software. Finally, several examples of CERN systems will be shown on which these techniques were or will be applied (LHC Beam-Based Feedbacks and LHC Luminosity Server) and describe why it is worth doing so."

In this framework the CpFM have been developed to measure the beam particle flux in different experimental situations. Thin movable fused-silica bars installed in the SPS primary vacuum and intercepting the incoming particles are used to radiate Cherenkov light. The light signal is collected outside the beam pipe through a quartz optical window by radiation hard PMTs. The PMT signal is readout by the WaveCatcher acquisition board",
        "which provides count rate as well as waveform information over a configurable time window. A bundle of optical fibers can be used to transport the light signal far from the beam pipe",

In the S-DALINAC Polarized Injector SPIN polarized electrons with a polarization of up to 86% can be produced. The polarization can be measured with two already mounted Mott polarimeters in the injector beamline where the electrons can have energies of up to 10 MeV. To allow polarization measurements behind the main accelerator a Moeller polarimeter suitable for energies between 50 MeV and 130 MeV is currently being developed. The rather low and variable beam energies result in a big and also variable scattering angle distribution. Combined with strict spatial boundary conditions at the designated mounting area necessitate a very compact set-up for the polarimeter. In addition to an overview over the planned polarimeter we will present drafts of the target chamber",

The standard kick beam and measured phase evolution of the head and tail of a given bunch has been tried at RHIC. Additionally a more exotic approach to measure the head versus tail phase difference has been tried. In this approach we used a BBQ pickup and kicker with the input stripline signal to the BBQ mixed with a nano second pulse timed to the head and tail of the bunch.

Key experiments rely on precise timing and synchronization between the different radiation pulses. An online single shot monitoring system has been set up in order to measure the timing between the high-power Ti:Sa laser DRACO and electron bunches generated by the conventional SRF accelerator. This turnkey timing system is suitable for timing control of Thomson scattering X-ray sources and external injection of electron bunches into a laser wakefield accelerator. It uses a broadband RF pickup to acquire a probe of the particle bunch's electric field and modulates a fraction of the high power laser pulse in a fast electro-optical modulator. The amplitude modulation gives a direct measure for the timing between both beams. Using this setup a resolution of <200 fs RMS has been demonstrated. The contribution will show the prototype",

      "abstract": "We present in this paper the design and implementation of the Non-invasive Profile Monitors for the ESS LEBT. Non-invasive Profile Monitors at ESS measure the transverse profile of the high power proton beam. As such the NPM for the LEBT is not different from NPM designed for other sections of the ESS linac, however, it received the requirement to measure the position of the beam accurately with respect to the centre of the vacuum chamber, representing the reference orbit. This particular requirement led to implement a specific design to provide absolute position measurement to the system. In the following we will first describe the design and the associated functionalities, and then we will present the performance measurements of this built system, fully integrated into the control system. Finally we will discuss the performance in comparison to the initial requirements. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",
