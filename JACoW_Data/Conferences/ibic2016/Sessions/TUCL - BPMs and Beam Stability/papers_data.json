        "and software domains. The recently added capability to resolve the orbits of multiple bunches within a turn as well as further improvement in transverse positional resolution for single- and few-bunch fills [*] allowed us to perform a number of novel beam dynamics measurements. These include measuring small impedances of vacuum chamber components",
        "and of extremely small (~10-5) current-dependent tune shifts (transverse and synchrotron)",
        "as well as obtaining an amplitude-dependent tune shift curve from a single kicker pulse. We are also effectively utilizing our BPMs to decipher the lifetimes of individual bunches and to visualize single bunch instability dynamics. In this paper we review the unique capabilities of NSLS-II BPMs and present examples of beam physics measurements that greatly benefit from them.",
