        "RF cavities have been designed and constructed that simultaneously and exclusively resonate many harmonic TMono modes. These modes are axially symmetric and have their electric field maximum along the cavities bore. A periodic beam passing through a harmonic cavities bore excites these modes whose superposition can be measured at the cavities antenna with a sampling oscilloscope. Processing the detected waveform with the harmonic cavities transfer function yields the Fourier series of the beam",
        "and a near real-time",
        "non-invasive measurement of the beams longitudinal bunch shape and duration. Experiments have been performed on the 130 kV injector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facilities Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility. The harmonic cavities sensitivity was near 1 mV/μA and measured beam bunches ranging in width from 45 to 150 picoseconds (FWHM). These measurements were in close agreement with measurements made using an invasive bunch measurement system as well as predictions by a particle tracking simulations."
