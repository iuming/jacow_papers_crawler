        "We present with simulations a new method to diagnose the longitudinal phase space of ultrashort electron bunches. It harnesses the strong transverse fields of laser-driven wakefields to streak an electron bunch that is injected off-axis with respect to the driver laser. Owed to the short plasma wavelength and the high field amplitude present in a plasma wakefield",
        "a temporal resolution around or below the femtosecond can be achieved with a plasma length of a few millimeters. We will explore the limitations on the time resolution",
        "the calibration",
        "and the influence of error sources such as beam loading and jitters. Amongst the possible applications are experiments aiming at external injection into laser-driven wakefields",
        "or the diagnostics of laser-plasma accelerated beams."

        "causing a large beam loss. Our study aims for a direct measurement of the betatron tune spread by using a quadrupole kicker and a 4-electrode monitor. The monochromatic rf signal is inputted to the kicker and we induce an oscillation by kicking the beam. The amplitude of the quadrupole oscillation will depend on the number of particles having a certain tune. In the beam test at J-PARC MR",
        "the dipole kicker was used as a quadrupole kicker by exciting the two facing electrodes in-phase. We measured the response to the kick at several frequencies. We observed that the amplitude depends on the kicker frequency and the number of particles per bunch. This demonstrates that the quadrupole oscillation can be induced by a kicker and the possibility of measuring the number of a particular tune particle from the response. We will present the result of the beam test and our prospect and the comparison between the experimental result and a numerical calculation."
