Nowadays several groups and laboratories are operating or developing projects and have become specialists in different accelerator systems. A network named CONECTA has been recently created with the aim of fostering collaboration and coordination at the national level. A general overview of these activities will be presented",
        "with special emphasis on the ALBA Synchrotron",
        "and with a perspective for the future."

        "depending on the number of insertion devices. The diagnostics used during commissioning will be described",
        "with emphasis on the emittance diagnostics This will involve two diagnostic beam lines to image the electron beam with infrared and ultraviolet synchrotron radiation from bending dipoles",
        "in order to determine also beam energy spread. The scheme for horizontal emittance measurements looks promising also for an order of magnitude lower emittance. Bunch lengthening with harmonic cavities is essential for the low emittance machine performance. We have used a radiation based sampling technique to verify individual bunch distributions."
