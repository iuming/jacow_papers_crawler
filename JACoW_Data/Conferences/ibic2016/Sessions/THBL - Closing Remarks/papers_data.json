        "Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) enable fast low-level light detection and even photon counting with a semiconductor device. Thanks to a now matured technology",
        "SiPMs can be used in a variety of applications like: Medical imaging",
        "fluorescence detection",
        "range-finding and high-energy physics. We present different possible application of SiPMs for beam instrumentation. First",
        "we discuss timing properties of SiPMs",
        "and how to optimize them for high rate environments enabling photon counting. This requires to understand the dependence of SiPM pulse shape on its configuration (total area",
        "cell size",
        "capacitances",
        "etc) and analyse dedicated front end electronics techniques. Finally",
        "based on the experience of several projects aiming to develop trackers for high energy physics",
        "we present some ideas to develop beam monitoring instrumentation based scintillating fibers coupled to SiPMs",
        "where radiation hardness of scintillating fibers can be an important concern."
