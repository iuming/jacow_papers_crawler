        "with a peak brightness ten orders of magnitude higher than conventional synchrotron radiation sources. Much like conventional lasers",
        "XFELs are extremely flexible machines and the properties of the x-rays can be controlled by accurately manipulating the lasing medium",
        "i.e. the electron beam. In my talk I will discuss past and present research on shaping the temporal properties of the x-rays at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). I will discuss the two-color FEL modes and their applications in user experiments. Finally I will present our results on laser-shaping of x-ray pulses and our plans for attosecond operation in the soft x-ray regime."
