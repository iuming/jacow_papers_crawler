        "The effects of energy chirp and undulator taper in FELs and applications of these effects in different schemes are discussed. This includes an operation of FEL oscillators with reverse-tapered undulators; energy chirp effects in high-gain",
        "short wavelength FELs like FLASH; compensation of the energy chirp by the undulator taper in high-gain FELs and the application of this effect for generation of attosecond X-ray pulses; reverse taper in high-gain FELs for circular polarization production and for an efficient",
        "background-free harmonic generation. Some new ideas are briefly described such as strongly chirped X-ray pulses",
        "an enhanced X-ray pulse compression",
        "few-cycle hard X-ray pulses etc."

        "The most simple and robust technique for production of short wavelength radiation is Self Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) FEL. Amplification process in SASE FELs develops from the shot noise in the electron beam",
        "and powerful radiation is produced by single pass of the electron beam through the undulator. Serving as a seed",
        "shot noise effects impose fundamental limits on the coherence properties of the radiation (both",
        "temporal and spatial). FEL theory reached mature status allowing elegant description of the shot noise phenomena",
        "and in this report we present relevant overview."
