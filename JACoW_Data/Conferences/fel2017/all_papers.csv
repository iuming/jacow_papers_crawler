fel2017,,MOBA01,Energy Chirp and Undulator Taper in FELs,DESY; Hamburg; Germany; The effects of energy chirp and undulator taper in FELs and applications of these effects in different schemes are discussed. This includes an operation of FEL oscillators with reverse-tapered undulators; energy chirp effects in high-gain; short wavelength FELs like FLASH; compensation of the energy chirp by the undulator taper in high-gain FELs and the application of this effect for generation of attosecond X-ray pulses; reverse taper in high-gain FELs for circular polarization production and for an efficient; background-free harmonic generation. Some new ideas are briefly described such as strongly chirped X-ray pulses; an enhanced X-ray pulse compression; few-cycle hard X-ray pulses etc.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/talks/moba01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/papers/moba01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/posters/moba01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FEL2017-MOBA01,
fel2017,,MOBA02,Coherence Limits of X-ray FEL Radiation,M.V. Yurkov; E. Schneidmiller; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; The most simple and robust technique for production of short wavelength radiation is Self Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) FEL. Amplification process in SASE FELs develops from the shot noise in the electron beam; and powerful radiation is produced by single pass of the electron beam through the undulator. Serving as a seed; shot noise effects impose fundamental limits on the coherence properties of the radiation (both; temporal and spatial). FEL theory reached mature status allowing elegant description of the shot noise phenomena; and in this report we present relevant overview.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/talks/moba02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/papers/moba02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/posters/moba02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FEL2017-MOBA02,5
fel2017,,MOBB01,Harmonic Lasing & Gain Cascading: More Efficient X-Ray Free Electron Laser Oscillators,SINAP; Shanghai; People's Republic of China; In this talk; I will focus on the recent theoretical progresses on X-ray free-electron laser oscillator (XFELO). A simplified one-dimensional theoretical model for fast XFELO optimization; harmonic lasing XFELO scheme which reduces the requiered beam energy for a interested radiation wavelength; and the gain-cascading scheme which may increase the pulse energy and the peak power of XFELO will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/talks/mobb01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/papers/mobb01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/posters/mobb01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FEL2017-MOBB01,
fel2017,,MOBB02,Temporal and Spatial Shaping of X-Ray Free-Electron Lasers,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; The x-ray free-electron laser is the brightest source of x-rays; with a peak brightness ten orders of magnitude higher than conventional synchrotron radiation sources. Much like conventional lasers; XFELs are extremely flexible machines and the properties of the x-rays can be controlled by accurately manipulating the lasing medium; i.e. the electron beam. In my talk I will discuss past and present research on shaping the temporal properties of the x-rays at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). I will discuss the two-color FEL modes and their applications in user experiments. Finally I will present our results on laser-shaping of x-ray pulses and our plans for attosecond operation in the soft x-ray regime.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/talks/mobb02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/papers/mobb02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/fel2017/posters/mobb02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-FEL2017-MOBB02,
