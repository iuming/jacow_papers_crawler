        "intra-beam scattering or space charge in hadron and lepton rings. The necessary steps are reviewed for designing the optics of high-intensity and high-brightness synchrotrons but also ultra-low emittance lepton storage rings",
        "whose performance is strongly dominated by collective effects. Particular emphasis is given to proposed and existing designs illustrated by simulations and beam measurements."
