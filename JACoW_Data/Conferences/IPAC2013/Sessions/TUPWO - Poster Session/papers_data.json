        "the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory. A new 5BA lattice was designed in replacement for the previous TBA lattice with the aim to reduce the emittance to sub-nm.rad values. The new design has a circumference of 518 m with 20 achromatic straight sections and a natural emittance of 0.28 nm.rad at 3 GeV for the bare lattice (without IDs). The dipoles combine low 0.58 T field magnets for the main beam deflection with a 2 T short superbend magnet sandwiched in the center dipole. This creates a longitudinal dipole gradient that is used both to lower the emittance and to provide hard X-ray dipole sources."

A preliminary solution using a pair of bipolar kickers to route the beam onto the targets at a repetition rate of 50 Hz (12.5 Hz per beam line) is proposed. Compensating dipoles would apply symmetry in the system. Magnetic fields induced by these optical elements would not exceed 0.96 T. Studies of the beam envelopes with the code TRANSPORT suggest the use of three quadrupoles per beam line located after the dipoles to focus the 4 mm σ beam onto each target. The length of this switchyard system is estimated to be 29.9 m and 3 m radius.",

The divergence in the range of one milli-radian at energies of some 100 MeV calls for strong focusing magnets.

        "which enables top-up operation",
        "the injected beam energy is displaced from the ring energy. The finite dispersion of 1.1 m at the injection point and the energy displacement of 0.7% reduce the betatron oscillation amplitude of the injected beam. A trade off is a synchrotron oscillation produced by the energy mismatch. Using this technique",
        "it became possible to inject new beam using a closed fast injection bump and also a top-up operation. Although it is not possible to inject beam to a normal achromatic lattice using a closed bump. Especially in non-achromatic quasi-isochronous ring",
        "it would be possible that the energy mismatch is reduced by the betatron amplitude dependent shift of the equilibrium energy."

In beam tuning towards the goal beam size, the presence of a tilt of the IP Shintake monitor fringe pattern with respect to the x-y coordinate system of the beam can break the orthogonality in the main σ34 and σ32 waist corrections required to reduce the vertical beam size at IP. Concerning the method of doing αx scan and measuring the vertical beam size to diagnose the IPBSM fringe tilt or residual σ13, one thing should be studied is to check what could break the orthogonality of the αx knob other than σ13 and the IPBSM fringe tilt. In this paper, we report on the simulation study that check for the breaking of orthogonality of the αx knob in the presence of gradient and coupling errors; to what extent this breaking of orthogonality can go; and also calculate the IPBSM fringe tilt angle from experiment results.",

        "the injected EMMA beam was further studied. This entails the continuation of the exploration of the large transverse and longitudinal acceptance and the effects of slower integer tune crossing on the betatron amplitude. A single closed orbit correction that is effective at multiple momenta (and hence over a significant range in tune space) was implemented. A comparison with a detailed model based on measured field maps",

These recent results together with more practical improvements such as injection orbit matching with real-time monitoring of the coordinates in the transverse phase space will be reported in this paper."

        "The FACET accelerator facility is designed to provide short and intense e- or e+ bunches with small spot size for plasma wakefield accelerator research and other experiments. It is based on the SLAC linac with a compressor chicane in sector-10",
        "and a second compressor chicane and final focus in sector-20 (S20). Originally",
        "the S20 chicane was designed to be compatible with an upgrade to include a second S20 chicane for simultaneous transport of e- and e+ bunches. This placed additional optics constraints which lead to strong focusing in the S20 chicane. The latter increases the effects of errors causing emittance growth. Lately",
        "it has been decided not to proceed with the upgrade option. Therefore",
        "there is a potential for improving the optics by relaxing the constraints. In this study",
        "we explore alternative optics designs where beta functions in the S20 chicane and final focus are reduced in order to minimize the error effects. The optics and non-linear aberrations are evaluated",
        "and the chromatic correction is optimized for each design. Beam tracking simulations are performed using Elegant and Lucretia. The most optimal designs are identified based on these simulations."

      "abstract": "The high quality of the RHIC turn-by-turn (TbT) data obtained from the beam position monitor (BPM) system was fully exploited by using two analysis approaches. One is a time domain least square fitting technique and the other one is a frequency domain interpolated Fourier Transform technique. Both methods were applied to 1024-turn data from kicked beam and from continuous coherent excitation experiments. The betatron phase precisions obtained with both methods were ~0.1 degree for the continuous excitation and ~0.2 degree for the impulse excitation. The algorithms of these two analyses and comparison of their results will be presented in this report.",

        "At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL the physics program includes collisions between beams of polarized protons at high beam energies. Maintaining the proton's polarization is vital and preserved primarily by application of a pair of Siberian snakes. Measurements from recent high-energy physics runs indicate polarization loss during acceleration between 100 and 250 GeV. Based on analytic estimations for off-momentum particles and/or beams",
        "a nonzero difference in DX prime - the dispersion function angle - between the snakes can result in a shift in the spin tune",
        "or equivalently",
        "of the conditions of snake resonances in close proximity to the beam during acceleration. Requiring that DX prime at the two Siberian snakes in RHIC being equal would reduce the spin tune shift for off-energy particles so helping to maintain polarization during the energy ramp. Preservation of half-integer spin tune is also important for future operation of the spin flipper at store. In this report",
        "the matching scheme and simulations using MAD-X will be presented together with a newly applied method based on response matrices."
