It is foreseen to build a new cw-heavy ion-linac behind this high charge state injector. In preparation an advanced R&D program is defined: The first linac section comprising a sc CH-cavity embedded by two sc solenoids (financed by HIM and partly by HGF-ARD-initiative) as a demonstrator will be tested in 2014). After successfull testing an advanced cryomodule comprising up to 4 rf cavities is foreseen. First layout scenarios of this advanced test bench will be presented."

Since the constant-envelop setting here for the frequency jump is away from equi-partitioning and close to the resonances kz=3kx",

The second point is the sensitivity of these lattices vs. errors. The third is about the criterion of mismatch in the presence of emittance exchange. When emittance exchange is serious the mismatch can be unavoidable. So it is crucial to ensure the settings are in the safe region free from un-controlled mismatch."

        "Next-generation in-flight RI beam facilities such as RIBF and FRIB pursue powerful and energetic 238U ion beams to produce thousands of new isotopes. For their efficient acceleration",
        "a durable electron stripper in the intermediate energy region around 10-20 MeV/u is indispensable. However",
        "there is no available stripper for the U beams with the intensity of more than 1 puA so far because of the lifetime problem of thin solid strippers caused by high energy loss. 　In the present study",
        "a novel electron stripping system employing high-flow rate He gas circulation (200 L/min) has been developed. He gas with the thickness of 0.6 mg/cm2 is confined and separated from beamline vacuum using five-stage differentially-pumped sections. To avoid huge gas consumption",
        "a clean gas recycling is achieved with multi-stage mechanical booster pump array. The recycling rate of He gas was achieved as more than 99%. The system was successfully operated in user runs with U35+ beams more than 1 puA injected at 10.8 MeV/u for the first time. U64+ beams were stably delivered to subsequent accelerators with the stripping efficiency of 23% without any deterioration of the system."

Total RF power of 320 kW has to be delivered into the RFQ cavity. For reliable operation, four input couplers are adopted to share the driven power. A coaxial loop type input coupler is developed. The coupler features a Tristan type RF window, a doorknob to realize the transition from a half-height WR2300 waveguide to a coaxial line and a coaxial line with a coupling antenna loop. Two prototypes of the window and inner conductor assemblies have been fabricated and received high power test. The prototypes were tested up to 100 kW CW RF power in traveling wave mode. This paper will describe the design, fabrication and high power test of the coupler in details.",

The peak flux of the ESS can be enhanced by placing an accumulator ring at the end of the linac.
