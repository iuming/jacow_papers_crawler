        "which consists of tails extending far beyond the Gaussian core of the beam. At present there is no dedicated collimation for the beam halo at ATF2",
        "and the transverse distribution near the interaction point is not well known. The development of a sensor based on CVD diamond to scan the beam halo in the vacuum chamber a few meters after the interaction point is presented. This system also aims to detect the Compton recoil electrons generated by the laser interferometer (Shintake monitor) used to measure the beam size at the interaction point of ATF2."

Fast luminosity measurements are needed as input to luminosity optimization and feedback in the presence of dynamic imperfections. The required small relative precision can be reached exploiting the very large cross section of the radiative Bhabha process at zero photon scattering angle. The instrumental technique selected to sustain the large particle fluxes is based on diamond sensors to be positioned via moveable stages immediately outside the beam pipe",

The installation of such a near-field setup changes the impedance of the storage ring and the corresponding effects have to be studied carefully. One possibility is to use numerical codes for simulating the wakefields induced by the setup. Such simulations has been done using the wakefield solver implemented in the CST Studio Suite. In this paper we present the simulation results together with first measurements.",

Electron beam extracted from the RF Gun is accelerated to 40 MeV by two superconducting cavities. Cavity alignment requirements for ILC are less than 300um offset and 300urad tilt with respect to cryomodule. It is necessary to measure their offset and tilt inside of cryomodule. Cavity offset has been already measured by using beam induced HOM at FLASH in DESY. Cavity deformation during assembly and by cooling contraction has not been examined yet. We measured HOM signals to detect their tilt and bending. TE111-6 which has high impedance is used to estimate cavity offset. To find cavity tilt and bending",

To protect the superconducting magnets of the high luminosity insertions an optimal detection of the energy deposition by the shower of beam particles is necessary. Therefore beam Loss Monitors (BLM) need to be placed close to the particle impact location in the cold mass of the magnets where they should operate in superfluid helium at 1.9 Kelvin. To choose optimal detectors n-type silicon wafers have been examined at superfluid helium temperature whilst under irradiation from a high intensity proton beam. The radiation hardness and leakage current of these detectors were found to be significantly improved at 1.9 Kelvin when compared to their operation at room temperature.",

The final setup will consist in replacing the energy variable part of the normal conducting REX post-accelerator with superconducting cavities. In order to preserve the beam emittance",
        "the drift space between the cryomodules housing these cavities has been kept to a minimum. As a consequence",

        "We present a novel method for the measurement of Linac beam parameters in the longitudinal phase space. The longitudinal momentum spread can be evaluated by means of Schottky type signal analysis of bunched beams. There is a close similarity between a repetitive Linac bunch train and a circulating beam with a single short batch in a large machine like the LHC. A dedicated longitudinal cavity pick-up was used in the Linac where resonance frequency and Q-value were carefully selected in order to get an optimum compromise between the unavoidable coherent signal and the desired incoherent part of the beam spectrum. A time domain gating similar to the 4.8 GHz LHC Schottky front-end is applied. As a cross-check of the validity of the interpretation in terms of momentum spread",
        "the Linac beam is analyzed in the downstream synchrotron using standard Schottky methods. In principle",
        "this approach can be understood as an extension of Schottky analysis for circular machines with a perfect “mixing” between subsequent bunch trains. This contribution describes the test set-up and discusses the results of the measurements with a heavy ion beam."

The polarities of the MCSSX skew sextupoles in IR 1 and the MCSX normal sextupoles in IR 5 were checked by measuring the tune shift due to a magnet trim. Comparison of measurements with model predictions indicates that the polarities of the octupoles and the IR sextupoles are correct",
