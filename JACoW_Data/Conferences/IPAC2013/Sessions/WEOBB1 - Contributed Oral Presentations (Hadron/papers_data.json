        "The development of the Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex (KOMAC) accelerator facility was finished and went into the operation period from 2013. The facility consists of an 100-MeV proton linac including a 50-keV ion source",
        "a 3-MeV RFQ",
        "and a 100-MeV DTL",
        "and 20-MeV and 100-MeV beam lines. The linac and beam lines were developed by the Proton Engineering Frontier Project (PEFP)",
        "the first phase of KOMAC from 2002 to 2012. The goal of the beam commissioning is delivering 100-MeV 1-kW proton beams to a beam bump in a 100-MeV target room. After finishing the commissioning",
        "the user beam service will start from spring 2013. The KOMAC user facility consists of 2 beam lines in the initial operation stage and it will be increased to 10 beam lines in future. The one beam line is for 20-MeV proton beams which are extracted after 20-MeV part of the DTL tanks. A medium energy beam transport (MEBT) is installed there for the 20-MeV beam extraction and the beam matching to the next DTL tank. The other beam line is for 100-MeV proton beams. This work summarized the status of the KOMAC accelerator and beam lines."
