        "A significant improvement of Q0 to values larger than 3.2x1010 at 1.8K has been repeatedly achieved in an SRF cavity by thermal cycling",
        "i.e. heating the cavity briefly above transition temperature and subsequent cooling. Conceivable explanations for this effect reach from effectivity deviations of the magnetic shielding to thermal currents to hydrogen diffusion. Experimental We have experimentally verified some of these explanations",
        "leaving a direct impact of cooling dynamics on frozen flux as the most plausible one. The pathway to this finding is being presented and the application to SRF systems is elicited."

        "Previously Cornell University developed Oscillating Superleak Transducers (OST) to locate quench spots on superconducting cavities in superfluid helium. This work builds upon this research and presents a technique to automatically visualize quench locations from OST data [1]. This system is now fully automated. The current system consists of between 8 and 16 OSTs",
        "a high gain low noise preamplifier",
        "and a data acquisition card that can log up to 16 simultaneously recorded inputs. The developed software allows computing quench locations on various cavity geometries",
        "adjustment of the location of each OST and a choice between several quench finding algorithms. Observed results are in excellent agreement with optical inspection and temperature map data."
