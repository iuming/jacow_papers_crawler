        "The unique facility for Antiproton and Ion Research â€“ FAIR will deliver stable and rare isotope beams covering a huge range of intensities and beam energies. In addition",
        "the beams for the experiments will have highest beam quality for a cutting edge physics program. Therefore a unique accelerator facility using cutting edge technology will be built until 2018. The challenges are heavy ion synchrotrons for highest intensities",
        "antiproton and rare isotope production stations",
        "high resolution separators and several storage rings where beam cooling can be applied. Here new kind of superconducting magnets",
        "rf-systems",
        "injection and extraction systems and beam diagnostics will be applied. As the construction of the FAIR facility and procurement has started",
        "an overview of the designs",
        "procurements status and infrastructure preparation will be provided."
