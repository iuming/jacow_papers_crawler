        "In May 2012 the Australian Synchrotron commenced Top-Up Operations for User beamtime. The facility was designed for top-up from the start with a full energy 3 GeV injection system",
        "however top-up only became a priority once the beamline user community had established itself at the new facility in operation since April 2007. New beam diagnostic and equipment protections systems were implemented as part of the move to top-up",
        "including a new injection efficiency monitoring system. The effect of top-up on the beamline data was also tested with each beamline prior to engaging top-up during user runs. Top-up has now been running successfully for one year and the performance statistics from this period will be presented. Top-up operations is a very popular standard mode for user beam and falling into decay mode is now treated almost as a beam dump."

        "The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) is presently midway through the Upgrade Programme Phase I (2009-2015), which concerns its infrastructure, beamlines and X-ray source. This paper reports on the present operation performance of the source, highlighting the more recent developments. In this context, 8 insertion device straight sections have been lengthened from five to six metres; two of them operating with canted undulators. The lattice of one cell has been modified for a further increase to 7 metres allowing the test of a mini beta optics and latter the distribution of cavities. A second cryogenic permanent magnet undulator has been completed, which gives a factor of more than 2 in flux at high energy. The booster klystron-based radio frequency transmitter has been replaced by high power solid state amplifiers. Out of three prototypes of HOM damped cavities working at room temperature which have been received and tested, one has been successfully commissioned with beam. Subsequent to the upgrade of the beam position monitor system, a new orbit feedback has substantially reduced the orbit distortion induced by ID gap motions."

To realize a compact and multi-purpose applicable design",

The produced electron beam has a length of 10cm in ion beam direction and a width of around 5mm in the interaction region with densities of ~109electrons/cm3. The target geometry allows the independent adjustment of the electron beam current and energy in the region of several 10eV and a few keV. The setup meets the high requirements for an operation in the UHV environment of a storage ring and is installed applying the so-called animated beam technique. The electron target is dedicated to the FAIR storage rings. First measurements have been performed at a test bench.

The design work on pickup and kicker is now finished and the production of the first cooling tank has been started. The whole system layout will be presented taking into account new additional requirements concerning the accumulation and the cooling of heavy ions. All beam-coupling structures are nearly identical and contain several ring-slot blocks. These blocks consist of eight wall-current monitors coupled out by eight electrodes each. Most of the signal combining and splitting take place within the vacuum envelope to reduce the number of vacuum RF feed throughs. The long-distance transmission of the signals and the filters containing long signal delays work with near infrared optical elements."

In the HESR the 2 MeV electron cooler is prepared with the maximal electron current of 3 A and the cooling length of 2.7 m. The electron cooling process of typically 238U92+ beam is simulated for the Hydogen and Xe internal target with simultaneous use of barrier voltage to compensate the mean energy loss caused by the interaction with internal target.

A bare uranium beam is injected from the collector ring CR into the HESR at 740 MeV/u. The beam preparation for an internal target experiment with cooling is outlined. The acceleration of the ion beam to 2 GeV/u is studied under the basic condition of the available cavity voltages and the maximum magnetic field ramp rate in the HESR. The cooling simulations include the beam-target interaction due to a Hydrogen and Xenon target. Diffusion due to Schottky and thermal noise as well as intra beam scattering is accounted for. Due to the higher charge states of the ions Schottky particle noise power becomes an important issue. The analysis considers the electronic power limitation to 500 W in case of momentum cooling. Fast Filter cooling is only available if the revolution harmonics do not overlap in the cooling bandwidth. Since overlap occurs for lower energies the application of the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) momentum cooling method is discussed.",

Besides that the insertion of an undulator with very short period up to 7 mm is planed. We studied an influence of the insertion devices on the dynamic aperture using new computer code which permits to find an electron beam trajectory in ID by Runge-Kutta integrator. Using two independent approaches it was shown that ID introduces the nonlinear components of magnetic field which lead to significant decrease of dynamic aperture in vertical direction. Nonlinear components of ID magnetic field are shown. Results of numerical calculation of Siberia-2 dynamic aperture are presented as well.",

A combination of local orbit distortions and horizontal scraper measurements pinpointed the location of the horizontal aperture restriction to the center of the main cavity straight section. The aperture restriction was determined to be located 10.4 ± 0.3 mm from the beam center. The precise result was achieved by measurements and calculations of the Touschek lifetime as a function of the main cavity voltage. Realignment of the main cavity increased the average lattice momentum acceptance from 0.0116 ± 0.0003 to 0.0158 ± 0.0003 and the horizontal acceptance from 26 ± 2 × 10-6 m to larger than 44 ± 2 × 10-6 m.

The optics solutions obtained so far using a Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) increase the dispersion and the horizontal beta function in the straight section. While the emittance can be reduced to 2.1 nm this optics is limited by the operation of high field superconducting wiggler devices. In this report we present details of the new optics and present results of practical tests. We also compare the theoretical emittance growth due to a wiggler in a dispersive region with test results.",
