        "Essential properties of radiation from storage rings and FELs include spatial- and temporal beam brightness and coherence. Starting from a fundamental representation of the electron beam as a radiating source the electromagnetic power can be represented as modes in phase-space to characterize beam quality. For storage rings",
        "conditions for transverse coherence are possible which can lead to high-resolution imaging under a variety of polarization conditions. For FELs the radiation brightness is over 10 orders of magnitude higher with finite temporal coherence times and much of the total FEL power contained in the dominant mode. This presentation should provide an overview of the above."
