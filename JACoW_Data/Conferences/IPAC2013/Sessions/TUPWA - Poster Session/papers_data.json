A series of beam based measurements have been developed at the Australian Synchrotron to accurately quantify quadrupole and sextupole alignments errors which cause coupling and where possible",
        "correct them. Results showing an reduction in emittance coupling due to realignments of magnets based on these measurements will be presented. Limitations and general applicability of this method will also be discussed."

In this concept a smooth and very well conductimg surface with low microwave losses is maintained",

        "Electron cooling has the potential to compensate the emittance growth of the circulating ion beam due to intra-beam scattering at low energy. A test of electron cooling for RHIC low energy operations has been planned at IP2. Apart from the wakefield from the environment",
        "the coherent interaction between the electron beam and ion beam could also play a role for the instability threshold. This work presents studies of ion beam stabilities in presence of coherent electron-ion interactions for the planned low energy RHIC electron-cooling test using the simulation code TRANFT."
