        "the longitudinal dispersion should be non-zero in some arcs of the accelerator. However small deviations in voltages of the accelerating structures can be enhanced by induced fields from circulating bunches due to the dependence of the flight time on the energy spread and the high quality factor of the superconducting radio-frequency cavities. Therefore",

Stability conditions for the interactions with fundamental accelerating mode of the split accelerating system are discussed. Numerical simulations are made for two projects - MARS and FSF."

        "A high current beam transmission test has been successfully completed at the JLAB FEL Facility",
        "culminating in very low-loss transmission of a high current CW beam through a small aperture. The purpose of this test was to determine if an ERL is capable of meeting the stringent requirements imposed by the use of a 1018/cm3 internal gas target proposed for the DarkLight experiment*. Minimal beamline modifications were made to create a machine configuration that is substantially different from those used in routine UV or IR FEL operation. A sustained (8 hour) high power beam run was performed",
        "with clean transmission through a 2 mm transverse aperture of 127 mm length simulating the target configuration. A beam size of 50 um (rms) was measured near the center of the aperture. Experimental data from a week-long test run consistently exhibited beam loss of only a few ppm on the aperture while running 4.5 mA current at 100 MeV – or nearly 0.5 MW beam power. This surpassed the users’ expectation and demonstrated a unique capability of an ERL for this type of experiments. This report presents a summary of the experiment",
