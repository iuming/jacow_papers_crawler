        "High-current high-energy particle beams can be generated at high repetition rates with good electrical efficiency making them well suited as drivers for wakefield accelerators. High-gradient wakefield accelerators operating with multi-GeV/m fields use dielectrics and plasmas as energy transformers to convert these high-current low-energy beams to relatively low-current high-energy beams in a short distance with high electrical efficiency. Further",
        "the high-frequencies and compact dimensions of these accelerators naturally result in high-brightness beams with potential applications in future light sources and colliders. The latest results in beam-driven dielectric and plasma acceleration will be reviewed",
        "with particular emphasis on recent results from the FACET facility at SLAC. Prospects for future developments",
        "including proton driven plasma wakefield accelerations experiments at CERN will also be discussed."
