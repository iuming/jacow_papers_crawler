In order to be able to offer higher external beam currents one has to increase the current of the internal beam in ELSA accordingly. The beam current is limited due to excitation of multi bunch instabilities which are mainly caused by higher order modes of the two PETRA cavities used for particle acceleration in the stretcher ring. To control the resonance frequency of these modes",

The frequency choice of L-band is based on the larger transverse and longitudinal acceptances than those of the S-band one. The load is preferable to compose the system with compact magnets and to minimize the dip in the solenoid field. The design of the load was reported in previous work*. We understand that the Kanthal-coated cell should be confirmed in high power to confirm the feasibility at our design field of 10 MV/m level. We are making a test cavity which consists of 3 cells and one of them is composed of Kanthal-coated disks to lower the intrinsic Q value from 20000 to the order of 1000.

We lowered the core winding tension in order to improve the electrical insulation between MA ribbon layers. The lower winding tension reduced the core filling factor that is defined as the volume ratio of MA ribbons and geometrical dimensions. The core shunt impedance might be reduced according to the core filling factor reduction. We discuss the reason why the lower winding tension increased the core shunt impedance.

      "abstract": "Current designs for muon cooling channels require high-gradient RF cavities to be placed in solenoidal magnetic fields in order to contain muons with large transverse emittances. It has been found that doing so reduces the threshold at which RF cavity breakdown occurs. To aid the effort to study RF cavity breakdown in magnetic fields it would be helpful to have a diagnostic tool which can detect breakdown and localize the source of the breakdown inside the cavity. We report here on progress towards developing a diagnostic tool for detecting and localizing sparks in an RF cavity by using piezoelectric transducers.",
