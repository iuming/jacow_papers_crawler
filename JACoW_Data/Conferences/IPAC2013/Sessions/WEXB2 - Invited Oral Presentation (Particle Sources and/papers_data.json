        "With increase of applications of heavy ions in the various fields",
        "production of intense beam of highly charged heavy ions form the ion sources become more and more important. For example",
        "ion sources are required to produce intense dc beams of the highly charged heavy ions for the accelerator facilities of radio isotope beam production and the intense short pulsed beams for injection into synchrotrons. Additionally",
        "in these applications",
        "the ion sources face several important matters to be improved for meeting the requirements",
        "such as source lifetime",
        "reliability",
        "current stability",
        "and beam emittance. For these purposes",
        "several high performance ion sources",
        "which include ECR ion sources",
        "electron beam ion sources and laser ion sources",
        "for production of the intense beam (dc and pulsed) of highly charged heavy ions have been constructed and achieved remarkable breakthrough in the past decade. In this contribution",
        "state-of-the-art ion sources for production of intense highly charged heavy ion beams are reviewed. Future perspective is also discussed."
