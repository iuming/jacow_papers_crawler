        "Ultra cold neutrons (UCN) - neutrons with energies less than 300 neV - can be accelerated or decelerated by means of static magnetic and RF fields. Neutron have a magnetic dipole moment",
        "and hence their kinetic energies vary depending on their spin in magnetic fields. Their kinetic energies are restored when they get out from the magnetic field area if their spin did not flip. A spin flip can be triggered by applying an RF field whose frequency coincides with the spin precession frequency of a neutron in this magnetic field. This allows to tune the kinetic energy of neutrons. This method can be used to rebunch a pulsed beam of neutrons to a storage bottle that can store UCN. By open and close the storage bottle synchronously with the rebuncher",
        "high UCN densities can be achieved for precision measurements of neutron properties such as the Electric Dipole Moment. The method and experimental setup are described in detail and the results of a recent first test experiments are presented."

        "conventional CPA technology is quite hard to get less than 30fs at high energy level. Non-collinear optical parametric amplification (NOPA) looks more and more attractive for generating super-broadbandwidth pulses which is possible to be compressed to ultra-short pulses. Previous NOPAs",
        "pumped by 400nm pulses",
        "were using BBO crystals to reach shorter signal pulse durations. But the associated spectral bandwidths are still strongly linked with higher order nonlinear effects. which make it quite difficult to get higher energy with short pulse duration. Here we proposed to use pre-chirped few nm bandwidths around 515nm pumped pulses to amplify ultra-short pulses centered at 800nm. In our setup",
        "we have found just one dramatical geometry configuration which support that we have possibility to get amplification from 720nm to 900nm",
        "which will support to less than 10fs by well re-compression. This design is well adapted for BBO crystals. But the idea could be used also for other crystals."

        "The understanding of the self-modulation (SMI) and hosing (HI) instabilities is critical for the success of the upcoming proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiments at CERN*. The use of long SLAC electron and positron bunches provides the possibility of understanding experimentally the interplay between SMI and HI. In this work we perform particle-in-cell simulations with the code OSIRIS with parameters that will be available for experiments at SLAC in 2013. We show that the SMI of 20 GeV lepton bunches can grow and saturate in less than 15 cm. Up to 8 GeV energy gain/loss could be observed after a meter long plasma. The HI can also be effectively mitigated by seeding the SMI using bunches with short rise times**. We also show analytically and numerically that in the linear regime and after saturation of the SMI the HI can be suppressed by a plasma-BNS damping analogue. Several diagnostics that could be used in experiments to measure the SMI development and these effects are also explored."

These devices come in a variety of configurations but share the use of lasers as power sources and dielectrics as the primary building material. While these devices have many of the same characteristics and dynamics as conventional accelerating structures",
        "they operate in a dramatically different regime. One version of these DLAs is the Micro Accelerator Platform (MAP): a slab-symmetric device operated with a standing wave (Pi-mode) and powered by a transversely coupled laser. The coupler is essentially a transmissive diffraction grating and therefore reinforced the desired mode. The remainder of the structure is composed of two Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) which serve to form a resonant cavity in an evacuated bounded by the reflectors. The MAP has now undergone experimental testing at SLAC’s E-163. As with many advanced accelerators",
        "identifying the best data analysis approach demands extensive numerical modelling of the anticipated beam parameters and development of data visualization tools. We present the latest numerical results and data analysis tools developed for dielectric laser acceleration experiments with MAP."

        "we have successfully delivered femtosecond x-ray pulses to the users with two operating modes – low-charge (20-40pC) scheme and emittance spoiling foil method. Diagnostics on the femtosecond beams is also a challenging topic and good progresses have been made at LCLS. In this paper we report the experimental studies on the two femtosecond operation schemes",

        "Efforts by numerous institutions have been ongoing over the past decade to develop a Dielectric-Loaded Accelerating (DLA) structure capable of supporting high gradient acceleration when driven by an external rf source. Multipactor is the major issue limiting the gradient that was revealed in earlier experiments. A theoretical model predicts that the strength of solenoid field within an optimal range applied to DLA structures may completely block the multipactor. To demonstrate this approach",
        "two DLA test structures have been built and the first high power test will be conducted in December 2012. The results will be reported."
