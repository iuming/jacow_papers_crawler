        "Following the high integrated luminosity accumulated in the first two Pb-Pb collision runs in 2010 and 2011",
        "the LHC heavy-ion physics community requested a first run with p-Pb collisions. This almost unprecedented mode of collider operation was not foreseen in the baseline design of the LHC whose two-in-one magnet design imposed equal rigidity and",
        "hence",
        "unequal revolution frequencies",
        "during injection and ramp. Nevertheless",
        "after a successful pilot physics fill in 2012",
        "the LHC provided 31 nb-1 of p-Pb luminosity per experiment",
        "at an energy of 5.02 TeV per colliding nucleon pair",
        "with several variations of the operating conditions",
        "in early 2013. Together with a companion p-p run at 2.76 TeV",
        "this was the last physics before the present long shutdown. We summarise the beam physics",
        "operational adaptations and strategy that resulted in extremely rapid commissioning. Finally",
        "we give an account of the progress of the run and provide an analysis of the performance."

        "The CERN Large Hadron Collider is routinely storing proton beam intensities of more than 100 MJ",
        "which puts extraordinary demands on the control of beam losses to avoid quenches of the superconducting magnets. Therefore",
        "a detailed understanding of the LHC beam cleaning is required. We present tracking and shower simulations of the LHC's multi-stage collimation system and compare with measured beam losses",
        "which allow us to conclude on the predictive power of the simulations."

        "A facility producing neutrinos from muons that decay in a storage ring can provide an extremely well understood neutrino beam for oscillation physics and the search for sterile neutrinos. The \"neutrinos from STORed Muons\"(nuSTORM) facility is based on this idea. The facility includes a target station with secondary particle collection",

This paper reports a detailed description of the proposed injection scheme with full G4beamline simulations. We also present progresses on possible design options for a muon racetrack decay ring."
