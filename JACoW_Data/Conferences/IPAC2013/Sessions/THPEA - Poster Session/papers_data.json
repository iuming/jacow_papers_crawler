This method is based on an ARM and DSP co-operation system. The control algorithm of this method is based on a data structure which is defined and implemented in the DSP module. Output data is created by the control algorithm and the actually pulse output is triggered by a timer which is achieved through a logic circuit actualized in a FPGA chip. The results show that the method is flexible and the control system matches the chopper regulating requirements."

        "Experience with LHC machine protection (MP) during the last three years of operation shows that the MP systems sufficiently protect the LHC against damage in case of failures leading to beam losses with a time constant exceeding 1ms. An unexpected fast beam loss mechanism",
        "called UFOs",
        "was observed",
        "which could potentially quench superconducting magnets. For such fast losses",
        "but also for better understanding of slower losses",
        "an improved understanding of the loss distribution within a bunch train is required. Diamond particle detectors with bunch-by-bunch resolution and high dynamic range have been developed and successfully tested in the LHC and in experiments to quantify the damage limits of LHC components. This paper will focus on experience gained in use of diamond detectors. The properties of these detectors were measured during high-fluence material damage tests in CERN's HiRadMat facility. The results will be discussed and compared to the cross-calibration with FLUKA simulations. Future applications of these detectors in the LHC to understand beam losses and to improve the protection against fast particle losses will be discussed."

        "a new chicane with four dipoles and quadrupole triplet magnets were installed in a 44 MeV linac to perform the IAC-RadiaBeam Terahertz (THz) project. To generate high power THz radiation",
        "a THz radiator with numerous periodic gratings was also installed downstream of the quadrupole triplet. However",
        "the electron beam shape at the radiator has to be horizontally focused strip-like one due to a tiny radiator gap with a width of 1.2 mm",
        "and electron bunch length should be about a few picosecond (ps) to generate high power THz radiation in the radiator. By using the quadrupole triplet and chicane dipoles",
        "we can control the transverse beam profile and bunch length freely. In this paper",
        "we report the measured field maps of the dipole and quadrupole magnets",
        "their effective lengths",
        "and field strength or gradient as a function of the magnet power supply current."
