        "The European XFEL is one of the world's largest accelerators presently under construction. The facility includes a 17.5 GeV superconducting linac with more than 3 km of electron beam transport lines and up to 5 FEL undulators. In mid-2013 the underground civil construction will finish. With most of the large scale production in full swing and first accelerator components installed",
        "this talk should present the XFEL facility status and plans for accelerator commissioning including prospects for first XFEL experiments in Hamburg."
