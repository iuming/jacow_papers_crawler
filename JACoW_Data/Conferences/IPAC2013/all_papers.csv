IPAC2013,,MOYCB101,Brightness and Coherence of Synchrotron Radiation and FELs,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Essential properties of radiation from storage rings and FELs include spatial- and temporal beam brightness and coherence. Starting from a fundamental representation of the electron beam as a radiating source the electromagnetic power can be represented as modes in phase-space to characterize beam quality. For storage rings; conditions for transverse coherence are possible which can lead to high-resolution imaging under a variety of polarization conditions. For FELs the radiation brightness is over 10 orders of magnitude higher with finite temporal coherence times and much of the total FEL power contained in the dominant mode. This presentation should provide an overview of the above.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/moycb101_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/moycb101.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/moycb101_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOYCB101,16
IPAC2013,,MOZB101,Progress in High Field Superconducting Magnet Technology for Accelerators,LBNL; Berkeley; California; USA; Next-generation high-energy accelerators are presently under study to complement and expand the physics reach of LHC. The magnet system is a major cost driver for hadron colliders at the energy frontier; and critical to the successful operation of muon colliders. Under most scenarios; magnet design as well as vacuum and cryogenic systems are complicated by high radiation loads. Magnet R&D programs are underway worldwide to take advantage of new developments in superconducting materials; achieve higher efficiency and simplify fabrication while preserving accelerator-class field quality. A review of recent progress in magnet technology is presented; with emphasis on the leading design concepts and fabrication techniques applicable to future accelerators.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mozb101_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mozb101.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mozb101_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOZB101,21
IPAC2013,,MOZB102,Undulator Technologies for Future Free Electron Laser Facilities and Storage Rings,SOLEIL; Gif-sur-Yvette; France; Insertion devices (undulators and wigglers) are key components for high brightness third generation synchrotron sources and for the amplifying medium of free electron lasers. Different technological developments carried out worldwide lead to improved undulator performance. In particular; the advances concerning the in vacuum permanent magnet systems; in particular for short period ones with the operation at cryogenic temperature with NdFeB or PrFeB magnets or for long period ones where in vacuum wigglers will be described. Secondly; progress in Elliptical Polarised Undulators (EPU) will be discussed; such as the DELTA undulator. Recent progress in superconducting undulators will also be reported.

Each magnet yoke contains combined function soft-end dipole and quadrupole elements which are machined out of one single iron block at tolerances of ± 0.02 mm. In addition; separate; higher order multipole magnets are kinematically mounted into the yokes. The integration of many magnetic elements into single yoke structures enables a compact; low emittance storage ring design. The dipole and quadrupole magnetic elements are magnetically field mapped with high precision on a 3D hall probe measuring bench. Higher order multipoles are measured on a slow rotating coil system developed for that purpose. Much effort has been put into automation in order to quickly perform the very comprehensive measurement program each girder will through.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/moodb102_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/moodb102.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/moodb102_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOODB102,34

Firstly; the energy deposition of the first bunches in a target with FLUKA is calculated. The effect of the energy deposition on the target is then calculated with a hydrodynamic code; BIG2. The impact of only a few bunches leads to a change of target density. The calculations are done iteratively in several steps and show that such beam can tunnel up to 30-35 m into a target. Validation experiments for these calculations at LHC are not possible; therefore experiments were suggested for the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS); since simulation studies with the tools used for the LHC also predict hydrodynamic tunnelling for SPS beams. An experiment at the SPS-HiRadMat facility (High-Radiation to Materials) using the 440 GeV beam with 144 bunches was performed in July 2012. In this paper we compare the results of this experiment with our calculations of hydrodynamic tunnelling.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/moodb103_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/moodb103.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/moodb103_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOODB103,37

L. Tock; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The LHC has been delivering data to the physics experiments since the first collisions in 2009. The first long shutdown (LS1); which started on 14 February 2013; was triggered by the need to consolidate the magnet interconnections so as to allow the LHC to operate at the design energy of 14 TeV in the centre-of-mass. It has now become a major shutdown which; in addition; includes other repairs; consolidation; upgrades and cabling across the whole accelerator complex and the associated experimental facilities. LS1 will see a massive programme of maintenance for the LHC and its injectors in the wake of more than three years of operation without the long winter shutdowns that were the norm in the past. The main driving effort will be the consolidation of the 10; 170 high-current splices between the superconducting magnets. The presentation describes first the preparation phase with the prioritisation of the activities; the building of the teams and the detailed planning of the operation. Then; it gives the status after 3 months and the restart plans for all CERN accelerators. First lessons learnt for the 2nd long shutdown (LS2) will conclude the presentation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mozb202_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mozb202.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mozb202_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOZB202,44

This almost unprecedented mode of collider operation was not foreseen in the baseline design of the LHC whose two-in-one magnet design imposed equal rigidity and; hence; unequal revolution frequencies; during injection and ramp. Nevertheless; after a successful pilot physics fill in 2012; the LHC provided 31 nb-1 of p-Pb luminosity per experiment; at an energy of 5.02 TeV per colliding nucleon pair; with several variations of the operating conditions; in early 2013. Together with a companion p-p run at 2.76 TeV; this was the last physics before the present long shutdown. We summarise the beam physics; operational adaptations and strategy that resulted in extremely rapid commissioning. Finally; we give an account of the progress of the run and provide an analysis of the performance.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/moodb201_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/moodb201.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/moodb201_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOODB201,49

The ""neutrinos from STORed Muons""(nuSTORM) facility is based on this idea. The facility includes a target station with secondary particle collection; pion transfer line; pion injection; and a ~3.8 GeV/c muon storage ring. No muon cooling or RF sub-systems are required.

The facility was designed for top-up from the start with a full energy 3 GeV injection system; however top-up only became a priority once the beamline user community had established itself at the new facility in operation since April 2007. New beam diagnostic and equipment protections systems were implemented as part of the move to top-up; including a new injection efficiency monitoring system. The effect of top-up on the beamline data was also tested with each beamline prior to engaging top-up during user runs. Top-up has now been running successfully for one year and the performance statistics from this period will be presented. Top-up operations is a very popular standard mode for user beam and falling into decay mode is now treated almost as a beam dump.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopea001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopea001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopea001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPEA001,58

The neutrons are generated by a high power (5 MW) proton beam impacting a rotating W spallation target. To reduce the replacement frequency of components subjected to the full beam current; i.e. the proton beam window and the target; means to introduce low peak current densities; i.e. flat transverse beam profiles; are necessary. The relatively long beam pulse duration of 2.86 ms (at 14 Hz) leaves ample time to facilitate a Lissajous-like; linear raster system that illuminates a footprint area by sweeping an only moderately enlarged LINAC beamlet. Although slightly more technically challenging; this method has many advantages over the previously envisaged beam expander system based on non-linear DC magnets.

In this exercise; the main constraint imposed is to leave all the existing 24 straight sections for insertion devices untouched. In the previous study (presented at IPAC 2012); the possibility of using superbends and exploiting their longitudinal dipole field variation was pursued in lowering the emittance; finding solutions with a horizontal emittance in the sub nanometer range. In the present study; the use of MBA (Multi-Bend-Achromat) lattice is explored; which is widely recognized today as the optimal lattice in reaching an ultra-low emittance. The study aims to clarify the adaptability of the MBA and the range of attainable emittance for the SOLEIL ring; in view particularly of the short straight sections existing in half of the original DBA cells in between the dipoles.

The SPIRAL 2 project a so called second generation RIB facility is under construction at GANIL. The low energy RIB’s will be produced by neutron induced fissions obtained from a 40 MeV primary beam (deutons) and a graphit convertor. Several issues must be addressed in order to insure the safety rules and ultimately the performances requested by the scientific programme. Among them; the space charge dominated regime during the extraction of the beam after the target and the ion source; the compromise between beam transmission; rejection of the light-ion beam; and management of the main safety features.

IPAC2013,,MOPEA015,A Transverse Electron Target for Heavy Ion Storage Rings,S. Geyer; O. Meusel; D. Ries; IAP; Frankfurt am Main; Germany; GSI; Darmstadt; Germany; A transverse electron target is a well suited concept under discussion for storage rings to investigate electron-ion interaction processes relevant for heavy ion accelerators. Using a sheet beam of free electrons in crossed beam geometry promises not only a high energy resolution but also allows access to the interaction region for photon and electron spectroscopy under large solid angles. To realize a compact and multi-purpose applicable design; only electrostatic fields are used for beam focussing. The produced electron beam has a length of 10cm in ion beam direction and a width of around 5mm in the interaction region with densities of ~109electrons/cm3. The target geometry allows the independent adjustment of the electron beam current and energy in the region of several 10eV and a few keV. The setup meets the high requirements for an operation in the UHV environment of a storage ring and is installed applying the so-called animated beam technique. The electron target is dedicated to the FAIR storage rings. First measurements have been performed at a test bench.

A bare uranium beam is injected from the collector ring CR into the HESR at 740 MeV/u. The beam preparation for an internal target experiment with cooling is outlined. The acceleration of the ion beam to 2 GeV/u is studied under the basic condition of the available cavity voltages and the maximum magnetic field ramp rate in the HESR. The cooling simulations include the beam-target interaction due to a Hydrogen and Xenon target. Diffusion due to Schottky and thermal noise as well as intra beam scattering is accounted for. Due to the higher charge states of the ions Schottky particle noise power becomes an important issue. The analysis considers the electronic power limitation to 500 W in case of momentum cooling.

Realignment of the main cavity increased the average lattice momentum acceptance from 0.0116 ± 0.0003 to 0.0158 ± 0.0003 and the horizontal acceptance from 26 ± 2 × 10-6 m to larger than 44 ± 2 × 10-6 m.

The lifetime in the storage ring is lower than originally envisaged. From vertical scraper measurements the lifetime contributions at 300 mA stored current have been determined. The lifetime is mainly limited by the Touschek lifetime; which is lower than its design value; whereas the vacuum lifetime is close to the expected value. The low Touschek lifetime is explained by a lower than design emittance ratio and momentum acceptance in the storage ring.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopea057_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopea057.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopea057_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPEA057,208

Thereby the collision rate between beam ions and residual gas particles and consequently beam loss by ionization is enhanced. The reduction and control of beam loss in the injection channel; during multiturn injection and during the Rf capture process has an outstanding importance for the vacuum dynamics. One way to minimize the initial losses in the synchrotron is to displace the beam loss into the transfer channel (TK) between UNILAC and SIS.

Although these remarkable features; the less robustness has been the biggest issue on the real operation of this cathode. According to past experiments; there are three sources of the cathode degradation; gas absorption; thermal desorption; and ion-back bombardment. First two processes could be controlled by less vacuum pressure in order of 10-10Pa and keeping the cathode temperature low. The ion back-bombardment is the last issue which should be solved for high brightness operation in such as ERL. We observed the cathode quantum efficiency evolution in various laser power density and bias voltage. We found that the cathode degradation was due to the ion back-bombardment quantitatively and the deactivation coefficient of NEA surface by one ion collision did not depend on the bias voltage.

The cascade shower in the target deposits large amount of energy in the material leading to target damage. The pulsed electron beam distributed the energy non-uniformly over the target. In that case; a mechanical stress appears due to the large thermal gradient during each pulse; which could potentially destroy the target. Based on the analysis of the SLAC damaged target; peak energy deposition density (PEDD) should not exceed 35 J/g to ensure a long term of safe operation. One way of reducing PEDD is increasing the beam spot size. Hence we proposed a target protection scheme; in which a protection target is placed upstream of generation target as a spoiler. The aim is to maintain the generation target’s PEDD below 35 J/g even with a point primary electron beam. In this paper; we will introduce graphite; aluminum and copper as the protection target material candidates.

Such as low cost; high averaged current and simple operation. However a thermionic rf gun has a significant disadvantage in form of back bombardment effect. The KU-FEL facility is an oscillator type FEL; which uses a thermionic 4.5 cell S-band RF gun for electron beam generation. The back bombardment effect causes increasing current in macropulse; which limits the gain of the FEL. In order to mitigate the current increase we plan to modify thermionic rf gun to triode type rf gun. Therefore an additional rf cavity has been designed. This cavity has separate rf power supply with amplitude and phase control. By this means we can properly adjust the injection of electrons into the main gun body.

This ECC rf gun has been made with the collaboration of High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). Although the bunch length could be controlled by the laser pulse width; the bunch length ends up to be more than 1ps due to space charge effect when using a femto-second laser and a normal 1.6 cell cavity. Concerning this phenomenon; ECC is attached right after the 1.6 cell so that the electron bunch would be compressed after the electron bunch is accelerated around 5MeV. The roll of ECC is to chirp the energy with the linear part of the rf electric field. The electron bunch would be compressed by velocity difference as it drifts. Simulation results from PARMELA and GPT show that ECC rf gun can accelerate an 100pC bunch with the bunch length less than 100fs. We already manufactured this ECC rf gun and installed in our system. We demonstrated the ultra-short bunch by measuring the coherent THz light by synchrotron radiation and transition radiation. In this conference; we will report the results of ultra-short bunch generation experiments; and future plans.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopfi024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopfi024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopfi024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPFI024,330

The target of CARIF needs endure high temperature and thermal energy deposit. A new multi-targets configuration is proposed. It consists of several discrete targets instead of traditional single-target structure used in accelerator driven facility. Because there is more thermal radiation area in this configuration; thermal radiation capacity is enhanced; so the target can withstand higher thermal power. The temperature distribution of multi-targets was simulated with finite element code. The results show that the configuration of multi targets can effectively reduce the target temperature.

Recent studies have shown cesium potassium antimonide to be a robust photocathode capable of producing high peak and average currents. However; for some applications; the UHV conditions required for producing these cathodes necessitate their fabrication site to be physically removed from the gun location and the cathode to be transferred between the two sites in UHV load-lock chambers. We have fabricated two cathodes at BNL; transported and tested them in DC gun at JLab at 100 kV and 200 kV. These cathodes have delivered up to 8A/cm2 without significant degradation.

In this case the fundamental resolution limit is determined by radiation diffraction in the optical system. A method to achieve resolutions beyond the diffraction limit is to perform point spread function (PSF) dominated imaging; i.e. the recorded image is dominated by the resolution function of a point source (single electron); and with knowledge of the PSF the true image (beam spot) may be reconstructed. To overcome the limited dynamical range of PSF dominated imaging; a dedicated de-focusing of the optical system can be introduced.

One is a signal process electronics circuit using fast analogue switches. The circuit picks up one of the selected bunch signal of the beam position monitor from the multi-bunch. The selected beam position signal can be processed as a single bunch beam. By changing the gate timing; arbitrary bunch signal can be selected. The other is a waveform memory using a high bandwidth oscilloscope. The long waveform memory of the oscilloscope has a capability to acquire the multi-turn waveform of the button electrode signals. The beam test of the circuit has been carried out at KEK-ATF damping ring in the cases of 2.8ns bunch spacing and 5.6ns bunch spacing; respectively.

Electron beam extracted from the RF Gun is accelerated to 40 MeV by two superconducting cavities. Cavity alignment requirements for ILC are less than 300um offset and 300urad tilt with respect to cryomodule. It is necessary to measure their offset and tilt inside of cryomodule. Cavity offset has been already measured by using beam induced HOM at FLASH in DESY. Cavity deformation during assembly and by cooling contraction has not been examined yet. We measured HOM signals to detect their tilt and bending. TE111-6 which has high impedance is used to estimate cavity offset. To find cavity tilt and bending; we selected pi over nine mode in the first dipole passband (TE111-1) and beam pipe modes. From information of TE111-1 which has maximum radial electric field in the middle cell; we can get electrical center of middle cell. At beam pipes; electrical center can be found by using beam pipe modes. Combinations of these electrical centers tell us cavity tilt and bending.

In addition; the incoherent tune is formed into spread shape commonly. When the incoherent tune satisfies a resonance condition; it might be occurred the beam emittance growth and the beam loss. So it is necessary to reduce the incoherent tune spread and the tune shift as much as possible. To achieve this condition; it is desired to measure the incoherent tune spread and the tune shift directly. Therefore we are developing the new measurement method of the incoherent tune spread and the shift due to the space charge effect. From the simulation results; it was cleared that the beam distribution can be modified in the case of using the mono frequency dipole exciter because a particle which has the tune corresponding to the exciter can be resonated temporary. In addition; it was cleared that it is possible to evaluate the incoherent tune spread and the tune shift by the measurement of the distribution transition.

As stripper foil position is fixed for the charge exchange H− injection; inclination of the injected beam centroid on foil for the MR beam is only moved to a smaller value by the pulse steering magnets; while DC septum magnets are fixed as determined first for the MLF beam.

A new method; referred to as Direct Diode Detection (3D) by LHC[1]; improves the situation. In this paper; the HLS II BPM signals have been calculated out in time domain and frequency domain. Basing on the characteristics of HLS II BPM signal; a preliminary simulation is performed to test and verify the feasibility of diode detector for HLS II tune measurement system. The simulation results clearly show that the technique of diode-based circuit can be applied to HLS II tune measurement.,"Funding: Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (11105141, 11175173) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2310000015)",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopme042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopme042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopme042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPME042,565

The theory of X-ray DR from single particles was created in [*; **]; and recently the theory has been developed for bunches [***]. DR from relativistic particles is used for noninvasive bunch diagnostics and also for creating new and effective sources of radiation; including Free-electron laser based on the Smith-Purcell effect. In the present work we explore theoretically DR from the bunch of ultrarelativistic charged particles at X-ray and UV frequencies domains. It is shown that incoherent part of form-factor; describing the effect of N electrons in bunch; exists and differs from the unity. The coherent part of radiation depends on transversal size of the bunch as ratio of the Bessel function to its argument.

Therefore for oblique incidence it can be emitted under big angles which is useful from point of view of measuring of the radiation. In spite of the fact that backward TR in X-ray frequency domain is much weaker than forward TR [*]; it has recently been proposed by A.P.

In this work we propose to use the multilayered target in order to enhance the resulting radiation; i.e. to use resonant backward X-ray TR. So far X-ray TR has not been explored theoretically for backward geometry. It is shown that the expressions obtained coincide in special case of forward resonant X-ray TR with the results by L. Durand (***) and X. Artru (****).

As a rule; dielectric objects applied for these goals have complex forms. Therefore development of methods of calculation of bunch radiation in presence of complex dielectric objects is now of a great interest. The approximate method developed by us allows to take into account influence of the object boundaries closed to the charge trajectory as well as ""external"" boundaries of the object. The case of the charge crossing a dielectric plate was considered as a test problem. The exact solution of this problem is in a good agreement with our approximate solution. Next; the cases of more complex objects were analyzed. One of them is a dielectric cone with a vacuum channel. Particularly; it was shown that radiation can be convergent under certain conditions; that is the field outside the cone can be more intensive than on the cone boundary.

Investigations of coherent radiation generated by such bunches using different interferometers allow to determine a bunch length*. Measuring a dependence of radiation yield intensity from two DR targets on a distance between them (the intrinsic DR interferogram); it is possible to obtain the same information. Such a non-invasive technique can be directly used for ultra-short bunch length measurements. Recently the first experiment with a double DR target was carried out at the SINAP fs linac facility** with parameters described in***. The double DR target was consisted of two plates made from Al foil. The pyro-electric detector SPI-D-62 was used. Here we report the results of the second stage of our investigations. The DR interferograms of different electron bunch length were measured. The bunch length was reconstructed using the heuristic model based on the dimension theory and simulation data.

The final setup will consist in replacing the energy variable part of the normal conducting REX post-accelerator with superconducting cavities. In order to preserve the beam emittance; the drift space between the cryomodules housing these cavities has been kept to a minimum. As a consequence; the longitudinal space available for beam diagnostics is severely limited in the inter-cryomodule regions. A Faraday cup (FC) will be installed to measure beam currents; and due to the tight spatial constraints; its length is much smaller than usual. This poses a great challenge when trying to avoid the escape of ion-induced secondary electrons; which would falsify the current measurement. Two prototypes of such a short FC have therefore been tested at REX-ISOLDE using several beam intensities and energies; with the aim of determining its accuracy.

The longitudinal momentum spread can be evaluated by means of Schottky type signal analysis of bunched beams. There is a close similarity between a repetitive Linac bunch train and a circulating beam with a single short batch in a large machine like the LHC. A dedicated longitudinal cavity pick-up was used in the Linac where resonance frequency and Q-value were carefully selected in order to get an optimum compromise between the unavoidable coherent signal and the desired incoherent part of the beam spectrum. A time domain gating similar to the 4.8 GHz LHC Schottky front-end is applied. As a cross-check of the validity of the interpretation in terms of momentum spread; the Linac beam is analyzed in the downstream synchrotron using standard Schottky methods. In principle; this approach can be understood as an extension of Schottky analysis for circular machines with a perfect “mixing” between subsequent bunch trains.

The CLIC pre-damping rings and damping rings will produce; through synchrotron radiation; ultra-low emittance beam with high bunch charge. To avoid beam emittance increase; the damping ring kicker systems must provide extremely flat; high-voltage; pulses. The specifications for the extraction kickers of the DRs are particularly demanding: the flat-top of the pulses must be ±12.5 kV with a combined ripple and droop of not more than ±0.02 % (±2.5 V). An inductive adder is a very promising approach to meeting the specifications. However; the output impedance of the inductive adder needs to be well matched to the system impedance.

It is used to study limitations of high-gradient acceleration in X-band structures being prototyped in the TBTS. The Flashbox is built around the beam tube such that an electron beam can pass to be accelerated in the X-band structure while charged particles emitted from the accelerating structure can be intercepted on the spectrometer consisting of detector plates aligned along the beam axis in combination with magnetic and electric fields. The Flashbox has made it possible to identify electrons and ions emitted by the accelerating structure during RF breakdown.

IPAC2013,,MOPWA040,Bipolar 10A and 50A Magnet Power Supplies for SwissFEL,R. Künzi; M. Emmenegger; PSI; Villigen PSI; Switzerland; 15 years ago the Power Electronics Group at PSI; Switzerland developed power supplies (PS) for the magnets of the Swiss Light Source (SLS). These PS are based on switched mode converters with fully digital control. During the 12 years of operation of the SLS they have shown a very good reliability but also revealed some potential for improvement: After several years of operation the many fans installed started to fail more frequently and the same was observed for “off-the-shelf” AC/DC converters for the DC link. For the new SwissFEL; which shall be in service by 2016; approx. 610 PS rated at 10A and 40 PS rated at 50A will be necessary. As for any accelerator application high stability and reliability of the magnet PS are essential for high beam quality and availability. The development of the SwissFEL PS aims to raise the already good reliability by omitting as many fans as possible and adding redundancy for the AC/DC converters. Presently; a prototype rack with 21 10A PS is available and the mass production has started. The presented paper describes the PS concept and test results of the prototype regarding stability and efficiency are given.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwa040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwa040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwa040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWA040,756

The measurement was performed by means of a beam size monitor based on the imaging of the vertically polarized synchrotron radiation in the visible and UV spectral ranges. However; the resolution limit of the monitor was reached during the last measurement campaign and prevented further emittance minimization. In the context of the work package “SLS Vertical Emittance Tuning” of the TIARA collaboration; a new improved monitor was built.

The target atoms are polarized by the electric field of the charged particle; which then oscillate thus emitting radiation with a very broad spectrum. The spatial-spectral properties of DR are sensitive to various electron beam parameters. Since the energy loss due to DR is so small that the electron beam parameters are unchanged; DR can be used to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools. The aim of this project is to measure the transverse (vertical) beam size using incoherent DR. To achieve the micron-scale resolution required by CLIC; DR in the UV and X-ray spectral-range must be studied. During the next few years; experimental validation of such a scheme will be conducted on the CesrTA at Cornell University; USA.

The transverse beam position in a cavity can be determined utilizing beam-excited HOMs based on dipole components. The existing couplers used for HOM suppression provide the necessary signals. The diagnostics principle is similar to a cavity BPM; but requires no additional vacuum instruments on the linac. The challenges lie in the dense HOM spectrum arising from couplings of the majority HOMs amongst the four cavities in the cryo-module. HOMs with particularly promising diagnostics features were evaluated using various devices with various analysis methods. After careful theoretical and experimental assessment of HOMs; multi-cavity modes at ~5GHz were chosen to provide a global position over the complete module with superior resolution (~20μm) while trapped modes at ~9GHz provide local position in each cavity with comparable resolution (~50μm). A similar HOM-BPM system is planned for the European XFEL 3.9GHz module with 8 cavities.

In order to estimate the expected halo signal and the total beam intensity; studies into proton beam transport through the whole CCC beam line have been carried out. This required the measurement of beam emittance at several positions of the beam delivery system. Quadrupole scans have been realized using a CsI (Tl) scintillating screen in combination with an 8 bit; 13 Mpixel CCD camera. In this contribution; results from measurements are presented and include a discussion of the effects from dispersion in the beam.

IPAC2013,,MOPWA060,DITANET - An International Network in Beam Diagnostics,Cockcroft Institute; Warrington; Cheshire; United Kingdom; The University of Liverpool; Liverpool; United Kingdom; Beam diagnostics systems are essential constituents of any particle accelerator; they reveal the properties of a beam and how it behaves in a machine. Without an appropriate set of diagnostic elements; it would simply be impossible to operate any accelerator complex; let alone optimize its performance. Beam diagnostics is also a rich field in which a great variety of physical effects are made use of and consequently provides a wide interdisciplinary base for the training of researchers. The DITANET Consortium develops beyond state-of-the-art beam diagnostic techniques for hadron and electron accelerators and trained more than 20 researchers between 2008 and 2012.

Previous experiments on an rf thermionic cathode gun beam at 50 MeV provide a proof-of-principle reference for the ASTA injector. The ASTA injector is based on an L-band rf photocathode (PC) gun with UV pulse drive laser; two L-band superconducting accelerator structures; a chicane bunch compressor; and an electron spectrometer. The injector energy of 40-50 MeV is expected. The 3-MHz micropulse repetition rate with micropulse charges up to to 3.2 nC and 1-ps bunch lengths should generate sufficient CDR signal for standard pyroelectric detectors to be used. The CDR signals will also be evaluated as a bunch compression signal for beam-based feedback for rf phase.

The strong phase shift enhancement from multiple reflections of standing microwaves in a resonating beam pipe cavity has been demonstrated with numerical modeling using dielectric approximation and e S-parameter measurements. The equivalent dielectric simulation showed a ~ 10 times phase shift enhancement (Pi-mode; 1.516 GHz) with the cavity beam pipe compared to the waveguide model. The position-dependence of the technique is investigated by overlapping the field distributions of harmonic resonances. The simulation with various positions of dielectric insertions confirmed that resonance peaks in phase-shift spectra corresponding to the relative distance between field-nodes and electron cloud position; which allows for one-dimensional mapping. Preliminary experimental studies based on a bench-top setup confirm the results of the simulation showing that thicker reflectors enhance the phase-shift measurement of the electron cloud density.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwa064_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwa064.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwa064_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWA064,825

For short-pulse modulators; this Marx topology provides a means to achieve astounding risetimes and flattop control that are simply not available with hard switch or transformer coupled topologies. The design is a high peak-power pulse modulator of greater efficiency than presently available; in the 100 kV to 1 MV range; for currents of 0.1 to 1 kA; pulse lengths of 0.2 to 5.0 us; and rise/fall times 10% of pulse length.

Each gyrotron requires a power system that must deliver the high-voltage power; modulate cathode voltage; and protect these expensive gyrotrons from arcing damage. It must be highly efficient; to minimize both the power and cooling costs associated with operation and to ensure high facility availability. Diversified Technologies; Inc. (DTI) has bench-tested a table-top scale ‘Buck Matrix’ modulator which uses a single set of IGBT switches for voltage regulation; arc protection; and pulse modulation. Although pulse step modulators represent a one-step solution; their size; and the complexity of their driving transformer make them more expensive than DTI’s two-step approach. DTI’s Buck Matrix modulator; with an efficiency of ~96%; cuts the size of the system in half; using a single layer of solid state switches for both voltage regulation and arc protection/modulation. This cuts the total hardware costs by a~30% or more; and eliminates the need for a separate opening switch or crowbar.

The current modulator switches the full power at high frequency during each pulse; and has a complex output transformer. DTI designed a modulator that meets all specifications and is less expensive. The proposed design is cheaper because there is an HV switch that operates at full current only once per pulse; a corrector that switches only 5% of the power at high frequency; a low-cost transformer-rectifier power supply; and no output transformer. DTI’s patented switch uses IGBTs; allowing the switch to operate at full capacity even if 20% of the devices fail. The modulator will be installed in 2013 at SNS to test klystrons.

Therefore; to avoid the possible effects of beam breakup; it will be important to determine the optimum transverse position for the beam within the first several sets of cavity cells in the cryostat assembly and to maintain this position over long periods. As a result a beam position monitor (BPM) has been designed to be located between the higher-order modes (HOM) loads and the seven-cell RF structures. This BPM’s design reduces the coupling of RF power from the fundamental mode and HOMs into the BPM; while maintaining acceptable position sensitivity and resolution. We analyzed the coupling of the probe to the HOMs of realistically shaped cavities by generating geometries for hundreds of cavities having small shape variations from the nominal dimensions consistent with present machining tolerances; and solved for their monopole and dipole spectra.

The purpose of the PEPPo (Polarized Electrons for Polarized Positrons) experiment is to demonstrate; for the first time; the production of polarized positrons from a polarized electron beam. This two-step process involves the production of circularly polarized photons in a high Z target via the bremsstrahlung process followed; within the same target; by the conversion of polarized photons into polarized e+e− pairs through the pair creation process. The PEPPo experiment was performed in Spring 2012 at the injector of the Jefferson Laboratory using a highly spin-polarized (~85%) 8.3 MeV/c electron beam.

The wire scanner utilizes three 25-micron diameter tungsten wires mounted vertically; horizontally; and diagonally on a single alumina card to measure the transverse beam size down to 10 microns with sub-micron accuracy of a 139-MeV electron beam. A double-ended design using dual bellows for actuation is used to reduce the vibrations of the wire holder during motion and negate the effects of air pressure on positioning. The servomotor-driven system is capable of performing full horizontal; vertical; and 45-degree scans in under a minute. Algorithms are presented for removing the broadening effect of the wires' thickness from the scanning data to measure beams that are as small or smaller than the wires.

Fortunately; not every beam trip is necessarily a failure. For example; in the proposed MYRRHA transmuter; absence of the beam for less than 3 seconds is still deemed acceptable. Predictive diagnostics strives to predict where a failure is likely to occur; so that a mitigating action can be taken in a more controlled manner; thus preventing failure of other components while exactly pinpointing the component that is about to fail. One approach to predictive diagnostics is to analyze process variables that quantify inputs and outputs of components as archived by the accelerator's distributed control system. By observing trends in their values an impending fault can be predicted. In addition; sensors measuring e.g.; vibration; temperature or noise can be attached to critical components. By analyzing the signatures of signals acquired by these sensors; non-nominal behavior can be detected which possibly indicates a looming failure.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwa087_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwa087.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwa087_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWA087,873

Since instabilities occur during injection; when the passive harmonic cavity potential is also time varying; it became important to simulate this transient process.

Additionally; the spin motion of lepton beams is affected significantly by synchrotron radiation. Hence; spin dynamics simulations require spin tracking with a large number of particles to compute the beam polarization and thus take considerably long computing times. Therefore; high efficiency is crucial to perform systematic polarization studies. The new simulation tool POLE provides the ability to balance accuracy against computing time. To that end; adjustable approximations of magnetic fields and synchrotron radiation are implemented.

Two ferrite-loaded cavity resonators are installed within this ring. During the acceleration phase their resonance frequency has to be adjusted to the revolution frequency of the heavy-ions to reflect their increasing speed. To this end; dedicated biased ferrite-ring cores are installed inside the cavities for a broad frequency tuning. By properly choosing a suited bias current; the differential permeability of the ferrite material is modified; which finally enables to adjust the eigenfrequency of the resonator system. Consequently; the actual resonance frequency strongly depends on the magnetic properties of the ferrites. The goal of the current study is to numerically determine the lowest eigensolutions of the GSI SIS18 ferrite-loaded cavity.

Using common eigenmode solvers the analysis of intentional and undesired geometric perturbations tend to be very extensive since any geometric variation involves an entire eigenmode recomputation. Perturbative methods constitute an efficient alternative for the computation of a multitude of moderately varying geometries. They require a common eigenmode computation of solely one (so called unperturbed) geometry and allow for deriving the eigenmodes of similar but modified (so called perturbed) geometries from these unperturbed eigenmodes. In [*]; [**] the practicability of perturbative methods was already proven by means of simple cavity geometries. In this paper we investigate the applicability and efficiency for practically relevant cavities. For this; basic geometric parameters of elliptical cavities are varied and the respective eigenmodes are computed by using perturbative as well as common methods.

The identification of damaged collimator jaws by observation of beam measurements is challenging: online loss measurements at the moment of the impacts can be tricky and degradation of the overall performance from single collimator damage can be difficult to measure. Visual inspections are excluded because collimator jaws are enclosed in vacuum tanks without windows. However; the sound generated during the beam impact can be used to give an estimate of the damage level.

As a result; a record cleaning efficiency below a few 0.0001 was achieved in the cold regions where the highest beam losses occur. The cleaning in other cold locations is typically a factor of 10 better. No quenches were observed during regular operation with up to 140 MJ stored beam energy. The system stability during the year; monitored regularly to ensure the system functionality for all machine configurations; and the performance of the alignment tools are also reviewed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwo048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwo048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwo048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWO048,

In a super-conducting machine like the LHC; the lifetime determines the intensity reach for a given collimation cleaning. The beam lifetime can be calculated from the direct measurement of beam current. However; due to the noise in the beam current signal only an average lifetime over several seconds can be calculated. We propose here an alternative method; which uses the signal of the beam loss monitors in the vicinity of the primary collimators to get the instantaneous beam lifetime at the collimators. In this paper we compare the lifetime from the two methods and investigate the minimum lifetime over the LHC cycle for all the physics fills in 2011 and 2012. These data provide a reference for estimates of performance reach from collimator cleaning.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwo049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwo049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwo049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWO049,

In this procedure; the beam is artificially excited to create abnormal loss rates. The transverse damper blow up and tune resonance crossing methods are used to increase the betatron amplitude of particles and verify the efficiency of the collimation cleaning and the collimator hierarchy. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of the methods; based on measurements done at different phases of the LHC machine cycle.

The insertions are not perfectly decoupled because the dispersion in IR7 is not null and the beta function in IR3 is not zero. The detailed sharing of losses between the two insertions depends on the relative collimator settings as observed by the change between 2011 and 2012 LHC operation. In this report; using the beam loss measurements at the primary collimators of IR3 and IR7; the total BLM losses in the two insertions are calculated and compared to each other. These studies are also used to quantify the total dose to warm magnets in those IRs with the aim to understand better their lifetime and the implications of the radiation to electronics.

Microwave diagnostics of electron clouds are a non-destructive way to measure cloud buildup; but it is very difficult to measure the cloud density from spectral signals alone. Modeling travelling-wave rf diagnostics is very hard because of the large range of spatial and temporal scales that must be resolved to simulate spectra. New numerical models have been used to generate synthetic spectra for electron clouds when the cloud density is not changing; and results have been compared to theoretical results. Here we use dielectric models to generate spectra for clouds that evolve over many bunch crossings. We first perform detailed simulations of cloud buildup using kinetic particle models; and then use an equivalent plasma dielectric model corresponding to this density; at a finer time resolution; to compute spectra.

This cooler requires a fast kicker system for injecting and extracting individual bunches in the circulator ring. Such a kicker must work at a high repetition rate; up to 7.5 to 75 MHz depending on the number of turns in the recirculator ring. It also must have a very short rise and fall time (of order of 1 ns) such that it will kick an individual bunch without disturbing the others in the ring. Both requirements are orders of magnitude beyond the present state-of-the-art as well as the goals of other on-going kicker R&D programs such as that for the ILC damping rings.

The path-length variation due to changes in the ion energy; which varies over 20 to 100 GeV; could be more than several times the bunch spacing. The scheme adopted in the present MEIC baseline is centered on varying the number of bunches (i.e.; harmonic number) stored in the collider ring. This could provide a set of discrete energies for proton or ions such that the beam synchronization condition is satisfied. To cover the ion energy between these synchronized values; we further propose to vary simultaneously the electron ring circumference and the frequency of the RF systems in both collider rings. We also present in this paper the requirement of frequency tunability of SRF cavities to support the scheme.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwo081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwo081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwo081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWO081,

Presently; a medium energy collider (MEIC) is set as an immediate goal with options for a future energy upgrade. A comprehensive design report for MEIC has been released recently. The MEIC facility could also accommodate electron and proton/ion collisions in a low CM energy range; covering proton energies from 10 to 25 GeV and ion energies with a similar magnetic rigidity; for additional science reach. In this paper; we present a conceptual design of this low energy collider; LEIC; showing its luminosity can reach above 1033 cm-2s−1. The design specifies that the large booster of the MEIC is converted to a low energy ion collider ring with an interaction region and an electron cooler integrated into it. The design provides options for either sharing the detector with the MEIC or a dedicated low energy detector in a third collision point; with advantages of either a minimum cost or extra detection parallel to the MEIC operation; respectively. The LEIC could be positioned as the first and low cost phase of a multi-stage approach to realize the full MEIC.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwo083_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwo083.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwo083_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWO083,

Such algorithms are not new; but this particular method has very robust convergence properties resulting from a novel approach that combines both deterministic and non-deterministic methods. The general idea is as follows: given a model of the beamline; in the zero-current case it is possible to compute the Courant-Snyder parameters directly from profile data using a deterministic; linear-algebraic approach. For the finite beam current case we can construct a smooth curve of these deterministic solutions starting from the zero-current solution and terminating at the finite-current case. We are guaranteed convergence; and convergence to the finite-current solution connected to the zero-current Courant-Snyder parameters. This approach avoids the convergence issues associated with a fully iterative; non-deterministic method. The details of the technique are outlined and examples are presented using profile data taken from the SNS accelerator.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/mopwo085_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/mopwo085.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/mopwo085_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-MOPWO085,

To analyze the performance of the CeC shielding of a hadron in an electron beam should be computed with high precision. We propose a solution of this problem via Fourier and Laplace transforms for 1D; 2D and 3D plasmas. In some cases there are fully analytical solutions; which gave an opportunity to test semi-analytical ones involving numerical evaluations of the inverse integral transforms.

Beijing Advanced Photon Source (BAPS) is under design at Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) which aims to emittance less than 1nm at 5GeV. To improve the coherence and high brightness; low emittance- in both transverse planes at the diffraction limit for the range of x-ray wavelengths(≈10 pm)- is being pursued. Thus; due to the very low emittance; intra-beam scattering effect is an issue. Accurate estimation to check if the design goal can be reached is necessary. In this paper; we use the 6-D accelerator simulation code-elegant and Accelerator Toolbox (AT)-a collection of tools to model storage rings in the MATLAB environment. Based on a temporary design lattice of BAPS; we present the results of particle simulation study of intra-beam scattering effect versus the beam energy; the emittance coupling factor; the bunch length; the bunch current and so on.

L. Rubin; D. Sagan; J.P. Shanks; S. Wang; CLASSE; Ithaca; New York; USA; Manifestation of intrabeam scattering (IBS) in an electron/positron storage ring depends on the radiation damping time in two ways. First; the beam size is the equilibrium of the IBS growth rate in each of the three degrees of freedom and corresponding damping rates. Second; scattering events that occur less frequently than order once per damping time contribute to non-Gaussian tails that are invisible to our beam size monitors. The tail cut procedure excludes these relatively rare events in the calculation of equilibrium beam size. In machines with short damping times; the tail cut significantly reduces the effective IBS growth rate. At CesrTA; we measure the dependence of beam size on bunch charge in IBS-dominated beams. We vary the vertical emittance using a closed optics bump that increases the vertical dispersion and transverse coupling in the wiggler regions. Measurements are taken at both 2.1 and 2.3 GeV.

IPAC2013,,TUOAB201,Ultra-Short X-ray Pulse Generation by Electron Beam Slicing in Storage Rings,L.-H. Yu; F.J. Willeke; BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; We propose a new method to generate ultra-short x-ray pulses using focused short low energy (5-10MeV) electron bunch to slice a short electron bunch from the electron bunches in a synchrotron radiation storage ring. When the low energy electron bunch crosses from top the high energy electron bunch at right angle; its coulomb force will kick a short slice of high energy electrons away from the core of the storage ring electron bunch. When the low energy electron bunch (about 50 pC) is focused to about 50 micron size and compressed to about 150fs bunch length and is positioned on top of the high energy electron bunch by a distance about 30 micron; the coulomb force is sufficient to give a kick vertically to the electrons within a short slice of the storage ring bunch about 200 fs long with a deflection about 4 micro-radian. This is sufficient to deflect the slice away from the core by a separation of 5 times the angular divergence of the beam. The separated slice when passing through an undulator; will radiate ulstra-short x-ray pulses at about 200 fs. We discuss the advantages and challenges of this new method. We provide data to demonstrate the feasibility of this method.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tuoab201_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tuoab201.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tuoab201_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUOAB201,

IPAC2013,,TUOCB201,Recent Developments of Novel Beam Diagnostics at the ESRF,ESRF; Grenoble; France; A number of rather novel and particular electron beam diagnostics have seen their development in 2012 for the ESRF Storage Ring. A vertical Beam Halo detector that measures the bunch population at millimetres; i.e. hundreds of σs of nominal beam size; away from the central core. This measurement is based on X-ray synchrotron radiation from a bending magnet and is totally non-destructive to the electron beam itself. Another diagnostic use of the very hard X-rays available from the bending magnets is the detection of electron beam energy fluctuations. The detector hardware is simple and in-expensive and has shown a resolution of energy fluctuations of less than 10ppm. Also a single orbit turn measurement of the injected beam shape and size is now possible through the use of visible synchrotron light combined with a fast gateable intensifier; which can be triggered on any of the desired orbit turns after injection.

As most of 3rd generation light sources; the fast orbit feedback system would be adopted to eliminate various disturbances and improve orbit stability. Due to the vacuum chamber material made of aluminum with higher conductivity and lower bandwidth; both of slow and fast correctors will be used for FOFB correction. In general; there are two schemes to operate these hybrid correctors. One is to transfer correction from fast to slow correctors periodically and avoid fast corrector saturation. The other is the fast correctors operated only at higher frequency domain and slow ones take care of DC part. TPS would adopt the first scheme but the second one still as a substitute. Both schemes will be supported.

A major goal of ATF2 is to demonstrate the ability to stabilise the beam position at the interaction point; where the beam can be focused down to about 35 nm. For this purpose; a set of new Beam Position Monitors (BPM) has been designed; with an expected resolution of about 2 nm. These BPMs must be very well aligned with respect to the beam; at the few micron level; to fully exploit their fine resolution. In this paper; the mechanical positioning system which has been developed to enable such a precise alignment is presented. It is based on a set of eight piezo actuators with nanometer range displacement resolution; mounted in a new specially made vacuum chamber.

Proton bunches are interesting wakefield drivers because they can be ultra-relativistic (TeVs/p+) and carry large amounts of energy (>kJ). It was demonstrated in simulations* that acceleration of an electron (e-) bunch from 10GeV to >500GeV can be achieved in ~500m of plasma driven by a 1TeV; 100micron-long; bunch with 1011 p+. Such short p+ bunches do not exist today. It was suggested** that a p+ bunch long compared to the plasma period can transversely self-modulate and resonantly drive wakefields to large amplitudes (~GV/m). Initial experiments based on self-modulation instability (SMI) will use single 12cm-long CERN SPS bunches with 1-3·1011; 450GeV p+ to study physics of SMI. With a plasma density of 7·1014/cc the plasma wave and modulation period is 1.3mm. The SMI saturates after ~3m with amplitude in the GV/m range.

Fermi FEL-2 is the first seeded FEL operating with a double stage cascade in the ""fresh bunch injection"" mode*. The two stages are two high gain harmonic generation FELs where the first stage is seeded by the 3rd harmonic of a Ti:Sa laser system; which is up converted to the 4th-12th harmonic. The output of the first stage is then used to seed the second stage. A final wavelength of 10.8 nm was obtained as the 24th harmonic of the seed wavelength at the end of the two frequency conversion processes; demonstrating that the FEL is capable of producing single mode narrow bandwidth pulses with an energy of several tens ofμjoules. We report on the experimental characterisation of the FEL performances in this configuration.; * I.

Neutron have a magnetic dipole moment; and hence their kinetic energies vary depending on their spin in magnetic fields. Their kinetic energies are restored when they get out from the magnetic field area if their spin did not flip. A spin flip can be triggered by applying an RF field whose frequency coincides with the spin precession frequency of a neutron in this magnetic field. This allows to tune the kinetic energy of neutrons. This method can be used to rebunch a pulsed beam of neutrons to a storage bottle that can store UCN. By open and close the storage bottle synchronously with the rebuncher; high UCN densities can be achieved for precision measurements of neutron properties such as the Electric Dipole Moment. The method and experimental setup are described in detail and the results of a recent first test experiments are presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupea012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupea012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupea012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPEA012,

It is found that there is a critical value of the ion momentum to make sure that the ions are trapped by the light sail and accelerated in the radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) region. If the initial ion momentum is smaller than the critical value; that is in the classical case of RPA; the potential has a deep well and traps the ions to be accelerated. There is a new ion acceleration region different from RPA; called ultra-relativistic acceleration; if the ion momentum exceeds the critical value. In this case; ions will experience a potential downhill. The dependence of the ion momentum and the self-similar variable at the ion front on the acceleration time has been obtained. The critical conditions of the laser and plasma parameters which identify the two acceleration modes have been achieved. No matter RPA or ultra-relativistic acceleration; the potential difference is a constant; which dedicates the maximum ion energy.,Funding: The Key Project of Chinese National Programs for Fundamental Research (973 Program) under contract No. 2011CB808104 and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation under contract No. 11105233.,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupea016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupea016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupea016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPEA016,

In this paper; the wake-field generated by a bunch of electrons traversing in an active medium has been discussed. The calculations of the development of amplitude for gas mixture active medium about CO2 and ArF were made respectively. The results show that the gradient can reach around 1GeV/m. In addition; the electron energy gain occurring as a train of electron micro-bunches traversing in gas mixture was analyzed by a two dimension model. The train of micro-bunches can obviously gain energy from the active medium and the energy exchange is linearly proportional to the interaction length d. The influence of the bunch figure and other quantities on the energy exchange occurring as a train of electron micro-bunches traversing CO2 gas mixture were investigated when the interaction length is 0.5m. The results illustrate that maximum electron energy gain can be obtained by the train of micro-bunches with optimized parameters.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupea029_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupea029.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupea029_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPEA029,

The current model of LSC impedance* derived from the fundamental electromagnetic theor** is widely used to explain the physics of the LSC-induced microbunching instability***. However; in the case of highly bright electron beams; the plasma effect starts to play a role. In this paper; the basic model of the LSC impedance including the plasma effect is built up by solving the Vlasov and Poisson equations in 6 dimensional phase space; and the investigation is done to study the modification to the gain of the instability based on the model. The solutions indicate that the gain does not only depend on the spatial information of the beam; but also on the velocity (momentum) and time information. The comparison of the gains of the microbunching instability in the LINAC of Shanghai soft X-ray Free Electron Laser Facility (SXFEL) computed by various methods is also given and the discrepancy is illustrated.; * Marco Venturini; Phys.

But limited by gain narrowing effect; conventional CPA technology is quite hard to get less than 30fs at high energy level. Non-collinear optical parametric amplification (NOPA) looks more and more attractive for generating super-broadbandwidth pulses which is possible to be compressed to ultra-short pulses. Previous NOPAs; pumped by 400nm pulses; were using BBO crystals to reach shorter signal pulse durations. But the associated spectral bandwidths are still strongly linked with higher order nonlinear effects. which make it quite difficult to get higher energy with short pulse duration. Here we proposed to use pre-chirped few nm bandwidths around 515nm pumped pulses to amplify ultra-short pulses centered at 800nm. In our setup; we have found just one dramatical geometry configuration which support that we have possibility to get amplification from 720nm to 900nm; which will support to less than 10fs by well re-compression.

The main attention is paid to the case of ultrarelativistic motion. First; for the case of point charge; we obtain the approximate formulas which are valid in the far-field zone and in the vicinity of the charge trajectory. These expressions predict the beating behavior of the far field and the harmonic behavior of the near field. Moreover; the magnitude of the longitudinal components of both electric and magnetic field as well as the transversal electric field possess singularity on the charge trajectory. Second; using formulas for the point charge field as Green function; we develop an effective algorithm for calculation of the bunch wakefield. Plots of wakefields produced by typical bunches are given. Prospects of using the bunch field properties for further development of the plasma wakefield acceleration technique are discussed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupea049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupea049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupea049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPEA049,

As full energy injector for the MAX IV rings; a thermionic gun will be used to create electrons. However a photocathode gun planned for a short pulse facility (SPF) will deliver small emittance and ultra-short electron bunches that will be suitable to also drive a Free-Electron Laser. Moreover extending the linac energy with 1 or 2 GeV will give the opportunity to get closer to 1 Angstrom radiation with much more flexibility and better performances. Given these opportunities at the MAX IV laboratory; a free electron laser is envisaged in the long term perspective of the facility. In this study we investigate the case of a 5 GeV machine which can produce radiation in the X-ray region. The FEL design will benefit from the implementation of self-seeding; to enhance stability of the central wavelength and spectral bandwidth. Tapering along variable gap undulators will help to extract the maximum photon flux and increase the brilliance of the source.

For this option; geometric constraints for radio protection reasons would limit the maximum proton beam energy to 300 GeV.

The sequence of bunches can be divided into exciting and accelerated parts in any proportion by means at the proper detuning of bunch repetition frequency relative to the frequency of principle eigen mode of the resonator. A train of 6000 electron bunches; each of energy 4.5МeV; charge 0.16nC; duration 60psec; diameter 1.0cm; and angular spread 0.05 mrad is produced with the linear resonant accelerator. Bunch repetition frequency is 2805 MHz and can be varied within 2MHz by changing master oscillator frequency. Bunches are injected into copper rectangular waveguide of cross-section 8.5x18.0cm2 and length 75cm along wide sides of which Teflon plates are placed.

Presently; the energy range of the gamma-beam is from 1 MeV to about 100 MeV; with the maximum total gamma-flux of more then 1010 gammas per second around 10 MeV. Production of high intensity; high energy gamma-beams of 60 to 100 MeV; using UV-VUV mirrors of 240 to 190 nm; requires high energy; high current electron beams of 0.9 to 1.05 GeV. Synchrotron radiation damage to the FEL mirrors becomes crucial for VUV FEL operation at or below 190 nm. The edge radiation (ER) from the End-of-Arc (EOA) bending magnet; instead of the radiation of FEL wigglers; is the dominant cause of a rapid degradation of the downstream FEL mirror. In this work; we describe a further development of the “soft” orbit bump concept to significantly reduce the radiation exposure to the mirror from the EOA dipole magnet. The bump uses designated ""soft"" orbit correctors with magnetic field limited to produce a radiation with a critical wavelength close or below the FEL wavelength.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupea074_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupea074.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupea074_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPEA074,

This technology permits more compact accelerators. One of our aims at the Colorado State University Accelerator Laboratory is to adapt this technology to our L-band (1.3 GHz) accelerator system to increase our overall beam energy; however; we would like to do this in a passive manner; i.e. one that does not require investment in an expensive; custom; high-power klystron system. In this paper we explore using the beam from our L-band 6 MeV photoinjector to power an x-band structure tuned to the 9th harmonic of our L-band system; 11.7 GHz. Electron bunches will be generated at a repetition rate of 81.25 MHz and passed through a high shunt impedance x-band accelerating structure where they will resonantly excite the fundamental field. We will optimize the system to create the highest accelerating potential within this structure. Once the peak gradient is achieved we will send a single electron bunch through the system at a phase that places it on the crest of the X-band accelerating wave thereby increasing the electron bunch energy by some amount without need for additional external power sources.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupea075_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupea075.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupea075_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPEA075,

These devices come in a variety of configurations but share the use of lasers as power sources and dielectrics as the primary building material. While these devices have many of the same characteristics and dynamics as conventional accelerating structures; they operate in a dramatically different regime. One version of these DLAs is the Micro Accelerator Platform (MAP): a slab-symmetric device operated with a standing wave (Pi-mode) and powered by a transversely coupled laser. The coupler is essentially a transmissive diffraction grating and therefore reinforced the desired mode. The remainder of the structure is composed of two Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) which serve to form a resonant cavity in an evacuated bounded by the reflectors. The MAP has now undergone experimental testing at SLAC’s E-163.

It will include two new Free Electron Lasers (FELs) to generate soft and hard X-ray radiation. The 2.9 km LCLS-II lattice will include 1/3 of the SLC linac located just before the existing LCLS; the 1.2 km bypass line; the bend section; the beam separation and diagnostic regions; and the FEL undulators and dump. The LCLS operation showed that occasionally the beam phase space may be significantly mismatched due to various errors in the beamline. This requires correction to ensure good beam quality in the undulators. Similarly; the LCLS-II must have lattice correction system with a large tuning range to cancel such errors. Since the various LCLS-II regions are connected using matching sections; the latter naturally can be used for correction of the mismatched lattice functions. In addition; the large tuning capability is required to provide a wide range of focusing conditions at the FEL undulators. The compensation and tuning abilities of the LCLS-II lattice have been studied for incoming beam errors equivalent to 160% of beta beat and for a factor of 5 in the range of undulator quadrupole strengths.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupea085_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupea085.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupea085_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPEA085,

Electron clouds induce unwanted pressure rise; heat loads on the beam screens of the superconducting magnets and beam instabilities. Operation with bunch spacing of 50 ns in 2011 and 2012 has required decreasing the Secondary Electron Yield of the beam screens below the multipacting threshold for beams with this bunch spacing. This was achieved by continuous electron bombardment induced by operating the machine with high intensity beams with 50 and 25 ns spacing during dedicated periods at injection energy (450 GeV) and at top energy (3.5 and 4 TeV). The evolution of the Secondary Electron Yield during these periods; at different sections of the machine; can be estimated by pressure; heat load and by bunch-by-bunch RF stable phase measurements.

The muon linac consists of the initial acceleration (to 0.01 of v/c); bunching section (0.01 to 0.08 of v/c); low beta section (0.08 to 0.3 of v/c); middle beta section (0.3 to 0.7 of v/c) and high beta section (0.7 to 0.94 of v/c).

To overcome this limitation a different crossing angle scheme was proposed in 2007 by W. Herr and Y. Papaphilippou. The new schema implies a vertical external crossing angle that together with the horizontal internal crossing angle; from the LHCb dipole and its three compensator magnets; defines a new tilted crossing and separation plane providing enough beam separation at the parasitic encounters.

An important constraint comes from the event pile–up for one bunch crossing that should not exceed 140 events per bunch crossing. With bunches every 25 ns the luminosity for data taking of the experiments should therefore not exceed 5*1034 s−1cm-2. For the optimisation of the integrated luminosity it is planned to design HL-LHC for much higher luminosity than acceptable for the experiments and to limit the initial luminosity by operating with larger beam size at the collision points. During the fill; the beam size will be slowly reduced to keep the luminosity constant. The gain from luminosity levelling depends on the average length of the fills. Today; with the LHC operating at 4 TeV; most fills are terminated due to equipment failures; resulting in an average fill length of about 5 h. In this paper we discuss the expected integrated luminosity for HL-LHC as a function of fill length and time between fills; depending on the expected MTBF of the LHC systems with HL-LHC parameters.

The LHC superconducting circuits will be consolidated; mitigation measures will be carried out to reduce the single event effects occurrence in the frame of the Radiation To Electronics mitigation project (R2E); all the equipment will be fully maintained. In parallel; numerous consolidation and upgrade activities will be performed all around the 27km ring. The schedule has been optimized in order to reduce the length of the shutdown (LS1) to 22 months (including hardware commissioning). The organization of the works is therefore essential to ensure a safe and reliable plan. This paper introduces the various activities to be performed and presents the schedule and the preparation process; including the operational safety aspects.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupfi013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupfi013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupfi013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPFI013,

The variants at collision energies must be compatible with the ATS* scheme which provides small beta function at the IP1 and IP5 or provide low beta function for Alice and LHCb during ion operatations. The ones at injection must satisfy injection transfer lines and aperture constraints. The final goal is to find the overlap between the phase advances of all the configuration for IR2 and IR8 respectively; in order to mainting the LHC working point without rematching the remaining insertions.; * S.

This will result in much higher peak beta functions in the inner triplet (IT) quadrupoles adjacent to these IPs. The consequences are a larger beam size in these quadrupoles; higher IT chromaticity; and stronger effects of the IT field errors on dynamic aperture (DA). The IT chromaticity will be compensated using the Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing scheme*. The increased IT beam size will be accommodated by installing large aperture Nb3Sn superconducting quadrupoles with 150 mm coil diameter. The field error tolerances in these magnets must satisfy the required acceptable DA while being reasonably close to realistically achievable field quality.

These include Nb3Sn superconducting (SC) triplet quadrupoles; Nb-Ti SC separation dipoles D1 and D2; and SC Q4 quadrupoles. The upgrade significantly reduces the beta functions at these IRs; producing higher beta functions and larger beam size in these magnets; and requiring a larger aperture. The high beta functions also increase the impact of high order field errors in these new magnets on dynamic aperture (DA). Therefore; to maintain an acceptable DA; new specifications for the magnet field quality are required. Since the IR error effects at collision are dominated by the triplets; their field quality has been studied and specified first*. As a next step; the field errors were added to the D1 and D2 dipoles and Q4 quadrupoles while maintaining the triplet errors to specifications. The impact of the errors on DA has been determined in long term tracking simulations using SixTrack. The optimized field error specifications for the D1; D2 and Q4 magnets are presented.; * Y.

The baseline-capturing layout consists of a series of solenoids producing a tapered magnetic field from 20 T; near the target; down to 1.5 T at the entrance of the drift section where the captured pions decay into muons to produce a useful beam for the machine. In our alternative layout the magnetic field is rapidly squeezed from 20 T to 1.5T using only three solenoids.

The tolerance to the misalignment of the different components has to be determined in order on one hand to set the limits beyond which the performance of the Front-End channel would be degraded; on the other hand to optimize the design and assembly of the Front-End cells such that the component alignment can be checked and corrected for where crucial for the performance of the channel.

Depending on the available magnet technology (Nb3Sn or NbTi) a number of beam optics has been developed to define the specifications for the new super conducting quadrupoles. In the context of the optics matching new issues have been addressed and new concepts have been used: Quadrupole strength flexibility and chromatic corrections have been studied; as well as the influence of quadrupole fringe fields. The lattice has been optimised including the needs of the foreseen crab cavities and the transition between injection and low β optics had to guarantee smooth gradient changes over a wide range of β* values. Tolerances on misalignments and power converter ripple have been re-evaluated. Finally the combination of the quadrupole strengths in the high luminosity matching sections with those in the neighboring sectors is explained; a key concept of the ATS to reach smallest β* values. This paper presents the results obtained within the HiLumi collaboration Task 2.2 and summarises the main parameters of the project.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupfi023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupfi023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupfi023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPFI023,

The beam dynamics of those high intensity lead beams are strongly influenced by intra-beam scattering (IBS); especially on the injection plateau. Each batch injected from the SPS spends a different time at injection; introducing significant changes from batch to batch. Within the batches there is an even larger spread imprinted by the SPS injection plateau. This results in a spread of the luminosity produced in each bunch crossing. The particle losses during collisions are dominated by nuclear electromagnetic processes; leading to a non-exponential intensity decay during the fill and short luminosity lifetime at 3.5 Z TeV. The luminosity; emittance; intensity and bunch length evolution of the 2011 run was analysed bunch-by-bunch and compared with simulations.

A breakdown of the growth through the different phases of the LHC cycle is given as well as a comparison with the data from the LHC experiments for transverse beam size.

This tune spread can originate from dedicated non-linear magnets such as octupoles; or through the beam-beam interaction. In the latter case we have to distinguish the contribution from head-on and parasitic beam-beam interactions and the collision pattern of different bunches plays an important role.

Primary collimators were moved in small steps down to 2 σ from the beam axis to allow for measurements of very forward proton scattering in special high-beta runs in the LHC. We studied the reduction in intensity as a function of collimator position which provides information about the halo shape. After scraping at 2 σ; collimators were retracted to 2.5 σ. This allowed for measurements of very forward proton-proton scattering with roman pot detectors at 3 σ from the beam axis at acceptable background levels for about an hour. Good background conditions were restored by another scraping with primary collimators at 2 σ.

The transition from injection to collision optics will be carried out in two stages; and will involve varying the strengths of the quadrupoles within the straight sections. Solutions for the optics transition have to meet a variety of challenging constraints; including constraints on the phase advances and Twiss parameters throughout the straights involved in the transition; specified minimum and maximum strengths of the quadrupoles; etc. Moreover; to minimize the time taken for the transition; the variation of the quadrupole strengths should be as smooth as possible; especially for the strongest quadrupoles. Avoiding changes of slope as much as possible will also minimize hysteresis effects in the super-conducting matching quadrupoles participating to the process.

In addition; for the higher muon beam intensity; the effects of the beam itself on the cavity fields in the accelerating mode are non-negligible (beam loading).

The baseline design for NuSTORM uses what was called “stochastic injection”. In that method; high-energy protons on a nuclear target produce pions that are directed by a chicane into a straight section of the storage ring. Pions that decay within that straight section can provide lower-energy muons that are within the circulating acceptance of the storage ring. This decay acceptance enables injection for multiple storage ring turns without kickers; and muon accumulation can be reasonably high.

Inc.; USA; LBNL; Berkeley; California; USA; BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; SBU; Stony Brook; USA; There is a strong limit of available RF gradient in a vacuum RF cavity under magnetic fields because the magnetic field enhances a dark current density due to electron focusing and increases probability of an electric breakdown. This limits the cooling performance. A dense hydrogen gas filled RF cavity can break this limit because the gas acts as a buffer of dark current. However; RF power loading due to a beam-induced plasma in a dense gas filled RF cavity (plasma loading effect) is crucial to design the practical cavity. Experiment shows that the plasma loading can be mitigated in denser hydrogen gas and by doping a small amount of electronegative gas in the cavity. A complicate plasma chemical reaction should be dominated in such a dense hydrogen gas condition. A beam-induced plasma is simulated by taking into account the plasma chemistry to reproduce the condition by using the supercomputer at LBNL.

Higgs bosons can be produced in reasonable amounts in the s-channel; so that the colliding muon beam energy of just 62.5GeV is required. Precision direct measurements of the Higgs boson mass and width is possible due to absence of brems- and beam-strahlung. At the same time; there are difficulties specific to muon colliders: relatively large beam emittance which necessitates quite small beta-function values (~ a few cm) at the interaction point in order to obtain sufficiently high luminosity; as well as superconducting magnet and detector protection from showers generated by muon decay products. Due to these factors; the required aperture of the final focus quadrupoles is very large (up to 0.5 m) posing challenging engineering constraints as well as beam dynamics issues with fringe fields. The first results of a complex approach to these problems in the Higgs Factory collider design are presented which promise luminosities in excess of 1031 cm-2s−1 with a 4 MW proton driver.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupfi061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupfi061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupfi061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPFI061,

Since the end of the 2011 LHC run the light extraction system; based on a retractable mirror; has suffered deformation and mechanical failure that is correlated to the increase in beam intensity. Temperature probes have associated these observations to a strong heating of the mirror support with a dependence on the longitudinal bunch length and shape; indicating the origin as electromagnetic coupling between the beam and the structure. This paper combines all this information with the aim of characterising and improving the system in view of its upgrade during the current LHC shutdown.

The choice of hydrogen gas provides the additional benefit of cooling a beam of muons. A beam of particles traversing the cavity; be it muons or protons; ionizes the gas; creating an electron-ion plasma which absorbs energy from the cavity. The ionization rate can be calculated from a beam intensity measurement. Energy loss measurements indicate the loading per RF cycle per electron-ion pair range from 10-18 to 10-16 Joules in pure hydrogen; and 10-20 to 10-18 Joules when hydrogen is doped with dry air. The addition of an electronegative gas (oxygen) has been observed to reduce the lifetime of ionization electrons in the cavity to below 1 nanosecond. Additionally; the recombination rate of electrons and hydrogen ions has been measured to be on the order of 10-6 cubic centimeters per second.

The ultimate Step VI configuration of the MICE cooling channel; a section of the one proposed in the Neutrino Factory Study II; will demonstrate a 10% reduction in transverse beam emittance measured at the level of 1%. This requires measuring emittance to 0.1%. This measurement will be made using all beam line elements present in the MICE Step IV configuration with the addition of two low-Z absorber modules and two RF-Coupling Coil (RFCC) modules. The RFCC modules each contain four normal-conducting low frequency (201 MHz) RF cavities with a guiding magnetic field provided by a large diameter coupling coil. Each of these cavities will require approximately 1 MW of RF power in a 1 ms pulse at a rate of 1 Hz.

A proposed scheme to reduce the radial size of RF cavities at a given resonance frequency is to insert a dielectric material into the RF cavity. In vacuum cavities; however; dielectric materials are extremely susceptible to breakdown in high power conditions. High-pressure hydrogen gas has been shown to inhibit breakdown events in RF cavities in strong magnetic fields. An experiment has been designed to test surface breakdown of alumina in RF cavities. A structure has been designed to maximize the parallel field parallel to the surface while bringing the cavity into a desired frequency range (800-810MHz).

DESY has contributed a systematic design integration approach; which helps to achieve a complete; correct and consistent design. We use the lattice as the leading element for design integration. Geometry information including 3D visualization models are derived from the lattice; and are used to ensure that the beamlines fit and suited for access and installation. The 3D models are also used as basis for tunnel and cavern layout. As detailed designs of components become available; the lattice is adjusted and the overall models are iterated. Lists of components are derived from the lattice and are used to generate a component bill of materials; which in turn serves as basis for cost estimation and installation planning. An integrated 3D model of the entire accelerator and all the civil construction elements helps to optimize the design for example with regard to space efficiency; ease of access for installation; and life safety.

This effect can be compensated to some extend by the choice of undulator parameters and an optimized capture section.

As an example; the case for a B-factory based on the crab-waist collision scheme has been studied. During the machine design all the effects that determine the beam lifetime and induce backgrounds in the detector have been analyzed in details. The crab-waist scheme provides an higher luminosity; but at the same time it induces higher beam losses at the final focus. For this reason single beam effects such as Touschek and beam-gas scattering have been studied in details; by means of a macroparticle tracking code developed for this purpose*. Also Radiative Bhabha scattering; that is the dominant effect to lifetime and backgrounds has been studied with the same technique to check possible multiturn losses at IR. An efficient collimation system has been designed to intercept scattered particles that would be lost in the IR in both the horizontal and the vertical plane.

To understand the beam dynamics; we simulate the microwave instability using Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) solver. The longitudinal wake potential is calculated as a sum of the contributions due to vacuum chamber components distributed around the ring; including geometry wake field and CSR wake. To improve the accuracy of the simulation of microwave instability; the coherent synchrotron radiation impedance is calculated to very high frequency to get more accurate wake field with a short bunch. The CSR wake is much larger than the geometry wake. The threshold is just above the design current and saw-tooth type of instability is found above the threshold.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupme017_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupme017.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupme017_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPME017,

This can be done in a compact way based on a local chromaticity correction. Two important issues are beam-beam induced radiation effects and the optical correction strategy to mitigate static and dynamic imperfections. For a small enough beam energy spread; we investigate the possibility to get a smaller vertical beam size; at the expense of a larger horizontal beam size; by re-optimising the final focus optics with chromatic correction mainly in the vertical plane. Firstly; we track the beam with MAD-X; with and without chromaticity correction; to estimate the optimum betax and betay values by rematching the linear optics; and cross-check and improve the rematching procedure with MAPCLASS.

The energy needed to accelerate a low intensity ""main"" beam is provided by a high intensity; low energy ""drive"" beam. The precision and stability of the phase relation between two beams is crucial for the performance of the scheme. The tolerable phase jitter is 0.2 deg rms at 12GHz. For this reason it is fundamental to understand the main possible causes of the drive beam timing jitter. Experimental work aimed at such understanding was done in the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) where a drive beam with characteristics similar to the CLIC one is produced. Several phase measurements allowed us to conclude that the main source of phase jitter is energy jitter of the beam transformed and amplified into phase jitter when passing through a magnetic chicane.

The impact of this optics in the performance of the LHC ion beam is studied here; especially with respect to collective effects; at the SPS injection energy. In particular; the potential gain of the increased beam sizes provided by this optics; with respect to losses and emittance blow up due to space-charge and Intrabeam Scattering (IBS) is evaluated. The measured lifetime is compared with the one provided by the Touschek effect and its interplay with RF noise is studied.

Especially the misaligned quadrupoles create dispersion and hence the beam quality is decreased gradually due to an effect called chromatic dilution. Over longer time periods; orbit feedback systems are not capable to fully recover the beam quality and have to be supplemented by dispersion correction algorithms. In this paper; such and dispersion correction algorithm is presented; which is an extended version of the well-known dispersion free steering algorithm. This extended algorithm can recover the beam quality over long time scaled without stopping the accelerator operation (on-line). Tolerances for different imperfections of the system have been identified and a strong sensitivity to the resolution of the wake field monitors of the main linac accelerating structures has been identified. This problem can be mitigated by using a local excitation scheme as will be shown in this work.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupme048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupme048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupme048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPME048,

The quality of the measurement of this matrix can be improved over time by statistically combining the effects of small system excitations with the help of system identification algorithms. These small excitations can be applied in a parasitic mode without stopping the accelerator operation (on-line).

Breakdowns in the high-gradient accelerator structures can deflect the beam and decrease the desired luminosity. The limitations of the accelerating structures due to breakdowns have been studied so far without a beam present in the structure. The presence of the beam modifies the distribution of the electrical and magnetic field distributions; which determine the breakdown rate. Therefore an experiment has been designed for high power testing a CLIC prototype accelerating structure with a beam present in the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3).

The result is that the beam is skewed in the horizontal-longitudinal plane. The skew angle is proportional to the V15 term of the 6X6 coupling matrix which is proportional to the RF cavity voltage and the horizontal dispersion in the cavity. Here we report experiments at CesrTA where x-z coupling was explored using three distinct lattice configurations with different V15 coupling terms. We explore x-z coupling for each of these lattices by measuring the horizontal projection of the beam with a beam size monitor; as the RF voltage is varied. The first lattice has about 1 m dispersion in the RF cavities; resulting in a V15 term at the beam size monitor source point corresponding to 16 mrad x-z tilt. In the second; the V15 generated in one pair of cavities is compensated at the second pair by adjusting the horizontal betatron phase advance between the cavity pairs. In the third; the optics are adjusted so that the RF cavity region is dispersion-free; eliminating the coupling entirely.

A peculiarity of the layout of the storage ring is that horizontal emittance is generated predominantly by the strong bends in the sextant of the ring that was designed with a long straight to accommodate the interaction region required for operation as an electron-positron collider. By reconfiguring that single sextant we reduce the emittance by 60% to 20 nm-rad at 5.3 GeV for x-ray production and with damping wigglers to 1.3 nm-rad at 2.1 GeV for investigations of low emittance phenomena. The 35 meter radius of curvature; 3.2 meter long dipoles are refitted as combined function (vertically focusing) magnets to create simple achromats. The layout can accommodate six; 3 meter long undulators; in addition to the six existing superconducting damping wigglers.

Such photon colliders usually rely on Compton back-scattering for generating high energy gamma photons and further Higgs bosons through gamma-gamma collisions. The presently existing proposals or design concepts all have chosen a very thick laser target (i.e.; high laser photon intensity) for Compton scatterings. In this paper; we present a new design concept of a gamma-gamma collider utilizing a thin laser target (i.e.; relatively low photon density); thus leading to a low electron to gamma photon conversion rate. This new concept eliminates most useless and harmful low energy soft gamma photons from multiple Compton scattering so the detector background is improved. It also greatly relaxes the requirement of the high peak power of the laser; a significant technical challenge. A high luminosity for such a gamma-gamma collider can be achieved through an increase of the bunch repetition rate and current of the driven electron beam. Further; multi-pass recirculating linac could greatly reduce the linac cost and energy recovery is required to reduce the needed RF power.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupme067_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupme067.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupme067_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPME067,

In such machines; not only high beam power but also high space charge are the major challenges. This double concern often induces conflicting issues; which should be overcome from the accelerator design stage. It progressively appears that the usual methods are no more sufficient. Even new concepts are to be invented. With mega-watt beams; losses and also micro-losses must be minimised while with very strong space charge; few room can be reserved for beam diagnostics. New strategies for design and tuning are to be carried out. The beam itself can no more be described only by its classical values like emittance and Twiss parameters. Core and halo parts should be instead precisely defined and kept under surveillance. The beam phase space distribution itself becomes determinant; which is very far from waterbag or gaussian distributions.

Single and multibunch tracking are performed using wake fields that were numerically obtained using GdfidL for the ensemble of the vacuum components. A special effort was made to include dynamically the effect of harmonic cavities that lengthen the bunch and introduce Landau damping; whose details are described in the companion paper *.

The moveable magnet array of the undulator is installed inside the vacuum chamber to achieve shorter wavelength synchrotron radiation. A thin metal foil covers the magnet structure to mitigate resistive wall wakefields. Moveable tapered transitions connect the magnet structure and the adjacent vacuum duct to reduce the geometric wakefields. Nevertheless these moveable tapered transitions contribute significantly to the impedance budget of PETRA III. The computer codes MAFIA; CST-Studio and PBCI have been used to calculate the longitudinal and transverse wakefields.

The present bunch by bunch feedback system; operating in a narrowband mode; has been effectively suppressing these instabilities; allowing the beam power to reach 230kW with only 400W of particle losses. The observed beam signals show that bunches are still executing complicated intra-bunch oscillations even if the narrowband feedback system is on; though they are not imposing significant particle losses at present. The new and more advanced broadband feedback system has been developed for control of the intra-bunch oscillations and further reduction of particle losses. The elaborate analysis code has been also developed on the MATLAB platform to analyse effects of the broadband feedback system on intra-bunch oscillations.

As the beam intensity in CYCIAE-14 is high; the beam emittance should be controlled strictly in order to reduce the beam loss in the cyclotron. Precessional mixing and resonance crossing are the two main factors leading to emittance growth in the cyclotron with stripping extraction. In this paper; the physical mechanism of precessional mixing in a stripping extraction cyclotron is investigated.

The magnetic filed can not be absolutely ideal because of imperfections during manufacturing and installation of this big magnet. Therefore the influence of the magnetic field errors on the beam behavior should be studied to provide the reference for magnet mapping and shimming. Magnetic field errors in a cyclotron will excite coherent oscillations through displacing the center of orbit or distorting the transverse phase space. This effect is especially important in the CYCIAE-100 cyclotron because there are a number of different turns in the extracted beam. The tolerances for the magnetic field errors are given in this paper based on analytic calculations and numerical simulations. The resonances vr=1; 2vr=2 driven by the 1st; 2nd harmonic magnetic field are considered; which will result in the radial emittance growth .Besides that; the resonances cause the vertical emittance growth are considered.

The accelerator uses two families (β=0.63 and β=0.82 ) of elliptical five cell superconducting cavities. High Order Modes can severely limit the operation of these cavities. Monopole modes are found by Microwave Studio CST. Then the longitudinal instability caused by these monopole modes are primarily investigated with code bbusim; taking into account of effects like High Order Modes frequency spread; beam input jitters and other beam and RF parameters of the beams and cavities. Preliminary simulation results show that monopole modes induced instability is not a problem if High Order Modes frequency spread is not less than 1MHz.

Recently the same measurement technique was used again; revealing a strong high frequency resonance. During the slow de-bunching with the RF switched off; the presence of different resonant impedances leads to a line density modulation at the resonant frequencies. Longitudinal profiles of bunches of various intensities were acquired. For sufficiently high intensities their spectra show a fast growing and strong modulation at 1.4 GHz.

High harmonic RF system; operating in bunch lengthening mode is used in many accelerators with space charge or inductive impedance to reduce the peak line density or stabilize the beam. An analytical approach; based on emerging of the discrete Van Kampen modes; shows that improved stability in a double RF system can be achieved only below some critical value of longitudinal emittance. Above this threshold; a phase shift of more than 15 degrees between the two RF components is proven to stabilize the bunch. These results; confirmed also by particle simulations; are able to explain now observations during the ppbar operation of the SPS.

Particularly some of the double-bellow modules; called VMTSA modules; were found to have deformed RF fingers and a broken spring which ensured good contact between them and a central insert.

Growth of the emittance in the dispersive transversal direction due to the additional excitation of betatron oscillations limits this type of cooling. Here we present the results of further studies on the fast cooling process; looking at the effect of the coupling of the transverse (betatron) oscillations. We first show theoretically that the transverse betatron coupling shortens the cooling time and hence reduces the steady-state energy spread of the electron beam; as well as the quantum losses.

In this experimental study; conducted on the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER); large-amplitude perturbations are purposefully generated and their propagation observed over a long transport length. It is found that narrow; large-amplitude perturbations on a long-pulse beam develop into Korteweg-deVries (KdV) type soliton wave trains. Each peak in the wave train has a constant width and amplitude over a long propagation distance; with the amplitude inversely proportional to the square of the width. Furthermore; two such pulses are seen to interact with each other and emerge from the collision unchanged. The experimental data is compared with the KdV model and particle-in-cell simulations with good agreement.

A new 5BA lattice was designed in replacement for the previous TBA lattice with the aim to reduce the emittance to sub-nm.rad values. The new design has a circumference of 518 m with 20 achromatic straight sections and a natural emittance of 0.28 nm.rad at 3 GeV for the bare lattice (without IDs). The dipoles combine low 0.58 T field magnets for the main beam deflection with a 2 T short superbend magnet sandwiched in the center dipole. This creates a longitudinal dipole gradient that is used both to lower the emittance and to provide hard X-ray dipole sources.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupwo001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupwo001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupwo001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPWO001,

The focusing properties and imaging quality of this lens type depend on the transverse and longitudinal confinement of the electron column.

This results in a shift and in a modification of the work function with a rise of aberrations and beam emittance growth.

The divergence in the range of one milli-radian at energies of some 100 MeV calls for strong focusing magnets. At the same time a chromatic correction of the magnets is needed due to the relative energy spread of a few percent. This contribution discusses in particular the layout of the beam transport optics for a diagnostic beam-line at the LWFA in Jena; Germany. The aim of this optics is to match the betatron functions and the non-zero dispersion to the x-dependent flux density amplitude of a non-planar undulator such that monochromatic undulator radiation is generated despite the large energy spread. The transport line is realized as a dogleg chicane involving several strong focusing quadrupoles. The chromatic error is compensated by additional sextupoles.

At this special mode; a normal injection scheme does not work because of the larger stored beam size and smaller ring acceptance. In order to obtain good injection efficiency; which enables top-up operation; the injected beam energy is displaced from the ring energy. The finite dispersion of 1.1 m at the injection point and the energy displacement of 0.7% reduce the betatron oscillation amplitude of the injected beam. A trade off is a synchrotron oscillation produced by the energy mismatch. Using this technique; it became possible to inject new beam using a closed fast injection bump and also a top-up operation. Although it is not possible to inject beam to a normal achromatic lattice using a closed bump. Especially in non-achromatic quasi-isochronous ring; it would be possible that the energy mismatch is reduced by the betatron amplitude dependent shift of the equilibrium energy.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/tupwo015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/tupwo015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/tupwo015_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-TUPWO015,

The usual slow extraction from a synchrotron by third-order resonance method cannot be applied in a RCS due to very short flat-top at the extraction energy. This is even more difficult when it is high-intensity synchrotron due to the strict control on beam loss. The parasitic slow extraction method to extract extremely weak beam from the RCS of CSNS has been studied in details. By moving only beam halo to a scatting foil in the arc region by a local orbit bump in about 2 ms before the fast extraction; one can extract a very small part of the scattered particles with very limited beam loss in the process. At 1.6 GeV and 62.5 A in beam power; halo particles of about 10-4 total particles are involved in the parasitic slow extraction can result in a beam intensity of 2105 protons per cycle or lower.

The effects of a 4.5T SW has been studied in SSRF including impaction on the emittance and the energy spread. To keep an undegraded storage ring performance; a local achromatic lattice is considered. The combat between the damping effect of the SW and emittance growth of local achromatic lattice is the main concern of this paper.

In some cases the bunch will traverse upwards of 100 turns; at which point the effects of space-charge may be significant. It is therefore necessary to model the electron beam transport in the ring using a code capable of both calculating the effect of and compensating for space-charge.

At the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HIGS) facility at Duke University; effort has been devoted to developing a variety of techniques to reduce the amount of radiation on the FEL mirror. One of the most effective methods was the use of a set of adjustable in-vacuum apertures to block harmonic radiation from FEL wigglers. In recent studies; it was determined that the edge radiation from the end-of-the-arc bending magnet is the main source of UV/VUV and x-ray radiation which causes mirror damage. To mitigate this effect; a soft orbit bump is designed to change the displacement and angle of the electron beam around the end-of-the-arc area. This soft orbit bump is developed using the multi-objective optimization technique. Calculation shows the soft orbit bump can significantly reduce the flux of high energy photons on the FEL mirror.

It is based on the SLAC linac with a compressor chicane in sector-10; and a second compressor chicane and final focus in sector-20 (S20). Originally; the S20 chicane was designed to be compatible with an upgrade to include a second S20 chicane for simultaneous transport of e- and e+ bunches. This placed additional optics constraints which lead to strong focusing in the S20 chicane. The latter increases the effects of errors causing emittance growth. Lately; it has been decided not to proceed with the upgrade option. Therefore; there is a potential for improving the optics by relaxing the constraints. In this study; we explore alternative optics designs where beta functions in the S20 chicane and final focus are reduced in order to minimize the error effects.

Maintaining the proton's polarization is vital and preserved primarily by application of a pair of Siberian snakes. Measurements from recent high-energy physics runs indicate polarization loss during acceleration between 100 and 250 GeV. Based on analytic estimations for off-momentum particles and/or beams; a nonzero difference in DX prime - the dispersion function angle - between the snakes can result in a shift in the spin tune; or equivalently; of the conditions of snake resonances in close proximity to the beam during acceleration. Requiring that DX prime at the two Siberian snakes in RHIC being equal would reduce the spin tune shift for off-energy particles so helping to maintain polarization during the energy ramp. Preservation of half-integer spin tune is also important for future operation of the spin flipper at store.

IPAC2013,,WEOAB103,Experimental Observations of a Multi-stream Instability in a Long Intense Beam,UMD; College Park; Maryland; USA; We have observed evidence of a multi-stream instability in a long non-relativistic space-charge dominated beam evolving with an initial non-linear distribution and zero external longitudinal containment. This type of instability can be detrimental to intense accelerators that propagate rectangular distributions; such as in a ring with single or multi-bunch injection. The longitudinal forces in these intense bunches causes the beam to expand axially; in the case of the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER); the initial long bunch is injected to fill a fraction of the ring; coasting beyond the point where the head and tail overlap. Adjacent filaments at that point are separated in velocity space by 2cs and approach a separation of cs. The onset of the instability has been observed to depend on the injected beam current; bunch length; and other experimental factors.

Such an RLA with linear-field multi-pass arcs was introduced for rapid acceleration of muons for the next generation of Muon Facilities. It allows for efficient use of expensive RF while the multi-pass arc design based on linear combined-function magnets exhibits a number of advantages over separate-arc or pulsed-arc designs. Here we describe a test of this concept by scaling a GeV scale muon design for electrons. Scaling muon momenta by the muon-to-electron mass ratio leads to a scheme; in which a 4.5 MeV electron beam is injected in the middle of a 3 MeV/pass linac with two double-pass return arcs and is accelerated to 18 MeV in 4.5 passes. All spatial dimensions including the orbit distortion are scaled by a factor of 7.5; which arises from scaling the 200 MHz muon RF to a readily available 1.5 GHz. The hardware requirements are not very demanding making it straightforward to implement. Such an RLA may have applications going beyond muon acceleration: in medical isotope production; radiation cancer therapy and homeland security.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/weoab202_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/weoab202.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/weoab202_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEOAB202,
IPAC2013,,WEOAB203,The PEPPo Concept for a Polarized Positron Source,LPSC; Grenoble; France; Polarized positron beams are identified as an essential ingredient for the experimental program at the next generation of lepton accelerators (JLab; Super KEK B; ILC; CLIC). A proof-of-principle experiment for a new method to produce polarized positrons has recently been performed at the Jefferson Laboratory. The PEPPo (Polarized Electrons for Polarized Positrons) concept relies on the production of polarized e+e− pairs from the bremsstrahlung radiation of a longitudinally polarized electron beam interacting within a high Z conversion target. The experiment was performed at the injector of the CEBAF accelerator at JLab and investigated the polarization transfer of an 8.3 MeV/c polarized electron beam to positrons produced in varying production target thicknesses. A dedicated new beam-line was constructed to produce; collect and transport positrons in the momentum range of 3.2 MeV/c to 6.2 MeV/c to a polarized iron target for polarization measurements. This technique potentially opens a new pathway for both high energy and thermal polarized positron beams.

To resolve the ultra-short terahertz pulses emitted by a single bunch; thin YBCO superconducting film detectors have been developed. A response time of 45ps was determined as the FWHM at the output of the analog amplifier. A novel and high accuracy data acquisition architecture for sampling of the individual ultra-short terahertz pulses combined with real-time data processing based on GPUs for coherent synchrotron radiation is presented. The digitizer board is a made-in-house board designed for sampling of the fast pulse signals with pulse width between few tens of picosecond until 100ps.

One of the advantages of these light sources is the possibility to obtain a small longitudinal beam size. To help reduce it; the longitudinal dispersion should be non-zero in some arcs of the accelerator. However small deviations in voltages of the accelerating structures can be enhanced by induced fields from circulating bunches due to the dependence of the flight time on the energy spread and the high quality factor of the superconducting radio-frequency cavities. Therefore; instabilities related with interactions of the electron bunches and longitudinal modes of the cavities can develop in the installation. Stability conditions for the interactions with fundamental accelerating mode of the split accelerating system are discussed.

Direct measurements may be performed when the beam is extracted to a beam line; where destructive methods are available. However; light sources can tolerate internal beam dumping and thus do not have an extraction line in general. We; therefore; propose a diagnostic dedicated extraction line; motivated by precise determination of the geometrical vertical emittance; which can be a few pm or even less and general comparisons of direct and indirect measurements. Such an extraction beam line has been realized in several accelerator facilities; e.g. KEK-ATF.

Alternating the direction of the bends in the DBA lattice turns the ring into a linear transport line; which has advantages over the straight transport lines typically used in linac FEL's. The dipoles in the DBA cells provide synchrotron images of the electron beam; a real-time non-destructive diagnostic during operation. As in circular machines; sections between DBA cells provide a low-emittance dispersion free beam for insertion devices such as FEL's and inverse Compton backscattering sources. This paper describes an example linear DBA; which has been designed and commissioned as part of the MkV 40 MeV electron accelerator facility at the University of Hawaii.; * Renate Chasman and G.

With sufficient peak current; the beam brightness of such an “ultimate” storage ring may be sufficient to drive a short-wavelength; high-gain FEL. However; the large energy spread intrinsic to storage rings hinders the FEL applications for x-ray wavelengths. To overcome this problem; we adopt the transverse-gradient undulator concept[**][***] to study a high-gain FEL in an ultimate storage ring. Using PEP-X as an example; we showed from simulations that a high-gain FEL at the photon energy 1keV with a peak power of a few hundred megawatts can be achieved within a saturation length of 100 meters.; * Y.

The purpose of this test was to determine if an ERL is capable of meeting the stringent requirements imposed by the use of a 1018/cm3 internal gas target proposed for the DarkLight experiment*. Minimal beamline modifications were made to create a machine configuration that is substantially different from those used in routine UV or IR FEL operation. A sustained (8 hour) high power beam run was performed; with clean transmission through a 2 mm transverse aperture of 127 mm length simulating the target configuration. A beam size of 50 um (rms) was measured near the center of the aperture. Experimental data from a week-long test run consistently exhibited beam loss of only a few ppm on the aperture while running 4.5 mA current at 100 MeV – or nearly 0.5 MW beam power. This surpassed the users’ expectation and demonstrated a unique capability of an ERL for this type of experiments.

We believe that cooling conditions have an additional impact; as they appear to influence the amount of trapped flux and hence the residual resistance. We have constructed a test stand using niobium rods to study flux trapping. Here we can precisely control the temperature and approach Tc from below in the superconducting state. Although the sample remains in the superconducting state; a change in the amount of trapped flux is visible. The procedure can be applied repeatedly resulting in a significantly lowered level of trapped flux in the sample. Furthermore; simulations using the Radia software package for Mathematica developed by the ESR were used to better unterstand the measured changes in magnetic flux around the Sample. Applying a similar procedure for minimization of trapped magnetic flux to a superconducting cavity could allow for reduction of the magnetic contribution to the surface resistance and result in a significant improvement of Q0.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepwo004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepwo004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepwo004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPWO004,

One of the main sources of detuning a cavity is microphonics. These low-frequent vibrations caused by vacuum pumps or underground noise are transferred to the cryostat and excite mechanical resonances of the cavity which may lead to frequency shifts larger than the bandwidth. To determine the mechanical resonance frequencies of the sc 325 MHz CH-cavity (Crossbar-H-Mode) simulations with ANSYS Workbench have been performed in a first step. Additionally; microphonics measurements were taken at room temperature as well as in a vertical cryostat at 4K in the cryo-lab of the IAP; Frankfurt University.

High-current operation requires an effective damping of higher-order modes (HOMs) of the 1.3 GHz main-linac cavities. Consequently it is important; at the SRF cavity design optimization stage; to calculate the external quality factors of HOMs to avoid beam break up (BBU) instabilities. The optimization of the SRF cavity design consists of two steps. In the first step the cavities' end half-cells are tuned with respect to field flatness; effective shunt impedance and geometrical factor of the fundamental accelerating mode using robust eigenmode simulations. The second step involves frequency domain simulations and the extraction of external quality factors of HOMs from transmission S-parameter spectra using vector fitting procedure and an automated scheme to remove non-static poles **. The eigenmode; as well as the frequency domain simulations are performed using CST Microwave Studio ***.; * A.

The welding sequence of such a complex structure; foresees many welding operations. The welding parameters depend on many variables as the material thickness; but also on the component temperature before each weld. This paper presents a technique to measure the temperature of Nb components in vacuum during the EBW operation using an IR pyrometer placed outside the vacuum chamber through an appropriate vacuum viewport. With the current configuration the system can measure temperatures up to 350°C in the vacuum conditions of the EBW vacuum chamber (10-5-10-6 mbar). The technique was used to optimize the time interval between each subsequent equatorial weld operation during Nb cavities production at Ettore Zanon; increasing the welding procedure reliability and decreasing the waiting time by control of the temperatures in the weld region. Moreover this technique can be generally used for in vacuum measurements of components from room temperature up to about 350 °C. Future developments are under way to make this technique compatible with UHV and increasing the measurement range.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepwo011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepwo011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepwo011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPWO011,

The current status of this work is presented in this report. Main EM characteristics of the cavity were calculated and the shop drawings for cavity fabrication were developed. Two test-benches were assembled for RF-tests of the cavities at room temperature and at liquid helium temperature. The measured SWR was about 1.01 due to special matching device developed for that. This measurement technique was applied to the single-cell cavity from FNAL at power level nearby 10 mW. Measured resonant frequency was about 1.27 GHz; while the measured Q-factor was 2.8·104 at room temperature and more than 108 at liquid helium temperature. To evaluate mechanical properties of sheet Nb and of model materials (Cu and Al); a number of tests were made.

Before assembling the couplers to the cryomodule; it is necessary to process them using high levels of RF power. In order to perform this conditioning; the power couplers must be connected to a RF network which is fed by an RF source and ended with a load or a short-circuit; depending on the conditioning mode to be applied. A test bench has been designed for the conditioning of the SRF LINAC couplers. The main component is the “test box”; a resonant cavity where two couplers will be assembled to transmit the 200 kW from the RF source to the appropriate termination. The test box includes a large pumping port allowing an efficient pumping of the entire vacuum volume limited by the coupler ceramic windows. Several diagnostics as light detectors; vacuum gauges and thermal transducers will provide information on the relevant parameters for the control of the RF conditioning process. In addition; a support frame has been designed to maintain the whole assembly and reduce the mechanical stress on the couplers.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepwo043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepwo043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepwo043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPWO043,

IPAC2013,,WEPWO048,Investigation of a Ridge-loaded Waveguide Structure for CLIC X-band Crab Cavity,V.F. Khan; R. Calaga; A. Grudiev; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; In conventional crab cavities the TM11 mode is used to deflect the beam. In a linear collider such as CLIC; it is necessary to damp all the other modes; namely the accelerating i.e. lower order mode (LOM); same order mode (SOM) and higher order modes (HOMs). In addition to this; as the TM11 mode is not the fundamental mode; it is generally not excited with the highest shunt impedance. This necessitates damping of the high shunt impedance modes to acceptable level. Here we report on the investigation of an alternative design of the X-band crab cavity for CLIC based on ridge-loaded waveguide. In this type of cavity; the deflecting mode is the fundamental mode and has the maximum shunt impedance. However; the geometry of the cavity is chosen to optimise the ratio of group velocity to shunt impedance to minimise the effect of beam loading. The other modes are excited above the crabbing mode and are damped using wave-guides. Another advantage of this type of cavity is; unlike the conventional TM11 mode cavities; the e.m. surface fields do not peak at the iris. This provides ample margin to optimise the cavity geometry and reach the desired field distribution.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepwo048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepwo048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepwo048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPWO048,

The resonant curve distortion is created by the resonance splitting due to the ellipticity caused by manufacture tolerance and RF ports. Therefore; the measured Q values are usually lower than the simulated or theoretical Q values. In some cases; even only one mode’s Q can be measured with the 3 dB method. There may be two reasons for this happening. One is that only one mode was excited and the neighbor splitmode was close to 90° polarized; the other reason is that the resonant curve of one mode was distorted by the other mode too much to measure the 3dB range. In this paper; we resolve this issue by looking into the RF measurement setup; including cavity; input coupler and pick-up coupler; from the equivalent circuit and wave point of view.

Numerical Fourier-Hermite solutions of the Vlasov equation have been studied for over fifty years. The idea to expand the distribution function in Fourier series in space and Hermite functions in velocity is transferred to the dynamics of bunched beams in hadron synchrotrons in this contribution. The Hermite basis is a natural choice for plasmas with Maxwellian velocity profile as well as for particle beams with Gaussian momentum spread. The Fourier basis used for spatially nearly uniform plasmas has to be adapted to bunched beams where the beam profile is not uniform in phase. This is achieved analogously to the deduction of the three term recursion relations to construct orthogonal polynomials; but applied to Fourier series with the weight function taken from the Hamiltonian.

Although presently these beams are not degraded by the interaction with the electron cloud; which develops only during few milliseconds before extraction; the question if this effect could degrade the future high intensity and high brightness beams foreseen by the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project is still open. Therefore several studies are being carried out employing both simulations and measurements with the electron cloud detectors in the machine.

Therefore several electron cloud studies were performed during the 2012 run in order to get a full characterization of the behavior of the SPS with the LHC-type beams with 25 ns bunch spacing; which can be very sensitive to electron cloud effects. The collected information should allow to understand up to which extent this long period without beam operation - and the related interventions on the machine - will degrade the present conditioning state of the SPS; which has been achieved by “scrubbing” over several years. Several measurements with different beam conditions have been collected also on the electron cloud detectors installed in the machine.

However; the severe space charge effects at low injection energy limit the beam intensity. In order to raise the beam power to the design limit; one logical way is to increase the repetition rate. However; the resulting eddy current in the laminations and pipes may impair the field quality of all magnets. In addition; the activation of beam pipe becomes severer in high beam power operation. Titanium beam pipe is proposed to replace the stainless steel pipe to reduce the activation and decrease the decay time.

The present FX system consists of five pair of bipolar kickers and eight pair of bipolar septa. In order to raise the beam power to the design limit; both the beam intensity and the repetition rate will increase gradually. The FX system needs to be upgraded to satisfy the new requirements. The upgrade includes FX orbit optimization and new design of devices. Firstly; the conventional multi-turn low-field septa will be replaced by eddy current type septa. Several configurations of the new design has been studied to realize the requirements of thinner septum; higher field quality; lower leakage and higher mechanical stability.

The MA-loaded rf cavities in the MR are driven by the single harmonic (h=9) rf signals; while the cavity frequency response covers also the neighbor harmonics (h=8; 10). The wake voltage induced by the beam consists of the three harmonics (h=8; 9; 10). We employ the rf feedforward method to compensate the beam loading of these harmonics. The full-digital feedforward system was developed for the MR. We have successfully commissioned the feedforward patterns for all of eight cavities by using high intensity beams with 1.0·1014 ppp. We present the commissioning results.

IPAC2013,,WEPEA040,Space Charge and Cavity Modeling for the ESS Linac Simulator,E. Laface; M. Eshraqi; R. Miyamoto; ESS; Lund; Sweden; The proton linac of the European Spallation Source will operate at unprecedented beam power of 5 MW. Such power requires a precise modeling of the beam dynamics in order to protect its components from losses. The high peak current of 62.5 mA produces a space charge force that dominates the dynamics at low energy; while the high gradient required to accelerate up to 2 GeV in the 500 m of linac length is challenging for the dynamics in the RF cavities. This paper presents modelings of the space charge force and RF cavities used in the ESS Linac Simulator. The simulator is under development as part of the XAL on-line model; and it will be adopted for the ESS linac operations.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepea040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepea040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepea040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPEA040,

Transverse head-tail instabilities have already been observed on operational LHC beams and a stabilizing mechanism as an alternative to linear coupling is currently being studied. It consists of reducing the mode number of the transverse oscillation by changing linear chromaticity and in succession completely suppressing the instability by a transverse damper system with appropriate bandwidth. Therefore; a chromaticity correction scheme at low energy exploiting the intrinsic possibilities offered by special circuits mounted on top of the main magnet poles; the Pole Face Windings (PFW); has been examined. The presence of destructive betatron resonances; which restrict the choice of the injection working point and the maximum acceptable tune spread; forms an additional limitation for high-brightness and high-intensity beams in the CERN PS. To improve the current working point control scheme; the influence of the P F W on the machine resonances is presented in this paper.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepea043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepea043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepea043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPEA043,

Several schemes based on cascades of batch compression; bunch merging; as well as the more routine bunch splitting have been successfully commissioned and higher brightness beams have been delivered to the downstream accelerators for measurement. Despite all this complexity; longitudinal and transverse beam quality are well preserved. In addition; to fully profit from the brightness of all four PS Booster rings; the injection of twice 4 bunches into harmonic 9 buckets in the PS has been made operational as an alternative to the usual double-batch transfer of 4+2 bunches into harmonic 7.

In this context; dedicated corrector magnets are foreseen to provide semi-local corrections of specific multipole components and find the best possible compromise between the demand and what can be realistically achieved by the magnet manufacturer.

As a result the beam is much more sensitive to non-linear perturbations in this region; such as those induced by the fringe fields of the low-beta quadrupoles. The spatial extension of these fringe fields increases as well more or less linearly with the coil aperture; which is an additional motivation to analyse this aspect in detail in the framework of the High Luminosity LHC design study.

The current baseline for this upgrade is the use of the Achromatic Telescopic Squeeze (ATS) concept; which allows mini-Beta squeeze in IRs 1 and 5 (ATLAS and CMS respectively) far below that possible with nominal optics. However it is useful to both explore the parameter space of the ATS scheme while also attempting to push the boundaries of the nominal layout. This paper presents a study into maximising optical flexibility of the nominal LHC Long Straight Sections (LSSs) around IPs 1 and 5. This involves replacing; moving or adding magnets within the LSS to investigate feasibility of exploiting a more conventional optical scheme than the ATS scheme. In particular the option of replacing single LSS quadrupoles with doublets is explored. The study also looks at making similar changes to the LSS while also implementing the ATS scheme; to further explore the ATS parameter space with the benefit of experience gained into flexibility of a modified nominal LHC optical scheme.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepea058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepea058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepea058_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPEA058,

The low operating energy of 50 – 70 MeV makes the impedances of the cavity higher order modes (HOMs) particularly critical for the beam stability. Their parasitic effects on the beam can be cured by HOM frequency shifting techniques; based on a fine temperature tuning and a dedicated plunger. A typical cavity temperature stability of ± 0.05°C within a range from 35 up to 80 °C can be achieved by a precise control of its water cooling temperature. On the other hand; the tuning of the cavity fundamental mode is achieved by changing its axial length by means of a mechanical tuner.

The storage ring operates applying a fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s from 1.2 GeV to 3.5 GeV. The intended upgrade is mainly limited due to the excitation of multibunch instabilities. As a countermeasure; we succesfully commissioned state-of-the-art bunch by bunch feedback systems in the longitudinal and the two transverse dimensions. In addition; a narrow band cavity based feedback system for damping the most harmful longitudinal multi bunch mode caused by a HOM of the accelerating cavities is under construction.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepfi006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepfi006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepfi006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPFI006,

In order to be able to offer higher external beam currents one has to increase the current of the internal beam in ELSA accordingly. The beam current is limited due to excitation of multi bunch instabilities which are mainly caused by higher order modes of the two PETRA cavities used for particle acceleration in the stretcher ring. To control the resonance frequency of these modes; a variable bypass of the cavities' cooling system has been installed which allows a stabilization of their temperature. With this modification; it is possible to vary the temperature of the cavities between 26 °C and 65 °C and thus to shift the higher order modes by hundreds of kHz in frequency. Additionally; first operational studies with a prototype of a FPGA based LLRF system (Dimtel) have been performed which in future will be used to stabilize the amplitude and phase of the accelerating RF fields of the cavities.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepfi007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepfi007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepfi007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPFI007,

The chopper; consists of two deflectors; was installed on the medium-energy beam-transport line. In the operation of the RF-chopper; the fast rise/fall time of the pulse is a fundamental requirement to minimize the beam loss due to insufficient deflection to some beam bunches. In the previous system; the two series-connected chopper deflectors were driven by one solid- state amplifier. However; the fall time indicated a poor result to effect the ringing into each cavity. Therefore; the additional solid-state amplifier and low level RF system were installed in the summer 2012 and the connection changed to the parallel system from the series using two amplifiers.

The system consists of a W target with a flux concentrator followed by acc. structures surrounded by solenoids. The increase of the e+ bunch charge and the reduction of satellite bunches are the main issues for this system. The frequency choice of L-band is based on the larger transverse and longitudinal acceptances than those of the S-band one.

We lowered the core winding tension in order to improve the electrical insulation between MA ribbon layers. The lower winding tension reduced the core filling factor that is defined as the volume ratio of MA ribbons and geometrical dimensions.

For a cavity that tunes rapidly over an overall frequency range around 100-400 MHz with high Q; we use ferrite garnets exposed to an innovative new biasing method consisting of a superposition of perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields. This method leads to a significant enlargement of the high-Q cavity tuning range by defining an operation point close to the magnetic saturation and thus improving ferrite material behaviour. A further advantage of this technique is the fast tuning speed resulting from the fact that tuning is carried out either with pure parallel biasing; or together with a very small change of operating point from perpendicular bias.

At this commission stage; 100mA with 950keV beam loss is estimated to have 47.5kW beam loss for each cavity. In the meanwhile; the cavity loss at the specified 1.2MV of each cavity will be about 50kW. Therefore; coupling coefficient of 2 is required. However; the initial design specification of Petra cavity has only beta of about 1.7. Hence; the modification of the input coupler is done with the enhancement of its beta as well as advanced water cooling for some heat point. Besides; due to the two-tuner system of Petra cavity; special field-balance tuner control system is also developed.

This breakdown behavior may be due to field-emitted electrons; focused by the magnetic field into ""beamlets"" with relatively large current densities. These beamlets may then cause pulsed heating and cyclic fatigue damage on cavity interior surfaces. If this model is correct; materials with long radiation lengths (relative to copper) may alleviate the problem of RF breakdown in strong magnetic fields. To study this phenomenon; RF breakdown was induced on pairs of ""buttons"" in an 805 MHz pillbox cavity. The shape of the buttons creates a local enhancement of the surface electric field; such that breakdown occurs preferentially on the button surface. Beryllium and copper buttons were tested in order to evaluate the effect of radiation length on RF breakdown performance.

A large field enhancement factor is usually thought to come from sharp tips whose β is roughly the ratio of their height to their tip radius. For a β of few hundred; the corresponding tip height would need to be more than 10 microns; which should be visible in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). However; the estimated β from SEM images of cavity surfaces is around 10. Therefore; the physics of such large β values is still not clear. In this paper; we have studied differentμstructures and found that the magnetic field could be enhanced many times in the presence of two nearby tips with β of 10.

Specifically the normal component of the electric field on the ceramic is minimized and a traveling wave is created inside the ceramic by optimizing the shape of the window and the geometry of the joint between the circular waveguide to the rectangular waveguide.

The proposed system works in tandem with the existing 500 MHz RF separators and beam repetition rate on the lower passes. The new 5th pass RF separators will have the same basic design but modified to run at 750 MHz. The change to the beam repetition rate will be at the photo-cathode gun through an innovative upgrade of the seed laser driver system using electro-optic modulators. The new laser system also allows addition of the fourth laser. The new RF separators; the new laser system and other hardware changes required to implement the Four-Hall operation delivery system will be discussed in this paper.; * Simultaneous Four-Hall Operation for 12 GeV CEBAF; Proceedings of this conference.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepfi085_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepfi085.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepfi085_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPFI085,

The corresponding source point stabilities have improved and results are reported. Some of the new beamlines request more stringent stability than the existing ones. Their requirements are not only tighter for beam orbit but also for beam size and divergence stability. For these reasons; SOLEIL has decided to define beam quality criteria for each sensitive beamline. Then it can predict ahead of commissioning how well the beamline will likely perform.

Therefore; using nominal values of the transfer optics with uncertainties leads to feedback quality degradation; and thus beam disturbances. In this work; we propose a method for measuring the phase advances and amplitude scaling between the positions of the kicker and the BPMs. Directly after applying a kick on the beam by means of the kicker; we record the BPM signals. Consequently; we use the Second-Order Blind Identification (SOBI) algorithm to decompose the noised recorded signals into independent sources mixture. Finally; we determine the required optics parameters by identifying and analyzing the betatron oscillation sourced from the kick based on its mixing and temporal patterns.

The HIT synchrotron produces a library of energy; focus and intensity-variable pencil beams used to deliver dose distributions of utmost conformity to irregularly shaped target volumes. The required number of particles for each volume element of the tumour; which can vary by more than two magnitudes; is applied using the rasterscan technology. The irradiation-time and thus the patient throughput are highly sensitive to the achieved spill-structure driven by RF-Knockout extraction. Presently unfavourable fluctuations of the extracted intensity due to inhomogeneous phase space distribution of the beam are present. Recently a feedback-loop coupling the dose-defining ionisation chamber in front of the patient with the RF-Exciter was implemented allowing for the adaptation of the extracted intensity to the patient-specific treatment plan in real-time.

Lately; the demand for an active damper strongly emerged for two main reasons: to avoid restrictions as imposed on the betatron tune settings by the linear coupling and to cure instabilities appearing with high intensity beams; especially at the extraction energy. Late in 2012; two electronic prototype units; newly developed for the CPS one-turn-feedback; were programmed with a firmware designed to satisfy the transverse feedback (TFB) requirements in both planes. The main achievements were to automatically adapt the loop delay to the particles' time-of-flight variation within a nanosecond precision and to compensate the changing betatron phase advance between pick-up and kicker during the entire accelerating cycle. With the power equipment limited to the modest bandwidth of 23 MHz and 2 x 800 W per plane; encouraging results were obtained such as fast damping of injection oscillations caused by injection errors; reduction of beam losses along the cycle and damping of instabilities at all CPS energies.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME011,

The field stabilities in amplitude were 0.160% and 0.097% for the cavities and 0.016% for the vector sum. The stabilities without beam are 0.057% and 0.054% for the cavities and 0.009% for the vector sum. For stability improvement during beam transient an adaptive beam feedforward for beam loading compensation is under development. So far an amplitude field stability of 0.013% for the vector sum was achieved at cavity gradients of 15 MV/m and 25 MV/m (no PkQL control) during a 6.8 mA beam with a pulse length of 123 us. Furthermore a fully automated PkQL control procedure is currently developed and tested.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme013_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME013,

It is an FPGA-based digital RF feedback control system using 16-bit ADC's; which works on the μTCA platform. The FPGA boards control accelerating cavity fields and cavity tuning; and the EPICS-IOC is embedded in each of them. The CSS-BOY was adopted for a user interface of our system. High power test of the new LLRF control system was performed with the ARES Cavity of KEKB. The obtained feedback control stability with a klystron drive was sufficient as well as the low-level evaluation result. And auto tuner control also worded successfully. The start-up sequencer program for the cavity operation and auto-aging program also worked very well. The temperature characteristics of the system depend largely on band-pass filters (BPF). We tried to tune the BPF to reduce the temperature coefficient. Consequently the temperature dependence was improved to satisfy the required stability.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme014_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme014.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme014_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME014,

One challenging task is to achieve the high amplitude and high phase stability required by the accelerating fields of up to 0.1% and 0.1°; respectively. To improve the performance of the LLRF system; a gain scanning experiment for determining the optimal controller gain was carried out on the cERL. Furthermore; as a substitute for the traditional PI controller; a more robust H∞-based multiple input multiple output (MIMO) controller was realized.

The high-precision alignment system is strongly required for the Super B-factory at KEK. The laser-based alignment system comprises a He-Ne laser source and optical components for delivering the laser beam; and silicon photodetectors. The laser-based alignment system aligns a misalignment of a girder unit for accelerating structures while accelerator components on the girder unit are aligned with another laser tracker system with a similar precision level. A new PC-based feedback system for the laser pointing stability has been introduced in order to stabilize the transverse laser positions at the photodetector. The experimental results show that although the laser pointing stability is easily disturbed by environmental factors without the feedback system; it has been successfully applied to control the laser pointing stability within a few ten-micron-meter.

The electron beams with a charge of 5 nC and a normalized emittance of 10 μm are expected to be generated in the photocathode RF gun by using the laser source with a center wavelength of 260 nm and a pulse width of 30 ps. Furthermore; for reducing the emittance; the laser pulse width should be reshaped from Gaussian to rectangle structure. Therefore; Ytterbium (Yb)-doped laser system that provides broader bandwidth; higher amplify efficiency and higher output power is employed. The laser system starts with a large mode-area Yb-doped fiber-based amplifier system; which consists of a passively mode-locked femtosecond Yb-fiber oscillator and two steps Yb-fiber amplifier. To obtain the several 10mJ-class pulse energy; a Yb:YAG thin-disk regenerative solid-state amplifier is employed.

IPAC2013,,WEPME040,Investigation to Reduce Power Overhead Required in  Superconducting RF Cavity Field Control,R. Zeng; S. Molloy; A. Sunesson; ESS; Lund; Sweden; Lund University; Lund; Sweden; A power overhead of more than 25% is usually required in RF field control of klystron drived superconducting cavity; since it is much easier to implement feild control in a linear region of klystron where it is far below saturation. It however results in a reduced efficiency and more power consumption. Within ESS project it places very high demands on energy efficiency; which leads to stringent requirements on power overhead required in RF field control. Investigation on power overhead reduction in RF field control has been carried out at ESS and related simulation has been done. In this paper we will look at how close we can implement field control to the klystron saturation and discuss if it is possible to make RF field control the RF field with 10% overhead.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME040,

Until the Opera results raised questions about the speed at which neutrinos travelled; the main alignment concern for the CNGS beamline had been an orientation problem -to ensure that the beamline arrived to within ~100 m of its target at LNGS. GPS measurements at the two sites; and the use of gyro-theodolite measurements in the tunnel at CERN; ensured that the absolute alignment of the beamline was established to the required accuracy. New determinations of the links between the surface and the tunnel were not considered necessary until interest grew in the distance between the sites; at which point additional measurement campaigns were organised in order to further reduce the uncertainty in the distance. Details of all these campaigns and the distance estimates will be given.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME041,

Tests have been performed with the nominal design bunch spacing of 25 ns. The transverse damper has been an essential element to provide beam stability for the multi-bunch beam with up to 1380 bunches used at 50 ns spacing. We report on the experience gained with 50 ns spacing and the improvements in the signal processing tested for the future 25 ns operation. The increase in bandwidth required for 25 ns spacing constituted a particular challenge. The response of the system was carefully measured and the results used to digitally pre-distort the drive signal to compensate for a drop in gain of the power system for higher frequencies. The bunch-by-bunch data collected from the feedback signal path provided valuable information during the 2012 Physics run that can be further explored for beam diagnostics purposes and instability analysis in the future. Performance estimates are given for the 7 TeV run planned for 2015; at 25 ns bunch spacing.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME043,

So far; the straight line reference concept has been based on stretched wires coupled with Wire Positioning Sensors. This concept should be validated through inter-comparison with an alternative solution. This paper proposes an alternative concept where laser beam acts as straight line reference and optical shutters coupled with cameras visualise the beam. The principle was first validated by a series of tests using low-cost components. Yet; in order to further decrease measurement uncertainty in this validation step; a high-precision automatised micrometric table and reference targets have been added to the setup.

This requires alignment tolerances never achieved before at that scale; down to the micrometre level. As a matter of fact; in the LHC; the goal for the smoothing of the components was to obtain a 1σ deviation with respect to a smooth curve of 0.15 mm in a 150 m long sliding window; while for the CLIC project for example; it corresponds to 10 micrometres over a sliding window of 200m in the Beam Delivery System area. Two complementary strategies are being studied to fulfill these requirements: the development and validation of long range alignment systems to propagate precision and accuracy over a few hundreds of metres and short range alignment systems over a few metres. The studies undertaken; with associated test setups and the latest results will be detailed; as well as their application for the alignment of both CLIC and ILC colliders.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme046_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme046.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme046_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME046,

In C space the localization of sources of distortions is facilitated since the large (per unit phase) number of BPMs and Cs involved provides a good spatial resolution. Applications of this technique include the beam-assisted girder alignment where changes in the C pattern are interactively analyzed while girder positions are remotely altered or the beam-based alignment of quadrupole/BPM pairs where the variation of C values as the result of quadrupole variations are observed. In both cases large oscillations in BPM space are completely surpressed by the FOFB leading to well controlled and stable conditions during the measurement.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/wepme047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/wepme047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/wepme047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-WEPME047,

The alignment of all magnets is very importance since it directly affects the closed orbit of electron beams. Previously; conventional on-site alignment of the magnets was mainly relying on the theodolite performance. The cumulated errors could be in the order of 0.1mm. In this paper; a new alignment scheme is proposed to enhance the on-site alignment of magnets for TPS project. To achieve the high precision requirements; a device possessing the advantages of expansion mandrel in conjunction with Position Sensing Detector (PSD) is proposed.

A wideband intra-bunch feedback method is in development; based on a 4 GS/s data acquisition and processing; and with a back end frequency structure extending to 1 GHz. A slotted type kicker; similar to those used for stochastic cooling; has been considered as the terminal element of the feedback chain. It offers the most promising deflecting structure characteristics to meet the system requirements in terms of bandwidth; shunt impedance; and beam coupling impedance.

The use of long wavelength drive lasers can mitigate the problem of dielectric structure breakdown caused by multiphoton ionization. In addition; structure fabrication requirements are relaxed; and greater energy can be stored in the structure. The 5-μm laser source consists of two components: (1) a type-II-beta-barium borate-based 2-μm optical parametric amplifier (OPA) as a pump source; and (2) a type-I-zinc-germaniu-phosphate-based 5-μm OPA to produce mJ-class; <100 fs pulses. Our supercontinuum seeded two-stage 2-μm OPA is pumped by a Ti:sapphire amplifier and produces pulse energy of ~1.4 mJ with a pulse duration of 42 fs (~6 optical cycles).

The system was developed at the superconducting linac (SCL) of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator complex. The laser wire profile scanner is based on a photo-detachment process and therefore can be conducted on an operational H− beam in a nonintrusive manner. The parallel profile scanning system makes it possible to simultaneously measure profiles of the 1-MW neutron production H− beam at 9 different locations (corresponding to energy levels of 400 – 950 MeV) of the superconducting linac using a single light source. The entire measurement process takes less than 5 minutes to complete. Together with the hardware modification; we have also upgraded our user interface to visualize the 9-pairs of H− beam profiles in a real-time fashion; which presents a highly intuitive and informative picture of the H− beam propagation along the acceleration path.

In order to quickly build up the FEL power in a short undulator; a laser technology has been proposed to generate a pre-bunched electron pulse-train with a THz bunching frequency from a photoinjector*. The bunching factor** of an accelerated pulse-train beam is influenced by the beam radius; initial bunching frequency; space charge force; acceleration gradient; and acceleration phase in an accelerator. For a given RF accelerator and initial beam parameters; there is a limitation on the maximally attainable bunching factor and bunching frequency for the accelerated pulse-train beam. This paper presents a theoretical analysis for the bunching factor and bunching frequency of an accelerated pulse-train beam subject to nominal initial beam conditions in a photoinjector. The theoretical analysis is compared with the simulation results from the simulation code; PARMELA. To obtain an output bunching factor larger than 0.5%; our simulation study indicates that the maximum bunching frequency at the cathode is 25 THz for a 150 A beam current under a peak acceleration field of 80 MV/m.; * Y.C.

This neutron output would be lot higher with hadrons due to their larger cross sections. There is no reliable/ useful data on this subject. Using the experimental neutron production data from different body elements; we have estimated the fluence and energies of these neutrons from tissue under irradiation with different hadrons. Our results indicate that at least 4.2 neutrons; with energies greater than 5 MeV; are produced for every C-ion of 400 MeV/u energy incident on tissue. This number reduces to 3; 1.4 and 0.3 respectively at C-energies of 300; 200 and 100 MeV /u. For protons these numbers are estimated to be 0.05; 0.2 and 0.4 per proton of energies 100; 200 and 300 MeV respectively. There would be even more neutrons with energies lesser than 5 MeV.

IPAC2013,,THPPA01,Realization of New Charge-state Stripper for High-power Uranium Ion Beams,RIKEN Nishina Center; Wako; Japan; Recent works to realize the new charge-state stripper using recirculating helium gas are presented. Very limited lifetimes of conventional solid-state strippers due to huge dE/dx for very heavy ion beams (e.g.; for uranium ions; several thousand times larger than protons at the energy around 10 MeV/u) were a principal bottleneck for their multi-stage acceleration at high intensities. The new stripping system is characterized by its infinite lifetime; efficient stripping and small beam degradation even for the world’s most intense uranium ion beams provided by the RIBF (more than 1 pμA at the injected energy of 11 MeV/u). Successful operations of the system in 2012 greatly contribute to the remarkable expansion of the accelerator performance of the RIBF that will allow an enormous breakthrough for exploring new domains of the nuclear world in the next several years; the peak intensity of the uranium beam has reached 15.1 pnA (almost 1011 pps) at 345 MeV/u and the average intensity provided for the users has become ten times higher than it was in 2011.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thppa01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thppa01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thppa01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPPA01,
IPAC2013,,THPPA02,Features and Applications of the Program ELEGANT,ANL; Argonne; USA; ELEGANT is an open-source accelerator design and simulation code that has been in use and development for nearly two decades. In that time; it has evolved into a fairly general code for the design and modeling of linacs and storage rings; due in no small measure to suggestions and feedback from users world-wide. The code is best known for modeling of linacs for free electron lasers and particularly its relatively fast and straightforward modeling of coherent synchrotron radiation in magnetic bunch compression systems. This capability led to the discovery of a microbunching instability in such systems; thus helping to seed a new field of research. ELEGANT's capabilities are enhanced by the use of self-describing data files and the Self-Describing Data Sets (SDDS) toolkit. In this paper; we briefly review the features and capabilities of the code; then give a series of application examples from simulation of linear accelerators and storage rings.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thppa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thppa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thppa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPPA02,

Providing capabilities to control and monitor the facility; it represents the top layer of a distributed control system composed of HP workstations; VME and field bus processors as well as linux based personal computer s. In addition to regular updates and improvements; the HP-UX operated part of the control system recently was ported to linux; so the outdated HP workstations could be replaced by a single linux PC. All reference values; for example the betatron tune or the extraction energy; can be specified using a window-based graphical user front end. They are directly computed to hardware compatible representations. Vice versa; measured beam parameters; e.g. the transversal beam emittance; are displayed for easy user access; allowing real time diagnostics. This abstraction layer allows for an intuitive approach to machine operation; requiring no detailed knowledge of the hardware implementation.

For heavy-ion acceleration the amplitude and phase have to be well adjusted over a whole machine cycle. In order to compensate small deviations induced by low-level rf components (LLRF) and transmission lines in the control paths; a calibration electronic (CEL) with a characteristic map was developed. It is a real-time module which is based on modern FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology and adaptable to special cavities with various physical dependencies (e.g. attenuation; dispersion; temperature drift; aging etc.). The hardware and software architecture of this CEL module are presented here.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpea003_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpea003.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpea003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPEA003,

For this purpose; a completely new low-level rf system architecture** has been developed; which is now used in SIS18 operation. Closed-loop control systems stabilize the amplitude and the phase of the rf gap voltages. Due to component imperfections the transmission and the detection of the actual values lead to systematic errors without countermeasures. These errors prohibit the operation of the rf systems over the whole amplitude and frequency range within the required accuracy. To compensate the inevitable errors; the target values provided by the central control system are modified by so-called calibration electronics*** modules. The calibration curves can be measured without the beam; but the desired beam behaviour has to be verified by experiments. For this purpose; a debunching scenario was selected as a SIS18 beam experiment that proved to be very sensitive to inaccuracies. In this contribution the results of this experiment are presented; showing for the first time at GSI by beam observation that the accuracy requirements are met based on predefined calibration curves.; * “FAIR - Baseline Technical Report; ” Volume 2; Accelerator and Scientific Infrastructure; (2006).  ** Klingbeil et al.: Phys.

It is a seeded HGHG-FEL; mainly consisting of one 300 MeV electron linear accelerator and one undulator. Radiation safety is one of the most important tasks for Dalian FEL. Radiation safety interlock system (RSIS) is designed to prevent personnel exposure to high radiation levels; based on the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle. RSIS controls access to the radiation protection areas and monitors safety devices. Only if all the radiation safety conditions are satisfied; then the facility will be permitted to operate. Once any condition is broken; RSIS will send a signal to stop the electron beam immediately to guarantee radiation safety.

The accelerator is terminated by a dump collecting beam which is not intended for further utilization. The aim of this study is to determine an optimal shielding of the beam dump fulfilling the radio-protection requirements. The proposed shielding must take into account different accelerator operational phases; the space constraints inside the accelerator vault as well as the decommissioning of the installation at the end of its lifetime. Therefore a detailed Monte-Carlo calculation using FLUKA particle transport and interaction code has been performed and the relevant physics quantities have been evaluated for different irradiation profiles and shielding material. Moreover; the residual dose rate and induced activation have been calculated for several cooling times in order to optimize the choice of the shielding material following the ALARA principle.

To date only a small number of beam-induced quenches have occurred; with most being due to specially designed quench tests. During normal collider operation with stored beam there has not been a single beam induced quench. This excellent result is mainly explained by the fact that the cleaning of the beam halo worked very well and; in case of beam losses; the beam was dumped before any significant energy was deposited in the magnets. However; conditions are expected to become much tougher after the long LHC shutdown; when the magnets will be working at near nominal currents in the presence of high energy and intensity beams. This paper summarizes the experience to date with beam-induced quenches. It describes the techniques used to generate controlled quench conditions which were used to study the limitations.

The uncontrolled loss of only a small fraction of the stored beam is sufficient to damage parts of the sc. magnet system; accelerator equipment or the particle physics experiments. To protect against this a correct functioning of the complex LHC machine protection (MP) systems through the operational cycle is essential. Operating with up to 140MJ stored beam energy was only possible due to the experience and confidence gained in the two previous running periods; where the intensity was slowly increased. In this paper the 2012 performance of the MP systems is discussed. The strategy applied for a fast; but safe; intensity ramp up and the monitoring of the MP systems during stable running periods are presented.

The quadrupole power supply is 18bit with higher stability than sextupole with 16 bits; and have internal data buffer for post-mortem capability. The dedicated IOCs are built individually at the 24 cPCI platforms to manipulate the devices of the 24 cells of storage ring respectively. Each IOC is used to control 10 quadrupole magnet power supplies and 7 sextupole magnet power supplies. The GUIs of storage ring quadrupole and sextupole power supplies controls were implemented by the EDM toolkit. The client console can use the specific EDM pages to access power supplies via PVs channel access.

To extend the capabilities of the FEL and HIGS to higher photon energy regions; a FEL wiggler switchyard system was developed in the recent years. This system was installed and commissioned in 2012. The FEL wiggler switchyard is used to change between two planar OK-4 wigglers and two helical OK-5 wigglers in the middle of the FEL straight section in a short period of time (a few days). With a total of six electromagnetic wigglers; the Duke FEL can be operated in a number of wiggler configurations and with a wide range of magnetic fields. The operation of uncompensated FEL wigglers can cause significant changes to the electron beam closed orbit and magnetic lattice. To maintain a sufficiently large dynamic aperture for an efficient injection and good beam lifetime; a set of complex compensation schemes; including magnetic field and lattice compensation; have been developed for the operation of the FEL wigglers.

The vacuum system should accommodate such high intensity; ultrashort bunch (0.1 ~ 3 ps) electron beams; and be designed so as to minimize its loss factor. Therefore; low impedance vacuum components; such as zero-gap flanges and rf-shielded screen monitors; have been developed. Extra high and clean vacuum is required in the vicinity of the SC cavities to maintain their high gradient operation; and those beam tubes are coated by Non-Evaporable Getter (NEG) films. Because of the low beam energy; photon absorbers are not necessary and the beam tubes can be made of stainless steel. However; the photon scrubbing effect is so limited that the beam tubes should be ready for in-situ bakeout and are wrapped with thin Kapton heaters; which are also useful for the NEG-coating activation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpfi012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpfi012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpfi012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPFI012,

They have been equipped with a newly developed RF shield; because the usual beryllium-copper spring finger contacts were found to be very hard (roughly 1000 N/mm) owing to the large size. This contact is made of Ti braid; which consists of wires with a diameter of 0.3 mm. This RF contact is a kind of basket (with two ports) made with the braids. Because of the spring effect; the contact can change shape easily. In addition; the contact can easily connect the different cross sections in a smooth fashion. Furthermore; this structure is almost free from the dust generation; which is one of the most troublesome problems for the usual spring finger contacts.

The kicker magnets mainly consist of Ni-Zn ferrite cores and Al alloy plates; and are installed in a vacuum to prevent discharge because a high voltage is applied for a short period. It is important to reduce the outgassing of water vapor from the ferrite cores. Although the kicker magnets have been working well; recently the vacuum quality became a little poor. Thus; we developed the in-situ degassing method for the ferrite cores. This is achieved by directing the heat from the heat source to the kicker magnet and not to the chamber wall. With the test stand we succeeded to flow almost all the heat toward the kicker magnet and to bake out the ferrite cores about 150°C; maintaining the temperature of the chamber wall less than 50°C. As the previous work with TDS measurements revealed that the absorbed water molecules can be easily removed by the bake-out at 100-150°C in a vacuum; the outgassing from the ferrite cores was successfully reduced.

In this report; we describe a deliberation flow about the design of a vacuum chamber; which is installed in the quadrupole corrector. The effect of eddy current was calculated in the case of the current titanium vacuum chamber. The results showed that the temperature rise was too much (up to ~350oC) and the magnetic field in the vacuum chamber is largely distorted by the eddy current. Therefore we decided to employ an alumina ceramics vacuum chamber; for which we have a past achievement in RCS*.

The existing facilities provide the maximum primary beam power of a few kW; while the next generation facility is planned to use hundreds of kW of 238U beam. We are designing a rare-isotope beam facility; which can provide U beam with the maximal power of 400 kW at the energy of 200 MeV/u. The high-power target studied is made of multi-slice rotating graphite to enhance radiation cooling. The total target thickness is roughly 2 mm with more than 10 slices. The resultant power density inside the target reaches above 50 MV/cm3. Numerical simulation for thermo-mechanical analysis has been performed using PHITS and ANSYS for single and multi-slice targets.

This becomes increasingly important for proton colliders with large energy stored in the beam such as LHC; for high power accelerators with a beam power of up to 10 MW; such as the European Spallation Source (ESS); and for linear colliders with high beam power and very small beam size. The reliability of Machine Protection Systems is crucial for safe machine operation; all possible sources of risk need to be taken into account in the early design stage. This paper presents a systematic approach to classify failures and to assess the associated risk; and discusses the impact of such considerations on the design of Machine Protection Systems.

IPAC2013,,THPFI047,Design Guidelines for Ferrite Absorbers Submitted to RF-induced Heating,A. Bertarelli; M. Garlaschè; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The use of ferrite absorbers is one of the most effective means of damping potentially harmful high order RF modes; which may lead to beam instabilities and excessive power losses in accelerator devices. However; the power deposited on ferrite absorbers themselves may lead to ferrite exceeding its Curie temperature; losing its damping properties. An evaluation of the ferrite capability to dissipate deposited heat is hence of paramount importance for the safe design of particle accelerator devices. In this paper; figures of merit are proposed to assess the maximum specific power allowed on a generic ferrite tile; before it reaches its Curie temperature. Due to its inherent brittleness; sufficient contact pressure between ferrite and its housing; allowing heat transmission by conduction; can hardly be applied. A semi-analytical study is thus performed; assuming that ferrite is evacuating heat solely through radiation. The described method is then exemplified in the case of the BPM-embedded tertiary collimator (TCTP) designed in the framework of the LHC collimation upgrade.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpfi047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpfi047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpfi047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPFI047,

During last two years the LHC operated with proton beams at a maximum energy of 4 TeV; coasting for several hours each time; inducing high pressure due to different effects: synchrotron radiation; electron cloud and localized temperature increase. All these phenomena generated an important gas load from the vacuum chamber walls; which led in some cases to a partial or a total saturation of the NEG coating. To keep the design vacuum performances and to schedule technical interventions for NEG vacuum reactivation; it is necessary to take into account all these aspects and to regularly evaluate the saturation level of the NEG coating. This study analyses the saturation level of the NEG coated beam pipes in the LHC accelerator. Pressure reading variation without proton beams circulating are analysed and combined with laboratory studies of the NEG saturation behaviour and with Vacuum Stability Code (VASCO) simulations.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpfi049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpfi049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpfi049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPFI049,

Work is proceeding in 3 areas: accelerators; campus and infrastructure; and re-use of thermal “waste” energy. The accelerator chain has the potential to further reduce the energy consumption by dynamic suppression of cycles when they are temporarily not needed and by operating magnets in pulsed mode. R&D for future accelerators includes the recuperation of the RF energy; which is not used for acceleration of the beams. Concerning the CERN campus more than half of the buildings are older than 40 years. Hence there is a big need for renovation; which includes energy aspects. New buildings use renewable energy whenever possible. As an example a building is under construction; which will use a 250 m2 solar field together with an absorption refrigerator for cooling purposes. Finally; about 80% of the electric energy gets dissipated in air cooling towers. Part of this energy can be re-used for heating buildings.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpfi050_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpfi050.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpfi050_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPFI050,

In the case of the SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron); which belongs to the LHC injector chain; testing the performance of coated beam pipes directly in the accelerator must cope with the schedule of the regular machine operation. For this reason an alternative instrument based on RF induced multipacting in a coaxial configuration has been designed for ex-situ characterization of the main bending dipoles of the SPS. In this contribution we report the results obtained before and after coating for two 6.4 meter dipoles with different cross sections of the vacuum chambers. The multipacting is monitored by measuring the pressure rise and the RF reflected power. After coating; the power threshold to induce multipacting is strongly reduced indicating a lower propensity for electron cloud.

Typically; ferrite plates attached to the walls of such structures like diagnostic devices; kickers or collimators; are used to dampen those undesired modes. However the heat transfer rate from these plates to the walls is rather limited. Brazing ferrite plates to the walls is not possible in most cases due to the different thermal expansion coefficients. To overcome those limitations; atmospheric plasma spraying techniques have been investigated. Ferrite layers with a thickness from 50 micron to about 300 micron can be deposited on metallic surfaces like stainless steel exhibiting good thermal contact and still reasonable absorption properties. In this paper the technological aspects of plasma deposition are discussed and results of specifically developed RF loss measurement procedures for such thin magnetically lossy layers on metal are presented.

In particular; vacuum chambers in the experiments should be as transparent as possible to minimize the background to the detectors while reducing also the material activation. Beryllium is; so far; the most performing material for this application; but it presents some drawbacks such as brittleness; manufacturing issues; toxic hazard; high cost and low availability. A development work to obtain alternative material to the beryllium with similar performance is being carried out at CERN. Three categories have been defined and considered: raw bulk material; material and structural composites. Main requirements are the vacuum compatibility: leak tightness; low outgassing rate; temperature resistance (in the range 200-230 °C); transparency; and mechanical stiffness and strength. Carbon is the element with the lowest atomic number after beryllium and that is appropriate for this application. Therefore carbon based materials have been considered in a variety of options.

IPAC2013,,THPFI060,"Development, Validation and Application of a Novel Method for Estimating the Thermal Conductance of Critical Interfaces in the Jaws of the LHC Collimation System",CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The motivation for this project arises from the difficulty in quantifying the manufacturing quality of critical interfaces in the water cooled jaws of the TCTP and TCSP (Target Collimator Tertiary Pickup and Target Collimator Secondary Pickup) collimators. These interfaces play a decisive role in the transfer of heat deposited by the beam towards the cooling system avoiding excessive deformation of the collimator. Therefore; it was necessary to develop a non-destructive method that provides an estimation of the thermal conductance during the acceptance test of the TCTP and TCSP jaws. The method is based on experimental measurements of temperature evolution and numerical simulations. By matching experimental and numerical results it is possible to estimate the thermal conductance in several sections of the jaw. A simplified experimental installation was built to validate the method; then a fully automatic Test-Bench was developed and built for the future acceptance of the TCTP/TCSP jaws which will be manufactured and installed in the LHC. This novel method has shown its validity and has become a decisive tool for the development of the new generation of LHC collimators.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpfi060_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpfi060.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpfi060_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPFI060,

Their goal is to inhibit the next pulse either on failure of critical equipment and/or on low beam quality evaluation. This paper presents the on-going process to validate design choices for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) interlock systems. The design process starts by establishing requirements. In mission-critical system case; they are mainly focused on the dependability. Moreover; the new concept of fast beam quality analysis has been introduced into the CLIC interlock system and will be discussed in this paper. To support the design process; experimentation on this concept has been launched. In addition; a hardware demonstration of the interlock systems has been set-up.

Two-millimeter-long silicon crystals; with bending angles of about 150 μrad; are used as primary collimators. The crystal collimation process is obtained consistently through channeling with high efficiency; showing a steady reduction of almost one order of magnitude of the loss rate at the onset of the channeling process. This result holds both for protons and for lead-ions. The corresponding loss map in the accelerator ring is accordingly reduced. These observations strongly support our expectation that the coherent deflection of the beam halo by a bent crystal should enhance the collimation efficiency also in LHC. After a concise description of the results collected in the SPS we propose a scenario to integrate bent crystals in the LHC collimation system for machine experiment.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpfi064_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpfi064.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpfi064_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPFI064,

It is machinable and cheap; which makes it a candidate for a gasket material. In the case of sealing between disparate materials; treating the thermal expansion when the gasket suffers from baking is difficult. The clearance and the eccentricity between the gasket and the flange are also important; most leaks occur about 80 ~ 110 oC. The experimental apparatus comprised a vacuum chamber with six diamond-edge gaskets assembled; a turbo-molecular pump and an extractor gauge. The pre-baking torque for this gasket is 70 – 80 kg cm; the rates of both heating and cooling are less than 40 oC per hour. The gaskets are baked repeatedly under the same conditions excluding the target temperature set for baking.

Identification of these limits for various irradiation and thermal environments is critical to high intensity targets for future facilities and experiments. To this end; several types of amorphous graphite and one type of carbon-carbon (3D weave) composite were exposed to 180 MeV proton beam at the BNL BLIP facility. Irradiated samples were then thermally; ultra-sonic; and structurally tested and compared to un-irradiated samples.

To this end; measurements of the secondary electron yield (SEY) of technical surfaces are being done in CESR. The CESR in-situ system; in operation since 2010; allows for measurements of SEY as a function of incident electron energy and angle on samples that are exposed to a realistic accelerator environment; typically 5.3 GeV electrons and positrons. The system was designed for periodic measurements to observe beam conditioning of the SEY and discrimination between exposure to direct photons from synchrotron radiation versus scattered photons and cloud electrons. Measurements so far have been done on bare metal surfaces (aluminum; copper; stainless steel) and EC-mitigatory coatings (titanium nitride; amorphous carbon; diamond-like carbon). A significant decrease in SEY with exposure to beam was observed for all cases other than the amorphous C samples; for the latter; the SEY remained near 1; independent of beam exposure.

Under the present CEBAF design; there is no option for sending beam to all four halls simultaneously. At least one hall has to stay down during the machine operation. A new pattern for interleaving the beam bunches is introduced that allows simultaneous operation of all four halls and provide opportunity for additional future experimental beams. The new configuration presents only a minimal change to the existing CEBAF extraction system. In fact all the lower pass extractions will stay as they are and only the frequency of 5th-pass horizontal RF separator will change. In order to make room for the new Hall D beam among the existing three beams; the beam repetition rate is reduced only for the halls taking beam at the highest pass. This and other details of the new configuration and beam pattern will be presented and discussed.

The necessary longitudinal space for the collimators could be provided by replacing some 8.33 T NbTi LHC main dipoles with 11 T dipoles based on Nb3Sn superconductor and compatible with the LHC lattice and main systems. To demonstrate this possibility Fermilab and CERN have started in 2011 a joint R&D program with the goal of building by 2015 a 5.5-m long twin-aperture dipole prototype suitable for installation in the LHC. An important part of the program is the development and test a series of short single-aperture demonstration dipoles with the nominal field of 11 T at the LHC nominal current of ~11.85 kA and ~20% margin.

Insulation is one of the primary elements of magnet design; essential for maintaining its electrical; mechanical and thermal performance. The Nb3Sn magnet fabrication process involves coil reaction at high temperature and then impregnation with epoxy to restore the insulation electrical and mechanical properties. The traditional epoxy offers adequate structural and electrical properties; but has a low radiation strength which limits the lifetime of accelerator magnets operating in severe radiation environments. Studies to replace epoxy as impregnation material for Nb3Sn coils with high radiation-resistant material have started at FNAL ten years ago. The studies concentrated on the Matrimid® 5292; a bismaleimide based material; which has appropriate viscosity and potlife as well as provides excellent mechanical; electrical and thermal coil properties. A 1 m long Nb3Sn quadrupole coil was recently fabricated; impregnated with Matrimid and tested in a quadrupole magnetic mirror at 4.2 and 1.9 K.

The number of two-stage cryocoolers was increased from three in 2009 to five in the modified magnet. The new shield for the spectrometer solenoid is fabricated primarily from 1100-O aluminum instead of 6061-T6 aluminum used in the former versions of the magnet. The thermal connection between the shield and the first-stage of the cold heads has been improved to reduce the temperature drop between the shield and the coolers. As a result of these changes; the first-stage temperatures for the coolers are below 45K; which resulted in an increase in the refrigeration generated by the cooler second stages. The quench protection system has been altered in order to provide additional protection to the magnet in the event of a lead failure between the magnet power supply and the magnet coils.

In a previous study*; we demonstrated the feasibility of this technique using the photoneutron flux emitted by a 16 MeV linear electron accelerator. This approach enables to reach average emission intensity on the order of one decade beyond the one produced by deuterium-tritium neutron generators traditionally used for such applications. Higher average emission intensities of the photoneutron flux would enable to expand boundaries of neutron interrogation. This new study aims at optimizing the photoneutron flux emitted by an electron accelerator. In order to ensure accuracy and reliability of our results; two Monte Carlo particle transport codes were used in parallel in this study: MCNPX developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory; and TRIPOLI-4 developed by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission. Potential discrepancies between results obtained with the two codes were investigated.

HIT is the first dedicated proton and carbon cancer therapy facility in Europe. It uses full 3D intensity controlled raster scanning dose delivering method of pencil beams. The ion energy ranges from ~50 up to 430 MeV/u (ion penetration depths of 20 to 300 mm in water). Beams are provided by a linac-synchrotron-system to four high energy beam lines: 2 horizontal patient treatment rooms; 1 horizontal experimental cave for quality assurance; development; and research work; and the heavy ion gantry. From the first commissioning the libraries of carbon and proton pencil beams at the gantry had been offered with the whole variety of ion beam properties: 255 energy steps; 4 beam foci; 360°; and 10 intensities (106-1010/spill) regarding the central beam.

Thus the whole accelerator chain is part of a medical product; in case of HIT an in-house manufactured device. The overall risk and quality management has deep influences on the maintenance process. Not only the huge volume of necessary documentation reflects this impact but also the organizational process before; along and after the services at HIT. Especially; the comprehensive testing after the maintenance procedures follows sophisticated checklists (e.g. the ion source service). On the other hand; a high operational availability of the accelerator in a hospital is mandatory. To realize 8250 hours of accelerator uptime per year in case of HIT; a maintenance strategy is necessary; which interleaves the regular service of the building infrastructure; e.g. air conditioning; with the periodic maintenance of the accelerator components.

Using a superconducting RF cavity; we can operate the EM in CW mode to obtain a beam flux comparable to that in DC mode. Low energy dispersion ΔE/E; e.g. 10-6 or better; is required for good spatial resolution in EMs; while it is usually between 10-3 to 10-4 in accelerators. We have thus designed a special type of cavity that can be excited with the fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies simultaneously; TM010 and TM020. With the two-mode cavity; the energy dispersion of the order of 10-5 would be obtained by modifying the peak of accelerating field to be flattened.

PALS for thick samples is possible by using high energy photons to create positrons inside the sample via pair production. This technique is called photon-induced positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PiPALS). We have developed a novel PiPALS system using ultra-short photon pulses based on bremsstrahlung radiation to carry out in-situ measurement of structural materials under special conditions (piping for supercritical water and nuclear reactor materials). Intense; ultra-short photon pulses with energies up to 40 MeV can be generated by using an electron linear accelerator with photocathode rf gun system at AIST.

Different materials and thickness of target have influence on dose rate. For 6MeV electron beam; this study gives the thickness of target for several materials in which the dose rate can be higher and drain electron can be lower. Then a X-ray target had been designed for 6MeV electron linac by FLUKA simulations.

For the beam control system of the accelerator; it is significant to obtain the accurate model of the electron gun system. The paper presents a fuzzy modeling method based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. A T-S model can be obtained using the system identification algorithms from input-output data. In our approach; fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is applied to identify the model structure. And a hybrid method based on quantum-inspired differential evolution algorithm (QDE) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to learn the parameters of T-S fuzzy model. Experiments on the Box-Jenkins gas furnace data have verified the validity of the modeling approach. The simulation results show that the T-S fuzzy model is very well to describe the electron gun system and reveal its performance.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpwa023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpwa023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpwa023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPWA023,

But the evaluation results are very conservative. After the discovery of data in transient ionizing radiation belonging to one universal data model “case 1 interval censored data”; ordering method in the sample space was introduced and applied to evaluate zero-failure data and was compared with non-parametric method both theoretically and via a practical LAT on QG-Ⅰ. Through the comparisons; it is concluded that ordering method can expand the scope of dose rate corresponding to the same lower confidence limit. It improves data utilization and this improvement could have practical significance in LAT. It can reduce requirements for the radiation source and can also reduce the number of trials.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpwa027_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpwa027.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpwa027_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPWA027,

The experimental results show that the pulsed ionizing radiation produces voltage surges in the devices and the output voltage recovers linearly after transient disturbance which includes a negative peak and a positive peak. The recovery time depends on the amplitude of the positive peak and the inherent slew rate of the devices. The degradation of transient disturbance amplitude and the recovery time versus ionizing dose rate of pulsed X-rays is researched. The relationship of circuit effects to physical mechanisms is investigated in detail. The photocurrent induced by transient ionizing radiation in the PN junctions in integrated circuits is responsible for the electrical degradation.

The accelerator system is to be operated in two modes; using the X-ray and electron beams. Because of the energy loss in electron mode; the accelerator is capable of producing 6-MeV; 100-mA electron beams with peak 2-MW RF power; and 7.5-MeV; 20 mA electron beams with peak 2.5-MW RF power. The beam radius at the end of column was < 0.5 mm without focusing magnets in PARMELA simulations; because the bunching cells are designed to enhance the RF phase focusing. Each cavity in the bunching and normal cells was designed by the MWS code to maximize the effective shunt impedance with 3.8% inter-cell coupling in normal cells. The dimensions of normal cells were determined by the low power RF test of prototype cells with 5711.06-MHz resonant frequency and 3.5% inter-cell coupling.

Low energy reactions involving the creation of specific nuclear states can be used for neutron production and for the manufacture of various medical isotopes. Unfortunately a beam rapidly loses energy in a target and falls below the resonant energy. A recycling ring with a thin internal target enables the particles that did not interact to be re-accelerated and used for subsequent cycles. The increase in emittance due to scattering in the target is partially countered by the re-acceleration; and accommodated by the large acceptance of the nsFFAG.

This includes for example synchrotron light sources and FELs; high intensity hadron accelerators for the generation of exotic beams and spallation sources; as well as much smaller accelerator facilities for precision experiments and fundamental studies. Moreover; accelerators are very important for many commercial applications; such as for example medical applications; material studies and treatment; lithography; or security applications; such as scanners at airports or cargo stations. The full potential of any accelerator can only be exploited if the performance of all its parts are continuously optimized; if numerical tools are made available that allow for developing and improving advanced machine designs; if methods are developed in partnership between the academic and industry sectors to monitor beams with ever higher intensities and brightness; shorter pulse lengths or smaller dimensions.

Inc.; USA; C. Bowman; R.B. Vogelaar; ADNA; Los Alamos; New Mexico; USA; The 75; 000 tons of US stored spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from conventional nuclear reactors is a resource that could provide 125 years of all US electrical power. Or it could also provide a great amount of process heat for many applications like producing green diesel fuel from natural gas and renewable carbon. An accelerator system like the SNS at ORNL can provide neutrons to convert SNF into fissile isotopes to provide high temperature heat using technology developed at the ORNL Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. In the GEM*STAR accelerator-driven subcritical reactor that we wish to build; the accelerator allows subcritical operation (no Chernobyls); the molten salt fuel allows volatiles to be continuously removed (no Fukushimas); and the SNF does not need to be enriched or reprocessed (to minimize weapons proliferation concerns). The molten salt fuel and the relaxed availability requirements of process heat applications imply that the required accelerator technology is available now. A new opportunity has arisen to use GEM*STAR to reduce the world’s inventory of weapons-grade plutonium leaving only remnants that are permanently unusable for nuclear weapons.; * Charles D.

RadiaBeam Technologies; in collaboration with the UCLA Department of Radiation Oncology and the University of Texas at Austin; is proposing the utilization of innovative laser-driven ion acceleration (LDIA) technology for the development of a compact; inexpensive proton therapy system that can ultimately be adapted for the acceleration of carbon ions. At less than a third the price of the average proton therapy unit; the realization of this system would make hadron therapy a much more realistic option for hospitals and clinics worldwide. However; LDIA produces a beam with large divergence; wide energy spread with multiple ion species; and a significant background of electrons and X-rays. Thus; a major challenge for clinical implementation of LDIA is the development of a post-target beam conditioning system for collimation; focusing; energy selection; background shielding; and scanning.

The coupled RFQ-IH combination is investigated with CST-MWS-simulations and by an RF model. The linac combination has to match the resonance frequency; flatness along the RFQ and the voltage ratio between both cavity sections.

We also studied the possibility of mitigating the intra-beam stripping (IBSt) with constant-envelop setting for the frequency jump from 324MHz to the 972MHz ACS section. Since the constant-envelop setting here for the frequency jump is away from equi-partitioning and close to the resonances kz=3kx; kz=2kx and so on; considerable emittance exchange and mismatch were found in the simulation. It is natural to continue the work to explore the parameter space around the above two typical settings. Three key points are to be checked. The first is the tradeoff between the envelopes big enough to suppress the IBSt and tunes not to be too depressed to the space charge region. The second point is the sensitivity of these lattices vs. errors. The third is about the criterion of mismatch in the presence of emittance exchange. When emittance exchange is serious the mismatch can be unavoidable. So it is crucial to ensure the settings are in the safe region free from un-controlled mismatch.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpwo027_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpwo027.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpwo027_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPWO027,

Due to the space limitation; the each BSM is installed at the center of the quadrupole doublet; where the fringe field from the quadrupole magnets exists. It has been observed that the fringe field significantly affects the orbit of the emitted electrons.

To realize simultaneously two kinds of beam shape which are required from the MLF and the MR; two pulse dipole magnets for injection painting were installed in the beam transport line from the Linac to the RCS.

For their efficient acceleration; a durable electron stripper in the intermediate energy region around 10-20 MeV/u is indispensable. However; there is no available stripper for the U beams with the intensity of more than 1 puA so far because of the lifetime problem of thin solid strippers caused by high energy loss. 　In the present study; a novel electron stripping system employing high-flow rate He gas circulation (200 L/min) has been developed. He gas with the thickness of 0.6 mg/cm2 is confined and separated from beamline vacuum using five-stage differentially-pumped sections.

The error studies are by very intense macro-particle simulations by both Trace-Win and TRACK codes with space charge effects included. Through error analysis the proper closed-orbit correction scheme and the maximum tolerable hardware and alignment errors can be found. This paper presents the method to optimize the apertures of elements in the C-ADS main linac. According to the detailed sensitivity analysis of different errors; the static and dynamic errors for the main linac are proposed.

Between the two segments of the SCL; the charge stripper strips electrons from ion beams to enhance the acceleration efficiency in the following SCL2. For high efficiency of the acceleration and high power in SCL2; the optimum energy of striped ion in solid carbon foil stripper for SCL1 was estimated by using code LISE. The thickness of the solid carbon foil is 300 ug/m2. Based on this study; the charge stripping efficiency of solid carbon stripper is ~80 %. For the charge selection from ions which produced by the solid carbon stripper; the dispersive section is required in down-stream of the foil.

The nominal average beam power is 5~MW with a peak beam power at target of 125~MW. During last year the ESS linac was costed; and to meet the budget a few modifications were introduced to the linac design; namely the final energy was decreased from 2.5~GeV to 2.0~GeV and the beam current was increased accordingly to compensate the lower final energy. As a result the linac is designed to meet the cost objective by taking a higher risk. This paper focuses on the new design options; beam dynamics requirements of the design and finally on the beam dynamics performance of the linac.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpwo072_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpwo072.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpwo072_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPWO072,

The long pulse concept is an excellent strategy of maximizing high beam power while minimizing peak power on the target. Chopping in the long pulse concept provides the necessary resolution for many neutron physics applications. However; there are some neutron physics applications in which both peak neutron flux and high resolution are desired. The peak flux of the ESS can be enhanced by placing an accumulator ring at the end of the linac. A bunch by bunch extraction scheme can be used to optimize the proton pulse time profile that maximizes peak neutron flux while minimizing instantaneous beam power on the target.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpwo073_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpwo073.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpwo073_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPWO073,

The loss limit originates from the hands-on-maintenance allowance of the accelerators and limits average dose rate level to less than 0.1 - 1 mSv/hr at 30 cm from a machine after 100 days of continuous operation and 4 hours of down time. However; machine activation and thus beam loss limit depends on incident particle energy and 1 W/m is only a good approximation for energies 100-200 MeV and higher (in H-/H+ accelerators). At lower energies though; one could allow much higher than 1 W/m without excess activation. A careful analysis of energy dependent loss limits was performed for proton linacs as part of the study for the European Spallation Source (ESS) linac; for energy ranges 5 MeV – 2.5 GeV. ESS linac is to be built in Lund; Sweden and will deliver 5 MW proton beam to the target.

The proton beam transport to the SINQ target is carried out exclusively by means of linear elements. As a consequence; at the SINQ target entrance the beam presents Gaussian transverse x and y distributions with tails cut short by collimators. This leads to a highly uneven temperature distribution inside the SINQ zircaloy target; giving rise to thermal and mechanical stress. In view of a future beam intensity upgrade; the possibility of homogenizing the beam distribution by means of a fast beam rotation system is currently under study. Important aspects of this method concern the resulting neutron spectrum and flux distribution.

However; equipartitioning imposes strict rules on the linac design; thus limiting the design options and increasing the overall construction cost. More recently; practical tools have been developed that offer guidelines in designing non-equipartitioned linacs; by charting the stable regions in a tune ratio diagram (Hofmann’s Charts).

IPAC2013,,THPWO094,Electromagnetic and Multi-particle Beam Dynamics Modeling of 4-Rod RFQs,S.S. Kurennoy; R.W. Garnett; L. Rybarcyk; LANL; Los Alamos; New Mexico; USA; Detailed 3D modeling of the recently commissioned FNAL 4-rod RFQ was performed with the CST Studio Suite. The RFQ model is based on the CAD files used for its fabrication; which are imported in CST Studio. The electromagnetic (EM) analysis was done with MicroWave Studio (MWS) and the beam dynamics modeled with Particle Studio (PS) using the MWS-calculated fields. Realistic matched input CW beam distributions; generated externally with up to 10K particles per RF period and up to 70 RF periods long; are injected in the RFQ for PS simulations. The EM analysis reveals some interesting features of the RFQ fields; their origin and influence on the beam parameters is studied. In particular; the end-gap longitudinal field; which is usually not taken into account when an RFQ is designed with standard codes; can change the output beam energy. Our CST modeling results helped explain and successfully resolve some problems encountered in the FNAL RFQ commissioning. We plan to use a similar approach to evaluate a new 4-rod RFQ that will become a part of an upgraded front end of the LANSCE linac.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/thpwo094_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/thpwo094.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/thpwo094_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-THPWO094,

IPAC2013,,FRXBA01,Accelerator Technology - From Big Projects to Broad Application,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan,,Big projects with far-reaching technical goals seem to define technical parameters and test infrastructure performance. As such these are the 'drivers' of the technology and have a vital role and have application far beyond that originally foreseen.

IPAC2013,,FRXCA01,Progress in Transverse Feedbacks and Related Diagnostics for Hadron Machines,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Today Hadron Accelerators with high intensity and high brightness beams increasingly rely on transverse feedback systems for the control of instabilities and the preservation of the transverse emittance. With particular emphasis; but not limited; to the CERN Hadron Accelerator Chain the progress made in recent years and the performances achieved are reviewed. Hadron colliders such as the LHC represent a particular challenge as they ask for low noise electronic systems in these feedbacks for acceptable emittance growth. Achievements of the LHC transverse feedback system used for damping injection oscillations and to provide stability throughout the cycle are summarized. This includes its use for abort gap and injection cleaning as well as transverse blow-up for diagnostics purposes. Beyond systems already in operation; advances in technology and modern digital signal processing with increasingly higher digitization rates have made systems conceivable to cure intra-bunch motion. With its capabilities to both acquire beam oscillations and to actively excite motion; transverse feedback systems have a large variety of applications for beam diagnostics purposes.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/talks/frxca01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/papers/frxca01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2013/posters/frxca01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2013-FRXCA01,
