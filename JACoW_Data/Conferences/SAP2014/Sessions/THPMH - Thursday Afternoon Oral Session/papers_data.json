        "we present a latest PEPX-type lattice design of the HEPS storage ring with beam energy of 6 (or 5) GeV and horizontal natural emittance of 88 (or 61) pm.rad. Nonlinear dynamics optimization has been done to ensure an efficient injection and a long enough Touschek lifetime."

        "respectively. The electron beam with a variable profile helps to get an ion beam with the emittance and intensity that meet the demands of specific physical experiments. Fast transverse cooling of the hot ion beam after horizontal multiturn of stripping injection allows beam accumulation at the injection energy. After optimization of the accumulation and cooling process an current increase by more than one order of magnitude has been achieved. Momentum spread in the 10-4 range has been demonstrated. In this paper",
        "the longitudinal cooling force and the transverse cooling time measurements",
        "the intrabeam scattering effect measurements were introduced."
