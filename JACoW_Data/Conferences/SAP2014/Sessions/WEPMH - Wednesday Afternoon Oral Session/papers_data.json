      "abstract": "The continue wave (CW) high current proton linac has wide applications as the front end of the high power proton machines. The low energy part is the most difficult one and there is no widely accepted solution yet. Both normal conducting and superconducting acceleration structures are thought to be the possible solutions. Although the characteristics of normal conducting structures and superconducting ones are quite different, such as acceleration voltage, maximum electric field and so on, we found the focusing properties of the lattice composed by these two acceleration structures are quite similar for different reasons. The advantages and disadvantages of lattices composed of both the normal conducting and superconducting structures are analysed from the beam dynamics point of view, and their constraints on beam main parameters are discussed.",

        "Historically particle accelerators are instrumental for high energy physics (accelerator based colliders) and photon science (accelerator based synchrotron light sources and free electron lasers). Now there is growing interest in applying accelerator technology to solve the grand challenge in probing matter at ultrafast temporal and ultrasmall spatial scales. In this paper we discuss how one can use MeV electrons produced in accelerators (e.g. photocathode rf guns) to study ultrafast dynamics at atomic scale through ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy techniques. We will also describe the current status of ENTROPY (cENter for ulTRafast diffractiOn and microscoPY) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). This center is expected to provide access to new sciences by producing kHz rep-rate ultrafast and ultrabright electron beams that will give researchers unparalleled power and precision in examining the fundamental nature of matter."
