      "abstract": "The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) accelerator consists of an 80MeV H− lianc and an 1.6GeV proton rapid cycling synchrotron, and it provide 100kW beam to the neutron target. At present, the most of the element of accelerator is under mass production and test. The installation and beam commissioning will be started from Ion Source, and done section by section. To make the beam commissioning smoothly and successfully, many preparation works on both accelerator physics and hardware have been doing. In this paper, the summary on the preparation work for beam commissioning is given, including the commissioning schedule, detailed commissioning plan, the development of the commissioning software, and etc.",
