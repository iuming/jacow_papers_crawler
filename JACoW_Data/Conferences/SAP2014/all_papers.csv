SAP2014,,WEPH01,Uniformization of the transverse beam profile by a new type nonlinear magnet,G. Gu; W.B. Liu; IHEP; Beijing; People's Republic of China; The uniform particle beam is desirable in many beam applications. One method to get this type of beam distribution is using octupoles; but loss of particles in the halo will be produced by this method. To reduce the beam loss; a new type of magnet is proposed in this paper. The field in the middle region of the new type magnet is similar to the octupole magnet field; but the rate of rise decline quickly in the edge. So that the particle in the edge experience a lower magnet field; and this would result in less particle loss. We also add a mechanical structure on the new type magnet to make it possible to adjust the size of middle region. So that the magnet can adapt to different transverse dimensions of the beam; and this would further reduce particle loss. Some numerical simulations have been done respectively with octuples and the new type of magnet. The simulation results show that the new type of magnet could get the uniform distribution of particle beam with less particle loss.

In this paper; an optics design technique is introduced which could minimize the emittance dilution within a single achromatic cell. We gave a comparison between this method and the earlier optics method; simulation results confirmed the usefulness of our new result.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/talks/thpmh3_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/papers/thpmh3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/posters/thpmh3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2014-THPMH3,116

SAP2014,,THPMH5,XAL Applications Development in CSNS,IHEP; Beijing; People's Republic of China; As high level physics applications; XAL was introduced to CSNS for the future accelerator commissioning. Some general applications of XAL can be used directly in CSNS; especially for linac and transport line. Because the rapid cycling ring (RCS) of CSNS is very different from the rings which XAL are used before; some applications must be customized for the RCS. Accordingly; the database which are used for the applications are also being developed. An introduction of XAL and the developing status in accelerator physics group of CSNS will be brought.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/talks/thpmh5_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/papers/thpmh5.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/posters/thpmh5_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2014-THPMH5,

By using superconducting (SC) accelerating structures except the normal conducting (NC) RFQ; the driver accelerator runs in CW mode and accelerates the 10 mA proton beam from 35 keV at the ECR ion source exit to 1.5 GeV at the main linac exit to bombard the target to produce neutrons. To satisfy the restrict requirement on the stability; availability and reliability; two identical injectors will operate in parallel as hot spare for each other at the low energy stage; while local compensation method will be used to accomplish beam dynamics rematch at the high energy stage when certain device failure happens. Currently; there are two injector testing facility are being built at IHEP and IMP; respectively. The task of IHEP is to build a 10 MeV/325 MHz Injector I testing facility and accomplish the main linac design. Here; the progress on the beam dynamics studies for the ADS injector I and the main linac are presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/talks/framh4_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/papers/framh4.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SAP2014/posters/framh4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2014-FRAMH4,124
