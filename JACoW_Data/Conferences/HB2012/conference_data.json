We present the ongoing work of developing a Finite Integration (FIT) solver in frequency domain which is based on the Parallel and Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computing (PETSc) framework in C++. The code is applied to an inductive insert used to compensate the longitudinal space charge impedance in low energy machines. Another application focuses on the impedance contribution of a ferrite kicker with inductively coupled pulse forming network (PFN) and frequency dependent complex material permeability. In future we plan to confirm our simulations with dedicated wire or coil bench measurements.",

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

This feasibility study was prompted by previous measurements [1] and the theoretical estimation of expected signal strengths for the GSI linear accelerator UNILAC. For this experiment",
            "an 11.4 MeV/u Uranium beam was chosen to investigate OTR signal from several target materials and to evaluate the working regime for the used experimental setup. The OTR light was either observed directly with an Image Intensified CCD camera (ICCD) or indirectly via a spectrometer for wavelength resolved data. A moveable stripping foil allowed measurements with two different ion charge states. The theoretical q2 dependency of the OTR process predicts a six-fold increase in light yield which was confirmed experimentally. Obtained OTR beam profiles were compered to SEM-Grid data. Moreover",
            "ICCD gating feature",

            "Measurements of the momentum spread of the beam particles are of great importance when optimizing linac settings for high current operation with controlled longitudinal phase space occupation. A new method of momentum spread determination was tested at the GSI heavy ion linear accelerator UNILAC. The method is based on an analysis of incoherent components of the bunch signal. A significant enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio was achieved by means of a resonant pick-up of pill-box shape. Spectra were analyzed on the 36th harmonics of the linac rf-frequency",

In real experiment",

The strongest lines in these spectra were at positions of theoretically expected incoherent frequencies. In this paper the method is described in details",

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

        "At present the beam based alignment of the LHC collimators is performed by touching the beam halo with the two jaws of each device. This method requires dedicated fills at low intensities that are done infrequently because the procedure is time consuming. This limits the operational flexibility in particular in the case of changes of optics and orbit configuration in the experimental regions. The system performance relies on the machine reproducibility and regular loss maps to validate the settings. To overcome these limitations and to allow a continuous monitoring of the beam position at the collimators",

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Two different kinds of phenomena will be introduced through a brief review of the literature on the topic. The first one is a consequence of the very weak vertical focusing found in the low energy region of most cyclotrons. The space charge tune shift further reduces the vertical focusing",

This leads to effects of space charge forces which are very peculiar to isochronous machines. We will finally present the simulation tools being developed at TRIUMF to study these effects.",

        "We have established two independent methods for monitoring the waste beam of only about 0.4% in the 3 GeV Rapid Cycling Synchrotron of the Japan Proton Accelerator. Although using conventional monitor systems",
        "the measurement technique made it possible for clearly measuring such a waste beam even with significantly low error. One of the method uses a current transformer to measure the waste beam as a whole",
        "while the other one uses a multi-wire profile monitor for clearly measuring beam profiles of both un-stripped and partially stripped components of the waste beam. While the raw signal measured by a CT (current transformer) contains a large noise",
        "an FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) analysis made it possible to clearly identify the beam signal corresponding to the frequency of the intermediate pulse. The waste beam was measured to be (0.38±0.03)%. Being non destructive",
        "the 1st method is efficiently operating for online monitoring of the waste beam during the RCS user operation so as to directly know the the stripper foil condition and would have great importance for higher power operation.",

        "and influence the transverse acceptance and the collimation efficiency of the collimation system. In this paper we show results of space-charge simulations introducing magnetic field tracking errors and discuss the combined effects of chromaticity",

The OTR light was either observed directly with an Image Intensified CCD camera (ICCD) or indirectly via a spectrometer for wavelength resolved data. A moveable stripping foil allowed measurements with two different ion charge states. The theoretical q2 dependency of the OTR process predicts a six-fold increase in light yield which was confirmed experimentally. Obtained OTR beam profiles were compered to SEM-Grid data. Moreover",

A significant enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio was achieved by means of a resonant pick-up of pill-box shape. Spectra were analyzed on the 36th harmonics of the linac rf-frequency",
