        "we gained substantial experience on the different beam loss mechanisms observed in the LHC all along the beam cycle. Some of these mechanisms were expected like beam losses during injection process and from the collisions. Other mechanisms have been discovered with the higher intensities like beam losses due to UFOs and beam instabilities. Mitigations actions had to be put in place to allow efficient operation. This talk will address the different types of losses (operational beam losses",
        "equipment failure and transient beam losses) as seen in the LHC and in the beam transfer from SPS to LHC.",

During that time the United States High Energy Physics program has continued to change with increasing demands put on the PS. The past 10 years saw an increase of over 10 fold in required hourly flux for the PS and plans are now underway to have the capability to double the output with continued operations until at least 2025. To meet these goals",
        "effort in area of beam loss control has been a major part of the upgrades. Beam collimation and absorption systems as well as diagnostics used to mitigate and control losses have been implemented. The recent implementation of new correctors for orbit and higher harmonic control has also been very beneficial. A summary of recent and planned modification to these PS systems will be discussed.",
