        "We had a massive earthquake in March 2011",
        "which forced us to shutdown J-PARC accelerators for nearly nine months due to its resultant damages. After significant restoration effort",
        "we resumed the beam operation of J-PARC linac in December 2011 and user operation in January 2012. Subsequently",
        "we restored the same beam power as just before the earthquake in March 2012. In the course of the beam commissioning after the earthquake",
        "we have experienced beam losses which were not observed before the earthquake. We discuss the experimentally observed beam losses and its comparison with particle simulations.",
