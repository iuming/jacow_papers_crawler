        "The facility for antiproton and ion research - FAIR - will produce secondary beams of unprecedented intensities [1]. In order to produce such intense secondary beams and to provide intense beams for the CBM [2] and APPA [3] collaboration",
        "primary heavy ion beams of highest intensities will be required. The main driver accelerator of FAIR will be the SIS100 synchrotron. The GSI heavy ion accelerator facility will be the injector of ion beams for SIS100. In order to reach the final intensities above 1011 ions per cycle",
        "the injector chain has to be modified accordingly and the SIS100 has to be tailored to the needs. Therefore an intensity upgrade program of the GSI accelerator facility has been started",
        "which comprises improvements of ion sources",
        "of the injector linacs and of the heavy ion synchrotron SIS18. In addition",
        "high energy beam transport and the SIS100 need to have a dedicated design",
        "in order to handle beam losses. The issues of the upgrade programme and of the SIS100 design will be addressed.",

        "we will discuss on the space-charge force which limit the stored charges in a ring together with the negative-ion injection scheme. The pulsed spallation neutron sources are classified into two schemes. One is the combination of a full-energy linac and an accumulation ring (AR) exemplified by SNS and LANSCE. The other is that of a low-energy linac and a Rapid-Cycle Synchrotron (RCS) exemplified by J-PARC RCS and ISIS. In general",
