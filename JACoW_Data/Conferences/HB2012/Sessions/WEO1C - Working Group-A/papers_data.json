        "because of the high permeability and the high saturation magnetic flux density",
        "the MA cores are the only materials to realize the required gradient. The MA loaded cavity can be considered as a stable passive load. No tuning control is necessary. 11 RF systems are installed in the RCS",

        "the RCS RF systems are operated in a dual harmonic mode to perform the acceleration and the longitudinal manipulation of the high intensity beam in the RCS available space. Beam loading compensation is an important issue. The feed-forward method using the RF beam signals from the wall current monitor has been established. The J-PARC synchrotrons realize stable",
