        "an ion injector and storage ring complex has been designed for delivering a required ion beam of superior qualities characterized by ultra short bunch length and ultra small emittance. Such ion beams are possible due to advantages of the high bunch repetition rate",
        "ultra small bunch charges",
        "and multi-staged beam cooling. This paper will present highlights of the design of this ion complex and the scheme of ion beam formation. We then present the staged beam cooling scheme followed by a discussion on its critical role in the ion beam formation process. We further will present the design concept of a medium energy electron cooler for the ion collider ring utilizing two advanced accelerator technologies",
