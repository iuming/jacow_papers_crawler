        "The Spallation Neutron Source Ring accumulates 0.6 μs long proton bunches of up to 1.6·1014 protons with a typical peak current of over 50 A during a 1 ms cycle. To qualify the beam",
        "we perform different transverse profile measurements that can be done at full intensity. The electron beam scanner performs a non-invasive measurement of the transverse and longitudinal profiles of the beam in the ring. Electrons passing over and through the proton beam are deflected and projected on a fluorescent screen. Analysis of the projection yields the transverse profile while multi transverse profiles offset in time yield the longitudinal profile. Progress made with this system will be discussed as well as temperature measurements of the stripping foil and other transverse measurements.",

        "About 3600 Ionization Chambers are located around the LHC ring to detect beam losses that could damage the equipment or quench superconducting magnets. The BLMs integrate the losses in 12 different time intervals (from 40 μs to 83.8 s) allowing for different abort thresholds depending on the duration of the loss and the beam energy. The signals are also recorded in a database at 1 Hz for offline analysis. Since the 2010 run",
        "a limiting factor in the machine availability occurred due to unforeseen sudden losses appearing around the ring on the ms time scale. Those were detected exclusively by the BLM system and they are the result of the interaction of macro-particles",
        "of sizes estimated to be 1-100 microns",
        "with the proton beams. In this document we describe the techniques employed to identify such events as well as the mitigations implemented in the BLM system to avoid unnecessary LHC downtime.",
