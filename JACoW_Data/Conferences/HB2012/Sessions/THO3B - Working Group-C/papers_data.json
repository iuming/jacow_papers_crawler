        "The goal of the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab will be the search for the conversion of a muon into an electron in the field of a nucleus",
        "with a precision roughly four orders of magnitude better than the current limit. The experiment requires a beam consisting of short (~200 ns FW) bunches of protons are separated by roughly 1.5 microseconds. Because the most significant backgrounds are prompt with respect to the arrival of the protons",
        "out of time beam must be suppressed at a level of at least 10-10 relative to in time beam. The removal of out of time beam is known as \"extinction\". This talk will discuss the likely sources of out of time beam and the steps we plan to take to remove it. In addition",
        "the plan for monitoring the extinction level will be presented.",

        "providing a large variety of high gradient- low loss resonators with large apertures",
        "suitable for many different beam current and energy regimes. Recent development was aiming not only at highest gradient and Q but also at improving field quality",
        "reliability and cost reduction for large production. The SRF R&D effort",
        "once concentrated mostly in the high energy electron machines",
        "is increasingly focused to heavy ion linacs",
        "energy recovery linacs and also to cavities for special applications. A concise overview of the present state of the art will be given.",

The project has chosen operating frequencies that are sub-harmonics of 1.3 GHz and is developing 6 separate cavity designs for acceleration of H− particles with various velocities. An R&D program is in progress to develop these cavities; the associated cryomodules; and the required fabrication and test infrastructure.
