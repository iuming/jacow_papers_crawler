Different dual harmonic acceleration schemes have been studied by using a self-made parameter calculation code - RAMADH and the simulation code - ORBIT. Both complete and partial coverage of the dual harmonic RF system along the acceleration have been considered. The injection by combining beam chopping and off-momentum is used in the macro-particle tracking simulations by ORBIT. In addition",
