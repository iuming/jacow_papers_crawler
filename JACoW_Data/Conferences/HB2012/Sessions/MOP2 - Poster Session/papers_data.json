        "A main challenge in the operation with high intensity beams is managing beam losses that imply the risk of quenching superconducting magnets or even damage equipment. There are various sources of beam losses",
        "such as losses related to injection",
        "to beam instabilities and to UFOs (Unidentified Falling Objects). Mostly surprising in the first years of LHC operation was the observation of UFOs. They are believed to be dust particles with a typical size of 1-100 um",
        "which lead to beam losses with a duration of about ten revolutions when they fall into the beam. 3600 BLMs (Beam Loss Monitors) are installed around the LHC ring",
        "allowing to determinate the accurate location of UFOs. The time resolution of the BLMs is 40 us (half a turn revolution). A measurement of the beam losses with a time resolution better than the bunch spacing of 50 ns is crucial to understand loss mechanisms. Diamond sensors are able to provide such diagnostics and perform particle counting with ns time resolution. In this paper",
        "we present measurements of various types of beam losses with diamond detectors. We also compare measurements of UFO induced beam losses around the LHC ring with results from MadX simulations.",

        "The method of measuring the incoherent synchrotron frequencies in a stationary bunch is presented.

In real experiment",
        "the incoherent frequencies were determined from bunch profiles recorded in the SIS18 with low intensity beam at injection energy. Bunch profiles were measured with a new Fast Current Transformer which has a relatively broad frequency range. The profiles were recorded using 8 bit resolution oscilloscope.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.

The system performance relies on the machine reproducibility and regular loss maps to validate the settings.

Without scraping the tail population is large enough to create losses above the beam abort thresholds of the LHC beam loss monitor system when injecting. The scrapers are only effective if correctly set up. This paper shows the results of periodical scraper scans. The beam position and beam size at the scraper is changing with time. The scraper settings hence need to follow accordingly. The scans also give insight into the transverse tail population and could therefore provide useful beam quality diagnostics. The impact on new scraper designs and setting up strategy are discussed.
