        "other parameters",
        "â€¦)",
        "reducing beam losses with operational parameters away from the design set points",
        "reducing beam losses (or concentrating beam losses at a few locations) using collimators",
        "minimizing beam losses due to beam transfer from one accelerator to the following accelerator - what parameters are important?  The issue of reducing beam losses with operational parameters away from the design set points is especially valuable as it is rarely discussed.",
