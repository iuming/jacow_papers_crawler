        "Space-charge driven nonlinear coupling resonance can have significant impact in high intensity linac and ring operation. Such a resonance causes emittance exchange between different degrees of freedom and may result in potential particle loss from the direction with smaller aperture size. In this paper",
        "we will report on numerical simulation studies of the resonance crossing phenomena using a previous experiment at the CERN PS including detailed three-dimensional space-charge effects and machine nonlinearity."
