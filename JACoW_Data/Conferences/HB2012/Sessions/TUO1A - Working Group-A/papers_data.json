        "electron cloud driven and TMCI instabilities in the SPS",
        "longitudinal coupled bunch instabilities in the PS for example - but also to the existing hardware capability to cope with beam instabilities and losses. A summary of the observations and simulation studies carried out so far",

Simulation and experimental studies of collective effects are therefore an integral part of the ongoing SIS-18 intensity upgrade and the SIS-100 design activities at GSI. In both rings collective effects are caused simultaneously by space charge",
        "impedances and secondary particles. They occur in the longitudinal and transverse planes",
        "in coasting beams as well as for different rf bucket forms. After a brief outline of the role of collective effects at GSI this contribution will focus on recent findings related to the interpretation of signals from intense bunches with space charge. The correct processing of these signals will be especially important for beam diagnostics and feedback control.",

        "setting an upper limit on instantaneous current. The second one arises from the fact that longitudinal phase space is frozen in isochronous rings. This leads to effects of space charge forces which are very peculiar to isochronous machines. We will finally present the simulation tools being developed at TRIUMF to study these effects.",
