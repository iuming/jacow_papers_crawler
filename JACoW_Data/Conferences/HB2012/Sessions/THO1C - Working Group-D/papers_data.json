Major beam loss mechanisms and tuning methods to minimize losses are presented. Concept and optimization of low loss beam extraction from a cyclotron are described. Collimators are used to localize beam losses and activation. Activation levels of accelerator components are shown. An overview on instrumentation for loss monitoring and prevention of failure situations is given. Other relevant aspects include the beam trip statistics and grid to beam power conversion efficiency.

        "to the accumulation of 11 fb-1 integrated luminosity two years later (June 2012). On the RF side this was made possible by a few key design choices and several developments",
        "that allow reliable LHC operation with 0.35 A DC beam at 4 TeV/c (1380 bunches at 50 ns spacing",
        "1.5·1011 p per bunch). This paper reviews the RF design and presents its performance. Plans are also outlined that would allow operation with 25 ns bunch spacing (doubling the beam current) and even increased bunch intensity with the target of above 1A DC current per beam",
