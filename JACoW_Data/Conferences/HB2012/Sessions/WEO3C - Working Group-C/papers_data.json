        "800 MeV proton beam from a rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS)",
        "which is fed by a 70 MeV H− drift tube linac. The multi-turn charge-exchange injection process used on ISIS has been the subject of a programme of detailed studies in recent years including benchmarked simulations and experiments. More recently",
        "these studies have been expanded as plans for upgrading ISIS have focussed on replacement of the 70 MeV linac with a new",
        "higher energy injector and a new synchrotron injection straight. Whilst much of these studies have been reported elsewhere",

        "well established for proton accelerators",
        "is considered for the fully-stripped ion beams. The two-stage system consists of a primary collimator (a scattering foil) and secondary collimators (bulky absorbers). The main tasks of this study are:  to specify beam optics of the system",
        "to calculate dependence of the scattering angle in the foil on the projectile species",
        "to investigate importance of the inelastic nuclear interaction in the foil and  to calculate dependence of the collimation efficiency on the projectile species. A concept for the collimation of partially-stripped ions is based on the stripping of remaining electrons and deflecting using a beam optical element towards a dump location. Residual activation and radiation damage issues of collimator materials are also being studied at GSI. Experimental results from irradiation of carbon-based materials by heavy ions are presented.",
