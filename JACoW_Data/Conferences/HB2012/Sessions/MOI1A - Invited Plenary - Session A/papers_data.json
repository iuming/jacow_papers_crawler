        "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN operates at 4 TeV with high intensity beams",
        "with bunch intensities exceeding the nominal value by several 10 %. The energy stored in each beams is beyond 130 MJ",
        "less than a factor of three from the nominal value at 7 TeV. With these parameters",
        "operation entered into a regime where various effects due to high intensity bunches are observed (instabilities",
        "beam-beam effects",
        "e-cloud effects). The highly efficient collimation system limits beam losses that threaten to quench superconducting magnets. The correct functioning of the machine protection systems is vital during the different operational phases",
        "where already a small fraction of the stored energy is sufficient to damage accelerator equipment or experiments in case of uncontrolled beam loss. Safe operation in presence of such high intensity proton beams is guaranteed by the interplay of many different systems: beam dumping system",
        "beam interlocks",
        "beam instrumentation",
        "equipment monitoring",
        "collimators and absorbers. The experience gained with the key systems of LHC machine protection and collimation will be discussed.",
