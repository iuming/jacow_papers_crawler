        "The Spallation Neutron Source is now operating in production mode at about 1 MW of beam power on target",
        "which corresponds to more than 1014 protons per pulse at 60 Hz with energies exceeding 900 MeV. Although overall beam losses in production tune are low",
        "the highest losses in the entire machine occur in the region downstream of the ring injection stripper foil. In order to better understand the contribution of scattering from the primary stripper foil to losses in the SNS ring",
        "we have carried out calculations using the ORBIT Code aimed at evaluating these losses. These calculations indicate that the probability of beam loss within one turn following a foil hit is ~1.7·10-8*T",
        "where T is the foil thickness in g/cm2",
        "assuming a carbon foil. Thus",
        "for a stripper foil of thickness T = 390 g/cm2",
        "the probability of loss within one turn of a foil hit is ~6.7·10-6. This paper describes the calculations used to arrive at this result",
        "presents the distribution of these losses around the SNS ring",
        "and compares the the calculated loss distribution with that observed experimentally.",
