        "In this paper we study in an idealized lattice model the dynamical behavior of non-equipartitioned beams and of approach to equipartition. It is shown that emittance transfer depends on times scales of tune change",
        "but also the direction of crossing the stopbands of space charge resonances. This provides additional information to support the stability charts suggested previously as design tool for high current linacs.",

        "are used as primary collimators instead than a standard amorphous target. Studies are performed with stored beams of protons and lead ions at 270 Z GeV. The loss profile is precisely measured in the area near to the crystal-collimator setup and in the downstream dispersion suppressor. A strong correlation of the losses in the two areas is observed and a steady reduction of dispersive losses is recorded at the onset of the channeling process. The loss map in the accelerator ring is is also reduced. These observations strongly support our expectation that the coherent deflection of the beam halo by a bent crystal should enhance the collimation efficiency in hadron colliders",
