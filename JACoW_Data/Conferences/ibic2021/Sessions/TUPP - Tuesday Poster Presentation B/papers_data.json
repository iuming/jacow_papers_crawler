        "the slit scan can give the details of the electron beam phase space",
        "which is useful for studying and understanding the beam dynamics. The ELBE SRF Gun diagnostics beamline was built science 2008 and both of two techniques were used to measure beam emittance. From 2019",

        "the image processing is time-consuming to reduce noise and make sure the emittance accuracy. Even so",
        "the dark current noise still cannot be avoided in low bunch charge. The deep learning method is advanced to image processing and has potential application in this field to reduce the noise effectively and give a more accuracy emittance of the beam. The applications of deep learning in slit-scan images processing can be classified into two classes: images classification network and regression network."

        "in which the excitation of wire oscillation is made through the interaction of the wire current with a permanent magnetic field. The high sensitivity of the oscillation frequency to the wire temperature allows the resonator to be used for measuring charged-particle/X-ray/laser/neutron beam profiles with wide dynamic range. The beam flux falling on the wire increases its temperature from fractions of mK to hundreds of degrees. Another application method is to use the vibrating wire as a moving target",
        "in which signals created at beam interaction with the wire are measured synchronously with the wire oscillation frequency. This method allows to effectively separate the background signals. Also",
        "the well-defined (in space) and stable (in time) form of the wire oscillation allows the vibrating wire to be used directly as a miniature scanner for measuring thin beams. The latter two methods enable a significant reduction in scanning time compared to the original thermal-based method."

In parallel to ion source and RFQ research and development we have experimented with our proprietary pepper pot device. We plan to install the final version of the pepper pot into the LEBT section and use the measured beam distributions for the design of a new RFQ. With the recent redesign of the mask-target assembly we have increased the active area of the device and generated a possibility for an accurate pixel calibration by a specialised calibration mask. Our tool PePE (Pepper Pot Emittance Evaluation) offers different approaches for the reconstruction of the 4D emittance parameters from the raw image. The evaluation process was validated by a pepper pot image generated from a simulated beam with known properties."

The first prototype of a fast scanning diamond beam profile detector (DBPD) suitable for invasive high power CW electron beam core profile measurements in transmittance mode was developed. It consists of a multi-strip solid state diamond detector to scan with high speed (up to 1 m/s) and precision (about 5 um) through the core of an electron beam. The diamond sensor was made from a thin pc-CVD diamond plate with highly B-doped CVD diamond conductive strips. Transient currents from the multi-strip detector were measured with fast digitizing electrometers. Successful operation of the DBPD was demonstrated for pulsed (5 Hz) and CW (78 kHz) CeC beams",

Thermal modeling demonstrated a manageable thermal impact even from a relatively long (up to 2 min) insertion of the diamond sensor into the CW CeC core. Electrical impedance modeling of the detector and vacuum chamber assembly demonstrated minimal impact on beam line impedance with diamond sensor insertion."

A test accelerator known as PIP-II Injector Test (PIP2IT) has been built to validate the concept of the front-end of such a machine. One of the paramount challenges of PIP2IT was to validate the bunch by bunch chopping system in the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT). This paper aims to present the direct extinction measurements at PIP2IT and their analysis. These measurements have been taken by two Resistive Wall Current Monitors (RWCM) and recorded by a high bandwidth oscilloscope."

The HLS will measure the vertical floor displacement at a total of 110 locations. Combined with the highly stable BPM/xBPM stands",
