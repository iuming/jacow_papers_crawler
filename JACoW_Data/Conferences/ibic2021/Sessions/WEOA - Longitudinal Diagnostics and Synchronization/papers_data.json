This technique utilizes two counter-propagating quasi-single-cycle THz pulses generated from two OH-1 organic crystals coupled into an optimized THz compressor structure. Ultrafast dynamics of photoexcited bismuth films show an improved temporal resolution from 178 fs down to 85 fs when the THz-compressed UED probes are used with no time-stamping correction. Furthermore",
