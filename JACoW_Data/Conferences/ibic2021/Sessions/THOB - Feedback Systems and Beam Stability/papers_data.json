        "together with the Synchrotron SOLEIL",
        "have demonstrated the possibility to control the multibunching instability that appears spontaneously when the number of electrons in a bunch exceeds a threshold value (typically few mA). By measuring the amplitude of THz emission created by the bunch structure appearing with this instability",
        "and by modulating correspondingly the RF cavity amplitude (to change the bunch length)",
        "the THz coherent radiation can be stabilized. The method is inspired by control of chaos techniques which aims at stabilizing an unstable state thanks to feedback loop. Feasibility experiment conducted at Synchrotron SOLEIL showed that the stabilization process is efficient up to 9.15 mA. This major achievement is a first step toward strong THz coherent sources in storage rings. Next challenges are the extension of the control to higher current.",

        "High-precision intra-bunch-train beam orbit feedback correction systems have been developed and tested in the ATF2 beamline of the Accelerator Test Facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Japan. Two systems are presented: 1) The vertical position of the bunch measured at two beam stripline position monitors (BPMs) is used to calculate a pair of kicks which are applied to the next bunch using two upstream kickers",
        "thereby correcting both the vertical position and trajectory angle. This system was optimized so as to stabilize the beam offset at the feedback BPMs to better than 350 nm",
        "yielding a local trajectory angle correction to within 250 nrad. Measurements with a beam size monitor at the focal point (IP) demonstrate that reducing the trajectory jitter of the beam by a factor of 4 also reduces the observed wakefield-induced increase in the measured beam size as a function of beam charge by a factor of c. 1.6. 2) High-resolution cavity BPMs were used to provide local beam stabilization in the IP region. The BPMs were demonstrated to achieve an operational resolution of ~20 nm. With the application of single-BPM and two-BPM feedback",
        "beam stabilization of below 50 nm and 41 nm respectively has been achieved with a closed-loop latency of 232 ns."

        "such as online surrogate models that act as virtual observers of beam properties. Then we give an overview of adaptive machine learning (AML) in which adaptive model-independent methods are combined with ML-based methods so that they are robust for and applicable to time-varying systems*. Finally",
        "we present some recent applications of AML for accelerator controls and diagnostics. In particular we present recently developed adaptive latent space tuning methods and show how they can be used as virtual adaptive predictors of an accelerator beam’s longitudinal phase space as well as all of the other 2D projections of a beam’s 6D phase space**",
