This reduces the inner diameter compared to the existing chamber. The vacuum components should fit to the new dimension to minimize transitions and therefore reduce wakefields which could interact with the electron beam and disturb the SASE effect. The electron beam position in the intersection of the undulators should be detected with a high resolution and a large charge dynamic range. Cavity BPMs are known to fulfill these requirements. The existing design with 10 mm inner diameter for the Eu-XFEL is reduced to 6 mm. Additional improvements are: widening of the dipole resonator waveguide to adapt to the dipole mode and antenna transmission. The resonator frequency of 3.3 GHz and loaded quality factor of 70 are maintained to use electronic synergies to other projects. The design considerations and simulation results of the cavity BPM will be presented."

Successful transverse cooling of the RHIC ion beam has been verified after using this switching technique to provide continuous calibration of the BPM electronics [1].

        "the fast orbit feedback system (FOFB) is employed to eliminate the undesirable interference from various sources. The paper will present the design of the design of the global Fast Orbit Feedback for Hefei Advanced Light Facility (HALF). The FOFB system aims to stabilize the electron beam position towards an ideal electron beam orbit. The FOFB system employs high-speed board series PXIe-7902 board of National Instruments (NI) to realize the design of the communication controller (CC) and the algorithm calculation. The PXIe-7902 called cell has a built-in Xilinx Virtex-7 586T and 24 two-way digital channels. Which allows connecting 12 Liberal BPMs at most to receive the beam position values. A two-tier communication architecture is applied in the CC design. The beam position monitors are directly connected to cell and do not communicate each other. Which liberates the tasks of BPMs and make the task concentrated on the cell. The correction output is connected to the power supply to adjust the correctors to reach beam stability.",
