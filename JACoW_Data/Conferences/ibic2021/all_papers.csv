The KIT electron storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator) is the first storage ring with a near-field single-shot electro-optical (EO) bunch profile monitor installed for the measurement of electron bunch dynamics in the longitudinal phase-space. Using electro-optical spectral decoding (EOSD) it is possible to imprint the bunch profile on chirped laser pulses subsequently read out by a spectrometer and a camera. However; commercially available cameras have a drawback in their acquisition rate; which is limited to a few hundred kHz. Hence; we have developed KALYPSO; an ultra-fast line camera capable of operating in the MHz regime. Its modular approach allows the installation of several sensors e.g. Si; InGaAs; PbS; PbSe to cover a wide range of spectral sensitivities. In this contribution; an overview of the EOSD experimental setup and the detector system installed for longitudinal bunch studies will be presented.,"Funding: This work is supported by BMBF project 05K19VKD (Federal Ministry of Education and Research), DFG-funded Doctoral School ""KSETA""",Your browser cannot play the video.

A conventional BBA method makes a local bump; change quadrupole strength; and measure COD by the quadrupole; which is very time-consuming. However; the fast BBA using AC excitations of corrector magnets can quickly measure the displacement between a BPM and a quadrupole. In the case of ALBA; the BBA duration was reduced from 5 hours to 10 minutes. The accuracy was the same as the conventional BBA (~10 um). This fast BBA method will help the alignment of BPMs in 3rd and 4th generation light sources.; *: Z. Marti et al.; Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 23; 012802 (2020),,Your browser cannot play the video.

ibic2021,,MOOC02,An Experimental Comparison of Single Crystal CVD Diamond and 4H-SiC Synchrotron X-Ray Beam Diagnostics,C.E. Houghton; C. Bloomer; L. Bobb; DLS; Harwell; United Kingdom; As synchrotron beamlines increasingly use micro-focus techniques with detectors sampling at kHz rates; the need for real-time monitoring of the beam position at similar bandwidths is vital. Commercially available single-crystal CVD diamond X-ray diagnostics are well established as excellent non-destructive monitors for synchrotron X-ray beamlines. Silicon carbide (4H-SiC) X-ray beam position monitors (XBPMs) are a recent development with the potential to provide the same benefits as their diamond counterparts with larger usable apertures and lower cost. At Diamond Light Source a comparison between single-crystal CVD diamond and 4H-SiC XBPMs has been carried out. The sc-diamond and 4H-SiC beam position monitors are mounted in-line along the beam path; so that synchronous kHz measurements of the synchrotron X-ray beam motion can be measured. Several tests of the two position monitors performance are presented: comparing kHz beam position measurements from the detectors; temporal response; and signal uniformity across the face of the detectors. Each test is performed with varying bias voltages applied to the detectors. A discussion of the benefits and limitations of 4H-SiC and diamond detectors is included.,,Your browser cannot play the video. Consider download from Link Address.

It is based on a 1.5 GeV normal conducting high gradient C-band (linear accelerator) LINAC and contains two FEL beamline; a seeded FEL beamline and a SASE beamline; and five experimental stations. The performance of X-ray FEL depends strongly on the quality of the electron beam and single shot stability. We have developed a BPM system including SBPM and CBPM. The resolution of SBPM is better than 4μmeters; and the resolution of CBPM is better than 176 nm. Because of its excellent position resolution; it plays an important role in the SASE beamline commissioning. The beam adjusters rely on this system to find and maintain an ideal track; and complete the debugging of the SBP beamline within 21 days. This paper presents the system design; methods used to determine the resolution; the performance; and the applications of those BPMs.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

After ten years hard work; in February of 2021; this LINAC reached its design goal with the successful commissioning of a 10 mA; 205 kW continuous-wave (CW) proton beam with the energy of 20 MeV. CAFe’s beam availability during long-term; high-power operation was measured to be 93- 96%; indicating high reliability: 12 hours of operation at 174 kW / 10 mA and 108 hours at 126 kW / 7.3 mA. To reach this final goal; challenges must be overcome including beam-loss control and detection; heavy beam loading and rapid fault recovery. During the whole process; beam instruments played a key point to overcome all those challenges. The beam diagnostics team delivered a comprehensive suite of instrumentation that supported the machine commissioning and operations; provided relevant feedback and beam interlock signal of the accelerator operation as well. A suite of instrumentation was commissioned and performed that includes a variety of current monitors; normal and cold capacitive BPMs; transverse and longitudinal profile monitors; multi-slit and single-slit scanning emittance stations; time-of-flight and magnetic field related energy and energy spread measurements; beam loss monitors and a target imaging system as well. The commissioning results and performance of these systems will be described; as well as the current and beam loss measurement for fast machine protection with the responding time of less than 10 us. Also the ten year’s lessons learnt will be described.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/talks/mopp01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/papers/mopp01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/posters/mopp01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2021-MOPP01,

The cyclotron-based BNCT system is undergoing clinical trial approval. In order to develop BNCT; the efficiency of the electrostatic accelerator ion source is important. In particular; it should be possible to maintain the optimal beam current by controlling the extraction; plasma; filament; and arc of the ion source. A set value is required for the desired beam current. In this article; the performance of the beam current was confirmed by changing the extraction voltage using the ion source of the KIRAMS’s static accelerator. In this experiment; plasma voltage; bias voltage; and extraction voltage were set as fixed values. After the extraction voltage was set to 2 kV; the beam current was set to 1 mA; 1.5 mA; 2 mA; 3 mA for each experiment. After that; the data was extracted by adjusting the extraction voltage by 0 - 0.2 kV. The extracted data result shows how the output beam current changes when the extraction voltage changes.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/talks/mopp06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/papers/mopp06.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/posters/mopp06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2021-MOPP06,

ibic2021,,MOPP08,Design of a Cavity Beam Position Monitor for the FLASH 2020+ Undulator Intersection Project at DESY,DESY; Hamburg; Germany,The FLASH 1 beamline at DESY will be upgraded from fixed to variable gap undulators in the next years. For this the vacuum beamline has to be adapted. This reduces the inner diameter compared to the existing chamber. The vacuum components should fit to the new dimension to minimize transitions and therefore reduce wakefields which could interact with the electron beam and disturb the SASE effect. The electron beam position in the intersection of the undulators should be detected with a high resolution and a large charge dynamic range. Cavity BPMs are known to fulfill these requirements. The existing design with 10 mm inner diameter for the Eu-XFEL is reduced to 6 mm. Additional improvements are: widening of the dipole resonator waveguide to adapt to the dipole mode and antenna transmission. The resonator frequency of 3.3 GHz and loaded quality factor of 70 are maintained to use electronic synergies to other projects.

In the application of bunch charge and position measurement; the accurate amplitude extraction method for cavity BPM signal is the primary issue to be considered when designing the data acquisition and processing system. In this paper; through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation; it is proved that the optimal algorithm of amplitude extraction for CBPM exists; and the dependence between the data processing window size and the decay time of the cavity BPM under the optimal design is given. In addition; the relationship between the optimized amplitude extraction uncertainty and the noise-to-signal ratio; sampling rate of data acquisition and processing system; and the decay time of the cavity BPM is also proposed; which can also provide clear guidance for the design and optimization of the CBPM system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/talks/mopp09_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/papers/mopp09.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/posters/mopp09_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2021-MOPP09,48

To guarantee the high performance of FEL light pulses; it put a strict requirement on the monitoring of electron bunch trajectory. The position resolution of each bunch at the undulator section is required to be better than 200 nm at a bunch charge of 100 pC. The cavity beam position monitor (CBPM) is widely used in FEL facilities for its unique high resolution and high sensitivity. The output signals of an ideal pillbox cavity are proportional to the resonant frequency. Compared with the C-band cavity; the X-band cavity is expected to have a higher signal-to-noise ratio which is especially helpful at low bunch charge. Therefore; an X-band CBPM prototype is developed for SHINE.

As for the fourth-generation storage ring; the emittance and beam size continue to decrease and higher requirements are being put for-ward for beam orbit stability. There are two main factors that affect the stability of the beam orbit. One is the vibration of the ground and other systems; which requires highly mechanically stable support. The other is due to synchrotron radiation and changes in ambient temperature; which lead to the expansion and deformation of the vacuum chamber; causing BPM movement and misjudging the position of the beam orbit. The misjudging will introduce errors in the orbit feedback system and decrease the stability of the beam orbit.

At Elettra; after an internal development; the effectiveness of this approach was proven with tests in the laboratory and on the storage ring. The pilot-tone scheme will be adopted for the eBPMs that will equip Elettra 2.0; the low-emittance upgrade of the present machine.

The proton beam; being considerably more intense than the co-propagating electron bunch; perturbs the measurement of the electron beam position achieved via standard techniques. This contribution shows that the electrons position monitoring is possible by frequency discrimination; exploiting the large bunch length difference between the electron and proton beams. Simulations and a beam measurement hint; the measurement has to be carried out in a frequency regime of a few tens of GHz; which is far beyond the spectrum produced by the 1ns long (4 σ Gaussian) proton bunch. As operating a conventional Beam Position Monitor (BPM) in this frequency range is problematic; an innovative approach based on the emission of coherent Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation (ChDR) in dielectrics is being studied.

ibic2021,,MOPP20,Beam Position Monitor Calibration by Rapid Channel Switching,R.L. Hulsart; R.J. Michnoff; S. Seletskiy; P. Thieberger; BNL; Upton; New York; USA; One of the requirements for low-energy RHIC electron cooling (LEReC) is a small relative angle between the ion and electron beams as they co-propagate. In order to minimize relative electron-ion trajectories angle; BPM measurements of both beams must be very accurate. Achieving this requires good electronic calibration of the associated cables and RF components; due to their inherent imperfections. Unfortunately; these are typically frequency dependent; especially in the RF filter and amplifier stages. The spectral content of the ion vs. electron bunch signals varies significantly; presenting a calibration challenge; even when using the same sampling channels and electronics to measure both beams. A scheme of rapidly swapping the BPM signals from the pickup electrodes between the two signal cables (and sampling channels); using switches installed near the BPM was implemented to combat these calibration is-sues. Bias in each signal path appears as an offset which has an equal and opposite component when the cables are reversed. Taking the average of the two measurements with the channels in normal and reverse positions reduces this offset error. Successful transverse cooling of the RHIC ion beam has been verified after using this switching technique to provide continuous calibration of the BPM electronics [1].

Parameters of electron beam generated by laser-driven photocathode-equipped gun are sensitive to laser wavelength; laser pulse intensity; duration (RMS); spot size (RMS) and spot position on the photocathode. Typically; tuning of such generation schema requires stable laser pulse generation and shaping; alignment of the laser transport line (LTL) and final focus optical system. Conventional diagnostics along LTL may include CCD cameras for position and profile tuning and monitoring including that at the virtual cathode position. An approach to achieve laser spot size and position with the high level of stability and reproducibility on the photocathode is associated with the implementation of geometric optics based software protocol which allows for automatic- or semi-automatic alignment of entire LTL. This approach was developed and applied for KEK LUCX RF gun LTL alignment. It employs two CCD cameras**; motorized mirrors and optical telescope designed for laser pulse delivery to the photocathode.

The paper will present the design of the design of the global Fast Orbit Feedback for Hefei Advanced Light Facility (HALF). The FOFB system aims to stabilize the electron beam position towards an ideal electron beam orbit. The FOFB system employs high-speed board series PXIe-7902 board of National Instruments (NI) to realize the design of the communication controller (CC) and the algorithm calculation. The PXIe-7902 called cell has a built-in Xilinx Virtex-7 586T and 24 two-way digital channels. Which allows connecting 12 Liberal BPMs at most to receive the beam position values. A two-tier communication architecture is applied in the CC design. The beam position monitors are directly connected to cell and do not communicate each other. Which liberates the tasks of BPMs and make the task concentrated on the cell. The correction output is connected to the power supply to adjust the correctors to reach beam stability.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/talks/mopp39_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/papers/mopp39.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/posters/mopp39_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2021-MOPP39,

HEPS Fofb independently developed hardware equipment; used to collect 576 BPM data; and then distributed to 192 fast corrector power supply after matrix operation and PI operation.

ibic2021,,TUOA01,Single-Crystal Diamond Pixelated Radiation Detector with Buried Graphitic Electrodes,C. Bloomer; L. Bobb; DLS; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom; University of Warwick; Coventry; United Kingdom; A new type of transmissive pixel detector has been developed for synchrotron radiation diagnostics at Diamond Light Source. A thin single-crystal CVD diamond plate is used as the detector material; and a pulsed-laser technique has been used to write conductive graphitic electrodes inside the diamond plate. Instead of using traditional electrodes formed from a layer of surface metallisation; the graphitic electrodes are buried under the surface of the diamond and result in an all-carbon imaging detector. Within the instrument’s transmissive aperture there are no surface structures that could be damaged by exposure to radiation beams; and no surface metallization that could introduce unwanted absorption edges. The instrument has successfully been used to image the X-ray beam profile and measure the beam position to sub-micron accuracy at 100 Hz at Diamond Light Source. A novel modulation lock-in technique is used to read out all pixels simultaneously. Presented in this work are measurements of the detector’s beam position resolution and intensity resolution. Initial measurements of the instrument’s spread-function are also presented. Numerical simulations are used to identify potential improvements to the electrode geometry to improve the spatial resolution of similar future detectors. The instrument has applications in both synchrotron radiation instrumentation; where real-time monitoring of the beam profile is useful for beam diagnostics and fault-finding; and particle tracking at colliders; where the electrode geometries that buried graphitic tracks can provide increased the charge collection efficiency of the detector.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

ibic2021,,TUOA02,Characterizing Ultralow Emittance Electron Beams using Structured Light Fields,IOQ; Jena; Germany; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; Novel schemes for generating ultralow emittance electron beams have been developed in past years and promise compact particle sources with excellent beam quality suitable for future high-energy physics experiments and free-electron lasers. Current methods for the characterization of low emittance electron beams such as pepperpot measurements or beam focus scanning are limited in their capability to resolve emittances in the sub 0.1 mm mrad regime. Here we propose a novel; highly sensitive method for the single shot characterization of the beam waist and emittance using interfering laser beams. In this scheme; two laser pulses are focused under an angle creating a gratinglike interference pattern. When the electron beam interacts with the structured laser field; the phase space of the electron beam becomes modulated by the laser ponderomotive force and results in a modulated beam profile after further electron beam phase advance; which allows for the characterization of ultralow emittance beams. 2D PIC simulations show the effectiveness of the technique for normalized emittances in the range of 0.01 to 1 mm mrad.; Characterizing ultralow emittance electron beams using structured light fields  Andreas Seidel; Jens Osterhoff; and Matt Zepf  Phys.

We have been developing a non-destructive transverse beam profile monitor using a gas sheet. The sheet-shaped gas flow is formed by a technique of rarefied gas dynamics and enables two-dimensional profile measurement. One of the issues on development of the profile monitor based on beam-gas interaction is reconstruction of the beam profile from the obtained signal by the monitor. Our gas sheet monitor captures the beam-induced fluorescence using an image intensifier and a CCD camera. Photons produced by beam-gas interaction are integrated along the normal direction of the detector; the luminous intensity distribution of the obtained image can be written as an integral of the product of the sheet-gas density distribution and the beam profile. To solve the equation and reconstruct the profile; the sheet-gas density distribution needs to be measured. The gas density distribution was quantified using an electron beam narrow enough as compared with the beam whose profile needs to be measured. The narrow electron beam induces local photon emission from the gas sheet; and the gas density distribution can be measured by scanning the electron beam position on the gas sheet while monitoring the photon signal intensities. An advantage of this measurement method of the gas density distribution is the obtained distribution includes the sensitivity distribution of the detector; such as a CCD camera and an image intensifier. The measured gas density distribution including the sensitivity distribution was applied to the profile reconstruction of 3 MeV; 60 mA negative hydrogen ion beam in J-PARC Linac; and the beam profile was successfully obtained.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

Two traditional emittance measurement techniques are curried out widely in photoinjectors beamline; quadrupole scan and slit scan. Comparing the quadrupole scan; the slit scan can give the details of the electron beam phase space; which is useful for studying and understanding the beam dynamics. The ELBE SRF Gun diagnostics beamline was built science 2008 and both of two techniques were used to measure beam emittance. From 2019; to optimize beam parameters for users more effectively; a new fast slit scan system was built; which is based on a mask with one 100 um width slit; a fast motor; two cameras and a control and data analysis software. In one experiment; about one hundred images will be captured in 5 to 15 seconds. In traditional data analysis method; the image processing is time-consuming to reduce noise and make sure the emittance accuracy. Even so; the dark current noise still cannot be avoided in low bunch charge. The deep learning method is advanced to image processing and has potential application in this field to reduce the noise effectively and give a more accuracy emittance of the beam.

The high sensitivity of the oscillation frequency to the wire temperature allows the resonator to be used for measuring charged-particle/X-ray/laser/neutron beam profiles with wide dynamic range. The beam flux falling on the wire increases its temperature from fractions of mK to hundreds of degrees. Another application method is to use the vibrating wire as a moving target; in which signals created at beam interaction with the wire are measured synchronously with the wire oscillation frequency.

Also; the well-defined (in space) and stable (in time) form of the wire oscillation allows the vibrating wire to be used directly as a miniature scanner for measuring thin beams.

Our diamond beam halo monitor is based on a microwave measurement of the change in the resonator coupling and eigen frequency. For measurements we put a sensitive diamond sample in a resonator that intercepts the halo. By measuring the change in RF properties of the resonator; one can infer the beam halo parameters scanning across the beam to map its transverse distribution. In first experiments we used a Vertical Beam Test Stand; delivered DC electron beam of the 20-200 keV energy with the current up to 50 ’A; to characterize several diamond samples. We have also designed and fabricated a scanning diamond X-band resonator; which was tested at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA).

Due to the lower power consumption and high flexibility of these miniature devices; a multi-camera system can be developed more effectively. A prototype of a beam-induced residual gas fluorescence monitor (BIF) has been developed and successfully tested at the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) of the Goethe University Frankfurt. This BIF is based on a single-board camera inserted into the vacuum. The previous promising results led to the development of a multi-camera system with 11 cameras. One of the advantages of integrating such a system into the vacuum is the small form factor; allowing this detector to be integrated in regions that are difficult to access.

Before reaching the dump; the proton beam (from 26 to 450 GeV) is vertically kicked and then diluted passing through a series of horizontal and vertical bumps. This prevents the dump damage; by reducing the power density per surface unit. The quality of each dump event must be recorded and verified and all parameters of the SBDS are logged and analysed from the so-called Post-Mortem dataset. An essential part of the verification is performed by a beam imaging system based on a Chromox screen imaged on a digital camera. The desired availability level (100%; to protect the dump) and the harsh radiation environment made the design extremely challenging. For example; it implied the need for a 17 m long optical line made of high-quality optical elements; a special camera shielding (to minimise single event upsets) and a generally careful design accounting for maintenance aspects; mainly related to expected high activation levels. After giving an overview of the whole imaging system design with details on the chosen layout and hardware; this paper will discuss the DAQ and SW architecture; including the automatic; on-line; image selection for validating every dump event.

In those electron beam melting applications; the electron energy can be 60 to 100 keV; the beam current can be around 10 mA to 100 mA; and the beam spot size can be as small as 200 µm according to electron energy and beam current. Those parameters can result in very high beam power densities. The diagnostics of this powerful beam can be quite a problematic issue. As the electron beam current required for the application is quite similar to DC current; fast undestructive current measurement techniques for current beam profile and beam position are very limited in performance. Therefore; some destructive techniques to measure current and other beam properties are essential. As part of the beam diagnostics for electron beam melting application for additive manufacturing; the authors proposed a complete beam diagnostics system to measure the electron gun’s capabilities and associate electromagnetic lens systems. The following properties have been diagnosed as part of this research work: i) Beam Current; ii) Beam Spot size for enlarged and focused beams; iii) Scanning velocity of the deflected beam; iv) Profile of the beam. The authors proposed methods to measure focused beam spot size and deflected beam scanning velocity using Secondary Emission Grid Sensors.

This device contributes to the diagnosis of beam core and halo of intense proton beams before injection to MR; particularly measurement of beam cut effects by beam collimators located in upstream of the device is useful for beam shaping. We have been developing the second device to be installed into MR for diagnosing on injected beams. By using the both of first and second devices; beam core and halo can be diagnosed in different phases. Moreover; by using the second device; beam profiles including halo can be measured with circulating beams in almost twenty turns after injection. This measurement allows us to diagnose beam cut effect by the MR beam collimators by observing beam halo phase space distribution. Property tests of the device have been conducted at a test bench to install it in the ring. In the structure of the device; its longitudinal coupling impedance close to 10 Ω (by Z/n value) is an issue; especially due to high-frequency resonance in the in-vacuum optical system and the target section by beam wake fields. As a countermeasure; we have been studying the absorption of the power of such high frequency resonances up to about 1 GHz using SiC. We have been studying to keep the coupling impedance as low as possible. In a current simulation; we obtained the result that the impedance can be reduced to about 0.5 Ω or less. At the end of this fiscal year; we plan to conduct a characteristic test with SiC mounted device. In this presentation; we will discuss the characteristics of the developing device to be put in the ring and the simulation result of suppressing the coupling impedance.; [1] Y.

Efficient electron cooling requires a high quality; high power electron beam with tight parameters (energy and space trajectory). In order to achieve and maintain the required parameters and stability of the electron beam; its parameters have to be continuously monitored and feedback control has to be developed. However; existing detectors are not suitable for invasive profile measurements of powerful continuous wave (CW) electron beams. As a result; the beam profile of powerful CW electron beams is currently monitored in low repetition pulsed mode and assumed to remain the same in CW mode. The first prototype of a fast scanning diamond beam profile detector (DBPD) suitable for invasive high power CW electron beam core profile measurements in transmittance mode was developed. It consists of a multi-strip solid state diamond detector to scan with high speed (up to 1 m/s) and precision (about 5 um) through the core of an electron beam. The diamond sensor was made from a thin pc-CVD diamond plate with highly B-doped CVD diamond conductive strips. Transient currents from the multi-strip detector were measured with fast digitizing electrometers. Successful operation of the DBPD was demonstrated for pulsed (5 Hz) and CW (78 kHz) CeC beams; including the detector’s ability to withstand a 20 sec insertion into the CW CeC beam core. The X-Y beam spatial profile was measured in one scan. Thermal modeling demonstrated a manageable thermal impact even from a relatively long (up to 2 min) insertion of the diamond sensor into the CW CeC core. Electrical impedance modeling of the detector and vacuum chamber assembly demonstrated minimal impact on beam line impedance with diamond sensor insertion.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/talks/tupp30_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/papers/tupp30.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/posters/tupp30_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2021-TUPP30,276

ibic2021,,WEOA05,Visualizing Femtosecond Dynamics with Ultrafast Electron Probes Through Terahertz Compression and Time-Stamping,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Visualizing ultrafast dynamics at the atomic scale requires time-resolved pump-probe characterization with femtosecond temporal resolution. For single-shot ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) with fully relativistic electron bunch probes; existing techniques are limited by the achievable electron probe bunch length; charge; and timing jitter. We present the first experimental demonstration of pump-probe UED with THz-driven compression and time-stamping that enable UED probes with unprecedented temporal resolution. This technique utilizes two counter-propagating quasi-single-cycle THz pulses generated from two OH-1 organic crystals coupled into an optimized THz compressor structure. Ultrafast dynamics of photoexcited bismuth films show an improved temporal resolution from 178 fs down to 85 fs when the THz-compressed UED probes are used with no time-stamping correction. Furthermore; we use a novel time-stamping technique to reveal transient oscillations in the dynamical response of THz-excited single-crystal gold films previously inaccessible by standard UED; achieving a time-stamped temporal resolution down to 5 fs.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,Funding: U.S. DOE Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515.

ibic2021,,WEPP04,Schottky Signal From Distributed Orbit Pick-Ups,O. Marqversen; S. Jensen; CERN; Geneva 23; Switzerland; In the CERN Extra Low ENergy Anti-proton (ELENA) ring; intended for the deceleration of antiprotons; the longitudinal Schottky signal is obtained by summing the multiple electrostatic pick-up (PU) signals that are also used to measure the closed orbit. The signals from the individual PUs are phase-compensated to a single; common longitudinal location in the machine and added in the time domain. In this contribution; the related theoretical phase compensation is calculated and compared to measurements. We show how the cross correlation between the Schottky noise from the individual PUs can be used to find the correct phase-compensation for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This improvement in terms of SNR is; as expected; proportional to the square root of the number of PUs. The capability of the system to measure both; the bunched and the un-bunched low intensity (~3·107 H− @ 100keV / 144kHz) beams is confirmed by the experimental results presented. Furthermore; the inter-bunch phase correlation is briefly addressed and; for the case of bunched beams; the Schottky signal levels once down converted to different harmonics of the revolution frequency (frev) are presented. In applications where the coherent beam signal dominates the spectrum and limits the dynamic range of the signal processing system; a down-conversation to a non-integer multiple of the RF harmonic is proposed as a way to reduce the coherent signal level.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/talks/wepp04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/papers/wepp04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2021/posters/wepp04_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2021-WEPP04,366

The IOTA OSC experiment is designed for a low nominal beam current (~0.1 microAmps of 100-MeV electrons) to reduce intrabeam scattering (IBS); and during cooling; OSC is expected to reduce the bunch length from ~200 ps to ~130 ps*. These equilibrium bunch lengths can be measured using a streak camera and the optical synchrotron radiation (OSR) generated in a ring dipole by the circulating beam. A similar measurement was previously performed at the Advanced Photon Source with a Hamamatsu C5680 synchroscan streak camera operating at 117.3 MHz**. In this case; synchronous summing of OSR resulted in a bunch length measurement of 276 ± 30 ps using only 57 electrons circulating at 425 MeV. At IOTA; an existing streak camera has been modified to operate at the 11th harmonic of the ring’s revolution frequency of 7.50 MHz and has been installed on an OSR port in support of the OSC experiments.

In experiments with large ramifications; it is important to quantify the uncertainty of each prediction. Given out-of-distribution inputs (e.g. using the same machine in a different operation mode); it is also necessary to understand how robust the VD model is and how well it generalizes on unfamiliar data. In this work**; we use various compositions of neural networks to explore and enhance prediction uncertainty and robustness on data sets gathered from SLAC National Laboratory. We aim to accurately and confidently predict the longitudinal phase space images of electron beams. The ability to make informed decisions under uncertainty and limited computational power is crucial for reliable deployment of scalable deep learning tools on safety-critical systems such as particle accelerators.; * Hanuka; A.; Emma; C.; Maxwell; T. et al.

The working frequency for the deflector is 11.424 GHz. New free electron laser LCLS-II has two undulator beamlines; one Soft-X-Ray and another Hard-X-Ray. The Hard-X-Ray line uses two one-meter long X-band deflectors for beam diagnostics. We have designed; build; installed and commissioned another; 1.5 meter long X-band deflector in the Soft-X-Ray beam line. Both Hard-X-Ray and Soft-X-Ray deflectors share one klystron. RF power is transmitted from a 50 MW klystron to a tunnel in an overmoded circular waveguide and then directed to either of the deflectors using a remotely controlled RF switch. The power split ratio could be changed arbitrarily; and both deflectors could work simultaneously. In this article; we provide details on the development and commissioning of the new deflector.,,"[1] C. Behrens et al., ’Few-femtosecond time-resolved measurements of X-ray free-electron lasers’ Nat.

The modifications are intended to allow operation with consistently high accuracy in a 1 pC mode; which is required for various user experiments. The lower charges; e.g. a factor of 20; lead to a reduced signal strength at the pickups and thus to a decreased resolution. A significant potential for improvement has been identified in a modified pickup structure and transmission network; which provide the transient voltage signal to subsequent parts of the synchronization system. One solution for a broadband pickup structure with short signal paths; large active surfaces and minimum aperture diameter could be achieved by connecting rod-shaped pickups to a combination network on a printed circuit board; which will be mounted in the beamline.

We are now installing LCLS-II; a superconducting linac that replaces the first km. Two undulators; for hard and soft x rays; will be driven by bunches from either linac. One of the solutions developed at SLAC involves a pyroelectric detector; which converts the infrared emitted by the electron bunch into voltage by measuring fast changes in the temperature of the detecting crystal. Not only are the pyrodetectors used at SLAC but also a method with gap diodes. The radial electric field produced by the bunches leaks through a ceramic gap in the beampipe and is collected by a horn antenna and conveyed through a one millimeter waveguide. The waveguides act as a filter; only passing shorter wavelengths and a zero-bias Schottky diode measures the power. In both methods; a portion of the spectral energy emitted by the bunch is intercepted. After normalizing to differentiate between bunches of the same length with different charge; the detected signal is sensitive to only changes in bunch length.

With respect to the proton therapy facility; non-destructive beam diagnostic devices are essential to guarantee the online measurement during the patient treatment. In order to meet the clinical requirement; the proton beam current varies from the 0.35-5 nA. Extremely low beam intensity is a great challenge to non-destructive beam current detection. Conventional beam current monitors used in proton therapy facility; ionization champers; will cause beam scattering and the monitor activation; etc. To mitigate this issue; we design a non-invasive beam current monitor based the principle of dielectric-filled reentrant cavity. The fundamental mode of the cavity was employed as the working mode and its working frequency of 146 MHz was matched to the second harmonic of the pulse rate. The CST Microwave Studio was used for electromagnetic modeling and design parameters optimization. We evaluated the effect of the different proton energy due to the degrader on the output signal. The electronics based on a commercial lock-in amplifier is proposed to perform the demodulation of induced signal and we evaluated the signal-to-noise ratio and the beam current resolution.

ibic2021,,WEPP31,Web-Based Software Development for Failure Prediction in Commercial Cyclotrons Used in Medical Applications,A. García-Tabarés Valdivieso; F. Berdascas Julián; BPT; Madrid; Spain; Radioisotopes used for PET and SPECT diagnostics are commonly produced using commercial cyclotrons. These accelerators are equipped with online monitoring instrumentation that allows the machine to be operated within the safety margins defined by the manufacturer. However; the probabilities of cyclotron failure cannot be estimated simply by online data logging but must be supplemented by a long-term data-driven analysis and storage system. The low level of development of the analysis and storage systems makes it difficult to optimize the preventive maintenance schedule and makes it almost impossible to prevent failures. Beta Pharma Technologies (BPT) has developed a web-based big data software; which in combination with a database; bridges the gap in storage and analytics capabilities of the current cyclotron software. This software analyzes the evolution of the cyclotron in the medium-long term; extracting statistical information and correlation between the different parameters of the cyclotron. To validate the method; BPT has used the software intensively to analyze the big data generated by various commercial cyclotrons. This article shows that by analyzing logged data using analysis tools the cyclotron failure can be identified before the actual machine failure.

The high element specificity of XAS is gained by photon energies around resonant absorption edges of the probed material. Dynamics on a femtosecond timescale can be accessed with time resolved XAS (TR-XAS) using a laser to photo-excite the sample and intense femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser to probe with XAS. A primary drawback to the implementation of TR-XAS at X-ray free-electron lasers is the general requirement to scan the photon energy for obtaining the spectrum. Moreover; fluctuations of the X-ray spectrum and intensity due to the self-amplified stimulated emission lead to normalization problems. To tackle these issues we propose a novel scheme for TR-XAS using a broadband emission mode of the Aramis undulator at SwissFEL providing dE/E = 2% bandwidth; which is sufficient to cover a XAS spectrum. By utilizing a transmission grating; the chirped beam is split into 1st; 0th and -1st orders having similar intensity. By placing a sample in the 1st or -1st diffraction order we can record sample and reference signal in order to normalize intrinsic spectral and intensity fluctuations on a shot-to-shot basis. The beams are sent onto a single shot spectrometer that uses the <111> reflection from a strongly bent thin Si crystal; in order to characterize the broadband; chirped emission of every free-electron laser shot. In this contribution; we present a quantitative data analysis and compare the shot-to-shot normalization method with the conventional data analysis without beam splitting; showing a significant improvement of the data quality in the first case. We show XAS measurements at the Nickel K-edge on thin foils and Nickelsulfamate solutions.

The performance of these diagnostics systems will be described; including the single shot ""butterfly"" emittance diagnostic that will be key to demonstrating emittance preservation of mm-mrad emittances in plasma wakefield acceleration experiments. Additionally; the gamma ray diagnostics will be discussed that will be used to assess the beam dynamics of low emittance beams in plasmas and to characterize beam-plasma filamentation instabilities.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS",,Your browser cannot play the video.

It is difficult to measure them with traditional methods during the user operation run. The behaviour of each bunch in the ring will not be exactly the same; but has its own personality (different transverse positions; longitudinal phases and different bunch charges). If the bunch-by-bunch 3D position can be accurately measured; every individual bunch can be used as probes to extract the dynamics parameters of the storage ring. Based on a broadband oscilloscope with a high sampling rate; a bunch-by-bunch three-dimensional parameter measurement system was built at the Shanghai synchrotron radiation facility(SSRF). The measurement uncertainty of longitudinal phase is less than 0.2 ps; the uncertainty of transverse position is less than 10 um and the charge uncertainty is 0.3% under the condition that the bunch charge is 600 pC. A general software package was developed to process the bunch signals and extract bunch parameters. The functions of this software package mainly include three-dimensional position; charge extraction; refilled charge signal stripping; and cable reflection signal stripping. Using this software package; the injection transient process was studied and the momentum contraction factor; dispersion function; and longitudinal damping oscillation parameters measurement were realized during the normal operation at SSRF. Because the software package does not require special acquisition equipment and does not have strict requirements on the state of the accelerator; the software package can be widely used in the bunch-by-bunch measurement of all ring accelerators.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

This work focuses specifically on the implementation of three separate longitudinal phase space virtual diagnostics at the FACET-II accelerator facility: one at the exit of the photoinjector; one after the second bunch compressor and one and the end of the linac before the experimental area. We present simulation results describing the simultaneous prediction of the LPS in a single-bunch and two-bunch mode of operation and discuss design choices for the machine learning architecture selected for the LPS prediction task**.

ibic2021,,THOB01,Control of the Microbunching Instability and Stabilization of the THz Coherent Radiation,C. Evain; S. Bielawski; PhLAM/CERLA; Villeneuve d’Ascq; France; A PhLAM laboratory team; together with the Synchrotron SOLEIL; have demonstrated the possibility to control the multibunching instability that appears spontaneously when the number of electrons in a bunch exceeds a threshold value (typically few mA). By measuring the amplitude of THz emission created by the bunch structure appearing with this instability; and by modulating correspondingly the RF cavity amplitude (to change the bunch length); the THz coherent radiation can be stabilized. The method is inspired by control of chaos techniques which aims at stabilizing an unstable state thanks to feedback loop. Feasibility experiment conducted at Synchrotron SOLEIL showed that the stabilization process is efficient up to 9.15 mA. This major achievement is a first step toward strong THz coherent sources in storage rings. Next challenges are the extension of the control to higher current.; ’Stable coherent terahertz synchrotron radiation from controlled relativistic electron bunches’; C.

Two systems are presented: 1) The vertical position of the bunch measured at two beam stripline position monitors (BPMs) is used to calculate a pair of kicks which are applied to the next bunch using two upstream kickers; thereby correcting both the vertical position and trajectory angle. This system was optimized so as to stabilize the beam offset at the feedback BPMs to better than 350 nm; yielding a local trajectory angle correction to within 250 nrad. Measurements with a beam size monitor at the focal point (IP) demonstrate that reducing the trajectory jitter of the beam by a factor of 4 also reduces the observed wakefield-induced increase in the measured beam size as a function of beam charge by a factor of c. 1.6. 2) High-resolution cavity BPMs were used to provide local beam stabilization in the IP region. The BPMs were demonstrated to achieve an operational resolution of ~20 nm. With the application of single-BPM and two-BPM feedback; beam stabilization of below 50 nm and 41 nm respectively has been achieved with a closed-loop latency of 232 ns.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

We then discuss recent developments in machine learning (ML) and show some examples of how ML methods are being developed for accelerator controls and diagnostics; such as online surrogate models that act as virtual observers of beam properties. Then we give an overview of adaptive machine learning (AML) in which adaptive model-independent methods are combined with ML-based methods so that they are robust for and applicable to time-varying systems*. Finally; we present some recent applications of AML for accelerator controls and diagnostics. In particular we present recently developed adaptive latent space tuning methods and show how they can be used as virtual adaptive predictors of an accelerator beam’s longitudinal phase space as well as all of the other 2D projections of a beam’s 6D phase space**; ***.

ibic2021,,FROA01,Identification of the Inter-Bunch and Intra-Bunch Beam Dynamics Based on Dynamic Modal Decomposition (DMD),"SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Stanford University; Stanford; California; USA; CalPoly; San Luis Obispo; California; USA; The quantification of the Inter-bunch and Intra-bunch beam dynamics is important to define monitoring and operation tools in accelerators as well as to design model-based controllers to stabilize the transversal and longitudinal beam motion*. Presently; analysis tools and control designs are based on simplified models; where their parameters are estimated based on beam measurements. In this work; data-driven models are estimated without preliminary model assumptions of the beam dynamics. The technique uses Dynamic Modal Decomposition (DMD); to estimate the model and reduce it to the dominant modes present in the beam dynamics that are important to capture to design monitoring tools and controllers. The DMD technique is developed as a method to decompose complex dynamics; such as the inter-bunch / intra-bunch dynamics; into simple representations based on spatiotemporal coherent structures. It is an equation-free; data-driven method capable of providing an accurate decomposition of the beam motion. This paper will present the decomposition-reduction technique and apply it for the case of the beam dynamics identification. It will illustrate with examples the models extracted from measurements of the longitudinal inter-bunch dynamics in accelerators and transverse intra-bunch dynamics in circular machines.; *O.
