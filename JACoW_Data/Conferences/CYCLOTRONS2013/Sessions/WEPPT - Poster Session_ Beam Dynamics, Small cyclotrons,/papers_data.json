The magnetic field distribution is used to track single charged particles as well as ion beam through lens segmentation method. The method facilitates in evaluation of optical properties as well as aberration coefficients of the lens. Application of such doublet solenoid lens in transporting low energy ion beam introduces minimal rotation of the beam as well as least entangling between transverse phase spaces of the beam.",

In order to transform the axisymmetric beam to a non-axisymmetric beam for matching at the entrance of the inflector one needs either an elliptical solenoid or a quadrupole doublet. The injection system of 10MeV-5mA proton cyclotron being developed at VECC consists of a 2.45GHz (80keV) microwave ion source and two solenoids to transport and match the beam at the spiral inflector. Due to space constraint we have planned to use an elliptical solenoid just before the spiral inflector for transverse matching of the beam. In this work the beam optical properties of an elliptical solenoid have been studied",

However in the case of high current bunching the increase of current in the specified bunch width as the beam advances affects the transverse behavior.

In the PIC method this effect is introduced by reweighting the charge and mass of the macroparticles during the transport with longitudinal compression. The evolutions of beam envelope and emittance growth have been estimated for various initial particle distributions. It is observed that the rms beam size is independent of particular beam distribution whereas rms emittance grows with nonuniformity of the distribution and peaks near the time focus."

        "the number of particles per bunch has to be approximately the same order in an FFAG as in a high power synchrotron. Collective effects such as space charge then become crucial issues. To understand high current beam behaviour in FFAGs",
