        "there was gradual beam loss due to poor vacuum. After installing a higher capacity liquid helium plant the cryo-panels were made functional leading to a substantial increase in the beam intensity. It was hoped that higher beam intensity would help in extraction of a measurable fraction of the beam",
        "but that did not happen. Detailed investigation of beam behavior with the help of three beam probes",
        "installed temporarily at three sectors",
        "revealed that the beam goes highly off-centered while passing through the resonance zone. A plastic scintillator based phase probe was mounted on the radial probe and beam phase was measured accurately. It was quite clear that large amount of field imperfection was prohibiting the beam to be extracted. So magnetic field measurement has been started again and considerable amount of harmonic and average field errors have been found. In this paper we report the important developments since 2010."
