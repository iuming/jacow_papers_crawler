        "Modern advanced ECR ion source can provide stable and reliable high charge state ion beams for the routine operation of a cyclotron",
        "which has made it irreplaceable",
        "particularly with regard to the performance and efficiency that a cyclotron complex could achieve with the ion source. The 3rd generation ECR ion sources that can produce higher charge state and more intense ion beams have been developed and put into cyclotron operation since early 21st century. They have provided the privilege for the cyclotron performance improvement that has never been met before",
        "especially in term of the delivered beam intensity and energy",
        "which has greatly promoted the experimental research in nuclear physics. This paper will have a brief review about the development of modern high performance high charge state ECR ion sources. Typical advanced high charge state ECR ion sources with fully superconducting magnet",
        "such as SERSE",
        "VENUS",
        "SECRAL",
        "SuSI and RIKEN SC-ECRIS will be presented",
        "and their high intensity operation status for cyclotrons will be introduced as well.",

        "To better understand the physical processes in ECRIS plasmas",
        "we developed a Particle-in-Cell code that follows the ionization and diffusion dynamics of ions. The basic features of the numerical model are given elsewhere*. Electron temperature is a free parameter and we found that its value should be about 1 keV to reproduce the experimentally observed performance of our 14 GHz ECR source. We assume that a pre-sheath is located outside the ECR zone",
        "in which ion acceleration toward the walls occurs. Electric fields inside the ECR zone are assumed to be zero. The ion production is modelled assuming ion confinement by a ponderomotive barrier formed at the boundary of the ECR zone. The barrier height is defined by the RF radiation density at the electron resonance layer and is taken as an adjustable parameter. With these assumptions",
        "we are able to reproduce the main features of ECRIS performance",
        "such as saturation and decrease of highest charge state currents with increasing gas pressure",
        "as well as reaction to an increase of injected RF power. Study of the source response to variations of the source parameters is possible.",

        "we tried to increase the beam intensity using various methods. Recently",
        "we observed that the use of Al chamber strongly enhanced the beam intensity of highly charged U ion beam. Using this method",
        "we obtained ~180e μA of U35+ and ~230e μA of U33+ at the injected RF power of ~3kW with sputtering method. Advantage of this method is that we can insert the large amount of material into the plasma chamber",
        "therefore",
        "we can produce the beam for long term without break. Actually",
        "we already produced intense U beams for the RIBF experiments longer than month without break. For the long term operation",
        "we observed that the consumption rate of the U metal was ~4mg/h. In this spring",
