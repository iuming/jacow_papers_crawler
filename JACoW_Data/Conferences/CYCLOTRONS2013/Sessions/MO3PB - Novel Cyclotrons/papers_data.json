        "The production of intense high energy muon beams for muon colliders is an active area of interest due to the muon's large mass and pointlike structure. The muon production and the subsequent preparation into a beam are challenging due to the large emittance of the initial beam and the short muon lifetime. Most muon cooling channels being developed are single-pass structures due to the difficulty of injecting large emittance beams into a circular device. Inverse cyclotrons can potentially solve the injection problem using single turn energy loss injection and also reduce the muon beam emittance by a large factor. An end-to-end simulation of an inverse cyclotron for muon cooling is presented performed with G4Beamline",
