        "we derive two simple coupled two-dimensional fluid equations describing the radial-longitudinal beam vortex motion associated with space charge effects in isochronous cyclotrons. These equations show that the vortex motion can be intuitively understood as the nonlinear advection of the beam by the ExB velocity field",
        "where E is the electric field due to the space charge and B is the applied magnetic field. This explains why elongated beams develop spiral halos while round beams are always stable. Solving the coupled equations numerically",
