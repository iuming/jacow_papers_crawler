        "Intensity upgrade of uranium beams is one of the main concerns at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF). The lifetime problem of carbon-foil strippers due to the high energy loss of uranium beams around 10~MeV/u was a principal bottleneck for the intensity upgrade in the acceleration scheme at the RIBF. We have developed a re-circulating He-gas stripper as an alternative to carbon foils for the acceleration of high-power uranium beams. The new stripping system was actually operated in user runs with U35+ beams of more than 1 puA. Electron-stripped U64+ beams were stably delivered to subsequent accelerators without serious deterioration of the system for six weeks. The new He-gas stripper",
