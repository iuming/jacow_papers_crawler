Slides MO4PB01 [6.691 MB] The IBA Superconducting Synchrocyclotron Project S2C2 In 2009 IBA decided to start the development of a compact superconducting synchrocyclotron as a proton-source for the small footprint proton therapy system called Proteus One ®. The cyclotron has been completely designed and constructed and is currently under commissioning at the IBA factory. Its design and commissioning results will be presented.
