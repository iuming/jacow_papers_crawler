In addition to the C-30 Cyclotron; the facility includes two other Cyclotrons namely; the RDS-111 and the CS30 Cyclotrons. The latter has dual responsibilities; while is kept as a backup for the other Cyclotrons for radioisotopes production; it’s used for proton therapy researches and Bragg Peak measurements at that particular energy. During the commission of the C30 cyclotron; 700 uA dual beam were measured.

In 2012 we celebrated the 2000th patient. Our cyclotron is again served by 2 different injectors: a 6 MV Van-de-Graaff and a 2 MV tandetron. The tandetron was optimized especially for the requirements of therapy. Its advantages are easier handling; lower service requirements and a shorter injection beam line. Development of the source resulted in safe operation of more than 600 h and extremely stable beam current. The tandetron is in operation for therapy since 2011. The Van-de-Graaff was considered to be a temporary backup. New requests for beams with a very specific time structure occurred; which can be provided only with the Van-de-Graaff-cyclotron beam line. Pulse structures of high variability; from single pulses of 1 ns at a max. repetition rate of 75 kHz to pulse packets with a length up to 100 μs were tested. The latter was used for the production of pulsed neutron radiation for comprehensive testing of dosimeters. Although major breakdowns have a huge impact on the up-time due to the small number of beam time hours; breakdowns over the past years amounted to less than 5%.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/moppt002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/moppt002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/moppt002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-MOPPT002,31

Since 1993 the cyclotron provides beams in 24/7 operation for more than 6500 hours/year on average. The cyclotron has been in operation since commissioning in 1968 and has reached in total 260000 hours of operation. JULIC provides routinely polarized and unpolarized negatively charged light ions for COSY experiments in the field of fundamental research in hadron; particle and nuclear physics. The ongoing program at the facility foresees increasing usage as a test facility for accelerator research and detector development for realization of FAIR; and other novel experiments on the road map of the Helmholtz Association and international collaborations. In parallel to the operation for COSY the cyclotron beam is used for irradiation and fundamental nuclide production for research purposes. A brief overview of activities at the Forschungszentrum Jülich; the cooler synchrotron COSY and its injector cyclotron JULIC; with focus on recent technical developments; will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/moppt003_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/moppt003.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/moppt003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-MOPPT003,34

Since the last cyclotron conference several highlights have been achieved. The maximum current extracted from the 590 MeV Ring Cyclotron could be increased from 2.2 mA to 2.4 mA during several beam development shifts. Furthermore; the availability of the facility has reached its highest level to date; beyond 93%. The new neutron source UCN which utilizes the full proton beam in pulsed mode; has been commissioned. To ensure reliable operation in the years to come and to further increase the intensity; an upgrade and refurbishment program is under way. Important parts of this program are the replacement of two resonators in Injector II and the installation of new RF amplifiers.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/moppt004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/moppt004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/moppt004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-MOPPT004,37

CYCLOTRONS2013,,MOPPT007,Recent Progress at the Jyväskylä Cyclotron Laboratory,JYFL; Jyväskylä; Finland; The use of the K130 cyclotron during the past few years has been normal. The total use of the cyclotron in 2012 was 6441 hours out of which 4610 hours on target. Three quarters of the beam time was devoted to basic nuclear physics research and one quarter for industrial applications; the main industrial application being space electronics testing. Altogether over 20 different isotopes were accelerated in 2012. Beam cocktails for space electronics testing were the most commonly used beams (26 %). Since the first beam in 1992 the total run time for the K130 cyclotron at the end of 2012 was 124’138 hours; and altogether 32 elements (73 isotopes) from p to Au have been accelerated. The MCC30/15 cyclotron will deliver proton and deuteron beams for nuclear physics research and for isotope production. The experimental set-up has been mainly under construction and we have had only a couple of beam tests. Isotope production with the MCC30/15 cyclotron has suffered from severe administrative delays. Finally in December 2012 a preliminary budget study for a GMP laboratory for FDG production (18F) was done.

Above a few hundred MeV; losses must be under a per cent to avoid massive shielding and unmanageable activation. As relativistic energies are approached; the orbit separation on consecutive acceleration turns decreases for isochronous performance and to achieve higher acceleration gradients and orbit separation; RF modules must be employed rather than Dees; resulting in the larger separated-sector cyclotron footprint. However; the addition of strong focusing – with reversed gradients to capture both transverse planes – to conventional cyclotron fields promote inclusion of long synchrotron-like straight sections and implementation of high-gradient RF; even SCRF.

For a number of these; low weight; low power consumption; portability or low radiation background are key design requirements. We have evaluated the feasibility of a compact superconducting cyclotron that would provide proton beams up to 20 MeV by accelerating H− ions and extracting them by the stripping process with current of 100uA. The study demonstrates that the survival of the H− ion under high magnetic field environment could be large enough to guarantee low beam losses as long as the RF voltage is high. The compact cyclotron is energized by a set of superconducting coils providing the needed magnetic field; while the azimuthal varying field is done by four iron sectors. Additional superconducting coils are added to minimize the stray magnetic field; eliminating the need for a return yoke.

This was discovered in 2003 for linear non-scaling FFAGs in the relativistic regime.

As a function of two key parameters; field index and synchronous energy; this paper shows how to optimize the extraction energy and the voltage per turn for the scaling case. Optimization is difficult; and typically leads to poor performance: either extreme voltage or small acceleration range.

CYCLOTRONS2013,,MO3PB01,An Inverse Cyclotron for Muon Cooling,T.L. Hart; D.J. Summers; UMiss; University; Mississippi; USA; The production of intense high energy muon beams for muon colliders is an active area of interest due to the muon's large mass and pointlike structure. The muon production and the subsequent preparation into a beam are challenging due to the large emittance of the initial beam and the short muon lifetime. Most muon cooling channels being developed are single-pass structures due to the difficulty of injecting large emittance beams into a circular device. Inverse cyclotrons can potentially solve the injection problem using single turn energy loss injection and also reduce the muon beam emittance by a large factor. An end-to-end simulation of an inverse cyclotron for muon cooling is presented performed with G4Beamline; a GEANT-based particle tracking simulation program. Muons are collected in a central trap and then all ejected together.; H. Tsutsui; A. Hashimoto; Y. Mikami; H. Mitsubori; T. Mitsumoto; Y. Touchi; T. Ueda; K. Uno; K. Watazawa; S. Yajima; J.Y. Yoshida; K.U. Yumoto; SHI; Tokyo; Japan; Since a cyclotron has better beam quality than that of a synchrocyclotron; we have designed a 4 Tesla superconducting AVF cyclotron for proton therapy. Its weight is less than 60 tons; which is about one fourth of our normal conducting 230 MeV cyclotron. In order to reduce the size and the weight without deteriorating the beam stability; the hill gap around the outer pole radius is made small. Calculated extraction efficiency is higher than 60%; by arranging the extraction elements properly. The low temperature superconducting coil using NbTi wire is conduction-cooled by 4K GM cryocooler. Three dimensional electromagnetic finite element codes have been used during all phases of basic design.; S.V. Kutsaev; Z.A. Conway; P.N. Ostroumov; ANL; Argonne; USA; R.D. Ford; C. Johnstone; PAC; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Like the cyclotron; the Fixed Field Alternating Gradient machine (FFAG) is a compact accelerator with variety of applications in industry and medicine. High intensity; fixed-field compact accelerators require enhanced orbit separation to minimize beam losses especially at extraction. In medium energy and compact FFAGs; this requires a total voltage of ~20 MV per turn with continuous wave accelerating gradients of ~10MV/m; which can only be achieved using superconducting accelerating cavities. This high voltage can be generated using 4 superconducting (SC) cavities operating at higher harmonics of the beam revolution; equal to approximately 200 MHz. The cavities and cryomodule are inserted into a 2m straight section of a racetrack-shaped FFAG. However; as with cyclotrons; the FFAG has a large horizontal acceleration aperture presenting a challenging problem for SCRF cavity design. In this work; we present SC cavity design with 50 cm x 1 cm beam apertures; their electrodynamics optimization; and multiphysics analysis.

This energy allows us to use the cyclotron as a stand-alone accelerator for proton therapy. The synchrocyclotron design features a central magnetic field of 5 T and an axisymmetric pole and a constant field index. The beam is injected axially with a spiral inflector. Resonant extraction allows beam ejection with moderate beam losses. The RF system operates in first harmonic (180° Dee); with modulation provided by a large rotating capacitor.

CYCLOTRONS2013,,TU1PB01,High Intensity Operation for Heavy Ion Cyclotron of Highly Charged ECR Ion Sources,IMP; Lanzhou; People's Republic of China; Modern advanced ECR ion source can provide stable and reliable high charge state ion beams for the routine operation of a cyclotron; which has made it irreplaceable; particularly with regard to the performance and efficiency that a cyclotron complex could achieve with the ion source. The 3rd generation ECR ion sources that can produce higher charge state and more intense ion beams have been developed and put into cyclotron operation since early 21st century. They have provided the privilege for the cyclotron performance improvement that has never been met before; especially in term of the delivered beam intensity and energy; which has greatly promoted the experimental research in nuclear physics. This paper will have a brief review about the development of modern high performance high charge state ECR ion sources. Typical advanced high charge state ECR ion sources with fully superconducting magnet; such as SERSE; VENUS; SECRAL; SuSI and RIKEN SC-ECRIS will be presented; and their high intensity operation status for cyclotrons will be introduced as well.; LBNL; Berkeley; California; USA; V. Mironov; J.P.M. Beijers; KVI; Groningen; The Netherlands; To better understand the physical processes in ECRIS plasmas; we developed a Particle-in-Cell code that follows the ionization and diffusion dynamics of ions. The basic features of the numerical model are given elsewhere*. Electron temperature is a free parameter and we found that its value should be about 1 keV to reproduce the experimentally observed performance of our 14 GHz ECR source. We assume that a pre-sheath is located outside the ECR zone; in which ion acceleration toward the walls occurs. Electric fields inside the ECR zone are assumed to be zero. The ion production is modelled assuming ion confinement by a ponderomotive barrier formed at the boundary of the ECR zone. The barrier height is defined by the RF radiation density at the electron resonance layer and is taken as an adjustable parameter. With these assumptions; we are able to reproduce the main features of ECRIS performance; such as saturation and decrease of highest charge state currents with increasing gas pressure; as well as reaction to an increase of injected RF power. Study of the source response to variations of the source parameters is possible.; *V. Mironov and J. P. M.

Advantage of this method is that we can insert the large amount of material into the plasma chamber; therefore; we can produce the beam for long term without break. Actually; we already produced intense U beams for the RIBF experiments longer than month without break. For the long term operation; we observed that the consumption rate of the U metal was ~4mg/h. In this spring; we also produced U beam with high temperature oven and two frequencies injection. In these test experiments; we observed that the beam intensity of highly charged U ions is strongly enhanced.

Recently; we observed that the use of Al chamber strongly enhanced the beam intensity of highly charged U ion beam. Using this method; we obtained ~180e μA of U35+ and ~230e μA of U33+ at the injected RF power of ~3kW with sputtering method. Advantage of this method is that we can insert the large amount of material into the plasma chamber; therefore; we can produce the beam for long term without break. Actually; we already produced intense U beams for the RIBF experiments longer than month without break. For the long term operation; we observed that the consumption rate of the U metal was ~4mg/h. In this spring; we also produced U beam with high temperature oven and two frequencies injection. In these test experiments; we observed that the beam intensity of highly charged U ions is strongly enhanced. In this contribution; we report the various results of the test experiments for production of highly charged U ion beam.

These models have been implemented in OPAL; a parallel framework for charged particle optics in accelerator structures and beam lines. The models and their implementation are carefully benchmarked against a non-stationary multipacting theory. A dedicated multipacting experiment with nanosecond time resolution for the classic parallel plate geometry has also successfully shown the validity of OPAL model. Multipacting phenomena; in the CYCIAE-100 cyclotron; under construction at China Institute of Atomic Energy; are expected to be more severe during the RF conditioning process than in separate-sector cyclotrons. This is because the magnetic fields in the valley are stronger; which may make the impact electrons easier to reach energies that lead to larger multipacting probabilities. We report on simulation results for CYCIAE-100; which gives us an insight view of the multipacting process and help to develop cures to suppress these phenomena.; A.C. Caruso; G. Gallo; A. Longhitano; INFN/LNS; Catania; Italy; Associazione Euratom-ENEA sulla Fusione; Frascati (Rome); Italy; CIAE; Beijing; People's Republic of China; Warsaw University; Warsaw; Poland; A new axial buncher for the K-800 superconducting cyclotron is under construction at LNS.

Numerical calculations were performed to examine the reliability and the performance of the profile analysis method. To simulate the temperature images acquired by a thermographic camera; temperature distributions were numerically calculated for various beam parameters. The noises in the temperature images; which are added by the camera sensor; were also simulated to be taken its effect into account. By using the profile analysis method; the beam profiles were evaluated from the simulated-temperature images; and they were compared with the exact solution of the beam profiles.

With our conventional emittance measurement system; it takes about 30 minutes to get emittances in both the horizontal and vertical plane. For quick measurements; we have developed a new system consisting of a fast moving slit with a fixed width and a BPM83 (rotating wire beam profile monitor). BPM83 uses a rotating helical wire made of tungsten; the speed is 18 rps. Fast moving slit consists of a shielding plate with two slits; and is inserted into the beam path at an angle of 45 degrees. The slit is driven by PLC controlled stepping motor; and it takes 70 seconds to move the full stroke of 290 mm. While moving the slit; the output from BPM83 and the voltage of potentiometer that corresponds to the slit position are recorded simultaneously. We are using CAMAC for data acquisition. Trigger signals are generated by BPM83 and NIM modules. Data analysis takes about 1 second. With this system we can get the horizontal and vertical emittance plots within 75 seconds.

It is an improved version of CMF compared to the classical one used earlier to design arbitrarily ECR ion source (ECRIS) of low frequency. The CMF has been reconfigured here adopting a simple; novel and cost-effective technique to shrink the loss area and to achieve denser plasma than in traditional ECRIS. The strength of the electron (plasma) confinement is demonstrated through electron simulations. It consists of a mid-iron disk; two end-plugs and a pair of superconducting magnet coils cooled by cryo-coolers. It is designed for high-B mode operation of the cusp ECRIS of as high as 28 GHz RF frequency for producing an intense beam of highly charged heavy ions.

The days of a few tens of micro-amperes bombarding a PET target with low residual activity on a self-shielded cyclotron are over. Now an integrated self-supporting mini-beamline is essential for safe; optimized and reliable operation of PET cyclotrons. The high levels of prompt/residual radiation are moved (~1 m) away from the cyclotron so that local-shielding can be placed around the target/selector assembly; which minimizes cyclotron component damage due to prompt neutrons/gammas; and ensures the high residual target radiation is attenuated; so maintenance personnel can work on the cyclotron in a “cool” environment. Beam diagnostic readbacks from baffles/collimators provide steering and focusing control of the beam. This ""plug-n-play"" beamline is an integrated self-supporting unit cantilevered from the cyclotron. The single aluminum sub-structure acts as mounting flange; support structure; beampipe; and magnet registration device.

In the large part; distributions can be taken from several angles of view; separated each by 45°. The measurement systems at our facility have evolved with time; this paper gives the present status; performance; limits and typical results.

However; the only diagnostics they have had were a Faraday Cup at the exit of the machine and a so called ""Dee-Probe"" which gives a current-vs-radius (IvR) measurement. Motivated by low transmission of the Cyclotron and to address how tuning can affect the beam; we have developed an optical beam viewer whose radial position within the cyclotron can be adjusted remotely. This viewer allows us to image the beam cross section and its axial position with very high spatial resolution as a function of radius.

CYCLOTRONS2013,,WE1PB01,The Houghton College Cyclotron: a Tool for Educating Undergraduates,Houghton College; Houghton; New York; USA; The cyclotron is an ideal undergraduate research project because its operation and use involve so many of the principles covered in the undergraduate physics curriculum – from resonant circuits to nuclear reactions.  The  physics program at Houghton College; as part of an emphasis on active learning; requires all majors to complete a multiyear research project culminating in an undergraduate thesis. Over the past ten years seven students have constructed a working 1.2 T  tabletop cyclotron theoretically capable of producing approximately 400 keV protons.  The construction and performance of the cyclotron will be discussed; as well as its use as an educational tool.; Rutgers University; The State University of New Jersey; Piscataway; New Jersey; USA; G.A. Hine; T.W. Koeth; UMD; College Park; Maryland; USA; Stanford University; Stanford; California; USA; The Rutgers 12” Cyclotron is an educational tool used to introduce students to the multifaceted field of accelerator physics.

In order to transform the axisymmetric beam to a non-axisymmetric beam for matching at the entrance of the inflector one needs either an elliptical solenoid or a quadrupole doublet. The injection system of 10MeV-5mA proton cyclotron being developed at VECC consists of a 2.45GHz (80keV) microwave ion source and two solenoids to transport and match the beam at the spiral inflector. Due to space constraint we have planned to use an elliptical solenoid just before the spiral inflector for transverse matching of the beam. In this work the beam optical properties of an elliptical solenoid have been studied; including the effect of space charge. An envelope model based on the canonical description of motion has been developed and utilized to study the feasibility of using an elliptical solenoid for transverse matching of a space charge dominated beam to the acceptance of a spiral inflector.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/weppt004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/weppt004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/weppt004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-WEPPT004,326

The 3 GHz Cell Coupled Linac; designed by the TERA Foundation; will be 5 meters long and will be powered by two 10 MW klystrons running at 100 Hz. Advanced Cyclotron Systems will modify the cyclotron source; so that the extracted 300 μA beam will be chopped in 4 μs long pulses. To compute the transverse acceptances of the linac; the horizontal and vertical emittances of the extracted proton beam have been measured with the secondary emission detector BISE (Beam Imaging with Secondary Electrons) built by TERA and previously calibrated at the Bern 18 MeV IBA cyclotron. In this detector a thin 5 cm diameter foil is placed at 45° with respect to the beam direction and an electrostatic lens images the secondary electrons -extracted by the protons- on a phosphor; which is viewed by a CCD camera.

The whole transport path (~40 m) consists of four 90 degree bends. Since the beams coming from DTL are expected to have an energy spread of 0.5 %; the magnetic bends have to be achromatic. The transport system is designed to meet the restrictions imposed by the existing beam hall and the other space constraints. The first three 90 degree achromats have the configuration of Q1Q2Q3MQ4MQ3Q2Q1 and the fourth one has configuration of Q1Q2MQ3Q4Q4Q3MQ2Q1 where Q stands for magnetic quadrupole and M stands for 45 degree bending magnets.

The project parameters of the ion beams have been achieved. During commissioning of cyclotron the vertical displacement of the beam at the last orbits and at the extraction channel was revealed. The calculations and experiments have shown that the reason of this displacement is the radial component of magnetic field at the median plane of the cyclotron; which appears because of asymmetry of the magnetic yoke. Correction of the vertical displacement of the beam has been achieved by creating an asymmetry of current distribution in the main coils of the electromagnet.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/weppt008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/weppt008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/weppt008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-WEPPT008,338

In principle; a rising slope of a dee-voltage at the first acceleration gap is more or less effective for production of the phase bunching. The phase difference between particles at the second acceleration gap depends on combination of four parameters: the acceleration harmonic number (h); a span angle of the dee electrode; a span angle from the first to the second acceleration gap; a ratio between a peak dee-voltage and an extraction voltage of an ion source. In the case of the JAEA AVF cyclotron; the effective phase bunching was realized for h = 2 and 3; and the geometric condition of phase bunching was unrealistic for h = 1. An orbit simulation for the JAEA AVF cyclotron indicated that the initial beam phase width of 40 RF degrees for h = 2 was compressed to 11 RF degrees. The phase bunching evaluation based on the simplified geometric trajectory analysis was consistent with the orbit simulation result; and practical phase bunching was verified by beam phase width measurement.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/weppt014_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/weppt014.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/weppt014_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-WEPPT014,350

CYCLOTRONS2013,,WEPPT019,Investigation on the Transverse Emittance Growth of Intense Beam during Bunching,P. Sing Babu; A. Goswami; V.S. Pandit; VECC; Kolkata; India; Bunchers are widely used in the injection system of cyclotrons to transform dc beam into a bunched beam in a desired phase width. In the case of low beam current; the longitudinal compression of beam has very little effect on the transverse dynamics. However in the case of high current bunching the increase of current in the specified bunch width as the beam advances affects the transverse behavior. A 2D particle-in-cell code has been developed to study the transverse dynamics during beam bunching in the injection system of 10MeV; 5mA compact proton cyclotron. We have used a linear increase of beam current in the specified bunch width from the buncher position to the time focus. In the PIC method this effect is introduced by reweighting the charge and mass of the macroparticles during the transport with longitudinal compression. The evolutions of beam envelope and emittance growth have been estimated for various initial particle distributions. It is observed that the rms beam size is independent of particular beam distribution whereas rms emittance grows with nonuniformity of the distribution and peaks near the time focus.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/weppt019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/weppt019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/weppt019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-WEPPT019,361

In this irradiation radioisotope of 62Zn produced as a generator and then decay to 62Cu radioisotope. The 62Cu is emitting β+ and known to PET radioisotope. Excitation function of 62Cu via natCu (p; 2n) 62Zn; 62Cu and 62Cu (d; 3n) 62Zn reactions were calculated using Alice and Talys codes and then were compared with the reported measurement by experimental data and ENDF-2011 data.

Position of the beam’s Bragg peak was measured with a stack of 60 pieces of HDV2 model GAFCHROMICTM films (105 microns thick each). This film type was specifically designed for measurement of very high doses; ranging up to 1; 000 Gy. Output of the proton beam was calibrated using IAEA TRS-398 reference dosimetry protocol with calibrated parallel plate chamber in water. The response of the film was calibrated in terms of dose to water by exposing calibration film pieces within a solid water phantom.

After 19 years of activity; a 200 MeV synchrocyclotron has been shut down and replaced by a 230 MeV C235 IBA proton cyclotron. This delivers beam to two passive fixed treatment rooms and to one universal nozzle equipped gantry. In the past two years of operation more than 95.5% of the scheduled patients (near 500/year) were treated. We have realised; according to IBA recommendations; preventive maintenance (i.e. RF final amplifier) and we have improved some diagnostic tools (i.e. Main Coil monitoring) allowing us to reduce the number of downtime events from 499 in 2011 to 351 in 2012. In order to improve cancer treatment capabilities we are now involved in the transition towards scanning particle therapy; requiring even more accurate quality assurance protocols.

Moreover; given the particularly high cost of 18O enriched water; only a small volume of this target material is desired. Procedure: Four conical shaped targets* with different target chamber sizes (Conical 6 – 2.4ml; Conical 8 – 3.2ml; Conical 12 - 5ml; Conical 16 - 7ml) were tested using IBA Cyclone® 18 MeV cyclotrons. The targets were filled with different volumes of 18O water (enrichment >92%) and irradiated with 18 MeV protons on target with beam currents up to 145 μA for 30–150 minutes. Fluoride-18 saturation activity yields and pressure curves were completed. Radionuclidic impurities were measured; even if the new target is using the same principle of Niobium body with Havar® window. Conclusions: Reliable operation in a production environment has been observed at beam currents up to 145 μA using less 18O enriched water as compared to the currently available IBA target systems without affecting the yield. The new design with less Orings and direct insertion of flow line into the niobium chamber has proven its effectiveness.,,*Patent application: WO 2012/055970 A1,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/wepsh043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/wepsh043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/wepsh043_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-WEPSH043,406

Two main drawbacks arise from this type of machine. The energy limit imposed by the non RF-particle isochronism requires a careful design of the acceleration process; resulting in challenging requirements for the RF system.

The iron yoke and poles in conventional superconducting cyclotrons have been avoided in this design. The azimuthally varying field is generated by superconducting sector-coils. The superconducting sector-coils and the circular main-coils have been housed in a single cryostat. It has resulted in an ultra-light 25 MeV proton cyclotron weighing about 2000 kg. Further; the sector coils and the main coils are fed by independent power supplies; which allow flexibility of operation through on-line magnetic field trimming. Here; we present design calculations and the engineering considerations; focused on making the cyclotron ideally suited for the production of radioisotopes for medical applications.; J.W. Engle; E.R. Birnbaum; M.E. Fassbender; K.D. John; F.M. Nortier; LANL; Los Alamos; New Mexico; USA; Several LINAC and cyclotron facilities worldwide generate high intensity beams with primary beam energies in the range 66 MeV to 200 MeV for isotope production purposes. Many of these beams are almost fully subscribed due to the high demand for isotopes produced via proton induced reactions; leaving little beam time available for production of smaller quantities of research isotopes. Modeling and preliminary experimental measurement of the high power proton beam interaction with targets at the Isotope Production Facility at Los Alamos show a high potential for parasitic small scale production of isotopes utilizing the secondary neutron flux generated around the target.

CYCLOTRONS2013,,TH2PB04,A Multi-Leaf Faraday Cup Especially for Proton Therapy of Ocular Tumors,C.S.G. Kunert; J. Bundesmann; T. Damerow; A. Denker; HZB; Berlin; Germany; Charite; Berlin; Germany; The Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) provides together with the University Hospital Charité in Berlin a treatment of eye tumors with a proton beam. The 68 MeV proton beam is delivered by an isochronous cyclotron as main accelerator. In tumor irradiation treatment the positioning of the radiation field is very important. In eye tumor treatment it is even more important; due to the small and sensitive structures in the eye. Hence; due to the well defined Bragg peak; a proton beam is a good choice to achieve rather small fields of dose delivery. Again; due to the small structures in the eye; one needs to know the proton beam energy and the proton beam range with a high accuracy. One possible solution for a quick and high precision measurement of the range of such proton beams is a Multi-Leaf Faraday Cup (MLFC). This work has the task to develop such a MLFC concerning the special requirements of the eye tumor therapy. In this presentation an overview of the progress of this work will be given; regarding the MLFC principles and issues such as the first technical realization.,,Slides TH2PB04 [5.358 MB],https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/talks/th2pb04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/papers/th2pb04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/CYCLOTRONS2013/posters/th2pb04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-CYCLOTRONS2013-TH2PB04,458

A proton beam of the AIC-144 cyclotron is accelerated without large losses in the radial region of 12-62 cm and is extracted from the cyclotron with a pretty good overall efficiency of ~35%. The beam was used for successful treatment of 15 patients in 2011-2012.; M. Ghergherehchi; J.-S. Chai; SKKU; Suwon; Republic of Korea; NCC; Goyang; Kyeonggi; Republic of Korea; High- and intermediate-energy protons are not able to directly form a track in a CR-39 etch detector (TED). Such detectors; however; can be used for the detection and dosimetry of the beams of these particles through the registration of secondary charged particles with sufficiently high values of linear energy transfer (LET). The studied were realized in a clinical proton beam of the NCC Korea; with primary energy of 72 to 220 MeV (1.1 to 0.4 KeV/ μm). The contribution of the secondary particle dose and the value of RBE both increase with decreasing proton energy. A strong agreement between experimentally obtained results and the predicted total cross sections was verified by the Alice code. Stimulation of the secondary particle dose by the Geant4 code also predicted results in agreement by experimental results. It is clear that higher cross sectional values lead to an increased production of secondary particles.

This method offers isotopic selection of the fragment of interest; however; the purity that can be achieved depends on the rigidity of the rare isotope with respect to more abundant fragments. This poses a problem specifically for neutron-deficient isotopes (towards the proton drip line) where much more abundant isotopes closer to stability can not be separated out. A separation by time-of-flight can further suppress such isotonic contaminants.

CYCLOTRONS2013,,FR2PB01,Construction of the Rare RI Ring at the RIKEN RI Beam Factory,RIKEN Nishina Center; Wako; Japan; Construction of the Rare-RI Ring has been started in 2012 at RIKEN RI Beam Factory. This ring is an isochronous storage ring aiming at 1-ppm precision mass measurements for short-lived rare nuclei extremely far from stability line. The beam optics in the ring is defined by simply 24 bending magnets; and half of them are accompanied by ten trim coils to precisely optimize the isochronism of circulating beams. The momentum acceptance; in which the isochronous condition is satisfied within 1-ppm accuracy; is designed to be 1%. Of particular note is the development of the exceptionally-fast response kicker system; which is triggered by the produced RI beam itself to make effective use of extremely rare events. In this paper; we present details of the Rare-RI Ring; the status of the construction; and prospects of the project.; TRIUMF; Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics; Vancouver; Canada; PSI; Villigen PSI; Switzerland; TRIUMF; Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics; Vancouver; Canada,,Slides FR2PB01 [6.694 MB] Cyclotron Production of Tc-99m Concern over past and impending shortages of Tc-99m have led to renewed interest in the cyclotron production of Tc-99m - the most used radionuclide in Nuclear Medicine.
