        "25 years ago the first beam was stored in the DAΦNE electron-positron collider working at the energy of Phi resonance (1.02 GeV c.m.). Since then much efforts have been dedicated to obtain the luminosity substantially higher than that ever achieved at the colliders operated in this energy range and to provide data for several experimental detectors aimed at studying the high energy and nuclear physics. Careful beam optics modeling and nonlinear dynamics studies",
        "design of the low impedance vacuum chamber",
        "suppression of a variety of beam instabilities and investigation of beam-beam interaction have helped to reach the impressive result. Several novel ideas in the accelerator physics have been proposed and/or tested at DAΦNE for the first time. In particular",
        "the Crab waist concept originally proposed and then tested at Frascati has been already successfully applied in SuperKEKB and now it is considered for implementation in the future electron-positron factories. In this paper we discuss the relevant advanced accelerator studies performed at DAΦNE which can be also of some interest to other circular colliders."

        "The SuperKEKB accelerator is a positron-electron collider with a nano-beam scheme and continues to achieve the world’s highest luminosity for the production of B meson pairs. The luminosity performance has been improved by the full-scale adoption of the crab-waist scheme. The nano-beam scheme allows the vertical beta function at the interaction point to be much smaller than the bunch length. The vertical beta function and the beam size at the collision point are the smallest in the world among colliders. As the result",
        "the peak luminosity of 4.65 x 1034 cm-2 s-1 has been achieved with the Belle II detector in 2022. Recent progress will be presented",
        "and then the problems and issues to be overcome from the beam physics point of view will be discussed for further improvement of luminosity performance in the future."
