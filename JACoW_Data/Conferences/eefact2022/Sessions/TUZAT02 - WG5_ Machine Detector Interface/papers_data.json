        "especially in CEPC",
        "it is one of the criteria to measure the accelerator and detector design performance. In this paper",
        "we will introduce the CEPC MDI layout and (Interaction Region) IR design",
        "IR beam pipe design",
        "thermal analysis and injection background etc on",
        "which are the most critical physics problem."

        "which can accumulate electromagnetic energy and determine the locations of these modes. We study the unavoidable resistive-wall wake field",
        "which is responsible for the direct beam pipe walls heating. We present the distribution of the heat load along the central part of IR. The results are very important for knowledge of the temperature distribution and the following cooling system design."
