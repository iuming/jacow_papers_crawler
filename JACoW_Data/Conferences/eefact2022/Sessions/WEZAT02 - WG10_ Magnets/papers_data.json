        "it started its practical operation in 2018 after measuring the magnetic field in IR. The operation is generally stable",
        "but some troubles have occurred. One of them is a quench. Radiation related to stored beam deposit energy on the superconducting coil. The beam suggested fluctuations in the main quadrupole magnetic field",
        "and measurements using the R & D machine have demonstrated this. In addition",
        "we are seeking a plan to upgrade the QCS for the long shutdown in 2026."

        "fabricated and measured. The preliminary magnetic measurement results showed a large crosstalk effect in the two apertures",
        "thus the magnetic center in X axis has a large shift. Then a modification of the iron is done to compensated the field crosstalk effect. The magnetic center shift decreased an order. The detailed process is illustrated in this paper."
