        "cool and crab the stored beams. R&D is focusing on the 591 MHz elliptical cavity and 197 MHz crab cavity first as these are the most challenging. Preliminary designs of these cavities are presented along with an R&D status report. To avoid developing multiple different cryostats a modular approach is adopted using a high degree of commonality of parts and systems. This approach may be easily adapted to other frequencies and applications."

        "we achieved new record of the luminosity of 4.7x1034 cm-2s-1 with 1.1 A for electron and 1.3 A for positron. The RF system that is basically reused from KEKB is operating stably in the high current operation owing to the measures against to large beam power and HOM power. To cope with the large beam power",
        "it has been increased the number of klystrons that drive only one normal conducting cavity (ARES) and reinforced the input couplers of ARES. As a measure against HOM power",
        "the additional HOM dampers have been installed to superconducting cavities. One-third of LLRF control systems have been replaced with newly developed digital system to improve accuracy and flexibility. New damper system for coupled bunch instability expected in high current has been installed to new digital system. In this report",
        "operation status of RF system under the high current operation will be presented."
