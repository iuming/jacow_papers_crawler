      "abstract": "I will discuss open issues of the SM and will present few examples of phenomenology that lead to a so-called dark sector and long-lived particles. In the illustration of the probes of these scenarios I will stress the role of energy and luminosity of colliders that can test interesting scenario of new physics suggested by these questions.",
