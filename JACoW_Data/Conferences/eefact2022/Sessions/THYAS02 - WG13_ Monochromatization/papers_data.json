        "The FCC-ee collider baseline foresees four different energy operation modes: Z",
        "WW",
        "H(ZH) and ttbar. An optional fifth mode",
        "called s-channel Higgs production mode",
        "could allow the measurement of the electron Yukawa coupling",
        "in dedicated runs at 125 GeV centre-of-mass energy",
        "provided that the centre-of-mass energy spread",
        "can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude (5-10 MeV). The use of a special collision technique known as monochromatization scheme (mono-scheme) is one way to accomplish it. The transverse monochromatization scheme consists of introducing a dispersion function different from zero but of opposite sign for the two colliding beams at the Interaction Point (IP); In this paper",
        "we will report about the trade-off between energy spread and luminosity",
        "and the first attempt to design a new optics to implement a transverse monochromatic scheme for the FCC-ee Higgs production."
