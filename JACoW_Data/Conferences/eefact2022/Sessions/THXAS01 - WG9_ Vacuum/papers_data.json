        "the maximum beam currents were ~1460 mA in the low energy ring for positron (LER) and ~1145 mA in the high energy ring for electron (HER). The beam doses up to now have been ~ 7312 Ah in LER and ~6199 Ah in HER",
        "and the vacuum scrubbing of the beam pipes is proceeding well. On the other hand",

        "problems such as abnormal pressure rises",
        "vacuum leaks",
