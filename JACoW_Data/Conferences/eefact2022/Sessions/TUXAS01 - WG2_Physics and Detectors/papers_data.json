        "The most recent results obtained by the KLOE-2 collaboration with entangled neutral kaons produced at DAÎ¦NE are briefly reviewed: (i) an improved search for decoherence and CPT violation effects in the process phi -> KSKL -> pi+pi- pi+pi-",
        "constraining with the utmost precision several phenomenological models; (ii) the first direct test of the T and CPT symmetries in neutral kaon transitions between flavor and CP eigenstates",
        "by studying the processes phi -> KSKL -> pi+pi- pi e nu",
        "phi -> KSKL -> pi e nu 3pi0; (iii) a new measurement of the KS -> pi e nu branching fraction",
        "that in combination with the previous KLOE result improves the total precision by almost a factor of two",
        "and allows a new derivation of f+(0) Vus."
