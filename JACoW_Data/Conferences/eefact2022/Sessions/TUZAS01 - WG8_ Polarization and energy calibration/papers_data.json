        "The Electron Ion Collider requires rapid and precise electron beam polarimetry to support both accelerator operations and the physics program. The primary requirements for measurement of the beam polarization in the electron storage ring include measurements with precision dP/P<1%",
        "measurements for each bunch in the storage ring",
        "and measurement times of about one minute or less for those bunches. The planned Compton polarimeter is designed to meet these requirements and will be located several meters upstream of the primary experiment. Since the beam polarization has both longitudinal and transverse components at that location",
        "the polarimeter is designed to measure both with high precision. In the addition",
        "a Compton polarimeter will be used to measure the electron beam polarization in the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) as the electrons are accelerated from low energy to the energy required in the storage ring (5",
        "10",
        "or 18 GeV). While the requirements for absolute precision are less stringent",
        "the design of this device poses unique challenges (measurement over a wide range of energies and operation in multi-photon mode)."

The obtainable equilibrium spin polarization levels under the influence of lattice imperfections should be estimated via spin polarization simulations. An early-stage exploration of spin simulations in the FCC-ee has been conducted using Bmad. An effective model has been used to generate residual errors for the simulation of realistic orbits after lattice corrections. The influences of depolarization effects near the first-order spin-orbit resonances are displayed in linear polarization simulations",

        "the first attempts at performing nonlinear spin tracking simulations in the FCC-ee reveals the full impact of lattice perturbations."
