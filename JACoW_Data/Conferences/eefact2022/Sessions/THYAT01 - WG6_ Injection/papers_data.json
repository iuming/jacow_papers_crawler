        "The KEK injector Linac feeds beams to four rings. It is called J-Linac. SuperKEKB Main Rings are High-Energy-Ring (HER) and Low-Energy-Ring (LER). The Linac injects a 7.0 GeV electron beam to HER and a 4.0 GeV positron beam to LER. It also injects electron beams into two light source rings. We have successfully performed this simultaneous four-ring injection. We achieve this complex simultaneous injection by using two electron guns",

        "whereas very high intensities are required for linear colliders. These constraints about intensity and emittance have strong consequences on the heat load and reliability of the targets. The high-luminosity circular collider FCC-ee will need a low-emittance positron beam with high enough intensity to shorten the injection time. A positron bunch intensity of about 3.5·1010 particles is required at the injection into a booster ring. Due to the large 6D production emittance and target thermal load",
