eefact2022,,MOXAT0102,The DAΦNE Legacy to Future Colliders,LNF-INFN; Frascati; Italy; 25 years ago the first beam was stored in the DAΦNE electron-positron collider working at the energy of Phi resonance (1.02 GeV c.m.). Since then much efforts have been dedicated to obtain the luminosity substantially higher than that ever achieved at the colliders operated in this energy range and to provide data for several experimental detectors aimed at studying the high energy and nuclear physics. Careful beam optics modeling and nonlinear dynamics studies; design of the low impedance vacuum chamber; suppression of a variety of beam instabilities and investigation of beam-beam interaction have helped to reach the impressive result. Several novel ideas in the accelerator physics have been proposed and/or tested at DAΦNE for the first time. In particular; the Crab waist concept originally proposed and then tested at Frascati has been already successfully applied in SuperKEKB and now it is considered for implementation in the future electron-positron factories. In this paper we discuss the relevant advanced accelerator studies performed at DAΦNE which can be also of some interest to other circular colliders.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/talks/moxat0102_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/papers/moxat0102.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/posters/moxat0102_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2022-MOXAT0102,
eefact2022,,MOXAT0103,SuperKEKB Luminosity Quest,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; The SuperKEKB accelerator is a positron-electron collider with a nano-beam scheme and continues to achieve the world’s highest luminosity for the production of B meson pairs. The luminosity performance has been improved by the full-scale adoption of the crab-waist scheme. The nano-beam scheme allows the vertical beta function at the interaction point to be much smaller than the bunch length. The vertical beta function and the beam size at the collision point are the smallest in the world among colliders. As the result; the peak luminosity of 4.65 x 1034 cm-2 s-1 has been achieved with the Belle II detector in 2022. Recent progress will be presented; and then the problems and issues to be overcome from the beam physics point of view will be discussed for further improvement of luminosity performance in the future.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/talks/moxat0103_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/papers/moxat0103.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/posters/moxat0103_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2022-MOXAT0103,1

eefact2022,,TUXAT0102,Investigation of Arc Region Lattice for the Compatible Modes of CEPC Collider Ring,IHEP; Beijing; People’s Republic of China; The FODO cell structure is chosen to provide a large filling factor of dipoles for the arc region of a circular Higgs factory. For the Higgs and ttbar modes of CEPC collider; the phase advances of each arc cell are 90/90 degrees; For the Z mode; the phase advance was reduced to 60/60 degrees in order to suppress the microwave and transverse mode coupling instability and to increase stable tune area when considering both the beam-beam effect and longitudinal impedance. For the W mode; the phase advance was reduced as Z to increase the stable tune area. Due to the different cell phase advances of Higgs/ttbar and Z/W modes; the sextupole pairs with ’I transportation matrix are no more maintain. Thus; compatible sextupole layout for the should be provide for the Higgs/ttbar and Z/W modes. Two schemes of the arc sextupole layout are investigated for the CEPC collider arc region. One has a period of 5 cells for Higgs/ttbar modes and 7 cells for Z/W modes; which is proposed by FCC-ee. Another one has a period of 11 cells or 23 cells for all the modes. From the view point of single beam dynamics and cost of the sextupole; the two schemes will be investigated and compared.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/talks/tuxat0102_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/papers/tuxat0102.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/posters/tuxat0102_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2022-TUXAT0102,
eefact2022,,TUXAT0103,SuperKEKB Optics Tuning and Issues,H. Sugimoto; H. Koiso; A. Morita; Y. Ohnishi; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; SuperKEKB is an electron-positron double-ring asymmetric-energy collider at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan. It adopts a novel collision method named nano-beam scheme to avoid the so-called hourglass effect. In the nano-beam scheme; two beams are squeezed to extremely small sizes at the interaction point and are collided with a large crossing angle between them. Since staring the collision operation in April 2018; numerous machine tunings and beam studies have been performed to improve the machine performance. The highest peak luminosity so far is 4.65 x 1034 cm-2 s-1 reached in June 8th; 2022. This record is the world’s highest instantaneous luminosity and is more than 2 times higher than that of the previous KEKB collider. This talk starts with a brief introduction to SuperKEKB ring lattice design. The talk then presents some important topics related to beam optics tuning in the actual machine operation. Major issues to be resolved to boost the machine performance further are also addressed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/talks/tuxat0103_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/papers/tuxat0103.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/posters/tuxat0103_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2022-TUXAT0103,35

The baseline design of a detector concept consists of a tracking system; which is a high precision (about 100 micrometers) spatial resolution Time Projection Chamber (TPC) as the main tracking device in very large 3D volume. TPC detection technology requires longitudinal time resolution of about 100 ns and the physics goals require PID resolution of very good separation power with cluster counting to be considered. A number of critical issues are still remaining regarding the TPC research. The simulation and PID resolution show TPC technology potential to extend Z at the high luminosity. In this talk; we will present the feasibility and status of high precision TPC as the main track detector for CEPC. A smaller prototype TPC has been developed with a drift length of 500 mm; gaseous chamber; 20000V field-cage; the low power consumption FEE electronics and DAQ have been commissioned and some studies have been finished.

eefact2022,,TUYAS0103,MgB₂ Conductors for Future Detector Magnets,R. Musenich; S. Farinonpresenter; INFN Genova; Genova; Italy; Since 1978; when the CELLO magnet was manufactured; superconducting detector magnets have been wound using NbTi based; aluminium stabilised conductors. However; other choices are possible and Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) could be an attractive alternative. Due to its characteristics; MgB2 is suitable for low field applications as detector magnets. Magnets wound with MgB2 conductors can be operated at relatively high temperature; between 10 K and 20 K; therefore increasing the cryogenics efficiency in terms of both refrigerator performance and indirect cooling (higher thermal conductivity of materials). Efficiency is not the only advantage in using MgB2 instead of NbTi: higher operating temperature and higher temperature margin lead to higher enthalpy margin; with higher stability respect to quench triggering disturbances. In addition; MgB2 is much cheaper respect to High Temperature Superconductors but more expensive than NbTi. However; cost comparison between Al stabilised NbTi magnets and MgB2 magnets must be made taking into account the entire fabrication process. R&D is necessary to develop the conductor. Detector magnet design must be rethought based on MgB2 conductor features.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/talks/tuyas0103_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/papers/tuyas0103.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/posters/tuyas0103_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2022-TUYAS0103,

eefact2022,,TUZAS0102,Electron Polarimetry at EIC,JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; The Electron Ion Collider requires rapid and precise electron beam polarimetry to support both accelerator operations and the physics program. The primary requirements for measurement of the beam polarization in the electron storage ring include measurements with precision dP/P<1%; measurements for each bunch in the storage ring; and measurement times of about one minute or less for those bunches. The planned Compton polarimeter is designed to meet these requirements and will be located several meters upstream of the primary experiment. Since the beam polarization has both longitudinal and transverse components at that location; the polarimeter is designed to measure both with high precision. In the addition; a Compton polarimeter will be used to measure the electron beam polarization in the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) as the electrons are accelerated from low energy to the energy required in the storage ring (5; 10; or 18 GeV). While the requirements for absolute precision are less stringent; the design of this device poses unique challenges (measurement over a wide range of energies and operation in multi-photon mode).,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/talks/tuzas0102_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/papers/tuzas0102.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/posters/tuzas0102_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2022-TUZAS0102,

The obtainable equilibrium spin polarization levels under the influence of lattice imperfections should be estimated via spin polarization simulations. An early-stage exploration of spin simulations in the FCC-ee has been conducted using Bmad. An effective model has been used to generate residual errors for the simulation of realistic orbits after lattice corrections. The influences of depolarization effects near the first-order spin-orbit resonances are displayed in linear polarization simulations; highlighting the demand for good closed orbit control.

The new found coherent head-tail instability (X-Z instability) may induce the horizontal beam size blowup and reduce the machine performance. The longitudinal coupling impedance would distort the phase space: lengthen the bunch and bring incoherent synchrotron tune spread. The simulation study has found the clear influence of longitudinal impedance on the X-Z instability in both CEPC and FCCee.

The results show that a vertical beam-beam TMCI-like instability may be induced when the impedance is considered. It is first found in e+e− colliders.

The ECE; however; was observed during phase-1 commissioning (2016) caused by the electron cloud in the beam pipes at drift spaces of the ring; which had antechambers and a TiN-film coating. Permanent magnets and solenoids to generate magnetic fields in the beam direction were attached to the beam pipes as additional countermeasures before the next phase-2 commissioning (2018). Consequently; the threshold of the current linear density for exciting the ECE increased by a factor of at least 2. During Phase-3 commissioning (2019); it was confirmed that the threshold was over 0.53 mA/bunch/RF bucket; and we have observed no clear evidence of ECE in the usual operation up to now. The effectiveness of the ante-chambers and TiN film coating of the real beam pipe was reevaluated.

The high current requirements of future colliders can be compromised by the extremely high positron emittance at the production target and consequent poor capture and transport to the damping ring. However; recent advances in high temperature superconductors allow for an efficient matching of such an emittance through the use a solenoid around the target delivering a field over 10 T on-axis. Moreover; the emittance of the matched positron beam can be contained through large aperture RF cavities surrounded by a multi-Tesla field generated by conventional superconducting solenoids; where simulations estimate a yield higher by one order of magnitude with respect to the state-of-theart. The goal of P3 is to demonstrate this basic principle by implementing the aforementioned solenoids into a prototype positron source based on a 6 GeV electron beam from the SwissFEL linac; including two RF capture cavities and a beam diagnostics section.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/talks/thxat0101_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/papers/thxat0101.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/eefact2022/posters/thxat0101_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-EEFACT2022-THXAT0101,218

At high energies the beam lifetime could be as low as 6 minutes; requiring the beam to be continuously topped up to reach a high integrated luminosity. This top-up injection would use a separate booster ring in the same tunnel as the collider; which would accelerate the beams to the collider energy. The booster ring should achieve a lower equilibrium emittance than the collider; despite challenges such as a long damping time and no magnet-strength tapering to compensate for the impact of synchrotron radiation. For top-up injection into the collider; we consider two strategies: conventional bump injection; employing a closed orbit bump; and injection using a multipole kicker magnet.

In the case of positron beams to be injected into circular colliders; the main concern is an optimized 6D emittance; whereas very high intensities are required for linear colliders. These constraints about intensity and emittance have strong consequences on the heat load and reliability of the targets.
