Thus; an RF source with high efficiency is preferable to minimise the overall power required. Klystrons represent an attractive RF source; with the current state of the art operating at efficiencies of up to 70%. Such devices feature monotonic bunching; where at the output cavity; a number of electrons will not be in the main bunch; and instead will be present in the anti-bunch; and therefore not contributing to the output power. Therefore; novel bunching methods; such as the Core Oscillation Method (COM); are worthy of investigation. By allowing the core of the electron beam to bunch and de-bunch between successive cavities; the number of electrons contained in the final bunch can increase; and therefore improve the efficiency of the device. Numerical simulation of klystrons featuring COM will be presented; with efficiencies of up to 85% being predicted thus far.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mooca1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mooca1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mooca1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOOCA1,37

To mitigate the Electron Multipacting (EM) phenomenon in the SPS; CERN developed thin film carbon coatings with a low Secondary Electron Yield (SEY). The development went from coating small samples; up to coating of 6 m long vacuum chambers directly installed in the magnets. To deposit the low SEY amorphous carbon (aC) film on the vacuum chamber inner wall of SPS ring components; a modular hollow cathode train was designed. The minimization of the logistical impact requires a strategy combining in-situ and ex-situ coating; depending on the type of components. To validate the implementation strategy of the aC thin films and the in-situ coating process along the 7 km long SPS beamline; approximately 2 cells of B-type bending dipoles and 9 focussing quadrupoles are foreseen to be treated with the aC coating during the Extended Year End Technical Stop (EYETS) 2016-2017.

LWFA is expected to be a novel scheme for accelerating electron beams beyond GeV-class energy with compact devices. In recent studies; the pointing stability of the electron beams from LWFA has been dramatically improved by plasma-micro-optics (PMO) that is plasma device functioning as a focusing and optical-guiding tool for intense laser pulses. The PMO enables electron beams to be precisely controlled and/or transported by the beam-optics of conventional accelerators. With these techniques a staging LWFA has been demonstrated successfully; and high quality quasi-mono-energetic beams below the 100 MeV range are produced with good repeatability as an injector. Sub-GeV electron beams are also produced with a 4 mm-booster laser wakefield. These results will be presented and discussed.

As the radiation source point is located in a dispersive section of the storage ring; this allows time-resolved studies of the energy spread. These studies are of particular interest in the framework of short-bunch beam dynamics and the characterization of instabilities.

The macropulse laser consists of a mode-locked picosecond pulsed seed laser and a burst-mode Nd:YAG laser amplifier. The general design concept can be adapted to any temporal beam structures in most accelerators. We have achieved UV pulses with the pulse widths varying between 34 to 54 ps and a maximum peak power over 3.5 MW. A laser transport line is installed to deliver the UV beam to the laser stripping chamber at a transmission efficiency of 70%. Laser operation including remote control and monitor of laser parameters will be described.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/moocb2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/moocb2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/moocb2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOOCB2,57

In this context; the collimation system has to deal with extremely tight requirements to prevent quenches and material damage. A first layout of the betatron cleaning insertion was conceived; adapting the present LHC collimation system to the FCC lattice. A crucial ingredient to assess its performance; in particular to estimate the robustness of the protection devices and the load on the downstream elements; is represented by the simulation of the particle shower generated at the collimators; allowing detailed energy deposition estimations. This paper presents the first results of the simulation chain starting from the proton losses generated with the Sixtrack-FLUKA coupling; as currently done for the present LHC and for its upgrade.

In preparation for this; several improvements to the equipment will already be implemented during the next Long Shutdown (LS2) starting in 2019. In the betatron cleaning insertion; the debris leaking out of several collimators will deposit energy in the downstream warm magnets; causing long-term radiation damage. A new layout has been proposed in which the most exposed magnet of each assembly is removed; reducing the assembly from 6 to 5 magnet units and gaining 2 spare magnets. New absorbers are therefore required to enhance the shielding of the remaining magnet string. In this paper; we present an evaluation of the dose to the warm magnets for post-LS2 operation; and we quantify the achievable reduction of the long-term radiation damage for different absorber configurations.

Due to the complexity of the system; consisting of more than 50 collimators per beam; it is difficult to identify small changes in the collimation hierarchy; which may be due to setting errors or beam orbit drifts with such methods.

The low beta regions produced by the quadrupoles are occupied by dense; low Z absorbers; such as lithium hydride or beryllium; that cool the beam. Equilibrium transverse emittance is linearly proportional to the beta function. Reverse emittance exchange with septa and/or wedges is then used to decrease transverse emittance from 100 to 25 microns at the expense of longitudinal emittance for a high energy lepton collider.

Such state of electron significantly modifies the characteristics of its electromagnetic radiation during further interaction of the particle with substance. We propose to study the influence of the half-bare state of electron upon its transition radiation (TR). The existence of such influence for the case of electron undressing at its scattering was theoretically predicted. We intend to obtain the electrons in half-bare state in the result of their crossing of a conducting screen such as a TR screen. We propose to investigate the influence of the half-bare state of electron in this process upon TR generated by such electron on a downstream TR screen situated on some distance from the upstream screen which undresses the particle. Calculations are presented for the case of a 45-MeV linac and the distance between the screens in the region between 100 mm and 300 mm.

We investigate a method for close estimation of bunch length for sub-picosecond electron bunches from the measurement of their energy spreads. Three or more measurements for the bunch energy spread are made by varying the phase of the accelerating structure and later a reconstruction of the bunch longitudinal dimensions; namely bunch length; initial energy spread and chirp at the entrance of the accelerating structure are obtained using the least square method. A comparison of the obtained results with ASTRA simulations is also included to validate the 3-phase method for sub-ps electron bunches. It is a simple method from both understanding (easy reconstruction using transport matrices) and experimental point of views (multiple measurements of energy spread with varying phase of the accelerating structure).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopab028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopab028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopab028_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPAB028,139

A typical CCC consists of a ferrite core; a pick-up coil; a superconducting quantum interference device; appropriate electronics and superconducting shielding consisting of a meander structure. This configuration offers a strong attenuation for all the magnetic field components; except for the azimuthal one. Thus; high precision measurements of extremely low beam currents are made possible.

In the framework of PETRA IV upgrade scenarios the potential for decreasing the extracted emittance from DESY II has been investigated which can be achieved by lowering the extraction energy to 5 GeV and increasing the focusing in DESY II. In addition measuring the emittance of the extracted beam from DESY II and the optics in the beam transport line can help to better understand and improve the injection efficiency of PETRA III. By changing the quadrupole strength and measuring the beam size downstream on a screen monitor in the E-Weg the emittance of DESY II and the Twiss functions at the quadrupole in the E-Weg have been determined.

Experimental reconstructions of these distributions are therefore a step foreward to understand the beam dynamics and to optimize FEL operation. The reconstructions of the transverse phase spaces can be acieved with tomographic methods. In the injector of the European XFEL; measurements for the reconstruction of the phase spaces were carried out using phase advance scans with multiple quadrupoles. The beam sizes were kept optimized at the measurement screen. A transversely deflecting cavity (TDS) was used to streak the beam vertically. That allows to do longitudinally slice resolved measurements of the horizontal phase space. The horizontal streak required for the slice measurements in the vertical plane was achieved with a correlated linear energy spread and dispersion.

Our simulations demonstrate that the use of dielectric-loaded waveguides driven by THz pulses would allow overcoming these two limitations and possibly achieving an ultimate resolution better than 5% for the determination of a 6.25 fs rms bunch length at 100 MeV energy and 1 pC charge.

The use of a quadrupole doublet proves to be adequate to fulfil the requirement on the position of the focal point and be very close to the one on the bunch transverse size; which could possibly be achieved by a further optimization of the parameters of the doublet. Finally; we also investigate the possibility to use an active plasma lens; showing that it could easily fulfil the requirements but that several points must be carefully studied before considering its implementation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopab049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopab049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopab049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPAB049,203

These coils feature a torus with two or four segments; each densely covered with an insulating copper wire of 150μm in diameter. The bunched particle beam induces voltages in these segments; which are combined and analysed to yield information about beam displacements in the horizontal and the vertical plane.

At the J-PARC RCS; a transverse painting scheme was adapted by adding vertical painting magnets to the beam transport line before the injection point; with horizontal painting being performed by a set of dedicated pulse magnets in the ring. To establish a transverse painting condition; it is usual to base on the pulse magnet current pattern. However; it is more desirable to directly measure the beam orbit time variation for evaluation. A linac beam was chopped to match the ring RF bucket. We thought that it would be difficult to measure the position for each pulse; however; the average position could be extracted by introducing a particular device. For the beam injected into the ring; because the linac RF frequency component was diminished due to debunching quickly; one could determine its position in the beginning of the injection period. However; due to rebunching effect the position determination becomes difficult. This problem needs to be resolved.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopab070_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopab070.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopab070_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPAB070,277

The bunch length of the electron beam is an important parameter for free-electron laser (FEL) facilities with linear accelerators. In order to obtain high FEL gain at Laboratory for Electron Beam Research and Application (LEBRA) in Nihon University and at Kyoto University Free Electron Laser (KU-FEL); the electron-bunch length is compressed to less than 1 ps in their undulator sections. Using the compressed electron beams; intense terahertz lights were generated by coherent radiation. The power of the coherent radiation was more than 50 micro-joule per electron-beam macropulse. We can extract the information of the bunch length of the electron-beam micropulse from the intense coherent radiation by using narrow-band diode detectors.

So it is very important to calibrate electrode gains for axially symmetric BPM. A method was proposed to calibrate electrode gains of this kind of BPM. This method is suitable for all axially symmetric BPMs; whether stripline BPM or button BPM.

This symmetry allows for an octupole component of the rf fields to co-propagate with the main accelerating field. The effect of this octupole mode has been observed at the CLIC test facility 3. In CLIC the accelerating structures are mounted together on a moveable girders. There are four vertical and four horizontal actuators on the girder; which allows for 5D control in a limited range and for instance we can roll the girder. By observing the beam shape perturbed by the octupole field on a screen downstream from the structure we can determine the roll angle and thus align the structure azimuthally.

Having different instruments or techniques that provide beam size estimations in order to compare the outcome and give an unbiased value of the emittance is very important in a collider.

This method is already successfully used at the Antiproton Decelerator since the commissioning of this machine. The fact that Schottky noise is a statistical phenomenon implies statistical errors of these measurements. Simple analytical formulas describing the statistical error to be expected as a function of the frequency spread of the band considered; the time resolution chosen and the background noise have been derived. On the one hand; low revolution harmonics and; in turn; frequency spread of the band analysed lead to large measurement errors as this situation corresponds to low momentum resolution of the resulting distribution describing the beam.

A full machine snapshot provided from the moment of instability is a crucial input to develop and fine tune instability models. The transverse feedback system (ADT) is the only instrument in LHC; where a full rate bunch by bunch transverse position information is available. Together with a sub-micron resolution it makes it a perfect place to detect transverse beam motion. Very large amounts of data; at very high data rates (8 Gb/s) need to be processed on the fly to detect onset of transverse instability. A very powerful computer system (so called ADTObsBox) was developed and put into operation by the CERN RF group; which is capable of processing the full rate data streams from ADT and perform an on the fly instability detection. The output of this system is a timing event with a list of all bunches developing instability; which is then sent to the LHC-wide instability trigger network to freeze other observation instruments.

The exploitation of the directionality and the polarization of cSPr to reduce the length of the monitor and to eliminate background radiation are discussed. The linear polarization of cSPr will be used to separate the signal from background radiation and experiments to test this design will be presented.

Commonly; transverse beam profile measurements are provided by direct imaging of the electron beam using X-ray pinhole cameras. From these beam size measurements and given knowledge of the lattice parameters the emittance; coupling and energy spread are calculated. Ideally; the pinhole aperture should be formed in an infinitely thin screen. However; due to the penetration of X-rays in the keV spectral range; stacked tungsten blades are often used to form the pinhole aperture. In this arrangement the absolute size of the pinhole aperture is unknown and cannot be directly measured; which affects the spatial resolution of the imaging system.

Lattice characterization was typically carried out with dedicated machine study time with low storage current. Due to collective effect; the lattice at high operation current is different. To characterize the machine lattice during normal user operation with little disturbance; a small portion of beam (~1%) filled in the ion gap can be excited by the bunch by bunch feedback system near betatron frequency.

In the past; the AGS emittance has been measured by using an ion collecting IPM during the whole cycle. The beam profiles from this IPM are distorted by space charge forces at higher energy; which makes the emittance determination very hard. The effect has been measured with IPM measurement at different energies with RF off to mitigate the space charge effect. In addition; helical snake magnets and near integer vertical tune for polarized proton operation distort the lattice in the AGS and introduce large beta beating. For more precise measurements of the emittance; we need turn-by-turn (TBT) measurements near injection and beta function measurements at the IPM. The AGS has also been modeled to get the beta functions at the locations of IPM. A new type of electron collecting IPM has been installed and tested in the AGS with proton beam.

Touschek scattering strongly depends on momentum aperture. Understanding momentum aperture is extremely important. NSLS II storage ring RF system has the digital ramp control function; enabling rapid change of the cavity phase and amplitude. This makes the possibility to ping the beam in longitudinal phase space and directly measure the longitudinal acceptance; in contrast with traditional indirect way to understand it from other aspect of parameters. In this paper; we present the tool; longitudinal pinger; its application to characterize NSLS II longitudinal acceptance and localize the momentum aperture limit with SR BPMs.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopab155_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopab155.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopab155_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPAB155,497

Presently the primary choice is to use metallic photocathodes for the ELBE SRF Gun-II to reduce the risk of contamination of the superconducting cavity. Magnesium has a low work function (3.6 eV) and shows high quantum efficiency (QE) up to 0.3 % after laser cleaning. The SRF Gun II with an Mg photocathode has successfully provided electron beam for ELBE users. However; the present cleaning process with a high intensi-ty laser (activation) is time consuming and generates unwanted surface roughness.

Using such ultrashort pulses for electron acceleration offers advantages in terms of higher thresholds for material breakdown which opens up a promising path towards increased acceleration gradients. In addition; using optically generated THz pulses enable inherently synchronized acceleration schemes; since accelerating field and particle injecting field are excited by a single seed laser. In this contribution; we present the first experimental demonstration of laser-driven THz acceleration of electrons initially at rest. It is shown that strong-field; single-cycle THz fields accelerate electrons with peak energies of up to 0.8 keV in an ultracompact THz gun with bunch charge of 40 fC.

THz-based accelerators are mm-scale devices that bridge the gap between micron-scale; ultra-compact devices such as laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) and dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) and meter-scale conventional accelerators. These intermediate-scale devices are promising because they combine many of the benefits of LPAs and DLAs; such as intrinsic synchronization and high acceleration gradients with the benefits of conventional accelerators such as high charge capacity; tunability as well as the robustness; stability and simple fabrication of static; macroscopic acceleration structures. The Butterfly LINAC allows optimization of electron acceleration using transversely-coupled single-cycle THz pulses by phase-matching electrons with the driving field.

In order to obtain low intensity of test beams; an approach using a metal target together with an energy selector has been employed. A combination of a target chamber installed at the high energy beam transport line and the existing 4-degree bending magnet that is used as an energy selector first produced low intensity test beams. However; the test beam profile was not well determined due to the insufficient bending angle of the energy selector and high primary beam energy. Another approach mounting a target chamber at the low energy beam transport line and using the synchrotron booster as an energy selector was implemented to avoid such problems.

The emittance exchange (EEX) beamline and a transverse mask can be used to achieve all of these requirements. First; this EEX-based method can independently control the longitudinal bunch shape of each bunches so that the drive bunch is shaped to generate a high transformer ratio while witness bunch is shaped to suppress its energy spread. Second; the timing jitter between the drive and witness bunch poses a serious limitation to the CWFA scheme but the EEX-based method eliminates this since both bunches are generated at the same time and share the exactly same beamline so there are no relative errors.

This beam line has been designed for low-loss (< 1nA/m) operation and provides space for a collimator to remove the beam halo produced by large-angle scattering in the cyclotron extraction foil. We have studied proton loss patterns and collimation efficiency using simulation codes: the older REVMOC program and a fully 3D simulation based on Geant4; with all particle interactions in matter included. Scattering in the foil is treated by a separate iterated single-scatter model. Using these tools we arrive at a prototype design for an effective collimator.,Funding: Funded under a contribution agreement with NRC (National Research Council of Canada).

In addition to the neutrinos; a copious number of muons that could be used by a future Neutrino Factory and a muon collider will also be produced at the same time. This facility will use the world's most intense pulsed spallation neutron source; the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund. Its LINAC is expected to be operational by 2023; producing 2 GeV protons with a power of 5 MW. The primary proton beam line completing the linear accelerator will consist of one or several accumulator rings and a proton beam switchyard. The secondary beam line producing neutrinos and muons will consist of a four-horn target station; a decay tunnel and a beam dump. To detect the produced neutrinos a far megaton scale Water Cherenkov detector will be placed at a baseline of about 500 km in one of the existing active mines in Sweden.

We are improving the magnets and their power supplies. The present magnets which is conventional type have problem in durability of septum coil by its vibration; and large leakage field. The new magnets are eddy current type. The eddy current type does not have septum coil; but has a thin plate. We expect that there is no problem in durability; we can construct the thin septum plate; the leakage field can be reduced.

The channelling effect of a bent crystal can be used to strongly deflect primary protons and eject them from the synchrotron. Many studies and experiments have been carried out to investigate crystal channelling effects. The extraction of 120 and 270 GeV proton beams has already been demonstrated in the SPS with dedicated experiments located in the ring. Presently in the SPS; the UA9 experiment is performing studies to evaluate the possibility to use bent silicon crystals to steer particle beams in high energy accelerators. Recent studies on the feasibility of extraction from the SPS have been made using the UA9 infrastructure with a longer-term view of using crystals to help mitigate slow extraction induced activation of the SPS. In this paper; the possibility to eject particles into the extraction channel in LSS2 using the bent crystals already installed in the SPS is presented.

The extracted intensity is controlled in feed-forward correction of the horizontal tune via the main SPS quadrupoles. The Mains power supply noise at 50 Hz and harmonics is also corrected in feed-forward by small amplitude tune modulation at the respective frequencies with a dedicated additional quadrupole circuit. In 2016 the spill quality could be much improved with respect to the situation of the previous year with more performant algorithms. In this paper the improved tools are described and the characteristics of the SPS slow extracted spill in terms of macro structure and typical frequency content are shown. Other sources of perturbation were; however; also present in 2016 which frequently caused the spill quality to be much reduced.

High-intensity slow-extraction of protons from the SPS is a pre-requisite for SHiP. The experiment requires a resonant extraction with in a 7.2 s cycle; and about 4·1013 protons extracted at 400 GeV in a 1 s flat-top; to achieve the needed 2·1020 protons on target in five years. Although the SPS has delivered this in the past to the CNGS experiment with fast extraction; for SHiP beam losses and activation of the SPS electrostatic extraction septum (ZS) could be a serious performance limitation; since the target number of protons to resonantly extract per year is a factor of two higher than ever achieved before and a factor of four than ever reached with the third-integer slow extraction. In this paper; a novel extraction technique to significantly reduce the losses at the ZS is proposed; based on the use of a bent crystal to shadow the septum wires.

A compact Nier-Johnson type of pre-separator has been designed to achieve a mass resolving power of 300 in order to minimize the undesired radioactive species contaminating the downstream beamlines. It consists of a 112 degree magnetic and a 90 degree toroidal electrostatic dipole with deflection in opposite direction. It also contains electrostatic quadrupole elements in between the dipoles. The electrostatic dipole compensates the energy dispersion of the magnetic dipole. This allows an achromatic mode of operation resulting in a high mass resolving power downstream to the electrostatic deflector even for beams with a high energy spread.

Inspired by the successful lattice designs elsewhere adopting the interleaved sextupole scheme with dispersion bumps originally developed at the ESRF; the 7BA-6BA structures adopting this scheme are studied in details in parallel to those without it. The former aims at the horizontal emittance in the 200-300 pm-rad range with on and off-momentum dynamic acceptances sufficiently large for off-axis injection and good Touschek lifetime. The latter pursues the lower bound of the reachable horizontal emittance with quadrupole and sextupole strengths in the feasible range with maximum dynamic acceptance. The option of non-standard on-axis injection such as displacing the injected beam longitudinally is envisaged for the latter solutions.

It consists of 3 parts. The first part is in DESY tunnel; the second part is a long drift space in a slanted tube and the third part is in PETRA III tunnel. The vertical plane difference between the tunnels is 1.28 m. The optics was derived from initial values at Transfer Point (UGP) from a previous optics. The total length of the transfer line is about 203 m. Ten screen monitors are used to estimate the profiles of the beam spot for the optics measurements; while 8 BPMs; mostly adjacent to the screens; are used to compare and control the orbits. Two scrapers are installed on either side of the long drift space to trim the beam dimensions in transverse plane. Two FCTs are used to measure the beam current and transfer efficiency. The transverse dispersion and beta functions are measured by extracting the beam from DESY at different energies and analysing the beam profiles at the screen as well as positions at BPMs. The details of such measurements are reported in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopik071_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopik071.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopik071_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPIK071,692

At FLASH and European XFEL a reliable arrival time detection with a resolution better than 0.1% is required for a broad range of bunch charges; from 1 nC down to 20 pC. The system developed is based on electro-optical sampling where an ultra-short pulsed laser is employed. Several bunch arrival time monitors (BAM) were developed and are since 2012 in operation at the FLASH facility. A major upgrade involved the development of new hardware and software based on the MTCA standard. Special operation mode at both facilities includes the possibility to subdivide the bunch train in up to three segments; each with different bunch energy and charge; causing variation of the time jitter within the bunch train itself. A further upgrade includes the measurement of the arrival time and application of delay correction for each of the three segments.

To control the irradiation dose of target; a multi-channels charge integrator; Faraday cups; and a beam shutter are used. The amount of irradiation dose is calculated in real time by accumulative charge; which is represented to integration of induced current at each Faraday cup for the target. If the measurements reach to the set value (desired dose); the beam is automatically blocked by beam shutter. Thus; precise measurement of accumulative charge is required.

ipac2017,,MOPIK097,Vertical Dispersion and Betatron Coupling Correction for FCC-ee,S. Aumon; B.J. Holzer; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; The FCC-ee project foresees to build a 100 km e+/e− circular collider for precision studies and rare decay observations in the range of 90 to 350 GeV center of mass energy with luminosities in the order of 1035 cm-2s-1. To reach such performances; an extreme focusing of the beam is required in the interaction regions with a low vertical beta function of 2~mm at the IPs. Moreover; the FCC-ee physics program requires very low emittances never achieved in a collider with 1~nm for εx and 2~pm for εy; bringing down the coupling ratio to 2/1000. Thus; coupling and vertical dispersion sources have to be controlled carefully. This paper describes the tolerance of the machine to magnet alignment errors as well as the optics correction methods that were implemented; such as the Orbit Dispersion Free Steering; in order to bring the vertical dispersion to reasonable values. The correction of the betatron coupling; being also a very important source of emittance growth; has been integrated to a challenging correction scheme to keep the vertical emittance as low as possible.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopik097_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopik097.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopik097_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPIK097,752

The radioactive beams are accelerated to high-energy using a post-accelerator before being transferred for study in different experiments at the end of a network of High Energy Beam Transfer (HEBT) lines. In the framework of the HIE-ISOLDE project; the energy of post-accelerated beams is to be increased to over 10 MeV/u and new experimental detectors are being proposed for installation to exploit the new energy regime. The stray magnetic fields associated with many of the new detectors will distort the beam trajectories in the HEBT; potentially affecting the transmission of the low intensity beams delivered to the experiments.

A conventional injection scheme is based on a septum to deflect the injected bunch plus a fast pulsed three or four kicker bump to bring the stored beam close to the septum wall. With the novel improvement; the bump kickers are fitted with a thin wall longitudinal metal plate which screens the injected bunch from deflection without changing the stored beam bump behaviour. This metal screen then forms the final septum; but inverted in function of the conventional approach; hence the name anti-septum. The approach does not remove the need for the main septum magnet; but for modest cost it permits the injected bunch to be brought closer to the stored beam. Application of the anti-septum to the SLS-2 project and simulation results on a prototype are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopik104_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopik104.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopik104_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPIK104,774

Increasing the average brightness of such sources requires increasing the electron beam current. To avoid degradation of the narrow-bandwidth performance of the source; the per-bunch charge shouldn't increase; the effective repetition rate of the electron beams must be raised. It has been proposed* to generate bunch trains of several hundred pulses spaced by the period of X-band RF (~87 ps); which raises questions about beam-loading effects on the energy uniformity of the bunches and wakefield effects degrading the emittance of later bunches; compromising the x-ray quality. As a first test of this concept; we have installed into the electron-generating laser of our system optical pulse-stacking hardware to allow generation of 16-electron-bunch trains. Here we present the current status of our x-ray source; along with initial results using this new multi-bunch train.

ipac2017,,MOPIK124,A New Method to Tune the Nonlinear Lattice Online,W. Guo; Y. Hidaka; X. Yangpresenter; BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; Most nonlinear lattice tuning methods use only part of the optimization constraints; for example; part of the driving terms; nonlinear detuning; lifetime or injection efficiency. Even though some of the nonlinear properties can be improved; it is not guaranteed the nonlinear lattice is fully optimized. In this paper we propose to optimize the nonlinear lattice by correcting the betatron phase advance and detuning of the off-orbit lattices. It is shown that all the leading order optimization constraints are restored in this approach. One advantage of this new method is that the measurement is independent of BPM calibration errors. We succeed in both simulation and experiment in identifying the intentionally added sextupole errors.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopik124_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopik124.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopik124_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPIK124,828

Yang et al.; 'Fast and precise technique for magnet lattice correction via sine-wave excitation of fast correctors'; Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams; vol. 20; p. 054001; 2017.,,We developed a novel technique to improve the precision and shorten the measurement time of the LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits) method at NSLS-II [1]. This technique named AC LOCO is based on a sine-wave (AC) beam excitation via fast correctors typically installed at synchrotron light sources for the fast orbit feedback. The beam oscillations are measured by beam position monitors. The narrow band used for the beam excitation and measurement not only allows us to suppress effectively the beam position noise and also makes simultaneously exciting multiple correctors at different frequencies (multi-frequency mode) possible. We demonstrated at NSLS-II that the new technique provides better lattice corrections and achieves two minutes measurement time in the thirty-frequency mode. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopik125_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopik125.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopik125_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPIK125,831

In this case the spontaneous emission is undulator radiation emission; the radiation in X-ray range being possible from electrons in GeV energy range. In the case of interaction of electrons with properly aligned crystal the channeling radiation results in X-rays from electrons with energies in tens MeV energy range. In this situation for high current densities the SASE process may take place that potentially could lead to construction of a compact bright X-ray source. In present contribution the first principle theoretical description is outlined and first order perturbation theory is used to model the initial stage of SASE. The transition from spontaneous to SASE regime is described; the requirements for bunch current and emittance are determined. By means of dispersion equation analysis and boundary condition application the intensity radiated from crystal slab is calculated and it is shown that Bragg diffraction could enhance self amplification. A numerical example for Si (001) illustrates the model.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopva002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopva002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopva002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPVA002,848

Hug et al.; Proc. of LINAC '12 (2012) 531.,,Non-isochronous recirculation is the common operation mode for synchrotrons or microtrons. In such a non-isochronous recirculation scheme the recirculation paths provide a non-zero longitudinal dispersion while the accelerating field is operated at a certain phase off-crest with respect to the maximum. In few turn linacs like ERLs and in microtrons non-isochronous beam dynamics can be used to reduce the energy spread by cancelling out any rf-jitters coming from the linac cavities. To do so the longitudinal phase advance needs to be tuned to a half-integer number of oscillations in longitudinal phase space. Then the total energy spread after main linac acceleration conserves the value at injection. In addition to the improved energy spread the beam stability of few-turn recirculators can be increased as well using such a system. Such concept provides an inherent beam stability and has been introduced many years ago [*] and proven to work successfully in a few-turn recirculator already [**].

ipac2017,,MOPVA014,Injector Linac Stability Requirements for High Precision Experiments at MESA,F. Hug; R.G. Heine; IKP; Mainz; Germany; MESA is a recirculating superconducting accelerator under construction at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz. It will be used for high precision particle physics experiments in two different operation modes: external beam (EB) mode and energy recovery (ERL) mode. The operating beam current and energy in EB mode is 0.15 mA with polarized electrons at 155 MeV. In ERL mode an unpolarized beam of 1 mA at 105 MeV will be available. In a later construction stage of MESA the beam current in ERL-mode shall be upgraded to 10 mA. In order to achieve high beam stability and low energy spread in recirculating operation the acceleration in the main linac sections will be done on edge of the accelerating field while the return arcs provide longitudinal dispersion. On certain longitudinal working points this can result in a setting where rf jitters from main linac do not contribute to the resulting energy spread of the final beam at all [*; **]. Then the resulting energy spread is only determined by the energy spread provided by the inector linac. Within this contribution we will investigate the requirements on the stability of the MESA injector linac MAMBO for achieving the experimental goals.; [*] H. Herminghaus; NIM. A 314 (1992) 209.

The PUB has been designed with the purpose of having a continuous and non-interceptive measurement of the beam transverse position short upstream the injection in the synchrotron. Detector commissioning has not been immediate since a number of primary ions and secondary electrons fall on the PUB electrodes in many configurations; resulting in a significantly distorted signal. After the identification; and consequent rejection; of a few circumstances where the PUB cannot work properly; the commissioning proceeded on a twofold way; designing a mechanical shield to stop ions before hitting the electrodes and developing an advanced data-analysis algorithm to go beyond the signal distortion. The use of the new algorithm was sufficient to make the PUB successfully working and; after a proper calibration with upstream and downstream profile monitors; the PUB started to provide the expected results.

A test accelerator; compact-ERL; has been operating in KEK for development works of technologies related to ERL and CW-Superconducting accelerators. In a special beam operation mode of bunch compression; a short bunch beam of ~150 fs at the repetition rate of CW 1.3 GHz can be realized in the return-loop. One of the promising applications of such a short bunch beam is a high power THz radiation source produced by a coherent radiation. When a charged particle beam passes close to a conductive target; a radiation called diffraction radiation is produced.

However; the maximum bunch charge was limited to 40 pC due to the limitation of the excitation laser power. For the bunch charge of 40 pC; the bunch length and the normalized emittance were measured in the injector diagnostic line. The results of the bunch length measurement gave good agreement with the values that had been obtained by model simulation. The measured normalized rms emittances for 40 pC were 0.9 to 2.4 mm mrad; and they were lager than the design value of 0.6 mm mrad.

The ERL can provide a high-current and high-quality electron beam for the high-power FEL and also greatly reduce the dumped beam power and activation compared to ordinary linacs. An ERL-based EUV-FEL source has been designed using available technologies and resources*. For this design; we perform Start-to-End(S2E) simulation from the electron gun to the exit of the decelerating main linac to track the electron beam parameters and to evaluate the FEL performance. The electron bunches from the injector are off-crest accelerated to 800 MeV and compressed in the 1st arc and/or chicane to obtain a high-peak current for high FEL output. After the undulator section for SASE FEL; they are decompressed in the 2nd arc and then decelerated in the main linac to optimize the energy spread or the energy recovery efficiency. This paper will present the S2E simulation for the designed EUV-FEL source.; * N.

The advantage of ERL is to accelerate high average current beam due to CW operation; and it is possible to drive high average power FEL. To generate the target EUV-FEL power; which is 10 kW; the bunch charge of 60 pC; the beam energy of 10.5 MeV and the bunch length of 1 ps are required at the end of the EUV-FEL injector. In order to demonstrate the target beam performance for the EUV-FEL accelerator; a high charge beam test was carried out at the cERL in KEK. We designed a new optics of the cERL injector prior to the high charge beam operation. To calculate beam dynamics more accurately; accelerator models corrected according to the condition of the actual cERL injector is used for the optics design. From results of the optics design that minimized the emittance and bunch length using the corrected accelerator models; the emittance and bunch length at the end of injector are 0.8 mm-mrad and 3.4 ps.

We are planning to apply crab crossing to laser-Compton scattering; which is a collision of electron beam and laser; to gain a higher luminosity leading to a higher flux X-ray source. It is well known that the collision angle between electron beam and laser affects the luminosity. It is the best when the collision angle is zero; head-on collision; to get a higher luminosity but difficult to construct such system especially when using an optical cavity for laser. Concerning this difficulty; we are planning crab crossing by tilting the electron beam using an rf-deflector. Although crab crossing in laser-Compton scattering has been already proposed*; nowhere has demonstrated yet.

High brightness hard X-ray beams at the energy particularly above 10kev are provided by insertion devices installed in straight sections of the storage ring. Brightness tuning curves of 14 ID beamlines planned in HEPS first stage are obtained after designing their parameters. However the presence of these insertion devices produce several effects on the beam performances including betatron tunes; betatron amplitude functions; closed orbit; emittance and dynamic aperture etc. It is found that the vertical octupole effect due to the fourteen IDs under the present schemes produce the most significant effect on the vertical dynamic aperture reduction. The ID field error effects on close orbit can be completely compensated by two correctors adjacent the ID at the both side.

The trapped flux causes additional dissipation in the order of 1 to 10 n' during operation and can therefore significantly degrade the quality factor in a TESLA cavity. We simulated the distribution of the generated magnetic field over the whole cavity-tank system for an asymmetric temperature distribution. The asymmetry allows the field to penetrate the RF surface which would be field free in the symmetric case. The calculated results complemented a direct measurement of trapped magnetic flux inside the cavity with a small number of field probes.

The simulation on the ideal cavity shape with both FishPact and MultiPac2.1 codes shows that multipacting appears in a very small region near equator where the weld seam exists. A simulation with more realistic cavity shape considering the weld seam at cell equators has also been done out showing similar results for end cell but a remarkable mitigation for inner cell. During the vertical tests at LASA; Multipacting is frequently observed but with no limitation to the cavity performance; which well confirms the MP predicted by the simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopva064_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopva064.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopva064_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPVA064,

We adopt the superconducting spoke cavity for electron beam drivers to realize a wide use of LCS X-ray and '-ray sources in academic and industrial applications. The spoke cavity can make the accelerator more compact than an elliptical cavity because the cavity size is small at the same frequency and the packing factor is good by installing couplers on outer conductor. Though our proposal design for the photon source consists of the 325 MHz spoke cavities in 4K operation; we are fabricating the half scale model of 650 MHz spoke cavity in order to accumulate our cavity production experience by effective utilization of our limited resources. Since the spoke has more complicated structure than an elliptical cavity; we performed press forming tests for the half spoke and estimated the formed shapes with 3-dimensional measurement.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopva071_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopva071.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopva071_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPVA071,

The most important signals during the RF conditioning are vacuum level; and electron emission by multipacting. The vacuum level changes continuously; and electron emission has pulse-like behavior; which has much faster response. Therefore; it was necessary to develop the peak hold and isolation modules to evaluate electron emission in short pulse width. This module has two kinds of feature. One is pulse height detection; and the other is total charge detection (integrated signal). During the RF conditioning for power couplers in STF-2 cryomodule; this module perfectly worked; and detected different trend between the pulse height and the total charge.

The cavities must be operated at 2 K; without excessive heat loads; in a low magnetic environment and in compliance with CERN safety guidelines on pressure and vacuum systems. A large set of components; such as a thermal shield; a two layers magnetic shield; RF lines; helium tank and tuner is required for the successful and safe operation of the cavities. The assembly of all these components with the cavities and their couplers forms the cryomodule. An overview of the design and fabrication strategy of this cryomodule is presented. The main components are described along with the present status of cavity fabrication and processing and cryomodule assembly. The lesson learned from the prototypes; the helium tank above all; and first manufactured systems is also included.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopva096_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopva096.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopva096_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPVA096,

When there is no beam current passing through the superconducting RF cavity of the accelerator; almost 100% RF power will be reflected from the cavity even the cavity is on resonance. The circulator shall be able to forward the reflected power to the load and remain good matching and isolation condition between ports at klystron and the cavity. However; for a ferrite material based circulator; the magnetic field within circulator would be temperature dependent which would cause the variation of input return loss and isolation between ports. Additional DC current driving electromagnet field is thus re-quired for compensating the temperature variation. Even with the compensating DC current; the circulator is still not ideal for practical operation especially when the performance of the circulator is strongly phase dependent. The phenomenon observed in actual operation with one set of SRF systems in NSRRC is thus reported in this article.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/mopva099_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/mopva099.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/mopva099_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-MOPVA099,

For niobium surfaces coated with a thin layer of Nb3Sn using the vapour diffusion method; the polycrystalline nature of the film grown lends to the possibility that performance-degrading non-uniformities may develop. In particular; regions of insufficiently thick coating and tin-depletion have been seen to occur in sample coupons. In the interests of understanding how to control the presence and nature of such features; it is necessary to know how they form.

A dual detector system employs a proportional-type gas chamber (PBLM) and an air-filled ionization chamber (AIC). The system shows a wide dynamic range of 160 dB. It can detect the low level signal that would arise in the case of the detection of residual dose in the ring itself after the beam has been turned off as well as an event such as high level beam loss at the collimators.

The plasma dechirper operates through the interaction of the electron bunch with its near linear self-wake to dechirp itself; leading to a reduction in energy spread. The experimental results demonstrate that the projected FWHM energy spread of the beam can be reduced from 1.2% to 0.9% with a 12 mm long plasma dechirper; which are in good agreement with full 3D PIC simulations. Theoretical analyses and simulations indicate that by optimizing the plasma density and length; the plasma dechirper can also be used to completely remove the characteristic energy chirp of the ultra-short high-current bunch generated from plasma based accelerator; such that its energy spread can be reduced from one percent level to 0.1 percent level[*]. Application of such a simple and effective method can significantly improve the beam quality and provide the path to realize the future compact free electron lasers and colliders driven by plasma based accelerators.; [*] Y.

Therefore; high beam position stability is needed to provide cen-tral collisions of the opposing bunches. Since ground motion (GM) amplitudes are likely to be larger than the required tolerances; an Active Vibration Control (AVC) system is required to damp quadrupole motion to the desired value of 0.2 nm RMS at 4 Hz. This paper focuses on the vertical final focus quadrupoles (QD0; QF1) stabilization and demonstrates its feasibility. An AVC system to be installed under QD0 and QF1 has been developed and successfully tested at LAPP. Based on a dedicated homemade sensor with an ex-tremely low internal noise level of 0.05 nm at 4 Hz; it damps GM in the frequency range [3;70] Hz by up to 30 dB; leading to RMS values of approximately 0.25 nm at 4 Hz. Simulations based on GM measured in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experimental hall [2] show that with such a GM level; the specifications would only be achieved with a Passive Insulation (PI) system; which would filter ground motion starting at ~ 25 Hz,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupab001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupab001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupab001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPAB001,

It is being upgraded for the SuperKEKB project; which aims at a 40-fold increase in luminosity over the previous project KEKB; in order to increase our understanding of new physics beyond the standard model of elementary particle physics. SuperKEKB asymmetric electron and positron collider with its extremely high luminosity requires a high current; low emittance and low energy spread injection beam from the injector. Electron beams will be generated by a new type of RF gun; that will provide a much higher beam current to correspond to a large stored beam current and a short lifetime in the ring. The positron source is another major challenge that enhances the positron bunch intensity from 1 to 4 nC by increasing the positron capture efficiency; and the positron beam emittance is reduced from 2000 micron to 20 micron in the vertical plane by introducing a damping ring; followed by the bunch compressor and energy compressor.

For the high luminosity; the injector linac is required to transport low emittance high-charged electron beam and positron beam to the ring. A charged beam with an offset from a center of cavity is affected by the wakefield depending on both the offset size in the cavity and longitudinal particle position in the beam. The wakefield causes emittance growth. This growth can be suppressed by appropriate orbit control so as to cancel the wakefield effect of the cavities in total. On the other hands; the beam variation in 6-dimensional phase space also induces the emittance growth. Emittance growth by both misalignments and 6-dimensional beam jitter was evaluated by particle tracking simulation. Investigation of beam jitter and drift was also performed by correlation analysis between beam position and measured parameter; charge or temperature.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupab005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupab005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupab005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPAB005,

Stripline electrodes collect cloud electrons which pass through holes in the beam-pipe wall. The array of small holes shields the striplines from the beam-induced electromagnetic pulse. The beam-pipe chamber has also been designed so that microwave measurements of the electron cloud density can be performed. The resonant microwaves are confined to be within the 56 cm length of the quadrupole. The detector is placed in a newly installed quadrupole that is adjacent to an existing lattice quadrupole of the same polarity. Since they are powered independently; their relative strengths can be varied with stored beam – allowing electron cloud measurements to be made as a function of gradient.

There are momentum analysis stations at 10 MeV and 30 MeV. In October 2014; using a total of two cavities; the e-linac demonstrated 22.9 MeV acceleration. In 2017 an additional SRF cavity was installed in the accelerator cryomodule; thereby completing its design specification; and leading to 30 MeV acceleration capability. The 9-cell 1.3 GHz cavities are a variant of the TESLA type; modified for c.w. operation and recirculation. An unusual feature of the module is the power feed of two cavities by one klystron through a wave-guide type power divider; and closed loop control of the combined voltage from the cavities.

In principle; using photoelectric effect a short electron bunch can initially be generated by illuminating a photocathode with an ultra-short light pulse of appropriate wavelength. Strong EM fields from a RF gun or similar accelerating structures; synchronized with the incoming laser pulses; are then used to accelerate these electron bunches initially up to an energy of tens of MeV.

Its design energy of 130 MeV in cw-operation was not reached so far due to a lower quality factor of the SRF cavities and thus a higher dissipated power to the helium bath. In 2015/2016 a third recirculation has been built. Enabling a fourth passage through the main linac; the accelerating gradients can be reduced to fit the resulting dissipated power to the available cooling power for running at design energy. The upgrade to a thrice recirculating accelerator required the reconstruction of main parts of the existing lattice as well as an installation of a new beam line. All magnets had to be aligned carefully in position and orientation using high-precision metrology sensors. This contribution will present an overview of the construction and the alignment process.

Depending on the user demand the bunch repetition rate may vary from single pulse up to 13 MHz. For the future different end stations should be served simultaneously; hence specific bunch patterns have to be kicked to other beam-lines. To use e.g. one bunch out of the bunch train very short kicking durations have to be realized. The variability of the bunch pattern and the frequency resp. switching time are one of the main arguments for a stripline-kicker combined with HV-switches as basic concept. A nearly homogenous field in the kicker has to be realized for uniform deflection of the electron bunch and emittance grow of the bunch has to be kept as low as possible. Furthermore the fast switching ability of the kicker demands for a fast decay of the HV-pulse resp. its reflections in the structure implying a specific design of the kicker elements. For this reason a design with two tapered active electrodes and two ground fenders was optimized in time and frequency domain with the software package CST. Additionally a first prototype was manufactured for laboratory and first beam-line tests.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupab033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupab033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupab033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPAB033,

This problem is especially serious for in-vacuum undulators; in which the girders are located inside the vacuum chamber. We have proposed a new concept called a phase-combined undulator; which has intrinsically no magnetic force*. In this undulator; the magnetic forces acting on the girders locally head to the longitudinal axis instead of the attractive direction; and are actually canceled out in total. Numerical calculations have shown that the attractive force will be reduced down to a negligible level. Recently; we performed a proof-of-principle experiment to examine the feasibility of this undulator concept in terms of the force between the girders and magnetic field distribution; which will be reported in the conference.; * R.

KEK-LS's undulators can produce extremely high brightness light ranging from VUV to X-ray. Brightness of undulator light strongly depends on the phase error of its periodic magnetic field. Then a precise magnetic field adjustment is required in order to prevent the reduction of the brightness performance. Generally; the adjustment is performed by the conventional field measurement system equipped with hole-probes on a huge stone table. But; for the in-vacuum undulator; the measurement must be performed without the vacuum chamber. The additional phase error caused by reattaching the chamber is not negligible for the low emittance rings. Therefore; some groups have developed measurement systems available for the direct field measurement inside the chamber**; ***. We have started to develop a compact measurement system.

Velocity bunching technique is able to compress the bunch at relatively low energy; which presents peculiar challenges when approaching a very high current and a low transverse emittance in photoinjectors. A brake-applied velocity bunching scheme was proposed; so that the transverse emittance of the beam could be almost compensated even if the compression factor was extremely high. By adding a magnetic compressor; one could obtain a shorter beam and achieve the coherent synchrotron radiation in THz range. Meanwhile; when making the final compressed beam collide with the laser; one could acquire high energy X-ray pulses. This opens the possibility for some interesting combinations of pump-and-probe experiments.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupab077_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupab077.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupab077_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPAB077,

Both on-axis swap out; on-axis longitudinal accumulation and off-axis single multipole kicker injection are considered. For on-axis fast kicker injection; basic parameters of the system are given. Layout of kickers and septums are presented. For off-axis multipole injection; non-linear kickers (NLK) draw much attention in recent years; various studies have been carried out in many laboratories. But it suffered from low injection efficiency and has not been used in routine operation.

The location of the aligned parts should not be changed in order to ensure that the electron beam parameters of PAL-XFEL remain stable and can be operated without any problems. As time goes by; however; the ground goes through uplift and subsidence; which consequently deforms building floors. The deformation of the ground and buildings changes the location of several devices including magnets and RF accelerator tubes; which eventually leads to the alignment errors. Once alignment errors occur with regard to these parts; the electron beam deviates from its course and beam parameters change accordingly. PAL-XFEL has installed the Hydrostatic Leveling System to measure and record the vertical change of buildings and ground consistently and systematically and the Wire Position System to measure the two dimensional changes of girders.

The gun is powered by a C-band (5.712 GHz) modulator-klystron system; identical to those of SwissFEL. The input coupler is a simple double feed coupler and it has been designed to increase the electric field enhancement at the cathode surface to improve the emittance.

Orbit reproducibility and stability are critical for the quality of user experiments. Ambient temperature variations and earth tides can cause a change in circumference; changing in turn the beam energy; and orbit drift. Therefore both; orbit correction and rf frequency adjustments are necessary to keep the ring circumference constant. A Fast Orbit Feedback (FOFB) system combined with rf frequency correction deduced from the fast corrector strengths is applied to the FOFB routine.

To achieve high quality experimental results; it is important to minimize beam motion. During the installation of insertion devices and front-ends; the beam motion around 60 Hz became significant. The response matrix together with singular value decomposition was used to identify the transmitter of the superconducting radio frequency system as the source for the 60 Hz perturbations. This was subsequently corrected by rerouting the grounding of the mains in the transmitters. Yet; the 60Hz orbit fluctuation became even more serious after the next shutdown. A serious of experiments are performed to dig out that the beam was disturbed by the magnetic field from newly installed fan motors. Shielding the fans with mu-metal and increasing the distance between fan and beam pipe drastically reduced the leakage field and greatly increased beam stability. These errors could be prevented at the design stage in the ideal case. However; these errors happened finally and need to be dug out and eliminated. The method and experiences are summarized in this report.

Reducing emittance in an accelerator driving a Free Electron Laser (FEL) delivers significant reduction in the saturation length for an x-ray FEL; reducing machine cost and increasing x-ray beam brightness. There are many parameters which affect the intrinsic emittance of a photocathode. Surface roughness is a significant factor*; and consequently the development of techniques to manufacture low roughness photocathodes with optimum emission properties is a priority for the electron source community.

Optimizations of the transverse projected emittance as a function of bunch charge are presented and discussed in terms of the scaling laws derived in the charge saturation limit. Additionally; optimization of the transverse coherence length as a function of final rms bunch length at the sample location have been performed.

Improvements in electron source brightness can be achieved by increasing electric fields on the cathode of photo-emitted electron guns. Recent developments in pulsed RF accelerator structures show that very high gradient fields can be sustained with low breakdown rates by operating at cryo-temperatures; which when applied to photoguns will lead to a large increase in the electron beam brightness. In particular; our simulations show that when operating with a peak gradient field of 240 MV/m on the cathode of an S-band; electron beam brightness of 80~nC/(mm· mrad)2/mm can be achieved with 100~pC bunches. In this paper; we present the design and optimization of an 1.x cell S-Band RF photoinjector; where the x varies from 4-6.

Determining Local Shielding Containment for LCLS-II,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Containment of beam losses by halo and momentum/energy collimators is a well-established practice for normal operation of particle accelerators where tracking codes are applied. However; for exceptional events; such as magnet power failures; severe lattice mis-match; etc.; ad-hoc analytical approaches are typically applied. Oftentimes those simplified methods are not automatic; they don't define the full phase-space of mis-steered trajectories and cannot keep up with beam-line upgrades. Moreover; there may exist a disconnect between the teams analyzing consequences of errant beams and those involved in beam-line design. With electron beams exceeding 100 kW; design of LCLS-II at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory required exhaustive beam-containment studies to avoid potential destruction of components and excessive dose rates. The geometry of the different beam-lines and the nominal optics was built with MadFLUKA [1]; and FLUKA [2] Monte Carlo code along with perturbations to magnetic fields was used to inspect failures compatible with beam operations and hardware settings.

RF power is coupled into the cavity through inline circular waveguide using a demountable TM01 mode launcher. The mode launcher feeds the power through 4 ports distributed azimuthally to eliminate both dipole and quadrupole field distortions.

The laser pulse of required length will be produced with the stacking of multiple few picosecond long sub-pulses. Depending on the choice of the laser sub-pulse length and on the relative delay between these sub-pulses one can obtain laser pulse with various longitudinal intensity modulations. The longitudinal modulation of laser intensity creates longitudinal modulation of electron bunch charge. Such modulation is known to cause the growth of e-beam uncorrelated energy spread in photoinjectors - the effect we would like to avoid.

With a triangular-shaped driver beam electron energies of up to 5 GeV from a few centimeters of plasma can be anticipated.

A plasma accelerator combining both schemes consists of a LWFA providing an electron beam which subsequently drives a PWFA in the highly nonlinear regime. This scenario explicitly makes use of the advantages unique to each method; particularly exploiting the capabilities of PWFA schemes to provide high-brightness beams; while the LWFA stage inherently fulfils the demand for compact high-current electron bunches required as PWFA drivers. Effectively; the sub-sequent PWFA stage operates as beam brightness and energy booster of the initial LWFA output; aiming to match the demanding beam quality requirements of accelerator based light sources. We report on numerical studies towards the implementation of a proof-of-principle experiment at the DRACO laser facility at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK010,

Among other reasons this is due to the increased control over the electron beam parameters and overall experimental setup when compared to other plasma schemes; such as controlled self-injection. At the future SINBAD (Short INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility at DESY this technique is planned to be tested experimentally through injection and acceleration of a sub-femtosecond electron beam; produced from a conventional RF-injector; with a charge of around 0.7 pC and initial mean energy of 100 MeV at the plasma entrance. A summary of optimisation steps for the potential experimental setup is presented in this paper; including considerations regarding effects of electron beam self-fields and matching of the beam into the plasma stage.

A key aspect of this type of acceleration is the ratio between the accelerating fields experienced by a witness beam and the decelerating fields experienced by the drive beam; called the transformer ratio. As for longitudinally symmetrical bunches this ratio is limited by the fundamental theorem of beamloading to 2 in the linear regime*; a transformer ratio above this limit is considered high. This can be reached by using a modulated drive bunch or a shaped train of drive bunches. So far; only the latter case has been shown for wakefields in a RF-structure**.

To explore the possibility of implementing PWFA at SXFEL; we performed 3D PIC simulations using shaped electron beam parameters obtained by start-to-end beam line simulations [2]. The PIC simulations show that an average transformer ratio around 4 can be maintained for about 10 cm long low density plasma; and the energy gain of the trailing bunch eventually reaches 5.9 GeV. Simulations and analysis are also performed to check the effects of transverse beam size on HTR acceleration.

The facility is located in the former CNGS area at CERN and will include a proton; laser and electron beam line merging in a 10 m long plasma cell; which is followed by the experimental diagnostics. In the first phase of the AWAKE physics program; which started at the end of 2016; the effect of the plasma on a high energy proton beam will be studied. A proton bunch is expected to experience the so called self-modulation instability; which leads to the creation of micro-bunches within the long proton bunch. The plasma channel is created in a rubidium vapor via field ionization by a TW laser pulse. This laser beam has to overlap with the proton beam over the full length of the plasma cell; resulting in tight requirements for the stability of the proton beam at the plasma cell in the order of ~ 0.1 mm. In this paper the beam commissioning results of the ~810 m long transfer line for proton bunches with 3·1011 protons/bunch and a momentum of 400 GeV/c will be presented with a focus on the challenges of the parallel operation of the laser and proton beam.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK032,

During bombarding of the Tungsten or Uranium targets the electron beam generates the original neutrons that are multiplied in the facility core of low enriched uranium trough the fission process. The maximal value of the neutron multiplication factor is 0.98. So the total neutron flux output is increased as much as 50 times and is 2·10 13 n·cm-2·c-1. The subcriticality of the system eliminates the possibility of self-sustained chain reaction existence that increases the nuclear safety of the facility drastically. The neutron source mentioned above is the first facility of such type in the world.

In an internal target type ring; protons are repeatedly passed through a thin foil; producing neutrons and other secondary particles. This technique has the potential to produce higher secondary particle fluxes with modest beam currents and energies. Scattering of the protons causes emittance growth in the beam; but this can be partially offset by energy lost through ionisation of the foil; which causes ionisation cooling. The resultant beams typically have large position and momentum spread; with transverse emittances of order mm. In this paper; the design of a solenoid-focussing ring is studied which may enable containment of large emittance beams.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK035,

We propose the use of a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) as an injector for compact electron storage rings to produce synchrotron radiation. In particular; we study the injection of 0.7 GeV and 3 GeV electrons into the DIAMOND storage ring and consider implications for future storage ring design. Whilst laser-based acceleration is well-known as a driver for future electron-positron colliders and future free-electron lasers; here we propose it is also advantageous to provide electrons for 3rd-generation storage rings. The electron beams produced by LWFAs have a naturally very small emittance around 1 nm and moderate energy spread of a few percent. Combining these beam parameters with the compact size of a LWFA makes them highly favourable compared to traditional linac or booster synchrotron injector chains.chains.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik036_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik036.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik036_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK036,

Using DPMJET-III to model 50 TeV proton-proton collisions; tracking studies have been performed with PTC and MERLIN in order to gauge the elastic and inelastic proton cross-talk. High arc losses; particularly in the dispersion suppressor regions; have been revealed. These losses originate mainly from particles with a momentum deviation; either from interaction with a primary collimator in the betatron cleaning insertion; or from the proton-proton collisions. This issue can be mitigated by introducing additional collimators in the dispersion suppressor region.

The contrast required by some users between the population of the main and empty buckets is 1011. In order to obtain these empty buckets some RF knock out (cleaning) of the parasitic bunches is needed. Until now this cleaning was performed on the beam stored in the storage ring. Recently we have started to deliver this 16 bunches filling in a so called top up mode; drastically increasing the rate of the storage ring refills. In this top up mode it is very penalizing to perform the cleaning in the storage ring so we are now performing it in the booster synchrotron which accelerates the 200MeV beam coming from the linac up to 6GeV. We describe the set up used to perform the cleaning in the booster and all the measurement and experiments performed in order to correctly understand the origin of the unwanted electrons populating buckets of the gaps separating the 16 main bunches.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK041,

The achievement of these demanding goals depends significantly on the performance of the electron source; a superconducting RF (SRF) photoinjector. A critical component for the quality of the generated beam is the superconducting solenoid magnet. In order to optimize its operation and minimize parasitic contributions; special attention has been given to the precise alignment of this element using a hexapod mover. Due to the strict limitations inside a cryostat; a complex coupling between the solenoid in vacuum and the hexapod in air has been realized; requiring sophisticated software and hardware mechanisms to prevent collisions.

Inside the enclosure and in transversal direction neutron and gamma radiation is of the same order of magnitude but high energy neutrons are much more penetrating. This causes outside the shielding neutron spectra with two broad maxima at about 1 MeV and 100 MeV. Standard Anderson-Braun or Leake neutron monitors measure thermalized neutrons in a proportional counter tube by nuclear reactions which limits the measurement range to neutron energies < 10 MeV. This implies two considerable systematic errors: Pulsed neutron beams causes dead-time losses due to the time structure of injections and the moderators are not sufficient to moderate high energy neutrons down to thermal energies. We determined and fixed these measurement errors by faster preamplifiers and by a more effective moderator developed by us; which expands the measurement range up to several GeV. Examples of the application at BESSY are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK043,

An alternative approach implementing the FIR filter as a derivative estimator controller is simulated and tested. This approach shares the same controller topology and can therefore be easily integrated in the system. It exploits the fact that the sampling rate of the feedback hardware is considerably higher than the frequency of the beam oscillations.

Since these FELs work with superconducting accelerators in pulsed mode; also the corresponding normal-conducting RF gun has to operate with long RF pulses. Generating high beam quality from the photo-cathode RF gun in addition requires a high accelerating gradient at the cathode. Therefore; the RF gun has to ensure stable and reliable operation at high average RF power; e.g. 6.5 MW peak power in the gun for 650 μs RF pulse length and 10 Hz repetition rate for the European XFEL. Several RF gun setups have been operated towards these goals over the last years. The latest gun setup is in operation since March 2016 and includes RF Gun 4.6 with an improved contact spring design. The RF input distribution consists of a coaxial coupler; a T-combiner and 2 RF windows from DESY production. In this contribution we will present statistics on the high average power operation and results from the characterization of the produced electron beam.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK051,
ipac2017,,TUPIK052,Fast Automatic Ramping of High Average Power Guns,DESY Zeuthen; Zeuthen; Germany; M.K. Grecki; O. Hensler; S. Pfeiffer; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; The electron guns at PITZ; FLASH and European XFEL are standing wave structures which operate at high average power (>40 kW) to produce long trains of high quality beams. This amount of power heats the cavity surface enough to change signi'cantly the gun resonance frequency. As consequence; to keep the re'ection low; the RF power ramp must be enough slow to permit the water cooling system to keep the gun temperature close to the set-point. Also; as the temperature probe sits close to the surface of the iris; the required gun temperature set-point to maintain the gun on resonance is a function of the average power. The RF power ramping is a difficult process in which temperature and re'ection must be monitored to adjust accordingly the temperature set-point and the ramping speed of the RF power. An automatic software to adjust the RF frequency and the temperature set-point of the PITZ gun in parallel to the RF power ramping has been developed. The use of this software has signi'cantly reduced the time spent to start up the gun or to recover from interlocks; increasing the time spent at nominal parameters which would also be very important for user facilities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK052,

The work is also intended to satisfy regulatory requirements. So far; for the MCR; we have completed a concept design. User requirements clarification involved interviews with stakeholders and visits to similar facilities. Concept design for the MCR was iterative and involved a user reference-group set up for the project. During several workshops; alternatives for layout and workstations were discussed and modeled using 3D graphics. The chosen concept design and 3D model were then checked against standards. The resulting design was approved by the user-group and now goes forward to detailed design and realization. We have also completed detailed design of the LCR so that it is available for commissioning before the MCR is built.

Two steps of alignment are concerned: the fiducialisation; i.e. the determination of the reference axis of components w.r.t alignment targets; and the initial alignment of components on a common support assembly. The main accelerator components considered for the study are quadrupoles; 15 GHz BPM and RF structures from the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) project. Different methods have been developed to determine the reference axis of these components with a micrometric accuracy; as well as to determine the position of this reference axis in the coordinate frame of the common support assembly. The tools and methods developed have been validated with success on dedicated test setups using CLIC components.

ESS will use a 4-ton; helium-cooled; rotating tungsten target for this purpose; and its protection and availability is paramount to the success of ESS. High demands are placed on all of the target equipment; including cooling; movement; rotation; and timing; in order to reach the facility-wide 95% availability goal for neutron production. Machine protection has defined a set of protection functions that are to be implemented for the target system. This paper describes the development of these protection functions through the use of classic HAZOPs combined with modern safety standard lifecycle management. The implementation of these functions is carried out through close collaboration between the target system owners and the machine protection group at ESS.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik078_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik078.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik078_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK078,

The aim is to construct a machine that allows for 95% availability for neutron beam production. This goal requires a robust protection system that allows for high availability by continuously monitoring and acting on the machine states; in order to avoid long facility downtimes and optimize the operation at any stage. The normal conducting section consists of the first 48 meters of the machine; and performs the initial acceleration; bunching; steering; and focusing of the beam; which sets it up for optimal transition into the superconducting section. Through a fit-for-purpose risk management process; a set of protection functions has been identified. The risk identification; analysis; and treatment were done in compliance with modern safety and ISO standards. This ensures that the risks; in this case downtime and equipment damage; are properly prevented and mitigated.

The unavoidable beam loss intrinsic to the extraction process activates the extraction region and its equipment. Although the radiation dose to equipment has an impact on availability; the cool-down times required to limit dose to the personnel carrying-out maintenance of the accelerator also pose important restrictions; and ultimately limit the number of protons on target. In order to understand how the extracted proton flux affects the build-up and subsequent cool-down of the induced activation; a model based on a simple empirical relationship has been developed and shown to predict the measured radioactive decay at ionisation chambers located along the extraction region. In this contribution; the empirical model is described; its strengths and limitations discussed; and its application as a predictive tool for estimating cool-down times as a function of extracted proton flux demonstrated.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik086_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik086.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik086_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK086,

In the unlikely event of an asynchronous beam dump; not all particles would be extracted immediately. They would still take one turn around the ring; oscillating with potentially high amplitudes. In case the beam would hit one of the experimental detectors or the collimators close to the interaction points; severe damage could occur. In order to minimize the risk during such a scenario; a new interlock system was put in place in 2016. This system guarantees a phase advance of zero degrees (within tolerances) between the extraction kicker and the interaction point. This contribution describes the motivation for this new system as well as the technical implementation and the strategies used to derive appropriate tolerances to allow sufficient protection without risking false beam dump triggers.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik087_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik087.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik087_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK087,

Statistics on the injection and beam availability in 2015 showed that too much time is spent at injection. Reducing this time could improve LHC availability and luminosity over the year. Currently; useful data to diagnose the problems is sparse and shown in different applications. Operators time is wasted in debugging and checking for the source of the problem before trying another injection. A new Software application for diagnostics of the LHC Filling is under development which collects data from multiple inputs of the CERN Control System and concentrates them in one central view. The inputs are processed and matched with a set of rules (or assertions) that need to be fulfilled for an injection to be successful. Whenever a problem occurs; the operator can check the Filling Diagnostic for hints on what is the source of the problem during the injection. Filling Diagnostic also produces statistics of the LHC injections and the causes of failed injections; this will allow significantly better analysis of the LHC performance for next year.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik088_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik088.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik088_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK088,

We develop an analytical model of the signal processing chain to explore the impact of even-symmetric and odd-symmetric intra-bunch movements on the detected beam position as a function of the longitudinal bunch shape.

In this approach the beam is excited and subsequent beam oscillations are recorded. Given that any number of pick-ups can be evaluated at once with only a marginal increase of transverse beam size this method is suitable for regular health checks of a transverse feedback system; e.g.; for every injection.

The powering of the BSW requires high precision 3.4 kA to 6.7 kA trapezoidal current pulses with 2 ms flat-top and 5 ms ramp-up and ramp-down time. The tracking error must remain within ± 50 parts-per-million (ppm) during the flat-top of the trapezoidal reference; and ± 500 ppm during the ramp-down. The BSW is powered with a four quadrant switch-mode power converter and the current through the magnet is controlled in closed-loop form with a 2-degree-of-freedom controller at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. A convex optimization algorithm is performed for obtaining the controller parameters. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by designing the controller for a full-scale prototype of the BSW system at CERN; which is in the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik096_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik096.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik096_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK096,

Even the natural motion of the ground could misalign the quadrupole magnets to such an extent that the resulting dipole kicks would require compensation. The novel technique described in this paper uses seismometers to measure the positions of the quadrupole magnets in real time and a kicker to counteract the effect of their misalignment. The prototype system deployed at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK in Japan has already demonstrated a reduction in the pulse-to-pulse vertical position jitter of the beam by about 10%. Based on the observed correlation of the beam position to the quadrupole positions the maximum possible jitter reduction from such a system is estimated to be about 25%.

The beam-based correction includes one-to-one and dispersion-free steering; then a global correction using tuning bumps is applied to reduce the final emittance and mitigate the effects of coupling. The results showed that the emittance growth budgets can be met both in the horizontal and vertical planes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik099_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik099.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik099_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK099,

A solenoid with iron shield can be used to provide the required axis-symmetric magnetic field to balance the radial space-charge force of the beam. However; the iron shield cannot be perfectly symmetric because openings are reserved for feeding water pipes and electrical cables to the coils. In addition; alignment errors of the solenoid may also spoil the symmetry of the focusing field. In this study; simulation is carried out to investigate how does the non-axisymmetric solenoid field of different origins influence beam properties; such as beam size; transverse emittance during the rf bunch compression.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik104_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik104.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik104_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK104,

Conventional approaches to reliability (e.g. RBDs) struggle due to a lack of data about specific component/system reliability and failure. There is a large body of beam current data retrievable from operating accelerators that contains detailed information about the accelerator behaviour; both before and after a machine trip has occurred. Analysing this data could provide insight and help develop a new approach to address accelerator reliability. In this paper; we propose a data-driven approach to detecting emergent behaviour in particle accelerators. Instead of attempting to identify every possible failure of a machine we propose an alternative approach based around a change in perspective; to knowing the normal default operational behaviour of a machine. Taking action when a ghost in the machine emerges that causes accelerator wide aberrant changes to normal machine behaviour.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupik109_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupik109.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupik109_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPIK109,

This system has now been enhanced through the use of position information from two cavity beam position monitors (BPMs) to enable beam stabilisation at a third; intermediate location where a witness BPM measures the correction. Low-Q cavity BPMs were used; along with custom signal processing electronics designed for low latency and optimal position resolution. A custom stripline kicker; power amplifier and digital feedback board were used to provide beam correction and feedback control. The system was tested in single-pass; multi-bunch mode with the aim of providing inter-bunch beam stabilisation on electron bunches of charge ~1 nC separated in time by 280 ns. In 2015 a single BPM feedback system demonstrated beam stabilisation to below 75 nm. To date the two BPM input feedback system has demonstrated beam stabilisation to 83 ± 6 nm.

This was achieved while running steadily with a peak luminosity above the design target of 1034 cm- 2s−1.

A reduction of the batch spacing can be directly used to increase luminosity without detrimental effects on beam stability; and with no increase in the number of events per crossing seen by the experiments. Measurements and simulations were performed in SPS and LHC to understand if a shorter injection kicker rise time and associated tighter batch spacing would lead to increased injection oscillations of the first and last bunches of a bunch train and eventually also a systematic growth of the transverse emittance. The results were used to define the minimum possible batch spacing for an acceptable emittance growth in LHC; with gains of reductions of about 10% possible in both machines.

However the diversity of the physics and their respective capabilities led them to request very different operating conditions; in terms of collision energy; luminosity and pile-up. These appeared mutually incompatible within the available one month of operation. Nevertheless; a plan to satisfy most requirements was developed and implemented successfully. It exploited different beam lifetimes at two beam energies of 4 Z TeV and 6.5 Z TeV; a variety of luminosity sharing and bunch filling schemes; and varying beam directions. The outcome of this very complex strategy for repeated re-commissioning and operation of the LHC included the longest ever LHC fill with luminosity levelled for almost 38 h.

Exposed electronics and accelerator components show dose dependent accelerated aging effects and stochastic Single Event Effects which can lead to faults and downtime of the LHC. In order to achieve an optimal life duration; the position of the equipment is chosen in dependency of the amplitude of the radiation fields. Therefore; it is crucial to monitor the prompt dose distributions along the whole LHC. By using the LHC beam loss monitor and RadMon systems; the prompt dose during the accelerator operation is continuously monitored. Measurements in the long straight sections and the dispersion suppressors in IR1 (ATLAS) and in IR5 (CMS) have shown that the radiation levels have localised maxima which exceed the base line by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. The analysis of these radiation peaks will be presented and the underlying loss mechanisms will be discussed. The results will help to identify areas not suitable for radiation sensitive electronics.

With this beam configuration electron clouds develop in a large fraction of the beam chambers; in spite of a very large electron dose accumulated on the surfaces. This posed several challenges to different aspects of the beam operation. In particular; the machine settings had to be optimized in order to mitigate coherent and incoherent effects of the electron cloud on the beam dynamics while a specifically designed feed-forward control had to be implemented and optimized in order to dynamically adapt the regulations of the cryogenic system to the strong heat load deposited by the electron cloud on the beam screens of the cryogenic magnets.

Peak power density values are lower than 3mW/cm3 and 1mW/cm3 in the triplet and matching section respectively. Total heat loads in magnets; collimators; masks and absorbers were also estimated; along with dose and particle fluence maps relevant for Radiation to Electronics (R2E) aspects.

This will allow extending the levelling time resulting in an increased production of integrated luminosity. Based on the availability of the LHC during 2016 operation; the expected yearly-integrated luminosity of the future HL-LHC was estimated using a Monte Carlo model. Crab cavity faults were added to the observed failure distribu-tions and their impact on integrated luminosity produc-tion as a function of fault time and fault frequency was studied. This allows identifying a breakeven point in luminosity production and defining minimum system availability requirements for the crab cavities to reach the design goal of 250 fb-1 of integrated luminosity per year.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva022.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva022_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA022,

In the presence of diffusive mechanisms; caused by resonance excitations or noise; the SD can be reduced due to the modification of the particle distribution inside the beam. This effect can lead to a possible lack of Landau damping of the coherent modes previously damped by lying within the unperturbed SD area. The limitations deriving from coherent instabilities in the LHC is crucial in view of future projects that aim to increase the performance of the LHC such as the High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Simulation tools for the computation of the SD have been extended in order to take into account the incoherent effects from long tracking through the detailed model of the accelerator machine.

During luminosity production the LHC experiments record the beam-gas interactions using dedicated background monitors. These data are sent to the LHC control system and are used to monitor the background levels at the experiments during accelerator operation.

In addition; simulated growth rates are compared with measured emittance evolution at injection; which shows better agreement in longitudinal than transverse dimension.

The new 255 GeV store lattice was designed to both accommodate the necessary phase advance between the e-lens and IP8 for testing and to maximize dynamic aperture.

In order to reach ultimate heavy ion intensities; medium charge state heavy ions are used. The cross sections for charge exchange in collisions with residual gas molecules for such beams are much higher; than for highly charged heavy ion beams. Therefore high pumping power is required to obtain a very low static residual gas pressure and to suppress vacuum dynamics during operation. In modern heavy ion synchrotrons different techniques are employed: NEG-coating; cryogenic pumping; and low-desorption ion-catcher. The unique StrahlSim code allows the comparison of different design options for heavy ion synchrotrons. Different aspects of dynamic vacuum limitations are summarized; such as the dependence on different injection parameter.

The requested intensities require filling the existing synchrotron SIS18; which serves as injector to FAIR; up to the space charge (SC) limit. Operation under these conditions is challenging due to the large tune footprint of the beam; demanding delicate control of adverse effects caused by machine imperfections to avoid emittance growth and beam loss. To facilitate the high intensity operation; the installation of an electron lens for SC compensation into SIS18 is foreseen. This requires an electron beam of a current of several amperes with longitudinal and transverse distributions matched to those of the ion beam during the cycle. The electron beam needs to be RF modulated at a bandwidth of a few MHz with time varying amplitude ranging from DC to fully modulated; while the transverse size needs to be continuously adapted to the adiabatically shrinking ion beam.

In 2014 HADES used a secondary pion beam produced by interaction between high-intensity nitrogen primary beam and a beryllium target. In these conditions beam losses; generated by slow extraction and beam transport to the experimental area; led to activation of the beam line elements and triggered radiation alarms. The primary beam intensity had to be reduced and the beam optics modified in order to keep radiation levels within the allowed limits. Similar beam conditions are requested by HADES experiment for upcoming run in 2018 and in the following years. Therefore; a number of measures have been proposed to improve beam transmission and quality.

A critical passage for the beam quality and especially for the emittance is the injector. Therefore; a new injector design with improved beam dynamics has been developed; featuring low emittance growth rates while using only room temperature structures. The previous design consisted of a 4-Rod RFQ; 7 room temperature and 5 superconducting CH-DTL cavities and 2 rebuncher cavities; whereas the superconducting cavities in the new design have been replaced by 8 room temperature CHs and an additional rebuncher. The main challenge during the development is achieving the required reliability to reduce the thermal stress inside the planned reactor.

As part of FRANZ a 175 MHz room temperature 5-gap CH DTL cavity was designed and built. Its main task will be focusing the particle bunch longitudinally at 2 MeV particle energy. Furthermore the CH cavity can also be used to increase the energy as well as decrease it by 0.2 MeV. The rebuncher and its cooling system is optimized to work with a 5 kW amplifier. The amplification system is intended to provide continuous power (cw mode). Due to its operating parameters being nearly identical to the requirements of the MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) Project; experience for future cavity designs was gained.

Zhang; H. Podlech: NEW REFERENCE DESIGN OF THE EUROPEAN ADS RFQ ACCELERATOR FOR MYRRHA. In Proceedings of IPAC'14; 3223-3225 (2014),,The MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) Project is planned as an accelerator driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of long-living radioactive waste. For this project a cw 4-Rod-RFQ with 176 MHz and a total length of about 4 m is required. It is supposed to accelerate protons from 30 keV up to 1.5 MeV*. One of the main tasks during the development of the RFQ is the very high reliability of the accelerator to limit the thermal stress inside the reactor. Another challenge was to compensate the dipole component of the MYRRHA-RFQ which is due to the design principle of 4-Rod-RFQs. This dipole component is responsible for shifting the ideal beam axis from the geometrical center of the quadrupole downwards. Design studies with CST MICROWAVE STUDIO have shown that the dipole component can be almost completely compensated by widening the stems alternately so that the current paths of the lower electrodes are increased. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva070_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva070.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva070_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA070,

As first RF structure a 176 MHz 4-Rod RFQ has been chosen because of tuning possibilities; maintenance; lower capital costs and technological risk compared to a 4-Vane-RFQ. The aim of beam dynamics design was to preserve excellent beam quality and to avoid the creation of halo particles especially in the longitudinal plane. Using the NFSP (New Four-Section Procedure) with a soft and symmetric pre-bunching with full 360° acceptance it was possible to reach the requirements. The simulated transmission of the 4 m long RFQ is close to 100%. The electrode voltage has been chosen to 44 kV which gives enough transverse focusing but limits the required RF losses to about 25 kW/m. The cooling has been optimized for reliable operation and a new method of dipole compensation has been applied. The RFQ has been built and tuned with respect to field flatness.

This paper describes the conceptual design of a rt front-end up to an energy of 5 AMeV appropriate as initial element of the EIC hadron linac.

The basic principle of polarimetry is the scattering of a polarized beam on a carbon target. Since the number of particles in one fill is limited; we must maximize the utility of the beam. This raises the question of sampling efficiency; as the signal; being an oscillating function; varies in informational content. To address it; we define a numerical measurement model; and compare two sampling strategies (uniform and frequency-modulated) in terms of beam-use efficiency. The upshot is the formulation of the conditions necessary for the effective use of the modulated sampling strategy; and the evaluation of its advantage over the uniform strategy. The simulation results are also used to compare two competing analytical models for the standard error of the frequency estimate.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva079_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva079.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva079_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA079,

These experiments use polarized deuteron beams at momenta below 1 GeV/c; that are stored for several minutes. In order to increase the spin coherence time; beam cooling is necessary. Electron cooling is applied to pre-cool the beam; but the solenoids of the electron cooler may not be perfectly compensated. Thus; stochastic cooling would be desirable instead. Unfortunately; the existing stochastic cooling system is not sensitive at low beam velocities. This paper presents newly developed stochastic cooling pickups and kickers for a system dedicated to low beam velocities of approximately 0.5c. The design is based on the slot-ring type pickups that have been developed for the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR); but optimized for low particle velocities and a low frequency band of 350-700 MHz. Since the structures get much bigger in comparison to the HESR version; mechanical properties must be reconsidered and a trade-off between electrical properties; cooling performance and constructability must be found.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva080_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva080.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva080_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA080,

Thus; a large fraction of our effort has been concentrated on reducing and managing beam losses. However the high residual activation is appeared around the stripper foils. It is caused by not primary particles due to the beam losses but secondary particles due to nuclear reaction at the foil. This radio-activation is an intrinsically serious problem for the RCS which adopts the charge exchange multi-turn beam injection scheme with the stripper foil. In this presentation; we report a detail measurement of the residual dose around the stripper foil together with the cause estimated based on simulation studies.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva093_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva093.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva093_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA093,

One of the main reasons is that the irradiation damage to electrode surface; caused by beam losses; influences RF performance of RFQ cavity. This is especially serious for high-current RFQ. By simulation and irradiation experiments; proton irradiation damage to copper target has been studied. The simulation results showed that normally incident proton beams with input energy lower than 1 MeV damage the copper surface in the range of one skin depth at 162.5 MHz; which indicated that almost all the lost beams with small incident angles impact RF performance of RFQ cavity. By the irradiation experiments; the damage within 60 nm depth from surface was proved to have a greater impact on surface finish. The conclusion is that low energy beam losses also need to be kept as low as possible to prolong the life of the RFQ electrodes; especially in high-current RFQ design.,Funding: the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB845503),reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva102_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva102.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva102_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA102,

Both beam losses and emittance growth could be mitigated by compensat-ing the non-linear LRBB kick with a correctly placed current carrying wire. Such a compensation scheme is currently being studied in the LHC through a demonstration test using current-bearing wires embedded into col-limator jaws; installed either side of the high luminosity interaction regions. For HL-LHC two options are considered; a current-bearing wire as for the demonstrator; or electron lenses; as the ideal distance between the particle beam and compensating current may be too small to allow the use of solid materials. This paper reports on the ongoing activities for both options; covering the progress of the wire-in-jaw collimators; the foreseen LRBB experiments at the LHC; and first considerations for the design of the electron lenses to ultimately replace material wires for HL-LHC.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva115_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva115.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva115_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA115,

Thus; the energy efficiency of grid to beam power conversion is particularly important for the overall power consumption of such facilities. In this study; we analyse the energy efficiency of PSI's cyclotron-based HIPA facility; which presently delivers a maximum of 1.4 MW beam power. The total power consumption of the entire facility is 12.5 MW at 2.2 mA beam current (1.3 MW). Main power consumers are: RF systems; electromagnets; water cooling and auxiliary systems including infrastructure; each consuming 5.3 MW; 3.6 MW; 1.65 MW and 1.95 MW; respectively. HIPA's grid to beam efficiency is 18.3% when considering only those parts of any subsystems (RF components; magnets; cooling; and auxiliary systems); which are minimally required to produce a full 1.3 MW beam.

Radioisotopes have a wide range of uses in medicine; and recent disruption to the supply chain has seen a renewed effort to find alternative isotopes and production methods. The FFAG design features separate sector magnets with non-scaling; non-linear field gradients which are optimized with magnet geometry to achieve isochronisity at the level of 0.3%; sufficient for Continuous Wave (CW) operation. Simulations have demonstrated that beam currents of up to 10mA can comfortably be achieved with this design. To further improve production efficiency a thin internal target; where the beam passes through the target and is recirculated; may be used. This setup ensures that production takes place within a narrow energy range; potentially increasing production rates and reducing impurities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva133_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva133.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva133_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA133,

This will significantly enhance the beam quality and enable new experiments. To fully exploit the discovery potential of this facility; advances are urgently required in numerical tools that can adequately model beam transport; life time and interaction; beam diagnostics tools and detectors to characterize the beam's properties; as well as in novel experiments that exploit the enhanced beam quality that ELENA will provide.

In order to achieve this; we use a method based upon the theory of sloppy models.** We use a model of the accelerator to create the Hessian matrix which encodes the effects of various corrector magnets on the vertical emittance. A singular value decomposition of this matrix yields the magnet combinations which have the greatest effect on the emittance. We can then adjust these magnet ‘‘knobs'' sequentially in order to decrease the dispersion and the emittance. We present here comparisons of the effectiveness of this procedure in both experiment and simulation using a variety of CESR lattices. We also discuss techniques to minimize changes to parameters we have already corrected.; * J. Shanks; D.L. Rubin; and D. Sagan; Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 17; 044003 (2014). ** K.S. Brown and J.P.

Typical tolerable fractional beam loss in the 100-MeV beamline is approximately 4 x10-3. During 2015-2016 operation cycle; several improvements were made to minimize the beam losses. Adjustments to the ion source's extraction voltage resulted in the removal of tails in phase space. Beam based steering in low-energy and high-energy beamlines led to the reduction of beam emittance growth. Readjustment of the 100-MeV quadrupole transport resulted in the elimination of excessive beam envelope oscillations and removed significant parts of the beam halo at the target. Careful beam matching in the drift tube linac (DTL) provided high beam capture (75% - 80%) and minimized beam emittance growth in the DTL. After improvements; beam losses in the 100-MeV beamline were reduced by an order of magnitude and reached the fractional level of 5 x10-4.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/tupva143_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/tupva143.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/tupva143_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-TUPVA143,

This will be accomplished by increasing the beam energy to 1.3 GeV and the beam current to 38 mA (average during the macro-pulse). Installation of 28 additional superconducting cavities and their associated technical systems will provide for the energy increase. Increased beam loading throughout the accelerator will be accommodated primarily through the use of existing margin in the RF systems and the installation of 700 kW klystrons to power the new superconducting cavities. Upgrades of a few existing RF stations may also be needed. The injection and extraction regions of the accumulator ring will be upgraded; a ring to second target station tunnel stub will be constructed; and a 2 MW target will be developed for the first target station.

The optics was corrected close to the design values. However; some minor adjustments are still needed. The commissioning of the Solaris 1.5 GeV storage ring required a big effort in machine parameters optimization. Performance of posi-tion monitoring devices has proven essential for the suc-cessful optimization of beam parameters such as: closed orbit; tune; chromaticity; and dispersion. Now; the effort is focused on fine-tuning the machine by implementing the linear optics from orbit correction (LOCO) and reduc-ing the disparity between model and measured results revealed by the phase advance analysis and dispersion measurement. Moreover; during daily operation the main task is to maintain long-term stability of the circulating electron beam allowing for beamlines commissioning.

The experience of building and operating the first short-length; 16-mm period superconducting undulator; SCU0; paved the way for two 1-m long; 18-mm period devices; SCU18-1 and SCU18-2. The first of those undulators has been in operation since May 2015; while the second one replaced SCU0 in September 2016. The possibility of building planar SCUs with a high quality field has been demonstrated at the APS. The measured phase errors of SCU18-2 at the design operational current are only 2 degrees rms; for example. An FEL SCU prototype - a 1.5-m long; 21-mm period undulator - was also built and tested as part of an LCLS SCU R&D program. This undulator successfully achieved all LCLS-II undulator requirements including a phase error of 5 degrees rms.

This may be the case in projects as SIS100 at GSI or LIU at CERN. In the past decade systematic simulation studies and experiments performed at CERN and GSI have highlighted the space charge induced periodic crossing of Â“one dimensionalÂ” resonances as the underlying mechanism of long term beam loss or emittance growth. However only in 2012; for the first time; the effect of space charge on a normal third order coupled resonance was investigated at the CERN-PS. The experimental results have highlighted an unprecedented asymmetric beam response where in the horizontal plane the beam exhibits a thick halo; whereas the vertical profile has only core growth. The quest for explaining these results requires a journey thorough the 4 dimensional dynamics of the coupled resonance investigating the fix-lines; and requires a detailed code-experiment benchmarking also including beam profile benchmarking. This study shows that the experimental results of the 2012 PS measurements can be explained by the dynamics the fixed lines also including the effect of the dispersion.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wexb1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wexb1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wexb1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEXB1,

Four harmonic sextupole families were sufficient with the earlier 8-fold symmetric lattice. Today there are ten families of harmonic sextupole mag-nets in addition to the three families of chromatic sextu-poles. This paper describes our experimental approach to find better settings for these harmonic sextupoles based on the direct optimization of the injection efficiency with a longitudinal phase offset between storage ring and the injector - in our case a booster synchrotron. As demon-strated in the paper; the resulting improvement of the phase acceptance of the ring leads to increased momen-tum acceptance by suppressing 3rd order non-systematic resonances. This increases not only the injection effi-ciency for long bunches but also the Touschek lifetime; the largest contribution to the overall lifetime of low emittance storage rings.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB006,

Recently; the low alpha operation mode; providing bunch lengths as short as 2 ps; was extended by pseudo single bunch options. A robust technique to excite one bunch with constant displacement and enlargement was implemented for pulse picking by resonant excitation (PPRE)** users. In addition; reliable scraping of an isolated bunch to provide zero current bunch length is opening new timing opportunities. The simultaneous usage of different photon characteristics: high intensity CSR; non-bursting CSR; short duration as well as operation mode specific X-rays impose new challenges. Sensitive tune measurements and feedback mechanisms had to be developed for all three dimensions. Negative alpha is in consideration to overcome the top up efficiency constraints.; *R. Müller et.al.

A laser-induced energy modulation is converted into a density modulation (microbunching) by a magnetic chicane; leading to coherent emission at harmonics of the initial laser wavelength (coherent harmonic generation; CHG). Path length differences of the energy-modulated electrons along the magnetic lattice lead to a dip in the longitudinal charge distribution; which gives rise to the coherent emission of THz radiation. In first pump-probe photoemission experiments; the spatial and temporal overlap of laser pump and CHG probe pulse on the sample was demonstrated. Furthermore; the effect of two temporally separated seed pulses was studied in the VUV and (sub-)THz regime.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB009,

A superconducting wiggler is installed in a short straight section of the ring where vertical beta-function is large (13 m). The life time of the electron beam was reduced from 15 to 12 hours at a high field level of the wiggler (2.5 T) even though the coherent shift of vertical tune was compensated locally. Computer simulations show the non-linear nature of the effect. The ANKA storage ring operates with strong sextupoles at a positive chromaticity of +2/+6. Even residual octupole components of the wiggler field; set at the tolerance limit of fabrication conditions; could reduce the dynamic aperture for off-momentum particles providing the betatron tune is located in the vicinity of a weak octupole resonance and the chromaticity is high. Also the vertical betatron tune is close to the sextupole resonance Qy=8/3. Large resonance stop-band and proximity of sextupole resonance affect the life time as well. Betatron tunes of ANKA have been shifted away of suspected high-order resonances and beam life time was essentially improved.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB011,

The high repetition rate together with the high loss sensitivity of the undulators raises serious radiation damage concern; especially for the implementation of the Hard X-ray Self-Seeding (HXRSS) system; where a 100 um thick diamond crystal will be inserted close to the beam in the undulator section. Since the seeding power level highly depends on the delay of the electron beam with respect to the photon beam; it is crucial to define the minimum electron beam offset to the edge of the crystal in the HXRSS chicane. At European XFEL a ~200 m long post-linac collimation section has been designed to protect the undulators.

Another useful application of harmonic lasing is so called Harmonic Lasing Self-Seeded Free Electron Laser (HLSS FEL) that allows to improve spectral brightness of these facilities. In the past; harmonic lasing has been demonstrated in the FEL oscillators in infrared and visible wavelength ranges; but not in high-gain FELs and not at short wavelengths. In this paper we report on the first evidence of the harmonic lasing and the first operation of the HLSS FEL at the soft X-ray FEL user facility FLASH in the wavelength range between 4.5 nm and 15 nm. Spectral brightness was improved in comparison with Self-Amplified Spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL by a factor of six in the exponential gain regime. A better performance of HLSS FEL with respect to SASE FEL in the post-saturation regime with a tapered undulator was observed as well.

In THz lasers an off-crest cavity adds a chirp to the bunch followed by a bunch compressor. Particles with different energies travel on different trajectories to the radiator. 2.) For EUV and X-ray FELs the beam enters an undulator which produces microbunches which then radiate. In this paper it is proposed to copy the THz laser scheme for EUV lasers. The incoming beam is chirped and a dogleg forces afterwards the particles with different energies to move on different parallel trajectories. Considering a detector plane perpendicular to the trajectories the particles with different energies arrive in general at different times. When in this plane for instance a TGU (Transverse Gradient Undulator) is positioned the emitted radiation in the TGU is monochromatic. If in addition chirp and dogleg are selected in such a way that the particles with different energies arrive at the same time at the entrance of the TGU the radiation is monochromatic and coherent similar to the THz laser concept. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB032,

A further reduction of the FEL pulse length is desired by those experiments aiming at probing ultrafast phenomena. Unlike SASE FEL; where the pulse duration is mainly driven by the electron bunch duration; in a seeded FEL the pulse duration can be determined by the seed laser properties. The use of techniques able to locally deteriorate the electron beam properties such as emittance or energy spread have been used in SASE FELs to reduce the region of the electron beam that is able to produce FEL radiation and hence reduce the FEL pulse length. The temporal shaping of the laser heater can be used to create an electron beam characterized by a very large energy spread all along the bunch except for a small region. We report measurements of the effect of the laser heater shaping on the electron beam phase-space performed at FERMI. Impact on the final FEL pulse properties are predicted with a series of numerical simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab034_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab034.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab034_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB034,

The injection energy was 3 GeV and the beam was accelerated to 6.5 GeV prior to the user run. The original beam transport line (BT) from the LINAC to the PF-AR shared its upstream part with the the BT line of KEKB High Energy Ring (HER). The injection-mode change from PF-AR to HER or vice versa needs about 10 minutes for the magnet cycling procedure of the shared part. In SuperKEKB; the upgrade of KEKB; the lifetime of HER is about 10 minutes. The mode-switch operation of the BT is; therefore; not allowed for maintaining the highest luminosity of the SuperKEKB. In order to avoid this problem; a new 6.5 GeV BT line dedicated to PF-AR has been constructed. This also enables the top-up injection for the user run. The commissioning of the new BT line has been completed in this March; and now the first user run has been operated successfully.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab044_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab044.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab044_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB044,

Due to the large electricity consumption; all accelerators in KEK are shut down during every summer for about 3 months. In 2017; because of the LINAC upgrade for SuperKEKB Phase 2 operation; the summer shutdown will be extended to about 5 months. On the other hand; the PF users always strongly wish the shorter shutdown and longer operation. Especially the structural biology users require the ability for the measurement within about 2 weeks after the irregular sample manufacture throughout the year. In order to satisfy these requests; the independent injector system is required for the realization of such longer operation.

Recently the first version lattice of the HALS storage ring has been studied using a new lattice design concept that we proposed for diffraction-limited storage rings. In this new concept; the beta functions of each cell are made to be locally symmetric. In this paper; an 8BA lattice and a 6BA lattice are designed for the HALS with the first and the second kind of the new concept; respectively. In their nonlinear optimization; good dynamic aperture and momentum aperture can be easily obtained. Especially the dynamic momentum aperture can be larger than 7% or even 10%; which enables long beam lifetime and implementation of longitudinal injection scheme. The studied 6BA lattice is at present considered as the nominal HALS lattice of the first version.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab060_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab060.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab060_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB060,

A high-power terahertz light source can be realized through coherent synchrotron radiation from a storage ring. The radiation power of coherent synchrotron radiation is proportional to square of the number of electrons in a bunch. To generate coherent synchrotron radiation; the electron bunch length should be shorter than its radiation wavelength. This paper presents our preliminary study on developing a terahertz light source based on Hefei Light Source. We will introduce the status of Hefei Light Source (HLS) and discusses the approach to change it to a dedicated Terahertz light source using coherent synchrotron radiation. Several schemes are proposed to shorten the electron bunch length in the storage ring; including using a low alpha lattice; adopting a magnetic chicane and upgrading the RF system with much higher frequency. The related beam instabilities are also analyzed to predict the beam current threshold.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab063_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab063.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab063_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB063,

The upgrade project mainly includes increasing the linac injector energy from 200 MeV to 800 MeV which is the same as the ring energy; changing the ring lattice structure from TBA to DBA in order to provide more straight sections for insertion devices while keeping the circumference unchanged; and lowering the beam emittance to obtain higher photon brightness. Before the upgrade project; decay mode is the only choice for the operation of Hefei Light Source. This is because the injected beam from the linac injector needs to be ramped up to 800 MeV after injection. At prensent we have the conditions to operate Hefei Light Source with top-off mode since the linac can perform full-energy and bunch-by-bunch injection. The main challenge for the top-off operation is to control the radiation dose for personal and equipment safety; and to maintain high stability and reliability of the injector.

At the beginning of storage ring operation the lifetime was very short mostly dominated by the ion trapping and residual gas scattering. After a 390 A·h of beam cleaning the measured total lifetime has reached 20 h for 100mA of a stored current. Since the main contribution to the total lifetime in the storage ring comes from single Coulomb and Touschek scattering the dependence of the residual gas pressure and the vertical aperture of storage ring is investigated. Moreover to improve the Touschek lifetime the 3rd harmonic cavities were installed. Recently the cavities were tuned close to the resonance and the total lifetime increased significantly.

Recently; the control of the timing has been upgraded to allow single bunches to be injected into any storage ring bucket and therefore to top up the stored current also in single bunch injector mode. In addition; by means of a specific algorithm; a new injection mode called Single Bunch Bucket Selection (SBBS) has been developed to provide any kind of filling pattern in the ALBA storage ring. This mode controls independently the amount of current injected into each bucket; and injects first into those buckets with lowest charge. When used in top-up mode; SBBS keeps the charge distribution of the filling pattern with a uniformity below 10%. The improved flexibility and stability of the filling pattern increases the scope of research for the ALBA experiments and for machine studies development.

One method to accomplish this is PPRE developed and currently in user operation at BESSY-II. In the method; the transverse emittance of one of the bunches in the bunch train is increased by an incoherent betatron excitation. Part of the light from this bunch can then be separated from the multibunch light by an aperture in the beamline; resulting in single-bunch light for the experiment. Methods such as this expand the scope of storage rings without requiring special fill patterns. This is of growing interest due to the upgrade trend towards diffraction-limited storage rings where it becomes more challenging to operate with inhomogeneous fill patterns. Measurements of PPRE were performed at the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring utilizing the bunch-by-bunch feedback system both for excitation and as a diagnostic. Furthermore; measurements involving direct beam imaging at the diagnostics beamline allowed quantifying the effect of this excitation on the horizontal and vertical emittance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepab073_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepab073.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepab073_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPAB073,

During this phase we have equipped and realigned 3 out of 24 cells; involving two beamlines. We have also tested and perfected the technique to execute a move with live beam and total remote control of the realignment process.

This change represents the largest modification to the storage ring since it was first commissioned in 2006; and was installed and fully commissioned during a single 8 week shutdown in autumn 2016. In view of this tight schedule; the planned commissioning steps and all high-level software needed to be developed and thoroughly tested in advance. Electron beam commissioning occupied the final 2 weeks of the shutdown; during which the injected electrons were captured and accumulated; the correct linear lattice was established; the nonlinear beam dynamics were studied; IDs were closed and the target 300 mA was achieved.

One of the consequences of producing a small emittance is a small dynamic aperture; although the momentum acceptance will remain large enough for acceptable beam lifetime. To overcome this challenge; ALS-U will use on-axis swap-out injection to exchange bunch trains between the storage ring and an accumulator ring.

The beam emittance and FEL performance are highly related to the transverse shape of the injector laser. When the injector laser has hot spots and non-uniformities that can carry over to the electron beam and degrade electron emittance and FEL performance; it requires long hours of manual adjustment by laser engineers and strenuous machine tuneup. The injector laser shaping project at LCLS aims to have precise control of the driver laser transverse profile in order to produce arbitrary electron beam profiles; which will enable us to study effects of laser shape on beam emittance and FEL performances. We use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to manipulate the drive laser profile. In this paper; we briefly discuss the implementations of laser shaping at LCLS.

The AWA facility is dedicated to the study of beam physics and the development of technology for future particle accelerators. Two independent electron linacs are used to study wakefield acceleration: 70 MeV high charge electron bunches of up to 100 nC are used to drive wakefields; which can be probed by bunches originating from the same linac or from the 15 MeV linac. Recent Two-Beam-Acceleration (TBA) experiments operating at 11.7 GHz reached accelerating gradients of up to 150 MV/m. No indication of witness beam quality degradation was observed; and bunch charge was preserved during the acceleration process. Two identical TBA setups were used in series in order to demonstrate staging capabilities. Dielectric loaded structures operating at 26 GHz are also used in TBA experiments. Another main thrust of the research program consists of exploring and developing techniques to manipulate the phase space of electron bunches.

Since the horizontal abort kicker magnets are required to have very fast rise time and large current; the gap of kicker magnet must be as small as possible. The thin and compact ceramic chamber were developed. The chamber has racetrack type chamber whose inner diameter is 60mm in horizontal and 40 mm in vertical. And the gap of horizontal kicker magnet is 70mm. The thickness of the ceramic chamber is 30 % reduced from that of KEKB. The 500mm long hollow type ceramic; which includes cooling water path inside; is fabricated. It makes the structure of ceramic chamber simple and compact. The new copper electroforming is applied to deposit the 100μmeter thickness Cu conducting layer on the inner wall of Kovar. The Cu conducting layer reduces the heat generated by image beam current on the Kovar brazering. They are installed in the Super-KEKB electron ring beam abort system; and used in the phase 1 operation.

It assumes the nano-beam scheme; in which the emittance of the colliding beams is 4.6 nm. To achieve such a low emittance; it is vitally important to preserve the emittance during the transport of the beam from the linac to the main ring. One of the most difficult sections is the injection system. Since the dynamic aperture is small for the low emittance; the allowed distances between the stored beam and the injected beam at the injection point are 7.8 mm for the betatron injection and 7.2 mm for the synchrotron injection. The new septum magnets has been constructed and installed in the beam line after the measurement of magnetic flux density and aging test. It has been also checked the septum magnets are capable of design orbit. The initial beam injection succeeded on schedule and they had been operated without any big troubles in the first beam run of Phase-1.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepik013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepik013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepik013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPIK013,

The beam lifetime will be limited to less than one hour; because of radiative Bhaba scattering and beamstrahlung. In order to keep the luminosity on the high level of 1035 cm-2s-1 continuous top-up injection is required. Therefore; besides the collider; that will operate at constant energy; a fast cycling booster synchrotron will be installed in the tunnel. The injection energy to the booster synchrotron will be around 6-20 GeV.

The beams collide at an angle (±15mrad) in a region where the detector solenoid magnetic field is large. Moreover; the very low vertical β* of the machine necessitates that the final focusing quadrupoles are also inside this high field region. The beams should be screened from the effect of the detector solenoid field; and the emittance blow-up due to vertical dispersion in the interaction region should be minimized while leaving enough space for detector components.

It allows one to preserve proton and deuteron polarizations using weak stabilizing solenoids when accelerating the beam up to 100 GeV/c. When the stabilizing solenoids are introduced into the collider's lattice; the particle spins precess about a spin field; which consists of the field induced by the stabilizing solenoids and the zero-integer spin resonance strength. During acceleration of the beam; the induced spin field is maintained constant while the resonance strength experiences significant changes in the regions of interference peaks. The beam polarization depends on the field ramp rate of the arc magnets. Its component along the spin field is preserved if acceleration is adiabatic. We present the results of our theoretical analysis and numerical modeling of the spin dynamics during acceleration of protons and deuterons in the JLEIC ion collider ring.

Although the resonators are operated in a driven setup; one of the advantageous numerical strategies here is given by an eigendecomposition of the fields which is realized by the application of accurate eigenmode calculations together with suitable postprocessing steps. In particular; the extraction of representative field maps used for particle tracking for example requires an accurate numerical modeling of the field at any position inside the structure. In order to avoid numerically motivated discontinuities of the fields a proper smoothing algorithm based on the vector equivalents of the Kirchhoff integral is proposed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepik064_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepik064.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepik064_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPIK064,

The HESR is designed for antiprotons with a momentum range from 1.5 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c; but will as well be suitable to provide heavy ion beams with a momentum range from approximately 0.6 GeV/c to 5.8 GeV/c. To guarantee smooth operation it is crucial to verify and to optimize the design with beam-dynamics simulations. Within recent studies* calculations based on a variant of the Lyapunov exponent were carried out to estimate the dynamic aperture. The studies could reproduce expected influences as reduced aperture due to tune resonances and tune shifts due to coupling. Thus they can be extended to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the beam and identify the main restrictions to the dynamic aperture near the chosen betatron tune. Furthermore ongoing measurements of the magnetic fields of the already produced bending dipoles and quadrupoles deliver a more precise insight to the harmonic content of these elements. Thus the existing simulations could now be updated by including the new measurement results.; *J. Hetzel; A. Lehrach; U. Bechstedt; J. Böker; B. Lorentz; R.

This optics has two dispersion bumps in one unit cell where chromaticity-correcting sextupoles locate. The horizontal and vertical betatron phases between these bumps are tuned to be 3PI and PI; respectively; to cancel the low order contributions of nonlinear kicks due to sextupoles. However; it is not easy to obtain a sufficiently large dynamic aperture (DA) since (i) the cancellation is incomplete due to a nested arrangement; (ii) sextupoles are very strong; and (iii) the number of tuning knobs is limited. The DA is quite small due to the leakage of nonlinear kicks by nested sextupoles. We hence proposed to install additional weak sextupoles between the dispersion bumps to suppress the leakage kick further. Simulations show that this simple scheme is very effective for suppressing ADTS and for enlarging DA. We present details of this scheme and some numerical examples together with a newly developed fourth-order formula of ADTS for describing and controlling the lattice nonlinearity.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepik070_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepik070.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepik070_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPIK070,

However; this intensity increase is currently limited by the LHC injector chain; in part due to longitudinal multi-bunch instabilities in the SPS. Therefore; the implementation of an accurate SPS impedance model was started some time ago in order to obtain a better understanding of instability sources and develop mitigation measures. In this paper; we present the electromagnetic characterization of commonly used all-metal gate valves with respect to their contribution to the SPS longitudinal impedance. The valve impedance was evaluated with commercially available EM-field simulation programs and verified with RF-bench measurements. Using this input; it was possible to obtain in particle simulations the dependence of the multi-bunch stability threshold on the number of these valves. A practical means of mitigation is to use a commercially available impedance shielded version of these gate valves.

We describe the evaluation of different impedance shielding designs proposed to reduce the longitudinal beam coupling impedance of this group of vacuum flanges in the SPS.

As a result of these beam interactions; it is required at CERN to characterize the beam coupling impedance of each new machine element that is to be installed in the accelerator ring. In the framework of the LIU (LHC Injectors Upgrade) project; a new design of rotational wire scanner to be used in the PS Booster is currently under development. As an intermediate step; the prototype of this wire scanner was evaluated with respect to its longitudinal beam coupling impedance. Depending on the performance of this machine element; it is planned to replace existing wire scanners in other machines at CERN (e.g. PS-Booster; PS and SPS) with very similar designs. This paper presents the simulations and describes the measurement methods used for benchmarking electromagnetic simulations performed for the impedance evaluation of the LIU wire scanner for the PS-Booster.

The use of a multipole-magnet injection kicker prevents disturbing the circulating beam. However; the injected bunch will be mismatched due to unwanted focusing (linear field profile) or even filamented (nonlinear field profile). Coreless nonlinear kicker magnets; using different configurations of straight conductors; can produce transverse step-like magnetic field distribution which prevent the mismatch. We explored an 8-conductor configuration and a multi-conductor approach like unipolar massless septum design. Maximizing the spatial derivative of the transverse field step function is crucial in order to kick the injected bunch inside the DA. Comparing the results of different designs a particular dependence between the smallest clear aperture and the maximum transverse field spatial derivative was observed. We have developed an optimization tool to generate arbitrary 2D magnetic fields and determine the associated current distribution. With it we obtained new design solutions for possible injection magnets that go beyond the limitations of the standard designs.,,B. MacDonald-de Neeve reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepik097_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepik097.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepik097_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPIK097,

They are designed to separate two closely spaced electron bunches (28 ns apart) accelerated in one RF macro-pulse and to send them to two separate undulator lines. High shot-to-shot amplitude stability is required to minimize the disturbance of the electron beam trajectories and to ensure stable X-ray lasing. The stability and speed was unlikely to be achieved by standard pulsed systems and a novel 18 MHz; lumped-element resonator deflector with high Q was developed. It is driven into resonance by a specialized pulsed RF driver. At resonance; the circulating currents can approach 300 A and the resulting magnetic field gives the required deflection to the electron bunches. The advanced DC offset measurement system is also described in this paper.

The undulator vacuum chamber is 20 m long with inner diameter 6 mm and its vacuum performance can benefit from a NEG coating. The thickness of the coating layer must be carefully optimised. A layer ~ 1 um would help the vacuum but a thinner layer would be partially transparent for the EM field reducing the resistive wall wakefields due to the NEG. A very thin layer; however; may not yield the necessary vacuum performance. Two types of NEG coatings produced at DL - dense and columnar - were considered. Their bulk conductivities were measured in a separate study. The resistive wall wakefield impedance was calculated following the standard approach for multilayer vessels. A 250 fs rms electron bunch was generated in ASTRA and its wakefield was obtained from the vessel impedance. The FEL performance was then studied through GENESIS simulations and the result compared to the case with no wakefields. It was found that NEG layers thicker than 100 nm give an unacceptable reduction of the FEL power and the vacuum performance of such thin coatings is unknown.

The charge dependent vertical beam size growth was observed while a single scraper was inserted through the top of the chamber. No change in the beam size was observed with top and bottom scrapers inserted symmetrically. The apparent growth in the vertical beam size was due in large part to the y-z coupling (vertical crabbing) induced by the monopole wake of the asymmetric scraper configuration. We explored this y-z coupling by varying vertical betatron phase advance between the vertical beam size monitor and the scrapers.

Solving for the potentials directly allows for a natural accounting of the beam wave interaction. It could also potentially avoid the issue of deleterious spurious modes inherent when selecting the Coulomb gauge and enforcing the subsequent divergence free condition; eliminating the need for vector basis functions.

The existing results for CSR impedances are usually obtained for the ultrarelativistic limit. To extend the microbunching analysis to cases of low energies; such as the case of an ERL merger; or to density modulations at extremely small wavelength; it is necessary to extend the impedance analysis to the non-ultrarelativistic regime. In this study; we present the impedance analysis for the transient CSR interaction in the non-ultrarelativistic regime; for transients including both entrance to and exit from a magnetic dipole.

Comprehensive strategies for achieving this goal have been considered and developed including injection of highly polarized electrons from CEBAF; mechanisms for manipulation and preservation of the polarization in the JLEIC collider ring and measurement of the electron polarization. In particular; maintaining a sufficiently long polarization lifetime is crucial for accumulation of adequate experimental statistics. The chosen electron polarization configuration; based on the unique figure-8 geometry of the ring; removes the electron spin-tune energy dependence.

In the muon collider concept; the resultant equilibrium transverse emittances from cooling with Skew PIC are an order of magnitude smaller than in conventional ionization cooling. The concept makes use of coupling of the transverse dynamic behavior; and the linear dynamics are well-behaved with good agreement between analytic solutions and simulation results. Compared to the uncoupled system; coupling of the transverse dynamic behavior purports to reduce the number of multipoles required for aberration compensation while also avoiding unwanted resonances. Aberration compensation is more complicated in the coupled case; especially in the high-luminosity muon collider application where equilibrium angular spreads in the cooling channel are on the order of 200 mrad.

The numerically obtained total longitudinal wakepotential by the GdfidL code allowed us to compare the measured results with particle tracking simulations using the SPACE code. The instability thresholds behavior at different RF voltages are in some sort of overarching agreement. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepik117_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepik117.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepik117_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPIK117,

Some muons in the storage ring will interact with material and undergo bremsstrahlung; emitting radiation and loosing energy. These so called lost muons will curl in towards the center of the ring and be lost; but some of them will be detected by the calorimeters. A systematic error will arise if the lost muons have a different average spin phase than the stored muons. Algorithms are being developed to estimate the relative number of lost muons; so as to optimize the stored muon beam.

This is due to the high damage threshold of dielectrics at optical frequencies. In the context of the Accelerator on a Chip International Program (ACHIP) we plan to inject electron bunches into a laser-illuminated dielectric grating structure. At a laser wavelength of 2 micro-meter the accelerating bucket is <1.5 fs. This requires both ultra-short bunches and highly stable laser to electron phase. We propose a scheme with intrinsic laser to electron synchronization and describe a possible implementation at the SINBAD facility (DESY). Prior to injection; the electron bunch is conditioned by interaction with an external laser field in an undulator. This generates a sinusoidal energy modulation that is transformed into periodic microbunches in a subsequent chicane. The phase synchronization is achieved by driving both the modulation process and the DLA with the same laser pulse. This allows scanning the electron bunch to laser phase and will show the dependence of the acceleration process on this delay.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA006,

We finally demonstrate that the bunch properties are optimized when low frequencies (< 300 GHz) are used inside the linac; and that the longitudinal focal point can be put several tens of cm away from the linac exit thanks to ballistic bunching.

Due to issues with conventional kicker systems; such as self-triggering and long term availability of thyratrons and limitations of HV-cables; innovative design changes are planned for the FCC injection kicker pulse generator. An inductive adder (IA) based on semiconductor (SC) switches is a promising technology for kicker systems. Its modular design; and the possibility of an active ripple suppression are significant advantages. Since the IA is a complex device; with multiple components whose characteristics are important; a detailed design study and construction of a prototype is necessary. This paper summarizes the system requirements and constraints; and describes the main components and design challenges of the prototype IA.

One option being studied is to reuse the 6.9 km circumference tunnel of the SPS to house a fast-ramping superconducting machine. This paper presents the conceptual design considerations for this superconducting single aperture accelerator (designated scSPS) which can be used to accelerate protons to an extraction energy of 1.3 TeV; both for FCC and for fixed target beam operation in CERN's North Area. As FCC injector this accelerator has to be used in a fast cycling mode to fulfil the FCC-hh requirements concerning filling time; which impacts directly the choice of magnet technology. The reliability and availability will also play important roles in the design; and the inclusion of a fixed target capacity also has significant implications for the lattice and layout.

Each of its four rings provides beams in a range of intensities varying from 40 e11 p/cycle to 0.8 e13 p/cycle. Low intensity beams are produced by transverse shaving; that is by scraping the tails; in order to tailor the intensity and transverse emittances. Eventually; tails repopulate and the beam profile reshapes; under the effect of space charge; which is dominant at low energy in the PS Booster. This paper describes the results of the measurements after the shaving process; where the tails are scraped but finally re-appear in the transverse profile; and it provides a first benchmark with space-charge simulations. It highlights the challenges encountered and the lessons learned; to guide the future experiments. The final outcome of these studies is the characterisation of the halo creation mechanism and the determination of the diffusion speed; important for the design of the future PS Booster scraping system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA038,

The purpose of these systems is to provide single sine voltage pulses at the cavity gap. Due to the high requirements regarding the gap signal quality; the calculation of the pre-distorted input signal plays a major role in the system development. A procedure to generate the input signal based on the dynamic properties in the linear region of the system has been developed and tested at a prototype system. It was shown that this method is able to generate single sine gap signals of high quality in a wide voltage range. As linearity can only be assumed up to a certain magnitude; nonlinear effects limit the quality of the output signal at very high input levels. An approach to overcome this limit is to extend the input signal calculation to a nonlinear model of the system.

The HESR is designed both for antiprotons and for heavy ion experiments. The injection kicker system of the HESR is located directly behind the septum and consists of two pumping crosses for pumps and measurement devices as well as two vacuum tanks housing the four ferrite magnets which will be operated with 40 kV; 4kA. As well as the magnets; the adjustments frames and the electrical feedthroughs will be installed inside the tanks. Due to the large surface of the magnets the injection kicker system will be very sensitive with regard to the achievable vacuum quality that is expected to be in the order of 10-11 mbar or better. Thus the vacuum system is designed to heat up to 250°C. In order to investigate the achievable end pressure and to develop the heating system a test facility was constructed.

By choosing properly the position of the stripper foils and of the corrector magnetic channels; it is possible to convoy the trajectories of the selected representative ion beams across a new extraction channel. It is mandatory to design a new extraction line to transport these beams to the existing beam transport line. The extracted beams have an energy spread of about ±0.4%; so; the new extraction line has to compensate the correlation energy-position of the beam and to produce an achromatic waist of the beam at the common starting point of the existing transport lines.

Its operational diagram is peculiar and many experiment are performed each year. In the near future a major upgrade is planned. This will allow to overcome the major limitation of the CS; which is the beam power limited at 100 W. In the new version of the CS; the extracted beam power will be increased up to a factor 100. This improvement will be reached adding a new extraction line dedicated to a specific set of light ions and energies extracted by stripping. The new design could affect the beam dynamics strongly. Indeed; the iron yoke penetrations don't respect the three folds symmetry of our cyclotron. This inhomogeneity produces unwanted field harmonics; which have to be reduced as much as possible to avoid beam precession or second order effects. Here the study accomplished to minimize the perturbation of the non-three fold field symmetry using the current sheet approximation (CSA) is presented; along with the state-of-art configuration of the updated cyclotron,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva054_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva054.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva054_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA054,

In the IS; charged particles are accelerated by pulse voltages driven by switching modulators employing high-speed semiconductor switches. As the switches are turned on and off by gate signals corresponding to the revolution frequency of the ion bunches; switching frequency reaches up to MHz order. The switching power supply (SPS) that generates bipolar pulses is one of the key technologies for the DA. The rating of SPS is roughly 2.5kV-20A-1MHz. To accomplish these requirements; we adopted 7 series connected Si-MOSFET for the switching devices of the 1st generation SPS. However it was too large and complicated for the future practical accelerator driver. Therefore we started to develop the next generation of SPS utilizing silicon carbide (SiC) devices; since they have inherently excellent properties such as high breakdown electric field high drift velocity; and high thermal conductivity**. In this paper; we describe the pulse switching test results of a prototype SiC-MOSFET and the test results of the prototype SPS.; * K. Takayama et al.; Phys. Rev.

Several kinds of absorber materials; such as SiC; ferrite and Kanthal; have been investigated and applied in accelerators. Among these materials; ferrite has been found to be superior to others because of its higher HOM absorbing efficiency. However; because of its low tensile strength and small thermal expansion rate; it cannot be easily bonded to other metals thus limiting its use as a HOM absorber.

Beam-screen upgrades have been very effective in reducing beam coupling impedance during Run 2. However; temperature measurements during LHC operation have shown that one end of the MKIs ferrite yoke is consistently hotter than the other: this effect is due to highly non-uniform beam induced power deposition along the kicker. Electromagnetic and thermal simulations show that part of the ferrite yoke will be above its Curie temperature when the LHC is operated with HL-LHC beam parameters; which could increase the turn-around time between fills of the LHC. An impedance mitigation study is presented in this paper with emphasis on the effect of the beam screen layout upon both total beam induced power deposition and its longitudinal distribution. Results of complex thermal simulations; to benchmark the effectiveness of the proposed schemes; are reported.

Important considerations in the design of such a system are machine protection constraints; collider filling factor and hence rise and fall times of the kicker magnet field. Fast rise time kicker magnets are generally ferrite loaded transmission line type magnets with a rectangular shaped aperture. The beam coupling impedance of the kicker magnets is crucial; as this can be a dominant contribution to beam instabilities. In addition; beam-induced heating of the ferrite yoke due to the real component of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance needs to be controlled: if the ferrite temperature exceeds the Curie point this impacts the ability to inject beam and hence the availability of the machine. This paper presents estimates for the beam induced power deposition in the ferrite yoke; based on a calculated FCC beam spectrum and an analytical model of longitudinal impedance for unshielded kicker magnets.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva095_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva095.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva095_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA095,

Operation with high intensity beams for many hours can lead to significant beam induced heating of the ferrite yokes of the MKIs. When the ferrite exceeds the Curie temperature of 125°C it loses its magnetic properties; preventing further injection until the ferrite cools down; potentially causing a delay of several hours. Hence important upgrades of the beam-screen were implemented after Run 1 of LHC. However; the High-Luminosity (HL) LHC will be operated with significantly higher intensity beams and hence additional measures are required to limit the ferrite temperature. These magnets operate under ultra-high vacuum conditions: convection is negligible and; as a result of low emissivity of the inside of the vacuum tanks; thermal radiation is limited. A detailed study of the thermal behaviour of these magnets is reported and compared with measurements. In addition several options to improve cooling of the ferrites are presented and analysed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva096_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva096.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva096_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA096,

The beam induced heating in the ferrite yoke of these magnets was historically kept to an acceptable level by implementing water cooling of the kicker magnets: in addition serigraphy was applied on the surfaces of the ferrite yoke facing the beam. Nevertheless; high intensity beams needed in the future for HL-LHC will significantly increase the beam induced heating; potentially raising the MKE ferrite yoke temperature to its Curie point. Hence detailed studies of longitudinal beam coupling impedance were carried out to identify simple but effective methods of further reducing beam induced power deposition. Based on the results of these studies; and in the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project; an upgraded MKE kicker magnet was installed during the 2015-2016 shutdown.

The pre-damping rings and damping rings (DRs) will produce ultra-low emittance beam with high bunch charge. To avoid beam emittance increase; the DR kicker systems must provide extremely stable field pulses during injection and extraction of bunches. The DR extraction kicker system consists of a stripline kicker and two pulse modulators. The current specifications for the modulators call for pulses with 160 ns or 900 ns flattop duration of ±12.5 kV and 305 A; with ripple of not more than ±0.02 % (±2.5 V). An inductive adder is a very promising approach to meeting the specifications because analogue modulation methods can be applied to adjust the output waveform. Recently; the first full-scale; 20-layer; 12.5 kV prototype inductive adder has been assembled at CERN and testing has commenced. The goal is to tailor the output waveform of the prototype to the waveform required for the DR extraction stripline kicker.

These kickers are transmission line type magnets with a rectangular shaped aperture through which the beam circulates. Unless special precautions are taken; the beam impedance of the yoke can provoke significant induced heating; especially for high intensity beams. Previous upgrades of the SPS extraction kicker magnets have included silver fingers serigraphed on the surface of the ferrite facing the beam; to help shield the ferrite yoke from circulating beam. Beam based measurements of the extracted beam indicated that the serigraphy may influence the shape of the field pulse; causing it to increase slightly in magnitude during the flat-top. Hence theoretical studies have been carried out to determine whether the serigraphy influences the field pulse: these studies are reported in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva099_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva099.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva099_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA099,

ipac2017,,WEPVA101,Review of Stripline Beam Impedance: Application to the Extraction Kicker for the CLIC Damping Rings,C. Belver-Aguilar; M.J. Barnespresenter; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The beam coupling impedance of the stripline kicker for beam extraction from the CLIC Damping Rings (DRs) has been studied analytically; numerically with CST Particle Studio (PS) and measured in the laboratory; although not all the results were understood. In order to have a better knowledge about the beam coupling impedance of a stripline kicker; a simple model has been first studied; with flat electrodes and a cylindrical beam pipe. From this preliminary study; a new approach for the dipolar component of the horizontal impedance has been derived; when considering both odd and even operating modes of the striplines. This new approach has been used to understand the differences found between the predicted transverse impedance and the two wire measurements carried out in the laboratory for the prototype CLIC DR striplines. Future tests of beam coupling impedance with beam in the ALBA Synchrotron Ligth Source will complete this study.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva101_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva101.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva101_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA101,

They are then collected by a 400 kA pulsed magnetic horn; momentum selected and injected into the AD facility. The area has been in operation since the 80s; keeping most of the equipment dating back to this period. A major upgrade is foreseen during the CERN's Long Shutdown 2 to guarantee the next decades of antiproton physics. Among other R&D activities; three main systems are within the scope of this upgrade; (i) a new antiproton target design; pressurized-air-cooled and with a new core configuration based on the results from the HiRadMat27 experiment. (ii) Manufacturing of a set of new magnetic horns and testing them using a dedicated test bench replicating the real horn setup. (iii) Design of new target and horn's trolleys; which are responsible for their positioning as well as providing an efficient long term maintenance giving the high radioactivity of the area.

Therefore; in order to meet the space requirements of new equipment; the infrastructure often needs to be modified; and given its rigid nature; this presents a challenge for the civil engineers to provide the needed space without compromising the safety and serviceability of the structures. In this paper two underground works are presented: a new cross-passage tunnel for the AWAKE experiment completed in 2014 and the future SPS Beam Dump. The challenges that must be faced are: (a) to make sure that the movements of the adjacent structures remain within admissible limits; (b) to design and execute the works such that the life span of the structure is not reduced; (c) To ensure the effectiveness of existing and new drainage systems during and after the works. For these purposes; in the frame of future tunnel asset management; the use of novel and conventional monitoring techniques plays a crucial role as it can predict in real time potential tunnel deformations which can lead; in the worst scenario; to tunnel failure,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva105_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva105.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva105_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA105,

As internal dumps; the PS dumps have been installed in 1975 directly in the PS vacuum ring between the main bending magnets and they are operating since then. The dumps enter the beam line when requested by beam operation; with a 6 kg Cu block moved quickly with a spring-based mechanism. This Cu block is not expected to survive the impact of the future beams. A new design is presented for the dump core based on FLUKA-ANSYS coupled simulations. The dumps should work with any PS beam foreseen within LIU; be water cooled in ultra-high vacuum medium; and enter the beam chamber in less than 250 ms. The dump should be used 200000 times per year; with a lifetime of 20 years; with almost zero maintenance.

The equipment installed in 2014 (TIDVG#3) featured an absorbing core composed of different materials surrounded by a water-cooled copper jacket; which hold the UHV of the machine. An inspection of a previous equipment (TIDVG#2) in 2013 revealed significant beam induced damage to the aluminium section of the dump; which required imposing operational limitations to minimise the risk of reproducing this phenomenon. Additionally; in 2016 a vacuum leak was detected in the dump assembly; which imposed further limitations; i.e. a reduction of the beam intensity that could be dumped per SPS supercycle. This paper presents a new design (TIDVG#4); which focuses on improving the operational robustness of the device. Moreover; thanks to the added instrumentation; a careful analysis of its performance (both experimentally and during operation) will be possible. These studies will help validating technical solutions for the design of the future SPS dump to be installed during CERN's Long Shutdown 2 in 2020 (TIDVG#5).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/wepva110_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/wepva110.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/wepva110_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-WEPVA110,

The mechanical characterisation of such kind of materials presents practical challenges associated with the heterogeneity of the materials; the geometry; size and quality of the samples that can be produced out of actual cables. These constraints impose the undertaking of such measurements from a nonstandard approach; and hence the development of tailor-made tooling. An extensive characterisation campaign for the determination of the mechanical properties of the superconducting cable at room and cryogenic temperature was launched at CERN in order to determine the most relevant mechanical properties of the superconducting cables used in the MQXF and 11T magnets.

The concept is based on a beam of electrons that travels around the protons for a few meters. The electron beam is produced by a cathode and then guided by a strong magnetic field generated by a set of solenoids. Mechanical design and integration require a preliminary knowledge of the optimal configuration of the solenoids that drive the electron trajectories. The estimation of such trajectories by means of a dedicated Matlab tool is presented. The influence of the main geometrical and electrical parameters is analysed and discussed. The main mechanical design choices are also outlined along with the concept of the electron collector. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the feasibility study of the Electron Lens for LHC.

The utility systems operate continuously since 2014; some of deionized and cooling water pumps produced higher vibration amplitude and noise during operation. The possibly reason could be poor system accuracy; inappropriate installation and commission adjustment. The data acquisition system on vibration evaluation for deionizes water pumps was established in 2016. Accord-ing to the long-tern vibration amplitude recording; the system operational status could be clarified. After vibra-tion test for several months; the bearing of booster deion-ized water pump was found abrasive since coupling be-tween motor and pump misaligned. Besides; the founda-tion of copper deionized water pump system was broken and observed by rapidly increase vibration amplitude in short term. The water pump systems were repaired and maintained base on vibration evaluation. There is still some remain problems for deionized and cooling water pump systems.

Especially in AC mode; during the booster ramping process; the current ramping profiles of the Quadruple Magnets have to track that of the Dipole AC power supply with precise phase and amplitude to maximize the beam energy boost efficiency. At the present time; analog controllers are used for all the booster supplies and the tracking waveforms are generated externally in an EPICS control unit; converted to analog signals with precision Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) and then distributed to all the booster power supplies with differential signal pairs. In this paper; here we propose a hybrid iterative learning control algorithm combined with discrete PID feedback controller with the objective to eliminate the signal integrity problem inherent in analogue signals; so that boosting the beam energy might become more reliable.

(DTI) has installed a high-power solid-state opening switch upgrade package to replace the mercury ignitron crowbars in the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) Transmitters at MIT Plasma Fusion Science Center's (PFSC) Alcator C Mod; a Tokamak-type fusion experimental device. The speed of the series opening switch avoids the large fault currents on the transformer and power feed inherent with a crowbar. This improvement enables re-optimization of the Transformer/Rectifier (T/R) set; ultimately allowing increased power output and increased tetrode reliability. The ratings of the prior high voltage power supply are a compromise between high output power (lower impedance required from the T/R set) and crowbar reliability (higher impedance required from the power supply to limit fault current). DTI's opening switch upgrade safely allows the use of significantly reduced transformer impedance and lower droop; giving increased power as well as improved tube protection.

Grade A helium is often available in high-pressure bottles; but not in large quantities. This report describes how one can cool-down and maintain a constant temperature of ~4.5 K in a superconducting magnet that has less than 5 L of liquid in the cryostat once it has been filled with liquid helium. One can do this with either GM coolers in the drop-in mode with pulsed tube coolers. The number of coolers needed to cool the magnet depends to the heat load at 4.5 K and the desired cool-down time for the magnet system. This type of cooling system is suitable for magnets that are away from a conventional large helium refrigeration system.

This research relates the magnitude of the ‘‘anti-Q-slope''; the puzzling reduction of surface resistance with increasing RF field intensity observed in certain cavities; to the doping level of nitrogen-doped niobium; quantified by the mean free path: shorter mean free paths correspond directly with stronger anti-Q-slopes.

Based upon HERA-II experience; a fundamental consideration is to avoid excessive background due to synchrotron radiation striking masks and septa in the vicinity of the experiment. Circumventing such radiation is problematic because the colliding beams have quite different rigidities; we must shield the e-beam from hadron IR magnet multi-tesla coil fields. On the outgoing-hadron; i.e. forward IR side; this difficulty is compounded by needing large hadron beam apertures to enable downstream separation and experimental detection of a mix of scattered and produced forward going charged particles and (in the electron-ion case) a wide-spread cone of neutrons.

In order to achieve this performance reliability requirement; in addition to hardware improvement; a failure tolerant design is mandatory. A compensation mechanism to cope with hardware failure; mainly RF failures of superconducting cavities; will be in place in order to maintain the high uptime; short recovery time and extremely low frequency of beam loss. This paper proposes an innovative and challenging way for compensation and rematch of cavity failure with the hardware implementation of the scheme using fast electronic devices and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A method combined building an equivalent model for the FPGA with an improved genetic algorithm has been developed. Results based on the model and algorithm are compared with TRACEWIN simulation to show the precision and correctness of the mechanism.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thoaa2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thoaa2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thoaa2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THOAA2,

Indeed; these systems induce a controllable increase of the energy spread of the electron bunch. The heating suppresses longitudinal microbunching instability which otherwise would limit the FEL performance. We demonstrate that; through the action of the microbunching instability; a long-wavelength modulation of the electron beam induced by the laser heater at low energy can persist until the beam entrance into the undulators. This coherent longitudinal modulation is exploited to control the FEL spectral properties; in particular; multicolor extreme-ultraviolet FEL pulses can be generated through a frequency mixing of the modulations produced by the laser heater and the seed laser in the electron beam.

ipac2017,,THPAB007,Short Bunches at the Transition From Strong to Weak Longitudinal Instability,HZB; Berlin; Germany,,The interaction of particles with their vacuum sur-roundings can lead to longitudinal instabilities of the whole bunch of particles. Most of these instabilities are strong and the growth rates are large compared to the damping rate. For a weak instability the opposite is true and with just a resistive impedance the instability would always be weak and independent of the bunch length. The interaction of a bunch with its own radiation emitted midway between parallel plates leads to a strong instabil-ity for long bunches and a transition to weak instability if the bunch length becomes shorter. This regime is ana-lysed numerically with a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck solver. The results are compared to recent observations at ANKA. An attempt is made to explain the remaining discrepan-cies by including higher order terms of the momentum compaction factor into these calculations. There are indi-cations that the simple model needs refinements in order to take radiation from upstream dipoles into account. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB007,

The most recent revision of the code introduced arbitrary order basis functions and curved meshes; for both triangular and quadrilateral unstructured meshes. This led to significant increases in convergence rates. However; due to the utilization of curved meshes and the complex coordinate transformations that are involved; spurious modes were introduced when solving the axisymmetric problem. Although workarounds do exist that circumvent these issues by lowering the likelihood and frequency of spurious modes; linear triangular meshes with higher order basis functions were chosen due to their simplicity and spurious free solutions. In order to support the usage of spline cavities as an alternative parameterization to the well known elliptical cavities; parameter space scans were carried out for non-reentrant spline cavities. In addition a new optimization strategy is presented that exploits the arbitrary polynomial order of Bézier curves by utilizing the degree elevation technique.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB011,

These codes model the evolution of both the electromagnetic fields inside a laser-driven DLA and the beam phase space very accurately. The main drawback of these codes is that they are computationally very expensive. While the simulation of a single DLA period is feasible with these codes; long multi-period structures cannot be studied without access to HPC clusters. We present a fast particle tracking tool for the simulation of long DLA structures. DLATracker is a parallelized code based on the analytical reconstruction of the in-channel electromagnetic fields and a Boris/Vay-type particle pusher. It computational kernel is written in OpenCL and can run on both CPUs and GPUs. The main code is following a modular approach and is written in Python 2.7.

In conjunction with a collective coherent force; e.g. longitudinal space-charge (LSC); bunch compressors can possibly cause a wavelength dependent amplification of initial density inhomogeneities; potentially to an extent detrimental to the operation of the FEL. A common model; consisting of LSC; acceleration (kicks); and magnetic chicanes (drift-type maps); is governed by a time-discrete Vlasov-Poisson system. Such systems have been successfully simulated using mesh based representations of the phase space density (PSD) and the method of characteristics for the update step. However; for the irregular and exotic PSDs; prevalent in FEL applications; a homogeneous high resolution discretization on a naive rectangular mesh can be prohibitively wasteful. Here we present an approach based on adaptive tree refinement that addresses the complexity of the PSDs and allows for the efficient simulation of LSC-driven micro-bunching in FELs.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab014_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab014.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab014_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB014,

The systematic simulation studies for beam instability by including the space charge effect has been done by using the ORBIT code. The simulation results are well reproduced in the corresponding measurements. The designed 1 MW beam power has recently been accomplished by keeping sextuple magnets off in order to stabilize the beam by utilizing the large lattice chromaticity throughout the entire acceleration period. The RCS simultaneously delivers extracted beam to the MLF (Material and Life Science Experimental Facility) and the MR (Main Ring). In order to ensure 1 MW beam power at the MLF even when RCS beam sharing to the MR is twice increased as well as when a second target station is constructed at the MLF; a beam power of 1.5 MW has to be realized in the RCS.

The Novosibirsk FEL is based on the multi-turn energy recovery linac (ERL). The ERL operate in CW mode with an average current about 10 mA. Therefore non-destructive beam diagnostics is preferable. The beam energy at the last track of the ERL is 42 MeV. As a result; significant part of synchrotron radiation from bending magnets is in the visible range. The transverse beam dimensions were measured with the optical diagnostics before and after the undulator applied for generation of middle-infrared coherent radiation. The obtained data is used to calculate the beam energy spread and emittance.

Discs are then joint together by diffusion bonding. The rest of important technical systems; such as vacuum; cooling and manifolds; to house damping silicon carbide absorbers; are brazed to the bonded disc stack afterwards. This manufacturing technique has been successfully demonstrated but it is very challenging and needs an accurate assembly at every production step. Main issues concern vacuum-tightness; misalignment; deformations during different assembly operations; defects of braz-ing/bonding operations (gaps; a leak of brazing material) etc. Preparation and repairs are time and resource con-suming and increase the final price of the accelerating structure.

Under the presence of such angle the closed orbits of the individual bunches in the bunch train varies due to the long-range beam-beam effects. These variations leave a signature as a non zero transverse offset at the collision points visible in the front and trail of the bunch train. When operation team aims for the optimised beam orbit and therefore maximised luminosity; those front and tail bunches due to the overall offset experience reduced luminosity. This paper describes an overview of the existing tool for simulating these effects and compares to operational data.

The Particle In Cell solver originally included in PyECLOUD later developed into a stand-alone general purpose library (PyPIC) that now includes advanced features like a refined modeling of curved boundaries and optimized resolution based on the usage of nested grids. The effects of the e-cloud on the beam dynamics can be simulated interfacing PyECLOUD with the PyHEADTAIL code.

These simulations have recently been crosschecked with a new simulation code called RF-Track; developed at CERN to simulate low energy accelerators. RF-Track can track multiple-specie beams at arbitrary energies; taking into account the full electromagnetic particle-to-particle inter-action.

However; the double EEX beamline also has potential limitations due to coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and transverse jitter. The former limitation arises because double EEX uses twice as many bending magnets as single EEX which means stronger CSR effects degrading the beam quality. The latter limitation arises because a longitudinal jitter in front of the first EEX beamline is converted into a transverse jitter in the middle section (between the EEX beamlines) which can cause beam loss or beam degradation. In this paper; we numerically explore the effects of these two limitations on the emittance and beam transport.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB061,

We are investigating this as an alternative to the normal magnetic chicane bunch compressor. The chicane method requires a longitudinal chirp before the chicane (since it relies on the path length difference of different energies) which results in an unwanted chirp after the compressor. Alternatively; the EEX method uses quadrupole magnets to compress the bunch.

The growth process usually produces photoemissive material layers with rough surface profiles that lead to transverse accelerating fields and possible work function variation resulting in emittance growth. To better understand the effects of surface roughness on emitted electron beams; we have developed realistic three-dimensional models for photocathode materials with grated surface structures. They include general modeling of electron excitation due to photon absorption; charge transport and emission from rough surfaces taking into account image charge and field enhancement effects.

While these lower emittances should translate to improved lasing efficiency and higher peak brightness in FELs; these beams are commensurately more vulnerable to coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) for the selfsame reasons. Conserving these ultralow emittances through the bunch compressors in an FEL given their increased propensity to emit CSR is particularly challenging. We investigate the possibility of imposing a large energy chirp at terahertz wavelengths to reduce the required magnetic fields in the compressor; counteracting the ultralow emittance in the generation of CSR. A second; higher frequency THz chirper would then be used to dechirp the beam after the chicane. Operation at THz as opposed to conventional radiofrequencies offers significantly larger chirp at similar input powers; yet still with wavelengths greater than typical FEL bunch lengths (several femtoseconds).

Numerical simulations of the 2D/3D CSR effects have been extremely challenging due to computational bottlenecks associated with calculating retarded potentials via integrating over the history of the bunch. We present a new high-performance 2D; particle-in-cell code which uses massively parallel multicore GPU/GPU platforms to alleviate computational bottlenecks. The code formulates the CSR problem from first principles by using the retarded scalar and vector potentials to compute the self-interaction fields. The speedup due to the parallel implementation on GPU/CPU platforms exceeds three oders of magnitude; thereby bringing a previously intractable problem within reach. The accuracy of the code is verified against analytic 1D solutions (rigid bunch) and semi-analytic 2D solutions for the chirped bunch.

The complexity of the non-linear dynamics makes it challenging to perform such simulations which require millions of turns. Until recently; most of the methods used linear approximations and/or tracking for a limited number of turns. We have developed a framework which exploits a massively parallel Graphical Processing Units (GPU) architecture to allow for tracking millions of turns in a sympletic way up to an arbitrary order and colliding them at each turn. The code is called GHOST for GPU-accelerated High-Order Symplectic Tracking. As of now; there is no other code in existence that can accurately model the single-particle non-linear dynamics and the beam-beam effect at the same time for a large enough number of turns required to verify the long-term stability of a collider.

The algorithm; which is a general one and it is not restricted on a mid-plane symmetry; is based on the Taylor series expansion of the magnetic field components in terms of the normal to the plane location. The coefficients of the Taylor series expansion are expressed in terms of the on-plane derivatives of the field components which are generated by the measured magnetic field components on the grid of the plane.

Therefore; a Kalman [1] filter based approach was developed and implemented as FPGA firmware to act as the core part of a detuning compensation algorithm. It relies on a fit by a second order model to a measured transfer function of cavity's forced oscillations with damping; caused by piezo drives and data about observed current phase with some adjustable confidence rate. The initial data for this core is taken from field detection firmware on mTCA.4's SIS8300-L2 digitizer; transferred by low latency links to a carrier board equipped by piezo drive controller where the DSP processing by the Kalman algorithm performed. The processing is characterized by a 550 kHz rate in pipeline mode and occupies almost all DSP resources of the Spartan 6 FPGA chip.

With the FAIR project the complexity of the accelerator facility increases further and for efficiency reasons it is recommended to establish a high level of automation for future operation. Modern Accelerator Control Systems allow a fast access to both; accelerator settings and beam diagnostics data. This provides the opportunity to implement algorithms for automated adjustment of e.g. magnet settings to maximize transmission and optimize required beam parameters. The fast-switching magnets in GSI-beamlines are an optimal basis for an automatic exploration of the parameter-space.

The low-level RF (LLRF) systems of FAIR have to support multi-harmonic operations; barrier bucket generation and bunch compression in order to meet the desired beam quality requirements. All this imposes several requirements on the LLRF systems. For example the phase error of the gap voltage of a specific RF cavity must be less than 3 degrees. Thus; each individual component must have a better accuracy. The RF reference signals for the FAIR synchrotron RF cavity systems are generated by direct digital synthesis (DDS). Four so-called Group DDS modules are mounted in one crate. In the supply rooms; the reference signals of such a crate are then distributed to local cavity LLRF systems. Therefore; the precise phase calibration of Group DDS modules is of importance. A phase calibration method with respect to the absolute phases of DDS modules defined by means of the FAIR Bunch Phase Timing System (BuTiS) is developed; and its precision is under evaluation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab097_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab097.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab097_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB097,

Hence; the associated LLRF has to be applicable to different RF systems; with respect to the cavity layout and the power amplifier used; as well as to variable repetition rates and amplitudes. Since already the first barrier bucket pulse of a long sequence has to meet certain minimum demands; an open-loop control on the basis of calibration data is foreseen. Closed-loop control is required to improve the signal quality during a sequence of pulses and to adapt to changing conditions like temperature drifts. A test setup was realized that allows controlling the signal generator; reading out the oscilloscope as well as processing the collected data. Frequency and time domain methods can be implemented to approach the dynamics of the RF system successively and under operating conditions; i.e. generating single sine pulses.

In addition the cavity is controlled to follow a prescribed resonance frequency ramp. In SIS100 the acceleration will be performed by ferrite cavities with comparatively small quality factors.

It is not only used just to accelerate particles but also to shape the bunches at bunch compressors. It is really important to control and measure the field as seen by the beam while usually only indirect (not using the beam) field measurements are available*. Since they are affected by many contributions the measurements must be always calibrated to the beam. Usually this calibration is performed at special operating conditions that prevents normal operation of the accelerator. During normal operation the calibrations is assumed to not drift which is certainly not perfectly true and introduce some control errors. The paper shows how to extract the RF-beam calibration from RF signals during normal operating condition (when RF feed-back; beam loading compensation; learning feed-forward etc. are active).

Target beam current for Phase-1 needed for sufficient vacuum scrubbing was achieved in both 7-GeV electron and 4-GeV positron rings. This presentation summarize the operation results related to low level RF (LLRF) control issues during the Phase-1 commissioning; including the system tuning; the coupled bunch instability and the bunch gap transient effect. RF system of SuperKEKB consists of about thirty klystron stations in both rings. Newly developed LLRF control system; which is composed of recent digital technique; is applied to the nine stations among the thirty for Phase-1. The RF reference signal distribution system has been also upgraded for SuperKEKB. These new systems worked well without serious problem and they contributed to smooth progress of the commissioning. The old existing systems; which had been used in the KEKB operation; were still reused for the most stations; and they also worked as soundly as performed in the KEKB operation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab114_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab114.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab114_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB114,

Phase-I commissioning was operated from February to June in 2016. The purpose of this accelerator is to aim at the higher luminosity than KEKB; so a larger beam current is made for it. In the future plan; beam currents in the electron and positron rings will be increased to 2.6A and 3.6A; respectively. As we consider beam dynamics in the storage ring; higher mode instability associated with the accelerating mode will be caused by a large beam current. Especially the target instability of this study is called μ=-2 mode Coupled Bunch Instability. To suppress it; we developed new feedback components for longitudinal coupled bunch instability. We have same mechanism feedback components for KEKB; but it supports only μ=-1 mode instability. Since a large current makes μ=-1 mode instability big; there is a possibility that suppression is difficult only by using KEKB components. In order to deal with this problem; new components we developed support μ=-1; -2; and -3 mode instabilities; and we improved the performance and usability as compared to existing components. We schedule studies using a beam at Phase-II.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab115_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab115.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab115_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB115,

The renewal of them with modern digital ones is underway and the developed LLRF system will be used for the operation of SPring-8-II. We built an amplitude and phase stabilizing system with commercial MicroTCA.4 modules. A motor driver controlled through EtherCAT was newly adapted to the cavity tuner. The system was implemented to the high power rf test stand which consists of a 1 MW klystron; a circulator; and a 508.58 MHz cavity. The rf power was successfully regulated to keep the cavity voltage with an amplitude deviation of less than 0.1% and a phase stability of less than 0.1 degree in rms. We are also developing new MTCA.4 modules: a digitizer AMC having sampling rate of 370 MHz and 16bit resolution; and a signal conditioning RTM.

To enable ongoing development when access to these devices is not possible (for whatever the reason), Kameleon was implemented. It is a behavior-rich, non-memoryless and time-aware generic simulator that handles clients through a TCP/IP connection. An instance of this client is an EPICS IOC or a Tango Device Server. Kameleon consumes a user-defined file that describes the commands received from a client and, optionally, the reaction to these through statuses sent back to the client. Key features are: 1) Ubiquitous (runs in disparate platforms such as Windows and Linux). 2) Behavior-rich (predefined behaviors as well as user-defined). 3) Non-memoryless (the state of the simulation can be preserved between events and/or elapsed time). 4) Time-aware (statuses can be sent to the client either event-based or time-based). 5) Flexible (commands and statuses are described in a simple user-defined file - nothing is hard-coded in Kameleon).

The main magnets of the SPS are regulated with a current loop; but it has turned out that hysteresis effects from the main dipoles have a significant impact on reproducibility and hence efficiency and availability. Beam and machine parameters were found to depend on the programmed sequence of magnetic cycles - the so-called super cycle - representing the production of the different beams. The scientific program of the SPS requires frequent changes of the supercycle composition and the effect of the main magnet hysteresis has to be understood; modelled and used in accelerator control system. This paper summarises the first main field measurements carried out with the currently available systems during operational conditions as well as measurements of vital machine and beam parameters as a function of the super cycle composition. Finally; ideas will be presented to provide reproducibility by automatically correcting different parameters taking the magnetic history of the main magnets into account.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab146_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab146.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab146_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB146,

It is equipped with flat vacuum chambers to accommodate the large horizontal beam size required during transition crossing and slow extraction. At low energy; the vertical acceptance becomes critical with high intensity large emittance fixed target beams. Optimizing the vertical available aperture is a key ingredient to optimize transmission and reduce activation around the ring. Aperture measurements are routinely carried out after each shutdown. Global vertical aperture measurements are followed by detailed bump scans at the locations with the loss peaks. During the 2016 run a tool was developed to provide an automated local aperture scan around the entire ring. This allowed to establish detailed reference measurements of the vertical aperture and identify directly the SPS aperture bottlenecks. The methodology applied for the scans will be briefly described in this paper and the analysis discussed. Finally; the 2016 SPS measured vertical aperture will be presented and compared to the results obtained with the previous method.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpab147_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpab147.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpab147_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPAB147,

Furthermore; the radiation spectrum carries information of the electron distribution which allows ultrashort electron bunch length measurements. For verifying correct measuring procedure during the CTR and CUR experiments; a conventional THz radiation generated by optical rectification from a ZnTe crystal has been performed. The produced THz pulse was sent into a Michelson interferometer which is designed for the autocorrelation of the intense; sub-mm and mm-wavelength; spatially-coherent radiation pulses.

Equally; given the large number of variables involved in optimising the ring performance; the true; global optimum solution may be difficult to identify using simple parameter scans. In order to address this problem; a flexible optimisation tool has been developed.

This means that the ions (typically radioactive ions produced via the ISOL method) have to be extracted from a source at a terminal voltage in excess of 60 kV. Presently the ISAC target modules cannot hold more than 54 kV (and some lower than this) so that some of the higher masses cannot be successfully accelerated. A small 3-gap RF structure at 11.8 MHz has been designed to provide an energy matching to the RFQ.

Two sets of magnets have been produced: six quadrupoles of strength 23.62T/m and six combined-function (asymmetrical) Halbach magnets of 19.12T/m with a central field of 0.377T. These were assembled using a 3D printed plastic mould inside an aluminium tube for strength. A shim holder; which is also 3D printed; is fitted within the magnet bore and holds iron wires of particular masses that cancel the multipole errors measured using a rotating coil on the unshimmed magnet. A single iteration of shimming reduces error multipoles by a factor of 4 on average.

This circuit consists of the RF input coupler; a trombone-type phase shifter and a stub tuner. The coupler with a loop antenna and the stub tuner are located in edges of the circuit; the loop antenna and the tuner work for a short plate. When RF input power is injected into the circuit; a high-voltage standing wave is excited by adjusting the tuner. The power of standing wave required for the tests is also accumulated due to its low resistive loss. At the operation frequency of 175 MHz; the resistive loss of 0.046ohm is measured and an equivalent RF power of 200 kW is accumulated by the RF input power of 740 W. In this circuit; the bandwidth is narrow to be ±5 kHz in S11 parameter of less -20 dB; but the equivalent RF power of 200 kW-14 sec CW could be achieved after sufficient RF aging. Using this high-Q load circuit; all the fabricated 9 couplers were successfully tested for RF contact defects; unnecessary low-Q value and extraordinary outgassing.

In this design; TM020 resonant mode is used for beam acceleration. Power of higher-order (or lower-order) modes are extracted through cylindrical slots which are placed at the position where the magnetic fields of HOMs are strong while that of TM020 mode is zero. Extracted powers are absorbed by lossy ferrites. In this scheme; excellent HOM damping is possible while occupying less space of the straight section in storage rings. We propose in this paper an alternative design which is based on the same TM020 mode but with rod-type HOM couplers. The rod-type HOM couplers are placed where the electric fields of HOMs are strong while that of TM020 mode is zero. In this scheme; openings needed for HOM extraction can be made smaller; which is desirable for stiffening the mechanical structure of the cavity. Potential use of lossy dielectric materials is another merit. We present external Q-values of HOMs that can be achieved in this scheme; as well as an effect of HOM couplers on the TM020 mode.

To mitigate intrabeam scattering due to ultra-low emittance; the bunch length will be elongated using the harmonic cavities which is based on the TM020 resonant mode. An accelerating cavity based on this mode was first proposed by Ego et al.**; and we found it very suitable for the harmonic cavities due to the following reasons: 1) it has high unloaded-Q and high stored electromagnetic energy which result in the reduction of transient beam-loading effect due to bunch gaps; and 2) efficient damping of higher (or lower) order modes is possible. Our investigations based on numerical simulations predicted the bunch elongation by a factor of 3.1 when realistic bunch-gaps were assumed. To improve the bunch elongation further; we also proposed to compensate the transient beam loading with two realistic measures: 1) compensation of rf voltages due to feedforward technique; and 2) compensation using a separate rf cavity.

At date; the actuators are two stripline kickers oriented in the horizontal and in the vertical plane; respectively. Apart from providing feedback in the transverse plane; the horizontal stripline is simultaneously operating as a longitudinal kicker. This is done by upconverting the longitudinal 0 - 50 MHz baseband signal to the 150 MHz - 250 MHz range where the longitudinal shunt impedance of the stripline is higher. This signal is then fed to the stripline electrodes in common-mode.

This far; negative feedback has been applied in the longitudinal plane by a stripline kicker at lower ring currents. However; the maximum longitudinal feedback voltage provided by the stripline is rather weak; and a waveguide overload cavity was therefore designed in order to suppress CBMIs at higher ring currents as well. Due to the long bunch length in the MAX IV storage rings; a relatively low center frequency of 625 MHz is selected. The new cavity kicker has been manufactured; and will be installed in the 3 GeV ring during the summer shut-down of 2017. In this paper; the RF and mechanical design of the cavity is presented.

The CERN magnet group has carried out extensive investigations on accelerator magnets for very low fields; comprising theoretical studies and the construction of several prototype magnets; to ensure that the required field quality can be reached at these very low fields. In the course of this work; experimental investigations [1] led to the initially unexpected observation that dilution of the yoke; i.e. alternating laminations made of electric steel with thicker non-magnetic stainless steel laminations; increases the remnant field. An explanation for this behaviour has already been anticipated in a previous paper [2]. Here; we treat this specific topic in analytical detail. We come to the conclusion that magnet yoke thinning in most practical situations does not improve the field quality at very low field levels; but rather enhances the impact from hysteresis and remanence effects.; [1] L.Fiscarelli; Magnetic measurements on the quadrupoles prototypes for ELENA (PXMQNLGNAP); CERN internal report.

Thus; the duration of the ramps must not be too long to avoid excessive blow up due to IBS. On the other hand; the bending magnets are C-shaped and the vacuum chambers are without insulated junctions; which are difficult for fully baked machines; thus; the ramps must not be too short.

The longitudinal magnetic field calculation along the beam centerline has been carried out in this study. The estimated Bz is obtained based on Biot-Savart law calculation. Then; it is verified by field measurement using Gauss meter at specific centerline locations. Calibration process is performed by comparing the calculated and measured Bz fields at selected operation settings. The comparison result is presented in this report.

They have an aperture of 202 mm and a yoke length of 303 mm; so the end effects are significant. The iron poles and the yoke are asymmetric and the coils are driven by a 50Hz; 400 A AC current; biased with a DC current of 665 A. Therefore the yoke has to be laminated; and the laminations are slitted up to a depth of 90 mm on each side to further reduce the eddy current losses. Two 3D models (DC and transient) have been developed using OPERA 3D for different purposes. Both models require the use of an anisotropic BH curve for the yoke; and the transient model also requires an anisotropic conductivity and a prismatic/hexahedral mesh to overcome the limitations of the linear tetrahedral edge elements in OPERA's vector potential formulation. The quadrupole field quality was originally measured in 1982 with a DC excitation at the biased peak current (1065 A) and those measurements are now compared to both models. The iron losses due to the eddy currents are also presented and compared to the original specifications defined in 1980; as well as an estimation of the eddy currents in the coils.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpik104_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpik104.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpik104_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPIK104,

Magnetron trans-mitters excited by a resonant (injection-locking) phase-modulated signal can provide phase and power control with the rates required for precise stabilization of phase and amplitude of the accelerating field in Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities of the intensity-frontier accelerators. An innovative technique that can significantly increase the magnetron transmitter efficiency at the wide-range power control required for superconducting accelerators was developed and verified with the 2.45 GHz magnetrons operating in CW and pulsed regimes.

The purpose of the AM is to compensate for microphonics in super conducting cavities by maintaining a constant gradient. The frequency range for the microphones is below 200 Hz. At these frequencies; eddy currents are encountered in the magnetron anode that reduce the effectiveness of the varying magnetic field on the magnetron current.

A novel technique has been proposed for a method for reducing the charging effects by filling nano sized pores in the ceramic with a conductive medium. Pores in ceramics can be formed in a chain with varying depths depending on sintering temperatures and methods for creating the pores. In the pre-formed condition of these novel ceramics; a nanoparticle slurry is infused by capillary action into the ceramic and fired at temperatures and atmospheres to stabilize the conductive medium inside the ceramic.

As determined by physics needs; the operational parameters of this magnet place it between fast rising kicker magnets with short duration and slow rising (or DC) resistive magnets which are optimized for efficiency and current-based power loss. This magnet must operate efficiently with over 91% duty factor and have a modestly fast rise time. The resulting design uses a resistive magnet scheme; to optimize the current-based losses; that is pulsed using a new circuit to control the applied voltage. The magnet has a laminated; iron dominated; H-shaped core. Directly-cooled copper pancake coils energize the magnet.

Above this limit the transverse space charge force in combination with the lattice structure causes beam quality degradation and beam loss. Proposed devices to mitigate this beam loss in ion beams are electron lenses. An electron lens imparts a nonlinear; localized focusing kick to counteract the (global) space-charge forces in the primary beam. This effort is met with many challenges; including a reduced dynamic aperture (DA); resonance crossing; and beam-beam alignment.

They combine strong electrostatic focusing with the possibility of space charge compensation and provide an attractive alternative to conventional ion beam optics in a LEBT section. The focusing performance strongly depends on the density and distribution of the enclosed electron plasma*. As the Gabor lens is usually operated close to the ion source; residual gas ionization is supposed to be the central electron generation mechanism. An electron source is introduced in order to investigate the possibility of boosting the electron density in plasma traps using the example of a Gabor lens. This way; a Gabor lens could be operated under XUHV conditions; where residual gas ionization is suppressed.

By using the test statistic from the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test the author visualises the change in the normalised distributions by looking at the supremum distance between the cumulative distribution functions in comparison; and the propagation of the deviation throughout the ESS linac. This approach identifies changes in the distribution which may cause losses in the linac and highlights the parts where the space-charge has big impact on the beam distribution.

The beam induced voltage can be computed in frequency or time domain using a slicing of the beam profile. This technique is adopted by many codes including CERN BLonD. The slicing acts as a frequency filter and cuts high frequency noise but also physical contributions if the resolution is not sufficient. Moreover; a linear interpolation usually defines the voltage for all the macro-particles; and this can be another source of unphysical effects. The MuSiC code describes interaction between the macro-particles with the wakes generated only by resonator impedances. The complications related to the slices are avoided; but the voltage can contain high frequency noise. In addition; since the computational time scales with the number of resonators and macro-particles; having a large number of them can be cumbersome. In this paper the features of the different approaches are described together with benchmarks between them and analytical formulas; considering both single and multi-turn wakes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpva022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpva022.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpva022_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPVA022,

In 2021; after the LHC injectors upgrade; 3 eVs should be extracted to the PS. Even if the current method may satisfy the new requirements; it relies on low-power level RF improvements. In this paper another method of blow-up was considered; that is the injection of band-limited phase noise in the main RF system (h=1); never tried in PSB but already used in CERN SPS and LHC; under different conditions (longer cycles). This technique; which lowers the peak line density and therefore the impact of intensity effects in the PSB and the PS; can also be complementary to the present method. The longitudinal space charge; dominant in the PSB; causes significant synchrotron frequency shifts with intensity; and its effect should be taken into account. Another complication arises from the interaction of the phase loop with the injected noise; since both act on the RF phase. All these elements were studied in simulations of the PSB cycle with the BLonD code; and the required blow-up was achieved.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpva024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpva024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpva024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPVA024,

Self-consistent beams are defined to be ellipsoidal distributions with uniform density and to retain these properties under all linear transformations. Self-consistent distributions may generate very little halo if realized in practice. Some may also be manipulated to generate flat beams. Self-consistent distributions involve very special relationships between the phase space coordinates; making them difficult to realize experimentally. One self-consistent distribution; the 2D rotating distribution; can be painted into the SNS ring; with slight modification of the lattice. However; it is unknown how robust self-consistent distributions will be under real world transport in the presence of nonlinearities and other collective effects.

To avoid a dedicated distribution infrastructure for radiofrequency (RF) signals between each source and destination synchrotron; a new approach has been developed to transmit bunch and bucket phase information using synchronous Ethernet. This allows to locally regenerate all reference signals needed for the RF synchronization prior to a bunch-to-bucket transfer; as well as the triggers to the kickers. The modular and configurable hardware implementation based on the White Rabbit network progresses towards a proof-of-principle demonstrator. Besides the synchronization of revolution and RF frequencies; the bunches in the source accelerator must be aligned in azimuth with respect to the buckets in the receiving synchrotron.

This enables to selectively cool areas where heat is generated and to decouple them from the temperature-sensitive areas of the sensor system. Passive thermography is used during our development work mainly to validate the results of thermal simulations; for design optimization and for the functional control of the carrier structure. Additionally active thermography allows us to identify anomalies and thermal disturbances; which remain unnoticed in static processes.

It is similar to the approach used by Superfish codes for drift-tube linacs (DTL); where a few single cells at representative beam velocities are tuned in 2D and their geometrical parameters are interpolated to cover the required beam-velocity range. The method is implemented using 3D electromagnetic (EM) modeling with CST MicroWave Studio; which allows its application for various types of resonators; e.g.; for H-mode cavities. Interpolating results of 3D EM design of tuned representative single-cell cavities leads to a 3D multi-cell cavity model that can be finalized with just a few small adjustments. As a challenging application example; we design multi-cell resonators of three types - cross-bar (CH) and inter-digital (IH) H-mode; as well as DTL - for accelerating muons in the velocity range of v/c = 0.08-0.3; and compare their performance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpva071_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpva071.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpva071_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPVA071,

Routine verification measurements in the synchrotron involve beam emittance; dispersion as well as tunes and chromaticity. The horizontal and vertical emittance are measured using scraping plates and a direct current transformer. The dispersion function in the ring is determined by sweeping the synchrotron RF frequency while measuring the beam position in the shoe-box pick-ups. The horizontal and vertical betatron tune and chromaticity are measured with Direct Diode Detection electronics; developed at CERN; while changing the beam position with the RF radial loop.

The second verification step consists in testing the full functionality of the therapy accelerator; including the medical frontend: scanning magnets performance; intensity monitoring and safety features. The final verification step is the quality assurance (QA) done by the medical department. An extended set of reference measurements assures the fast identification of the faulty components in case of a performance deviation; and the totality of the accumulated data allows in-depth analysis of the accelerator performance.

In this first data supply model beam re-acceleration or deceleration between two arbitrary extraction energies is defined. The model defines an additional transition phase; i.e. current/set value patterns between extraction and the re-acceleration yet giving the possibility of setting the beam properties suitable for further acceleration/deceleration.

The TR24 cyclotron produced and commercialized by ACSI (Canada) delivers a 16-25 MeV proton beam with intensity from few nA up to 500 mcA. The solenoidal focusing instead of existing quadrupole one is proposed in this report. The changing of the focusing elements will give the better beam matching with the acceptance of the spiral inflector of the cyclotron. The parameters of the focusing solenoid is found. Additionally; the main parameters of the bunching system are evaluated in the presence of the beam space charge. This system consists of the buncher installed in the axial injection beam line of the cyclotron. The using of the greedless multi harmonic buncher may increase the accelerated beam current and will give the opportunity to a new proton beam applications.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpva121_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpva121.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpva121_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPVA121,

Due to the interactions of protons in these components there will be an additional neutron dose at the location where a patient is positioned during a proton therapy. The results of numerical study of this additional dose are presented. Neutron prompt dose at the patient position is estimated through the Monte Carlo simulation using the MCNPX 2.7.0 particle transport code. Secondary neutron and photon fluxes from the distinct beam loss points are taken into consideration and the resulting dose is calculated using realistic estimates of beam losses. The dependence of the dose on the beam energy and individual impacts of each loss point on the total dose at the patient position as well as on critical beam line components are estimated and potential design constraints are discussed. It has been found that compared with a conventional gantry the expected additional dose is higher but the optimization of the beam line configuration and additional shielding shall help to reduce the dose to an acceptable value. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpva123_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpva123.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpva123_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPVA123,

This is realized by a special structure design where accelerating structure cells are made out of copper plated stainless steel with knife edges and structure irises - copper disks acts also as gaskets for vacuum and RF seal. Besides the reduced cost; brazeless assembly allows integration of effective cooling and magnet optics elements into accelerator cells.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/talks/thpva148_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/papers/thpva148.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2017/posters/thpva148_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2017-THPVA148,
