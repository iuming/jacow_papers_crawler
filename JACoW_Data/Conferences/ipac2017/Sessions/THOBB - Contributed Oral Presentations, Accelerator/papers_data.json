        "High gradient RF photoguns have been a key development to enable several applications of high quality electron beams. They allow the generation of beams with very high peak current and low transverse emittance",
        "satisfying the tight demands for free-electron lasers",
        "energy recovery Linacs",
        "Compton/Thomson Sources and high-energy linear colliders. A new fabrication technique for this type of structures has been recently developed and implemented at the Laboratories of the National Institute of Nuclear physics in Frascati (LNF-INFN",
        "Italy). It is based on the use of special RF-vacuum gaskets that allow avoiding brazing in the realization process. The S-band gun of the Compton-based ELI-NP gamma beam system (GBS) has been fabricated with this new technique. It operates at 100 Hz with 120 MV/m cathode peak field and long RF pulses to allow the 32 bunch generation foreseen for the GBS. High gradient tests have been performed at full power full repetition rate and have shown the extremely good performances of the structure in term of breakdown rates. In the paper we report and discuss all experimental results with details of the electromagnetic design and mechanical realization processes."
