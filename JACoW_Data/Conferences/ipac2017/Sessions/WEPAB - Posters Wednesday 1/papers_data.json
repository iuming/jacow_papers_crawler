        "Synchrotron SOLEIL has just turned 10 years since its commissioning. The 2.75 GeV facility is now delivering very stable photon beams to 29 beam lines. A total of 5 operation modes are available in top-up. Maintaining and updating the key performance metric remains a daily work facing both aging of components and tighter operation requirements. Low-alpha operation is attracting more beam lines leading us to an upgrade of the Booster (BOO) radiofrequency (RF) system in order to increase the injection efficiency into the storage ring (SR). The femtoslicing experiment is now in production for a hard X-ray beam line; a dedicated chicane has been installed for a second beam line in the soft X-ray regime. The two long canted beam lines can operate simultaneously at minimum gaps since May 2016 thanks to the introduction of a dedicated photon absorber and a fast angle interlock. R&D work in several areas will be reported. In parallel lattice design are in progress both for short term and long term evolution of the ring performance."

        "Linear optics modifications in order to improve injec-tion efficiency and for the installation of two IDs in one straight section demand an optimization of the sextupole correction scheme. Four harmonic sextupole families were sufficient with the earlier 8-fold symmetric lattice. Today there are ten families of harmonic sextupole mag-nets in addition to the three families of chromatic sextu-poles. This paper describes our experimental approach to find better settings for these harmonic sextupoles based on the direct optimization of the injection efficiency with a longitudinal phase offset between storage ring and the injector - in our case a booster synchrotron. As demon-strated in the paper",
        "the resulting improvement of the phase acceptance of the ring leads to increased momen-tum acceptance by suppressing 3rd order non-systematic resonances. This increases not only the injection effi-ciency for long bunches but also the Touschek lifetime",

The life time of the electron beam was reduced from 15 to 12 hours at a high field level of the wiggler (2.5 T) even though the coherent shift of vertical tune was compensated locally. Computer simulations show the non-linear nature of the effect. The ANKA storage ring operates with strong sextupoles at a positive chromaticity of +2/+6. Even residual octupole components of the wiggler field",

Betatron tunes of ANKA have been shifted away of suspected high-order resonances and beam life time was essentially improved."

Another useful application of harmonic lasing is so called Harmonic Lasing Self-Seeded Free Electron Laser (HLSS FEL) that allows to improve spectral brightness of these facilities. In the past",
        "harmonic lasing has been demonstrated in the FEL oscillators in infrared and visible wavelength ranges",

In this paper we report on the first evidence of the harmonic lasing and the first operation of the HLSS FEL at the soft X-ray FEL user facility FLASH in the wavelength range between 4.5 nm and 15 nm. Spectral brightness was improved in comparison with Self-Amplified Spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL by a factor of six in the exponential gain regime. A better performance of HLSS FEL with respect to SASE FEL in the post-saturation regime with a tapered undulator was observed as well. The first demonstration of harmonic lasing in a high-gain FEL and at a short wavelength paves the way for a variety of applications of this new operation mode in X-ray FELs."

      "abstract": "Up to now two FEL concepts are known in conventional accelerators: 1.) In THz lasers an off-crest cavity adds a chirp to the bunch followed by a bunch compressor. Particles with different energies travel on different trajectories to the radiator. 2.) For EUV and X-ray FELs the beam enters an undulator which produces microbunches which then radiate. In this paper it is proposed to copy the THz laser scheme for EUV lasers. The incoming beam is chirped and a dogleg forces afterwards the particles with different energies to move on different parallel trajectories. Considering a detector plane perpendicular to the trajectories the particles with different energies arrive in general at different times. When in this plane for instance a TGU (Transverse Gradient Undulator) is positioned the emitted radiation in the TGU is monochromatic. If in addition chirp and dogleg are selected in such a way that the particles with different energies arrive at the same time at the entrance of the TGU the radiation is monochromatic and coherent similar to the THz laser concept. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "where the pulse duration is mainly driven by the electron bunch duration",
        "in a seeded FEL the pulse duration can be determined by the seed laser properties. The use of techniques able to locally deteriorate the electron beam properties such as emittance or energy spread have been used in SASE FELs to reduce the region of the electron beam that is able to produce FEL radiation and hence reduce the FEL pulse length. The temporal shaping of the laser heater can be used to create an electron beam characterized by a very large energy spread all along the bunch except for a small region. We report measurements of the effect of the laser heater shaping on the electron beam phase-space performed at FERMI. Impact on the final FEL pulse properties are predicted with a series of numerical simulations."

At the beginning of storage ring operation the lifetime was very short mostly dominated by the ion trapping and residual gas scattering. After a 390 A·h of beam cleaning the measured total lifetime has reached 20 h for 100mA of a stored current. Since the main contribution to the total lifetime in the storage ring comes from single Coulomb and Touschek scattering the dependence of the residual gas pressure and the vertical aperture of storage ring is investigated. Moreover to improve the Touschek lifetime the 3rd harmonic cavities were installed. Recently the cavities were tuned close to the resonance and the total lifetime increased significantly. This presentation will report on the lifetime measurements and calculations carried out for Solaris 1.5 GeV storage ring at different vacuum and RF conditions. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "At synchrotron light storage rings there is demand for serving high-brilliance users requesting multibunch operation while simultaneously serving timing users who require single-bunch operation. One method to accomplish this is PPRE developed and currently in user operation at BESSY-II. In the method",
        "the transverse emittance of one of the bunches in the bunch train is increased by an incoherent betatron excitation. Part of the light from this bunch can then be separated from the multibunch light by an aperture in the beamline",
        "resulting in single-bunch light for the experiment. Methods such as this expand the scope of storage rings without requiring special fill patterns. This is of growing interest due to the upgrade trend towards diffraction-limited storage rings where it becomes more challenging to operate with inhomogeneous fill patterns. Measurements of PPRE were performed at the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring utilizing the bunch-by-bunch feedback system both for excitation and as a diagnostic. Furthermore",
        "measurements involving direct beam imaging at the diagnostics beamline allowed quantifying the effect of this excitation on the horizontal and vertical emittance."

Most important of which are the improvement of the positional stability of the stored electron beam, and the installation of 2 IDs, i.e. a 2.2 T hybrid multipole wiggler and a 6.5 T superconducting wavelength shifter, to extend the available SR spectrum into hard x-ray region. The beam stability improvement was achieved through several activities, including improving the BPM system, upgrading the existing corrector power supplies, and implementing global orbit feedback. The two new IDs provide higher-intensity and higher-energy (up to 25 keV) synchrotron light, which will be utilized for MX, high-energy SAXS, WAXS, XAS, and microtomography. Ongoing machine upgrades include increasing the energy of the booster and transport line to 1.2 GeV for full-energy injection and eventual top-up operation. Utilization of the electron beam is also being explored. A beam test facility, which extracts electron beam in the booster for characterizing high-energy particle sensors, as well as calibrating other beam diagnostic instruments, has been constructed and is now in operation. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "Using a transverse gradient undulator (TGU) is one of the methods proposed in order to enable the utilization of electron beams with large energy spread (such as those from plasma-based accelerators) in a free-electron laser (FEL). Most of the analytical treatments of this scheme assume a linear variation of the undulator field with one of the transverse coordinates. While this assumption leads to a simplified and more tractable model",
        "including higher-order multipoles allows us to offer a more complete and rigorous description of the system. In this paper",
        "we investigate the magnetic field components of a TGU using both theory and simulation and explore the impact of higher-order multipoles on the FEL performance."

In principle the natural emittance can be made ever smaller with stronger magnets and larger rings until it reaches the true diffraction limit for hard X-rays. By considering the scaling laws of linear optics and nonlinear beam dynamics of storage rings and technical challenges",

        "the injector laser plays an important role as the source of the electron beam for the Free Electron Laser (FEL). The beam emittance and FEL performance are highly related to the transverse shape of the injector laser. When the injector laser has hot spots and non-uniformities that can carry over to the electron beam and degrade electron emittance and FEL performance",
        "it requires long hours of manual adjustment by laser engineers and strenuous machine tuneup. The injector laser shaping project at LCLS aims to have precise control of the driver laser transverse profile in order to produce arbitrary electron beam profiles",

We present results of using laser shaping to control the X-ray laser output via an online optimizer. We also show the photocathode quantum efficiency measurements across cathode surface using the DMD."

Dielectric loaded structures operating at 26 GHz are also used in TBA experiments. Another main thrust of the research program consists of exploring and developing techniques to manipulate the phase space of electron bunches. These efforts include bunch shaping and the exchange of emittances in the transverse and the longitudinal phase spaces"
