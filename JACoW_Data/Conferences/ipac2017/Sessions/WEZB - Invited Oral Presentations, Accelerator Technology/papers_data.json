        "solid state power amplifier (SSPA) systems with several hundred kW RF power are now available for various accelerator fields. Following the successful development at 352 MHz that took place at SOLEIL in the 2000s",
        "the technology was transferred to industry and SSPAs at different frequencies",
        "power levels",
        "and pulse lengths have been widely adopted. In this paper we report about the SOLEIL experience with SSPAs and review the used or planned SSPAs in other accelerator facilities."
