        "conductance limitation and high precision and stability positioning requirements. The speaker will review some possible solutions including the use of distributed pumping (NEG coating)",
        "distributed absorber (good thermal conducting material vacuum chamber wall)",
        "and distributed cooling (different water cooling channel design at the location where the synchrotron radiation hits the wall). In situ baking for NEG activation and precise installation will also be covered."
