        "neutrino experiments and from experiments in space are changing the particle physics landscape. In the last decade several accelerator designs and studies have taken shape and reached a high level of maturity both at the high energy and high intensity frontiers. The talk should review the physics questions facing the HEP community and the strategy to address them in view of the next update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics."
