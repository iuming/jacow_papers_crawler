      "abstract": "Minimization of the beta-beating at the two main interaction points of the LHC arising from the head-on and long-range beam-beam interactions can be performed by adjusting the strength of quadrupole or sextupole correctors. This compensation scheme is applied to the current LHC optics where the results show a significant reduction of the peak and RMS beta-beating; and the impact on the dynamic aperture is computed. A proposal for a similar strategy to be adopted in the High Luminosity LHC is also discussed.",
