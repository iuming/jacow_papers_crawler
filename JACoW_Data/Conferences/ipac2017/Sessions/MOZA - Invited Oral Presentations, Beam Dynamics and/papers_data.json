        "Electron cloud effects are one of the main limitations of the performance of the LHC and its injectors. Enormous progress has been done in the simulation of the electron cloud build-up and of the effects on beam stability while mitigation measures have been identified and implemented (scrubbing",
        "low secondary electron yield coatings",
        "etc.). The above has allowed reaching nominal beam parameters in the LHC during Run 2. A review of the studies and results obtained and the strategy and expected performance for the High Luminosity operation of the LHC will be presented."
