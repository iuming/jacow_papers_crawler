        "The existence of a region of hypothetical Super Heavy Elements (SHE) forming region (island) with high stability in the vicinity of the doubly magic nucleus 298 114 was postulated in the mid-1960s. For more than 30 years",
        "scientists hard searched for naturally occurring SHEs and unsuccessfully attempted to synthesize them using heavy ion accelerators. Over the past 15 years the breakthroughs in heavy element synthesis has achieved",
        "using rare actinide targets irradiated with 48Ca beams. More than 52 neutron-rich nuclei including the isotopes of the new element 113-118 and their alpha-decay product where synthesized for the first time. SHE with Z> 40% larger than that of Bi show an impressive extension in nuclear survival: the map of the nuclides have extended up to mass number 294",
        "the 7th row of the periodic Table have completed. The talk will cover this achievement and will give an outlook for the field including any plans at the new facilities: SHE-Factory",
        "SPIRAL-2 and others."
