      "abstract": "The GSI UNILAC has served as injector for all ion species since 40 years. Its 108 MHz Alvarez DTL providing acceleration from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u has suffered from material fatigue and has to be replaced by a new section. The design of the new post-stripper DTL is now under development in GSI. Five Alvarez tanks with four intertank sections provide 100% transmission and low emittance growth. The intertank sections allow for a matched solution and provide place for diagnostics. Simulations along the complete Alvarez DTL were done for 238U28+ using the TraceWin code. The transversal zero current phase advance is 65' for all tanks. Results of beam dynamics simulations for six different scenarios as well as an error study for the FAIR nominal case are presented. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

In order to avoid emittance growth in plasma cells with ultra-high accelerating gradients the injection and transport of electron bunches with beta functions of mm-size or even smaller are required. This kind of bunch is usually space-charged dominated since the energy is low (< 200 MeV) while the peak current is high for allowing the electron bunches to be used for Free Electron-Laser (FEL) generation. We present the beamline design and explore the possible beam parameters at the SINBAD linac by start-to-end simulations."

        "Integrable optics is an innovation in particle accelerator design that enables strong nonlinear focusing without generating parametric resonances. We use a Synergia space-charge simulation to investigate the application of integrable optics to a high-intensity hadron ring that could replace the Fermilab Booster. We find that incorporating integrability into the design suppresses the beam halo generated by a mismatched KV beam. Our integrable rapid cycling synchrotron (iRCS) design includes other features of modern ring design such as low momentum compaction factor and harmonically canceling sextupoles. Experimental tests of high-intensity beams in integrable lattices will take place over the next several years at the Fermilab Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) and the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER)."

Self-consistent beams are defined to be ellipsoidal distributions with uniform density and to retain these properties under all linear transformations. Self-consistent distributions may generate very little halo if realized in practice. Some may also be manipulated to generate flat beams. Self-consistent distributions involve very special relationships between the phase space coordinates",

This paper studies these issues and the mitigation of unwanted effects by applying realistic detailed computational models to the simulation of the injection of rotating beams into SNS. The result is a feasible prescription for the injection of a rotating self-consistent distribution into the SNS ring."

For most experiments a thermionic gun is used as electron source. The cw electron pulse structure so as the pulse charge is realized by applying electrical pulses with specific amplitudes and frequencies on the grid of the gun. The standard cw operation frequency is 13 MHz but can be divided sequentially by the factor 2 down to 101 kHz. For very special pulse structures a so called single pulser module exist performing different patterns also with dark current suppression via a macro pulser gate. For evaluating the performance and hardness under irradiation of e.g. aerospace components much lower doses respectively currents lower than the μA range are required. Furthermore reproducible and stable doses in a specific area for consecutively radiation of samples are necessary. In the presentation the investigations and concepts used at ELBE for the irradiation of different aerospace components are described. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "At the Heidelberg ion beam therapy center (HIT) cancer patients are treated with the raster-scanning dose delivery method of heavy ion pencil beams. The beams are provided by a synchrotron which allows for a variation of the ion penetration depth by changing the ion beam energy for each synchrotron cycle. In order to change the beam energy within one synchrotron cycle the accelerator model and data supply model within the control system have been extended extensively. In this first data supply model beam re-acceleration or deceleration between two arbitrary extraction energies is defined. The model defines an additional transition phase",

The properties of the reaccelerated beam are now under detailed examination. The reaccelerated beam was successfully extracted and guided to the experimental area.

Due to the interactions of protons in these components there will be an additional neutron dose at the location where a patient is positioned during a proton therapy. The results of numerical study of this additional dose are presented. Neutron prompt dose at the patient position is estimated through the Monte Carlo simulation using the MCNPX 2.7.0 particle transport code. Secondary neutron and photon fluxes from the distinct beam loss points are taken into consideration and the resulting dose is calculated using realistic estimates of beam losses. The dependence of the dose on the beam energy and individual impacts of each loss point on the total dose at the patient position as well as on critical beam line components are estimated and potential design constraints are discussed. It has been found that compared with a conventional gantry the expected additional dose is higher but the optimization of the beam line configuration and additional shielding shall help to reduce the dose to an acceptable value. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Experimentally determined transverse dose profiles were acquired using radiation sensitive EBT3 Gafchromic films embedded in the water phantom at various depths. EBT3 Gafchromic films were found to be a suitable dosimeter for relative dose dosimetry of VHEE beams. Simulated and measured results were found to be consistent with each other and the largest discrepancy was found to be no more than 5%.

This is realized by a special structure design where accelerating structure cells are made out of copper plated stainless steel with knife edges and structure irises - copper disks acts also as gaskets for vacuum and RF seal. Besides the reduced cost",
