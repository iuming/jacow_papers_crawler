In the betatron cleaning area, three primary collimators cut the primary halo in horizontal, vertical and skew planes. The beam loss monitors located downstream each of these collimators can be used to diagnose the main plane of loss. We present here a method to identify these beam losses at the LHC and decompose them as a linear combination of loss scenarios using singular value decomposition to calculate Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the scenario matrix. This matrix has been used to evaluate the type of beam losses in different stages of the LHC cycle. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Such state of electron significantly modifies the characteristics of its electromagnetic radiation during further interaction of the particle with substance. We propose to study the influence of the half-bare state of electron upon its transition radiation (TR). The existence of such influence for the case of electron undressing at its scattering was theoretically predicted. We intend to obtain the electrons in half-bare state in the result of their crossing of a conducting screen such as a TR screen. We propose to investigate the influence of the half-bare state of electron in this process upon TR generated by such electron on a downstream TR screen situated on some distance from the upstream screen which undresses the particle. Calculations are presented for the case of a 45-MeV linac and the distance between the screens in the region between 100 mm and 300 mm. The proposed experiment is expected to reveal new features of TR signal in such process comparing to previous measurements.",

In the framework of PETRA IV upgrade scenarios the potential for decreasing the extracted emittance from DESY II has been investigated which can be achieved by lowering the extraction energy to 5 GeV and increasing the focusing in DESY II. In addition measuring the emittance of the extracted beam from DESY II and the optics in the beam transport line can help to better understand and improve the injection efficiency of PETRA III. By changing the quadrupole strength and measuring the beam size downstream on a screen monitor in the E-Weg the emittance of DESY II and the Twiss functions at the quadrupole in the E-Weg have been determined. Measurements at different energies and tunes of DESY II will be shown and compared with calculations."

The designed TDS has the new feature of providing variable polarization of the deflecting field**. The possibility of changing the orientation of the streaking field of the TDS to an arbitrary azimuthal angle allows for 3D characterization of the phase space using tomographic methods***. Moreover the complete 6D characterization of the beam phase space is possible by combining this technique with quadrupole scans and a dipole spectrometer. As this new cavity design requires very high manufacturing precision to guarantee highest azimuthal symmetry of the structure to avoid the deterioration of the polarization of the streaking field",

        "We are developing a stable and precise BPM system for the low-emittance upgrade of SPring-8. One of the essential requirements for the BPM is the long term stabilization of the photon beam by regulating the electron beam orbit. Both the single-pass resolution of 100 um rms for an injected beam charge of 100 pC and an accuracy of 100 um rms are also crucial for beam commissioning. Drift sources of the present BPM system have been investigated extensively",
        "such as humidity-dependent drifts coming from the radiation damage of coaxial cables",
        "and the results are fed back to the design of the new BPM system. We have optimized the design of the button BPM electrodes to reconcile reduction of trapped-mode heating and maximization of the signal intensity. Stringent machining tolerance is imposed on a BPM head to align the BPM electric center accurately. A few kinds of the BPM head prototypes were produced and the machining accuracy",
        "RF characteristics etc. were confirmed to be sufficient. We have installed one of the prototypes in the present storage ring to test the performance of the new BPM system under development",
        "and have been obtaining successful results satisfying the requirements."

Measuring the beam loss is essential for the purpose of machine protections for the facility. A beam position pickup based differential beam current monitoring (BPDBCM) scheme has been proposed for the MEBT section at CIADS. Discussions of the principles for the scheme and the realtionship between beam intensity measurement and the pulse length are presented. Simulations are performed and they demonstrate that the proposed system can be effective at the low enery section for the CIADS beam. This paper describes the proposed implementation that will have the capability of detecting both the instantaneous and chronicle loss in real time. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Devices measuring the beam emittance face the challenge of dealing with considerable systematic errors that can compromise the quality of the measurement. Having different instruments or techniques that provide beam size estimations in order to compare the outcome and give an unbiased value of the emittance is very important in a collider. The comparison of the different results is as well very useful to identify possible problems in a given equipment which could remain unnoticed if such device is the only source of emittance reconstruction.

An accurate control of the transverse beam parameters is necessary in order to succeed in preserving the beam quality after the recombination. During the activity of the facility we improved our tools and technique for characterising the transverse phase space of the beam before and after recombination. The common quadrupole scan technique was improved by performing constant-beam-size measurement and it was enriched by a tomographic reconstruction of the phase-space. Moreover studies have been performed in order to estimate and subtract the impact of dispersion on such a measurements. An overview of these techniques will be presented with actual measurements performed over the last year of operations of the facility."

The exploitation of the directionality and the polarization of cSPr to reduce the length of the monitor and to eliminate background radiation are discussed. The linear polarization of cSPr will be used to separate the signal from background radiation and experiments to test this design will be presented. Alongside the conceptual design an investigation to optimize the number of detection channels needed to produce high quality longitudinal bunch profile reconstructions has been carried out. It has been determined that the number of detection channels can be reduced compared to previous experiments if measurement uncertainty and background radiation are minimized effectively. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Traditional solid-based beam intercepting instrumentation produces unallowable levels of radiation at high powers. Our alternative approach is to use a low mass residual-gas profile monitor",
        "where ionization electrons are collected along extended magnetic field lines and the gas composition and pressure in the beam pipe are locally controlled to minimize unwanted radiation and to improve resolution. Beam Induced Fluorescence profile monitor with mirascope light collection is proposed."
