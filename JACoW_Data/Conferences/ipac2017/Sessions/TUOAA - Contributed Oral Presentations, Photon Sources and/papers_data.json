        "Commissioning of PAL-XFEL started in April 2016 after its completion of building construction in 2014 and installation in 2015. Saturation of 0.15 nm FEL in the hard X-ray line was successfully done on 27 November 2016",
        "followed by saturation of 15 nm FEL in the soft X-ray FEL line on February 2",
        "2017. For lasing of hard x-ray FEL a beam based alignment method and an undulator optimization scheme using undulator radiation spectrum analysis are fully exploited. In this paper we present the results of both schemes as well as the performance of FEL radiation."

        "the beamline-1 has been upgraded from a spontaneous radiation to a soft x-ray FEL beamline",
        "which generates FEL lights over a wide wavelength range from the extreme-ultraviolet to the soft x-ray regions. We started operation for users in July 2016. A dedicated accelerator",
        "which is a refinement of the SCSS test accelerator operated in 2005-2013",
        "was installed beside the XFEL beamlines in the SACLA undulator hall. The SCSS concept to make an FEL facility compact was continuously adopted. In the 2016 summer shutdown period",
        "the beam energy was upgraded from 500 MeV to 800 MeV by adding two C-band rf units. The maximum K-value of the undulator magnet is 2.1. The available wavelengths of the FEL lights were extended to the range from 8 to 50 nm with pulse energies between a few to few tensμJ at an operational repetition rate of 60 Hz. In this conference",
        "we will report an overview of the upgraded SACLA-beamline-1 and characteristics of the FEL light pulse."
