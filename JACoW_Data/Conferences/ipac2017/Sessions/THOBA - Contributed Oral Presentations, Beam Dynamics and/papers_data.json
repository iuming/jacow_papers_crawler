        "Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is an essential issue in modern accelerators. We propose a new method to examine CSR in the time domain using an unstructured Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The method uses a 2D spatial discretization in the longitudinal and transverse coordinates (Z",
        "X) with a Fourier series decomposition in the transverse coordinate Y and computes the fields modally. Additionally",
        "by alignment of mesh element interfaces along a source reference orbit",
        "DG methods can naturally handle discontinuous or thin sources in the transverse X direction. We present an overview of the method",
        "illustrate it by calculating wake potentials in a model problem",
        "and in a bunch compressor."
