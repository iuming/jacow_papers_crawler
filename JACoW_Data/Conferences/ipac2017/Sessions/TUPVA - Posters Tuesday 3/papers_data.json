The layout of FCC-hh has been optimized to a more compact design following recommendations from civil engineering aspects. The updates on the first order and second order optics of the ring will be shown for collisions at the required centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. Special emphasis is put on the dispersion suppressors and general beam cleaning sections as well as first considerations of injection and extraction sections. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Measurements and simulations were performed in SPS and LHC to understand if a shorter injection kicker rise time and associated tighter batch spacing would lead to increased injection oscillations of the first and last bunches of a bunch train and eventually also a systematic growth of the transverse emittance. The results were used to define the minimum possible batch spacing for an acceptable emittance growth in LHC",

        "the lifetime of the lead beam was significantly shorter than could be accounted for by luminosity burn-off. These effects were observed at a lower level in 2016 and studied in more detail. The beams were not only asymmetric but the differences in the bunch filling schemes between protons and Pb nuclei led to a wide variety of beam-beam interaction sequences in the bunch trains. The colliding bunches were also of different sizes. We present an analysis of the data and an interpretation in terms of theoretical models."

Measurements in the long straight sections and the dispersion suppressors in IR1 (ATLAS) and in IR5 (CMS) have shown that the radiation levels have localised maxima which exceed the base line by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. The analysis of these radiation peaks will be presented and the underlying loss mechanisms will be discussed. The results will help to identify areas not suitable for radiation sensitive electronics.

The present study intends to evaluate each scenario from the beam-beam effects point of view. In particular the single particle long term stability to maximize beam lifetimes and luminosity reach is used to quantify the differences. The impact of strong head on interactions on the beam quality and lifetime is addressed by means of GPU accelerated simulations code featuring a weak-strong 6-dimensional beam-beam interaction. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The limitations deriving from coherent instabilities in the LHC is crucial in view of future projects that aim to increase the performance of the LHC such as the High-Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Simulation tools for the computation of the SD have been extended in order to take into account the incoherent effects from long tracking through the detailed model of the accelerator machine. The model includes among others beam-beam interactions and octupoles and the interplay between both is addressed. Finally the simulation results are compared to the Beam Transfer Function (BTF) measurements in the LHC."

These data are sent to the LHC control system and are used to monitor the background levels at the experiments during accelerator operation. This is a very important measurement",

For this project a cw 4-Rod-RFQ with 176 MHz and a total length of about 4 m is required. It is supposed to accelerate protons from 30 keV up to 1.5 MeV*. One of the main tasks during the development of the RFQ is the very high reliability of the accelerator to limit the thermal stress inside the reactor. Another challenge was to compensate the dipole component of the MYRRHA-RFQ which is due to the design principle of 4-Rod-RFQs. This dipole component is responsible for shifting the ideal beam axis from the geometrical center of the quadrupole downwards. Design studies with CST MICROWAVE STUDIO have shown that the dipole component can be almost completely compensated by widening the stems alternately so that the current paths of the lower electrodes are increased. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The aim of beam dynamics design was to preserve excellent beam quality and to avoid the creation of halo particles especially in the longitudinal plane. Using the NFSP (New Four-Section Procedure) with a soft and symmetric pre-bunching with full 360° acceptance it was possible to reach the requirements. The simulated transmission of the 4 m long RFQ is close to 100%. The electrode voltage has been chosen to 44 kV which gives enough transverse focusing but limits the required RF losses to about 25 kW/m. The cooling has been optimized for reliable operation and a new method of dipole compensation has been applied. The RFQ has been built and tuned with respect to field flatness.

The muon acceleration is the one of the most critical technique to achieve the goal of the sensitivity. The world's first muon LINAC is planed toward the muon acceleration to 212 MeV in J-PARC. The first trial of the muon acceleration is planed in the early 2017 with the J-PARC prototype RFQ ahead of the construction of the actual muon LINAC. The slow muon source is required for the RFQ test",

The demonstration of the muon extraction with 7 keV by the electrostatic accelerator called SOA lens was also done. The low-energy muon beam profile monitor (muon BPM) for the measurement of the beam intensity and profile in order to estimate the beam emittance was tested using the surface muon beam. The simulation for the beam emittance measurement has been developed. In this paper",

        "in particular if operated without crab cavities. Both beam losses and emittance growth could be mitigated by compensat-ing the non-linear LRBB kick with a correctly placed current carrying wire. Such a compensation scheme is currently being studied in the LHC through a demonstration test using current-bearing wires embedded into col-limator jaws",

The aim is a general purpose fixed target facility",

These challenges include: slow resonant extraction from the SPS; a target that has the two-fold objective of producing charged mesons as well as stopping the primary proton beam; and radiation protection considerations related to primary proton beam with a power of around 355 kW. The aim of the project is to complete the key technical feasibility studies in time for the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) update foreseen in 2020.

        "several improvements were made to minimize the beam losses. Adjustments to the ion source's extraction voltage resulted in the removal of tails in phase space. Beam based steering in low-energy and high-energy beamlines led to the reduction of beam emittance growth. Readjustment of the 100-MeV quadrupole transport resulted in the elimination of excessive beam envelope oscillations and removed significant parts of the beam halo at the target. Careful beam matching in the drift tube linac (DTL) provided high beam capture (75% - 80%) and minimized beam emittance growth in the DTL. After improvements",
        "beam losses in the 100-MeV beamline were reduced by an order of magnitude and reached the fractional level of 5 x10-4."

This will be accomplished by increasing the beam energy to 1.3 GeV and the beam current to 38 mA (average during the macro-pulse). Installation of 28 additional superconducting cavities and their associated technical systems will provide for the energy increase. Increased beam loading throughout the accelerator will be accommodated primarily through the use of existing margin in the RF systems and the installation of 700 kW klystrons to power the new superconducting cavities. Upgrades of a few existing RF stations may also be needed. The injection and extraction regions of the accumulator ring will be upgraded",

In this exercise he students worked in groups of 5 to design a 3rd generation light source from scratch based on photon light specifications. In comparison to similar design exercises we stipulate that all students must do all parts and students are not allowed to specialise.
