        "All new hadron linear accelerators have as a first element an RFQ (radio frequency quadrupole)",
        "where the beam characteristics (longitudinal and transverse) are formed in the most critical space charge conditions. In many cases also a high duty cycle is required",
        "hence the tight geometrical tolerances dictated by beam dynamics need to be kept in the presence of high power density. It is widely recognized that this component of the accelerator is fundamental",
        "and deserves investments in terms of beam dynamics",
        "electromagnetics and mechanical engineering studies. New results from the various RFQÂ’s worldwide will be reported (those for IFMIF"
