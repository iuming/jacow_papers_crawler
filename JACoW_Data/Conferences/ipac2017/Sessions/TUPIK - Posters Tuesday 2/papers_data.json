High-quality 1 GeV-class electron beams from the free-electron laser FLASH will act as the wake driver. The setup will allow studies of external injection as well as density-downramp injection. With a triangular-shaped driver beam electron energies of up to 5 GeV from a few centimeters of plasma can be anticipated. Particle-In-Cell simulations are used to assess the feasibility of each technique and to predict properties of the accelerated electron bunches. In this contribution the current status of FLASHForward",

This scenario explicitly makes use of the advantages unique to each method",

        "the acceleration of particles in a plasma wakefield driven by high current-density particle bunches",
        "is one of the most promising candidates for a future compact accelerator technology. A key aspect of this type of acceleration is the ratio between the accelerating fields experienced by a witness beam and the decelerating fields experienced by the drive beam",

        "a transformer ratio above this limit is considered high. This can be reached by using a modulated drive bunch or a shaped train of drive bunches. So far",

The maximal value of the neutron multiplication factor is 0.98. So the total neutron flux output is increased as much as 50 times and is 2·10 13 n·cm-2·c-1. The subcriticality of the system eliminates the possibility of self-sustained chain reaction existence that increases the nuclear safety of the facility drastically.

Inside the enclosure and in transversal direction neutron and gamma radiation is of the same order of magnitude but high energy neutrons are much more penetrating. This causes outside the shielding neutron spectra with two broad maxima at about 1 MeV and 100 MeV. Standard Anderson-Braun or Leake neutron monitors measure thermalized neutrons in a proportional counter tube by nuclear reactions which limits the measurement range to neutron energies < 10 MeV. This implies two considerable systematic errors: Pulsed neutron beams causes dead-time losses due to the time structure of injections and the moderators are not sufficient to moderate high energy neutrons down to thermal energies. We determined and fixed these measurement errors by faster preamplifiers and by a more effective moderator developed by us",

To date longitudinal beam oscillations have been damped in machine experiments with a finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter controller with 3 filter taps[1]. An alternative approach implementing the FIR filter as a derivative estimator controller is simulated and tested. This approach shares the same controller topology and can therefore be easily integrated in the system. It exploits the fact that the sampling rate of the feedback hardware is considerably higher than the frequency of the beam oscillations. It is therefore capable of damping oscillations without overshoot within one oscillation period."

Even the natural motion of the ground could misalign the quadrupole magnets to such an extent that the resulting dipole kicks would require compensation. The novel technique described in this paper uses seismometers to measure the positions of the quadrupole magnets in real time and a kicker to counteract the effect of their misalignment. The prototype system deployed at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK in Japan has already demonstrated a reduction in the pulse-to-pulse vertical position jitter of the beam by about 10%. Based on the observed correlation of the beam position to the quadrupole positions the maximum possible jitter reduction from such a system is estimated to be about 25%. This paper details the latest improvements made to the system with the aim of achieving this limit."

Such a configuration will limit the propagation of errors (maximum deviation w.r.t. a fit line) below 10 micrometres over 200 metres. These first results were obtained through simulations in 2009",

This paper presents the experimental results obtained on dedicated calibration benches and on a facility made of three overlapping stretched wires over a length of 140 metres including WPS sensors measurements. It confirms the possibility to have a propagation of error below 10 micrometres using overlapping stretched wires combined with WPS sensors."

Large reflected power was observed at the downstream port of stripline kicker driven by the feedback amplifier. A rapid surge of vacuum pressure was observed when we tested the high current operation in TPS storage ring in April 2016. A burned feedthrough of the horizontal stripline kicker was discovered during a maintenance shutdown. The improved design is targeted to reduce the reflection of driving power from feedback system and to reduce beam induced RF heating. This major modification of the design is described.
