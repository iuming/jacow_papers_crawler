      "abstract": "The interaction of particles with their vacuum sur-roundings can lead to longitudinal instabilities of the whole bunch of particles. Most of these instabilities are strong and the growth rates are large compared to the damping rate. For a weak instability the opposite is true and with just a resistive impedance the instability would always be weak and independent of the bunch length. The interaction of a bunch with its own radiation emitted midway between parallel plates leads to a strong instabil-ity for long bunches and a transition to weak instability if the bunch length becomes shorter. This regime is ana-lysed numerically with a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck solver. The results are compared to recent observations at ANKA. An attempt is made to explain the remaining discrepan-cies by including higher order terms of the momentum compaction factor into these calculations. There are indi-cations that the simple model needs refinements in order to take radiation from upstream dipoles into account. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

This algorithm has been successfully used for beam dynamics simulation due to its excellent capability to deal with large-dimensional optimization problems. At the MLS and BESSY II PSO was first successfully applied to improve the lifetime by 20~30% within only 10 iterations respectively. Now the PSO has been implemented as a multifunctional online optimizer to improve the machine performance.

The systematic simulation studies for beam instability by including the space charge effect has been done by using the ORBIT code. The simulation results are well reproduced in the corresponding measurements. The designed 1 MW beam power has recently been accomplished by keeping sextuple magnets off in order to stabilize the beam by utilizing the large lattice chromaticity throughout the entire acceleration period. The RCS simultaneously delivers extracted beam to the MLF (Material and Life Science Experimental Facility) and the MR (Main Ring). In order to ensure 1 MW beam power at the MLF even when RCS beam sharing to the MR is twice increased as well as when a second target station is constructed at the MLF",

The effects of the e-cloud on the beam dynamics can be simulated interfacing PyECLOUD with the PyHEADTAIL code.

        "which will be accelerated to several GeV. Upstream of the plasma cell the two beams will either be transported coaxially or with an o'set of few millimetres for about 6 m. The interaction between the two beams in this beam line has been investigated in the past",
        "with a dedicated simulation code tracking particles under the in'uence of direct space-charge e'ects. These simulations have recently been crosschecked with a new simulation code called RF-Track",
        "developed at CERN to simulate low energy accelerators. RF-Track can track multiple-specie beams at arbitrary energies",

The results of these studies are presented in this paper and compared to the previous results. The implications for the facility performance are discussed."

        "the double EEX beamline also has potential limitations due to coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and transverse jitter. The former limitation arises because double EEX uses twice as many bending magnets as single EEX which means stronger CSR effects degrading the beam quality. The latter limitation arises because a longitudinal jitter in front of the first EEX beamline is converted into a transverse jitter in the middle section (between the EEX beamlines) which can cause beam loss or beam degradation. In this paper",

We are investigating this as an alternative to the normal magnetic chicane bunch compressor. The chicane method requires a longitudinal chirp before the chicane (since it relies on the path length difference of different energies) which results in an unwanted chirp after the compressor. Alternatively",

The required data analysis relies on precise calculation of the RMS sizes and positions of the beamlets originated from the mask which drifted up to the analyzing diagnostics. Voronoi diagram is an efficient method for splitting a plane into subsets according to the distances between given vortices. The application of the method to analyze data from pepper pot and multislit mask based measurement is validated via numerical simulation and applied to experimental data acquired at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility. We also discuss the application of the Voronoi diagrams to quantify transversely-modulated beams distortion."

We examine the effects of space charge on the dynamics of the booster synchrotron for the proposed JLEIC electron ion collider.

In 2015/2016 the S-DALINAC received an upgrade to three recirculations. The new beam line enables in addition to higher maximum energies the possibility to operate the S-DALINAC as an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). Therefore the current rf control system encounters new requirements for ERL operation. Since 2010 a digital rf control system is successfully used for the control of the superconducting cavities. This system was not built and optimized for the control of an ERL. This contribution is discussing the expected challenges of an ERL operation regarding the existing digital rf control system. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "The accelerating RF field has crucial importance on the beam properties. It is not only used just to accelerate particles but also to shape the bunches at bunch compressors. It is really important to control and measure the field as seen by the beam while usually only indirect (not using the beam) field measurements are available*. Since they are affected by many contributions the measurements must be always calibrated to the beam. Usually this calibration is performed at special operating conditions that prevents normal operation of the accelerator. During normal operation the calibrations is assumed to not drift which is certainly not perfectly true and introduce some control errors. The paper shows how to extract the RF-beam calibration from RF signals during normal operating condition (when RF feed-back",
        "beam loading compensation",

      "abstract": "Accurate timing synchronization on the femtosecond timescale is an essential installation for time-resolved experiments at free-electron lasers (FELs) such as FLASH and the upcoming European XFEL. Conventional RF timing systems suffer from RF attenuation for such long distances and have reached to date a limit for synchronization precision of around 100 femtoseconds. An optical synchronization system is used at FLASH and is based on the distribution of femtosecond laser pulses over actively stabilized optical fibers. The upcoming European XFEL has raised the demands due to its large number of stabilized optical fibers and a length of 3400 m. The increased lengths for the stabilized optical fibers necessitated major advancement in precision to achieve the requirement of less than 10 femtosecond precision.

        "it is crucial to achieve fs level stability in terms of Laser-to-RF synchronization. In this paper we present an advanced laser-to-RF synchronization scheme based on integrated Mach-Zehnder modulator. The setup demonstrated the Titanium Sapphire photo-injector laser synchronization with 11 fs (rms) precision in the bandwidth up to 100 kHz. Long term timing drift measurements showed unprecedented peak-to-peak stability of 31 fs (7 fs rms) over 43 hours of measurement time. In addition",
        "AM-PM coefficient of the MZM based laser-to-RF synchronization setup has been evaluated and showed a factor of 10 improved performance compared to conventional direct conversion based laser synchronization setup."

It is the excellent performance in terms of synchronization of CPU time. The all abort channels of SuperKEKB are synchronized their issued time.

To enable ongoing development when access to these devices is not possible (for whatever the reason), Kameleon was implemented. It is a behavior-rich, non-memoryless and time-aware generic simulator that handles clients through a TCP/IP connection. An instance of this client is an EPICS IOC or a Tango Device Server. Kameleon consumes a user-defined file that describes the commands received from a client and, optionally, the reaction to these through statuses sent back to the client. Key features are: 1) Ubiquitous (runs in disparate platforms such as Windows and Linux). 2) Behavior-rich (predefined behaviors as well as user-defined). 3) Non-memoryless (the state of the simulation can be preserved between events and/or elapsed time). 4) Time-aware (statuses can be sent to the client either event-based or time-based). 5) Flexible (commands and statuses are described in a simple user-defined file - nothing is hard-coded in Kameleon). Kameleon will be used in a myriad of scenarios at ESS such as development of EPICS devices support, IOCs, OPI screens, testing of IOCs and alarm workflows. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Optimizing the vertical available aperture is a key ingredient to optimize transmission and reduce activation around the ring. Aperture measurements are routinely carried out after each shutdown.

During the 2016 run a tool was developed to provide an automated local aperture scan around the entire ring. This allowed to establish detailed reference measurements of the vertical aperture and identify directly the SPS aperture bottlenecks. The methodology applied for the scans will be briefly described in this paper and the analysis discussed. Finally",
