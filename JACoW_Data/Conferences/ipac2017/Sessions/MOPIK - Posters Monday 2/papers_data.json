        "To improve the quality of photocathodes is one of the critical issues in enhancing the stability and reliability of photo-injector systems. Presently the primary choice is to use metallic photocathodes for the ELBE SRF Gun-II to reduce the risk of contamination of the superconducting cavity. Magnesium has a low work function (3.6 eV) and shows high quantum efficiency (QE) up to 0.3 % after laser cleaning. The SRF Gun II with an Mg photocathode has successfully provided electron beam for ELBE users. However",
        "the present cleaning process with a high intensi-ty laser (activation) is time consuming and generates unwanted surface roughness. This paper presents the investigation of alternative surface cleaning procedures",
        "such as thermal treatment. The QE and topography of Mg samples after treatment are reported."

Using such ultrashort pulses for electron acceleration offers advantages in terms of higher thresholds for material breakdown which opens up a promising path towards increased acceleration gradients. In addition",

The cold model cavity with an input coupler was completed in spring 2016. The RF characteristics measured at room temperature were in agreement with the prediction by the CST Studio simulation. The RF characteristics at 20 K have been measured using a rather simple cavity-cooling vacuum system that was built by using existing components for tentative experiments. A thin-wall stainless-steel R48 waveguide with copper-plated inner walls has been used for the RF power transmission from the room-temperature input port to the 20-K cooled coupler waveguide. The unloaded Q-value of 73000 has been obtained by the reflection coefficient measurement at 20 K",

A combination of a target chamber installed at the high energy beam transport line and the existing 4-degree bending magnet that is used as an energy selector first produced low intensity test beams. However",
        "the test beam profile was not well determined due to the insufficient bending angle of the energy selector and high primary beam energy. Another approach mounting a target chamber at the low energy beam transport line and using the synchrotron booster as an energy selector was implemented to avoid such problems. Once in operation",
        "the facility will have the potential to service calibration and testing of high energy detectors as well as beam diagnostic instrumentations."

        "Generating the drive and witness bunch for collinear wakefield acceleration (CWFA) requires precise control of the longitudinal bunch shape for each bunch as well as the controlling their separation. The emittance exchange (EEX) beamline and a transverse mask can be used to achieve all of these requirements. First",
        "this EEX-based method can independently control the longitudinal bunch shape of each bunches so that the drive bunch is shaped to generate a high transformer ratio while witness bunch is shaped to suppress its energy spread. Second",
        "the timing jitter between the drive and witness bunch poses a serious limitation to the CWFA scheme but the EEX-based method eliminates this since both bunches are generated at the same time and share the exactly same beamline so there are no relative errors. In this paper",
        "we confirm the feasibility of this EEX-based method for simultaneous generation with simulation for CWFA in a dielectric structure."

        "COSY is a versatile racetrack-type synchrotron accelerating protons and deuterons in a range of rigidity between 1 T m and 11 T m. Circulating beam can be slowly extracted on a third order resonance and channeled towards different users. New users of the COSY beam have presented new challenges with specific requests",
        "most notably in term of beam shape. This in turn drove a strong interest to develop and improve characterization and modeling methods in the COSY extraction beam line. In this contribution we will present the different beam characterization methods used and their limitations. We will then discuss the modeling of the line and the importance of an accurate and reliable model of the extraction line. Some of the latest beam measurements are presented and compared to modeled results."

This typically occurs during the later part of the design stage of the system, however such exercises may also be requested by funding bodies at later stages in order to manage project contingency. Naturally, the later this is done, the more challenging it becomes. In this paper we report on a recently concluded Value Engineering effort at the European Spallation Source. The challenges presented by the initiation of such an exercise during the construction phase are discussed. In addition, we present and discuss the various options that we examined, and indicate the philosophy and figures of merit used to narrow down these options.

A compact Nier-Johnson type of pre-separator has been designed to achieve a mass resolving power of 300 in order to minimize the undesired radioactive species contaminating the downstream beamlines. It consists of a 112 degree magnetic and a 90 degree toroidal electrostatic dipole with deflection in opposite direction. It also contains electrostatic quadrupole elements in between the dipoles. The electrostatic dipole compensates the energy dispersion of the magnetic dipole. This allows an achromatic mode of operation resulting in a high mass resolving power downstream to the electrostatic deflector even for beams with a high energy spread. We present the result of beam optics calculations for the ARIEL pre-separator. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

In recent operational periods the availability of the HPRF System has exceeded 97 percent while the neutron source availability overall is typically greater than 90 percent. SNS has a unique set of 92 HPRF stations that operate at either 402.5 MHz or 805 MHz with peak output power ranging from 550 kW to 5 MW and average power ranging from 49.5 kW to 450 kW. The HPRF transmitters consist of chassis-mounted power supplies",
        "solid-state amplifiers and other equipment that support the operation of the klystrons that ultimately provide the RF power to the accelerating structures. Management of the operation and maintenance of the HPRF system has increasingly focused on reliability and sustainability in recent years. Techniques for klystron lifetime preservation and optimization of transmitter reliability have been developed and will be described."

This technique named AC LOCO is based on a sine-wave (AC) beam excitation via fast correctors typically installed at synchrotron light sources for the fast orbit feedback. The beam oscillations are measured by beam position monitors. The narrow band used for the beam excitation and measurement not only allows us to suppress effectively the beam position noise and also makes simultaneously exciting multiple correctors at different frequencies (multi-frequency mode) possible. We demonstrated at NSLS-II that the new technique provides better lattice corrections and achieves two minutes measurement time in the thirty-frequency mode. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "level of state of the art",
        "level of human interfaces",
        "level of operational complexity) and importance factors (safety",
        "cost",
        "schedule",
        "resources) represent the likelihood of risk occurrence and the eventual value at risk. Relative comparison of the normalized factors together with a supplier assessment enables to derive an event based risk register with a standardized evaluation scheme assigning risk and opportunity classes. This contribution demonstrates the full methodology highlighting some typical examples of the FAIR project."

Main objective is to preserve the advantages of a bottom-up planning topology with the actual and detailed level of information keeping the ~400 work package leader's central role as plan owners in their field of responsibility. Simultaneously different project phases (e.g. civil construction",
        "procurement",
        "installation",
        "commissioning) need to be excluded from detailed plans while being re-integrated in the level-1 project master schedule. Additional cost profiles and resource assignment by name allow a progress tracking and flexible project steering."
