      "abstract": "The European XFEL uses the world's largest superconducting RF installation to drive three independent SASE FELs. After eight years of construction the facility is now brought into operation. First experience with the superconducting accelerator as well as beam commissioning results will be presented. The path to the first user experiments will be laid down.",
