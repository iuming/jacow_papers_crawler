        "The Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) [1] luminosity requires extremely low beam emittances. Therefore",
        "high beam position stability is needed to provide cen-tral collisions of the opposing bunches. Since ground motion (GM) amplitudes are likely to be larger than the required tolerances",
        "an Active Vibration Control (AVC) system is required to damp quadrupole motion to the desired value of 0.2 nm RMS at 4 Hz. This paper focuses on the vertical final focus quadrupoles (QD0",
        "QF1) stabilization and demonstrates its feasibility. An AVC system to be installed under QD0 and QF1 has been developed and successfully tested at LAPP. Based on a dedicated homemade sensor with an ex-tremely low internal noise level of 0.05 nm at 4 Hz",
        "it damps GM in the frequency range [3;70] Hz by up to 30 dB",
        "leading to RMS values of approximately 0.25 nm at 4 Hz. Simulations based on GM measured in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experimental hall [2] show that with such a GM level",
        "the specifications would only be achieved with a Passive Insulation (PI) system",
        "which would filter ground motion starting at ~ 25 Hz"

      "abstract": "The positron source is a vital system of the ILC. The conversion target that yields 1014 positrons per second will undergo high peak and cyclic load during ILC operation. In order to ensure stable long term operation of the positron source the candidate material for the conversion target has to be tested. The intense electron beam at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI) provides a good opportunity for such tests. The first results for Ti6Al4V are presented which is the candidate material for the positron conversion target as well as for the exit window to the photon beam absorber. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

A charged beam with an offset from a center of cavity is affected by the wakefield depending on both the offset size in the cavity and longitudinal particle position in the beam. The wakefield causes emittance growth. This growth can be suppressed by appropriate orbit control so as to cancel the wakefield effect of the cavities in total. On the other hands",

Emittance growth by both misalignments and 6-dimensional beam jitter was evaluated by particle tracking simulation.

Injector linac should provide two regimes: ~250 pC bunches for injection and ~6 nC bunches for e−/e+ conversion. Two possible schemes of photogun are comprised and results of beam dynamics simulation in both FCC-ee injection linac photoguns are discussed."

Earlier such structure with operating frequency of 27 GHz was proposed for medical application and beam dynamics simulations and electrodynamics modeling were done [1-2]. It was shown that such structure manufacturing should have very high accuracy and can be manufactured using electro erosive technology only. It is very complex for axi-symmetrical geometry to use such technology. Interesting option will to use a prismatic geometry BAS.

The detector is placed in a newly installed quadrupole that is adjacent to an existing lattice quadrupole of the same polarity. Since they are powered independently",

Final design goals are 50MeV and 10mA/3mA at TRIUMF/VECC respectively. A ARIEL e-linac demonstrator with two cold cavities in two modules successfully accelerated beam to 20MeV.

        "hence specific bunch patterns have to be kicked to other beam-lines. To use e.g. one bunch out of the bunch train very short kicking durations have to be realized. The variability of the bunch pattern and the frequency resp. switching time are one of the main arguments for a stripline-kicker combined with HV-switches as basic concept. A nearly homogenous field in the kicker has to be realized for uniform deflection of the electron bunch and emittance grow of the bunch has to be kept as low as possible. Furthermore the fast switching ability of the kicker demands for a fast decay of the HV-pulse resp. its reflections in the structure implying a specific design of the kicker elements. For this reason a design with two tapered active electrodes and two ground fenders was optimized in time and frequency domain with the software package CST. Additionally a first prototype was manufactured for laboratory and first beam-line tests."

Meanwhile the post-LWFA beam is not directly suitable for storage and accumulation in conventional storage rings. New generation rings with adapted features are required. Different geometries and ring lattices of very large-acceptance compact storage ring operating between 50 to 500 MeV energy range were studied. The main objective was to create a model suitable to store the post-LWFA beam with a wide momentum spread (2% to3%) and ultra-short electron bunches of fs range.

The parallel fed Cockcroft Walton multiplier is a capacitive coupling multiplier with diode rectification which can convert an input RF voltage to a low ripple output DC voltage. In this research tried to get a low ripple (300keV output) dc voltage. At first, the voltage multiplier column has been simulated with pspice simulation software. After doing the pspice simulations, optimum value of different parameters has been get. At the end we try to get the optimum values of pspice simulations with a mechanical design with CST STODIO. The mechanical design of voltage multiplier and its equivalent circuit hah a good accordance with each other. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

These errors could be prevented at the design stage in the ideal case. However",

        "with the braze joint bisecting the irises and cells",

The mode launcher feeds the power through 4 ports distributed azimuthally to eliminate both dipole and quadrupole field distortions. The brazed-in cathode and absence of complex power coupler result in a very inexpensive yet high performance device. The clean design allows the RF cavity to sit entirely within the solenoid assembly. The cathode gradient is 120 MV/m at 3 MW of input power. The cathode cell is just 0.17 RF wavelength so that laser arrival phase for peak acceleration is 70 degrees from zero crossing resulting in exit energy of 4 MeV. The photoinjector will operate with 1μs pulses at 1 kHz",

We will present results of simulations of different IVU misalignment effects on magnetic fields seen by electron beam and on the emitted undulator radiation spectra. The simulations show e.g. that an impact of angular misalignment of an IVU on the radiation spectrum can be minimized if the IVU elevation is selected to make the electron orbit to pass through the IVU magnetic center. Experimental results of spectrum-based alignment of IVUs at hard X-ray beamlines will be presented."

The laser pulse of required length will be produced with the stacking of multiple few picosecond long sub-pulses. Depending on the choice of the laser sub-pulse length and on the relative delay between these sub-pulses one can obtain laser pulse with various longitudinal intensity modulations. The longitudinal modulation of laser intensity creates longitudinal modulation of electron bunch charge. Such modulation is known to cause the growth of e-beam uncorrelated energy spread in photoinjectors - the effect we would like to avoid. In this paper we estimate growth of e-beam energy spread due to its initial density modulation and set requirements to the maximum allowable depth of longitudinal modulation of photocathode laser intensity. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
