            "Software development is often understood as an engineering process. However",
            "the factors that affect the success of a software development project are often human and social. The social context of software design and development is important: it provides social reinforcement for good practice. Study of high-performing software development teams makes it clear that the interplay between designers plays a crucial part both in nurturing creativity and innovation",
            "and in embedding systematic practice and rigor. This talk will present key observations from empirical studies of expert software development that can be applied usefully to scientific software development. It will discuss why matching development practices to the context and purpose of scientific software can improve both software and scientific outcomes. It will draw on research in order to discuss how communication and collaboration can be fostered",
            "and to identify what works (and what doesn’t work) in building collaboration in software development teams",

The presentation will be supplemented by a poster (if accepted) with **live demonstation** of the current KAT-7 Control&Monitoring system. The vision for MeerKAT includes to a) use Offset Gregorian antennas in a radio telescope array combined with optimized receiver technology in order to achieve superior imaging and maximum sensitivity, b) be the most sensitive instrument in the world in L-band, c) be an instrument that will be considered the benchmark for performance and reliability by the scientific community at large, and d) be a true precursor for the SKA that will be integrated into the SKA-mid dish array. The 7-dish engineering prototype (KAT-7) for MeerKAT is already producing exciting science and is being operated 24x7. The first MeerKAT antenna will be on site by the end of this year and the first two Receptors will be fully integrated and ready for testing by April 2014. By December 2016 hardware for all 64 receptors will be installed and accepted and 32 antennas will be fully commissioned.",

By 2004 the controls system build-out began and over the next 6 years the remainder was installed and activated. The NIF has now transitioned to a user facility with a 30 year operational lifespan. As with many large",
            "long duration projects the controls system diversity has created maintenance issues and components have reached end-of-life. This requires the controls team to develop and execute a controls hardware refresh cycle to replace aging components before reliability issues interfere with facility operations. This refresh also affects the controls system software since modernization of controls hardware and operating system require corresponding software changes and possibly coding language changes. This talk addresses the NIF controls system maintenance and refresh strategy",

A key system requirement is that LHC machine protection rules are obeyed: the position is surveyed every 20ms with an accuracy of 15?m. If the detectors move too close to the beam (outside limits set by LHC Operators) the LHC interlock system is triggered to dump the beam. LHC Operators in the CERN Control Centre (CCC) drive the system via an HMI provided by a custom built Java application which uses Common Middleware (CMW) to interact with lower level components. Low-level motorization control is executed using National Instruments PXI devices. The DIM protocol provides the software interface to the PXI layer. A FESA gateway server provides a communication bridge between CMW and DIM. A cut down laboratory version of the system was built to provide a platform for verifying the integrity of the full chain",

This will be accomplished by using a closed-loop system for determining the optimal liquid-crystal-based spatial light pattern for beamshaping and placement of variable transmission blockers. A stand-alone prototype was developed and successfully run in a lab environment as well as on a single quad of NIF lasers following a temporary hardware reconfiguration required to support the test. Several challenges exist in directly integrating the C-based PSS engine written by an independent team into the Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS) for proof on concept on all 48 NIF laser quads.

Increasingly there has been a strong move toward IEC 61508 based standards in the design of these systems. CLS designed and deployed its first IEC 61508 based system nearly 10 years ago. The challenge has increasingly been to manage the complexity of requirements and ensure that features being added into such systems were truly requirements to achieve safety. Over the past few years CLS has moved to a more structured Hazard Analysis technique that is tightly coupled and traceable through the design and verification of its engineered safety systems. This paper presents the CLS approach and lessons learned.",

            "The RHIC Beam Permit System (BPS) plays a key role in safeguarding against the anomalies developing in the collider during a run. The BPS collects RHIC subsystem statuses to allow the beam entry and its existence in the machine. The building blocks of BPS are Permit Module (PM) and Abort Kicker Module (AKM)",
            "which incorporate various electronic boards based on VME specification. This paper presents a quantitative Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) of the PM and AKM",
            "yielding the hazard rates of three top failures that are potential enough to cause a significant downtime of the machine. The FTA helps tracing down the top failure of the module to a component level failure (such as an IC or resistor). The fault trees are constructed for all module variants and are probabilistically evaluated using an analytical solution approach. The component failure rates are calculated using manufacturer datasheets and MIL-HDBK-217F. The apportionment of failure modes for components is calculated using FMD-97. The aim of this work is to understand the importance of individual components of the RHIC BPS regarding its reliable operation",
            "and evaluate their impact on the operation of BPS."

They were largely based on Linux, EPICS and VME and were applied fairly consistently across the three accelerators and first twenty photon beamlines. With funding for further photon beamlines in 2011 the opportunity was taken to redefine the standards to be largely based on Linux, EPICS, PC’s and Ethernet. The developments associated with this will be presented, together with solutions being developed for requirements that fall outside the standards.",

UAB** (UNICOS Application Builder) is the software factory used to develop UNICOS-CPC applications. The constant evolution of the CPC component brought the necessity of creating a new tool to validate the generated applications and to verify that the modifications introduced in the software tools do not create any undesirable effect on the existing control applications. The uab-maven-plugin is a plug-in for the Apache Maven build manager that can be used to trigger the generation of the CPC applications and verify the consistency of the generated code.

Metadata is harvested from the neutron beam and X-ray instruments raw experimental files and catalogued in databases that are local to the facilities. The data is accessible via a web portal. Data policies are applied to embargo data prior to placing data in the public domain. Public domain data is published to the Australian Research Data Commons using the OAI-PMH standard. The Commons is run by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS), who was the project sponsor. The Commons is a web robot friendly site. ANDS also sponsors digital object identifiers (DOI) for deposited datasets, which allows raw data to now be a first class research output, allowing scientists that collect data to gain recognition in the same way as those who publish journal articles.

Local bar-codes and/or datamatrix codes can be used in conjunction with intelligent devices like smart (i)Phones to retrieve data directly from the control system. The developed application will also show information from the asset database. This will provide the asset properties of the individual hardware device including the remaining warranty.

Thorough analysis of available infrastructure and current approaches to monitoring and archiving was conducted to take into account additional needs that come from booster special characteristics.

Google's Map API provides a simple and convenient way to display some of C-AD's Controls System data and provide location and status feedback using dynamic symbols and animations. This paper describes the details of how chipmunk and beam loss data visualization can be implemented for the AGS/RHIC Controls system. Most of the server side and client site software can be easily adapted to many other similar types of data visualizations.",

Each of an underground RF station consist from multi beam horizontal klystron which can provide up to 10MW of power at 1.3GHz. The XFEL should work continuously over 20 years with only 1 day per month for maintenance. In order to meet so demanding requirement lifetime of the MBK should be as long as possible. In the real operation the lifetime of tube can be thoroughly reduced by service conditions. To minimize the influence of service conditions to the klystrons lifetime the special fast protection system named as Klystron Lifetime Management System (KLM) has been developed",
            "the main task of this system is to detect all events which can destroy the tube as quickly as possible",

KLM is based on the standard LLRF uTCA system for XFEL with additional DC channels. This article gives an overview of implementation of measurement and protection system installed at klystron test stand."

          "abstract": "TANGO (http://www.tango-controls.org) is a modern distributed device oriented control system toolkit used by a number of facilities to control synchrotrons, lasers and a wide variety of equipment for doing physics experiments. The performance of the network protocol used by TANGO is a key component of the toolkit. For this reason TANGO is based on the omniORB implementation of CORBA. CORBA offers an interface definition language with mappings to multiple programming languages, an efficient binary protocol, a data representation layer, and various services. In recent years a new series of binary protocols based on AMQP have emerged from the high frequency stock market trading business. A simplified version of AMQP called ZMQ (http://www.zeromq.org/) was open sourced in 2010. In 2011 the TANGO community decided to take advantage of ZMQ. In 2012 the kernel developers successfully replaced the CORBA Notification Service with ZMQ in TANGO V8. The first part of this paper will present the software design, the issues encountered and the resulting improvements in performance. The second part of this paper will present a study of how ZMQ could replace CORBA completely in TANGO.",

The ARM based embedded controller card is developed to replace the existing PC based systems with a small plug-in module that will contain the EPICS IOC and the database having the control parameters. This will have an obvious advantage of integrating the control system inside the hardware itself thus reducing the overall hardware complexities which was involved in the PC based systems. The paper explains the steps involved in designing the ARM based controller for beam diagnostics and Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Operator Interface. EPICS Channel Access embedded ActiveX components along with Microsoft Visual Basic (VB) is chosen as the OPI development platform."

            "A neutron radiography/tomography instrument (Dingo) has recently been commissioned at the Bragg Institute",
            "ANSTO. It utilizes thermal beam HB2 of the OPAL research reactor with flux up to 4.75 x 107 neutrons cm-2 s−1 at the sample. One component of the instrument is a 2.5 tonne selector wheel filled with a wax/steel shielding mixture which requires complex interaction between the safety interlock and motion control systems. It provides six apertures which are equipped with various neutron beam optics plus a solid ‘shutter’ section to block the beam. A standardized Galil based motion system precisely controls the movement of the wheel while a Pilz safety PLC specifies the desired position and handles other safety aspects of the instrument. A shielded absolute SSI encoder is employed to give high accuracy feedback on the position in conjunction with a number or limit switches. This paper details the challenges of creating a motion system with inherent safety",
            "verifying the wheel meets specifications and the considerations in selecting components to withstand high radiation environments."

Developers can simply create an EPICS record referring to a memory address in the PLC and the device support takes care of automatically connecting to the PLC and transferring the value. This contribution presents the concept behind the s7nodave device support and shows how simple it is to create an EPICS IOC that communicates with an S7 PLC.",

            "The Advanced Radiographic Capability (ARC) at the National Ignition Facility was developed to produce a sequence of short laser pulses that are used to backlight an imploding fuel capsule. This backlighting capability will enable the creation of a sequence of radiographs during capsule implosion and provide an unprecedented view into the dynamics of the implosion. A critical element of the ARC is the diagnostic instrumentation used to assess the quality of the pulses. Pulses are steered to the diagnostic package through a complex optical path that requires precision alignment. A central component of the alignment system is the image analysis algorithms",
            "which are used to extract information from alignment imagery and provide feedback for the optical alignment control loops. Alignment imagery consists of complex patterns of light resulting from the diffraction of pilot beams around cross-hairs and other fiducials placed in the optical path. This paper describes the alignment imagery",

We must manage highly frequent injections even with this situation. Typically beam pulse is delivered to one of rings at every 20ms. Besides",

This talk will present key observations from empirical studies of expert software development that can be applied usefully to scientific software development.

The presentation will be supplemented by a poster (if accepted) with **live demonstation** of the current KAT-7 Control&Monitoring system. The vision for MeerKAT includes to a) use Offset Gregorian antennas in a radio telescope array combined with optimized receiver technology in order to achieve superior imaging and maximum sensitivity, b) be the most sensitive instrument in the world in L-band, c) be an instrument that will be considered the benchmark for performance and reliability by the scientific community at large, and d) be a true precursor for the SKA that will be integrated into the SKA-mid dish array. The 7-dish engineering prototype (KAT-7) for MeerKAT is already producing exciting science and is being operated 24x7. The first MeerKAT antenna will be on site by the end of this year and the first two Receptors will be fully integrated and ready for testing by April 2014. By December 2016 hardware for all 64 receptors will be installed and accepted and 32 antennas will be fully commissioned.",

        "This paper describes the movement control system for detector positioning based on the Roman Pot design used by the ATLAS-ALFA and TOTEM experiments at the LHC. A key system requirement is that LHC machine protection rules are obeyed: the position is surveyed every 20ms with an accuracy of 15?m. If the detectors move too close to the beam (outside limits set by LHC Operators) the LHC interlock system is triggered to dump the beam. LHC Operators in the CERN Control Centre (CCC) drive the system via an HMI provided by a custom built Java application which uses Common Middleware (CMW) to interact with lower level components. Low-level motorization control is executed using National Instruments PXI devices. The DIM protocol provides the software interface to the PXI layer. A FESA gateway server provides a communication bridge between CMW and DIM. A cut down laboratory version of the system was built to provide a platform for verifying the integrity of the full chain",
        "with respect to user and machine protection requirements",
        "and validating new functionality before deploying to the LHC. The paper contains a detailed system description",
        "test bench results and foreseen system improvements."

Increasingly there has been a strong move toward IEC 61508 based standards in the design of these systems. CLS designed and deployed its first IEC 61508 based system nearly 10 years ago. The challenge has increasingly been to manage the complexity of requirements and ensure that features being added into such systems were truly requirements to achieve safety. Over the past few years CLS has moved to a more structured Hazard Analysis technique that is tightly coupled and traceable through the design and verification of its engineered safety systems.

The migration of the Accelerator Control System to an EPICS-based system started three years ago and has essentially been done in parallel to regular operation. While it has not been finished yet it already pervades all the different aspects of the control system. The hardware is interfaced by EPICS Input/Output Controllers. User interfaces are designed with Control System Studio (CSS) and BOY (Best Operator Interface Yet). Latest activities are aimed at the completion of the migration of the beamline devices to EPICS.

With funding for further photon beamlines in 2011 the opportunity was taken to redefine the standards to be largely based on Linux, EPICS, PC’s and Ethernet. The developments associated with this will be presented, together with solutions being developed for requirements that fall outside the standards.",

        "The accelerator control system for the MedAustron light-ion medical particle accelerator has been designed under the guidance of CERN in the scope of an EBG MedAustron/CERN collaboration agreement. The core is based on the SIMATIC WinCC OA SCADA tool. Its open API and modular architecture permitted CERN to extend the product with features that go beyond traditional supervisory control and that are vital for directly operating a particle accelerator. Several extensions have been introduced to make WinCC OA fit for accelerator control: (1) Near real-time data visualization",
        "(2) external application launch and monitoring",
        "(3) accelerator settings snapshot and consistent restore",
        "(4) generic panel navigation supporting role based permission handling",
        "(5) native integration with interactive 3D engineering visualization",
        "(6) integration with National Instruments based front-end controllers. The major drawback identified is the lack of support of callbacks from C++ extensions. This prevents asynchronous functions",
        "multithreaded implementations and soft real-time behaviour. We are therefore striving to search for support in the user community to trigger the implementation of this function."

      "abstract": "The UNICOS* (UNified Industrial COntrol System) framework was created back in 1998 as a solution to build object-based industry-like control systems. The Continuous Process Control package (CPC**) is a UNICOS component that provides a methodology and a set of tools to design and implement industrial control applications. UAB** (UNICOS Application Builder) is the software factory used to develop UNICOS-CPC applications. The constant evolution of the CPC component brought the necessity of creating a new tool to validate the generated applications and to verify that the modifications introduced in the software tools do not create any undesirable effect on the existing control applications. The uab-maven-plugin is a plug-in for the Apache Maven build manager that can be used to trigger the generation of the CPC applications and verify the consistency of the generated code. This plug-in can be integrated in continuous integration tools - like Hudson or Jenkins – to create jobs for constant monitoring of changes in the software that will trigger a new generation of all the applications located in the source code management. * \"UNICOS a framework to build industry like control systems: Principles & Methodology\".  ** \"UNICOS CPC6: Automated code generation for process control applications\".",

The challenges of this technique are the accurate positioning of the target tumour with respect to the beam and the precision of the dose delivery whilst fully assuring the patient safety. The positioning system used for previous angiography clinical trials has been adapted to this new modality. 3-D imaging is performed for positioning purpose to fit to the treatment planning.

        "so records of a work process generally have to be kept. As any other machine",

        "there were additional challenges when designing and developing monitoring and archiving tools. Thorough analysis of available infrastructure and current approaches to monitoring and archiving was conducted to take into account additional needs that come from booster special characteristics. A software extension for values present in the control system allowed to track the state of booster subsystems and to perform an advanced archiving with multiple warning levels. Time stamping and data collecting strategies were developed as a part of monitoring scheme in order to preserve and recover read-backs and settings as consistent data sets. This paper describes relevant solutions incorporated in the booster control system."

The microbeam has been focused down to FWHM sizes of less than 3 μm by manually adjusting the vertical and horizontal focusing mirrors of a K-B (Kirkpatrick-Baez) mirror system. In this research",
        "a microbeam-focusing automation software was developed to automate the old complex and cumbersome process of beam focusing which may take about a day. The existing controllers of the K-B mirror system were replaced by products with communication functions and a motor-driving routine by means of proportional feedback control was constructed. Based on the routine and the outputs of two ionization chambers arranged in front and rear of the K-B mirror system",
        "the automation software to perform every step of the beam focusing process was completed as LabVIEW applications. The developed automation software was applied to the 4B beamline and showed the performance of focusing an X-ray beam with a minimal size within an hour. This presentation introduces the details of the algorithms of the automation software and examines its performances."

        "we report on the new control framework especially from messaging aspects. We also report the status on the replacement of the control system with MADOCA II. Partial control system of SPring-8 was already replaced with MADOCA II last summer and has been stably operated.",

      "abstract": "TANGO (http://www.tango-controls.org) is a modern distributed device oriented control system toolkit used by a number of facilities to control synchrotrons, lasers and a wide variety of equipment for doing physics experiments. The performance of the network protocol used by TANGO is a key component of the toolkit. For this reason TANGO is based on the omniORB implementation of CORBA. CORBA offers an interface definition language with mappings to multiple programming languages, an efficient binary protocol, a data representation layer, and various services. In recent years a new series of binary protocols based on AMQP have emerged from the high frequency stock market trading business. A simplified version of AMQP called ZMQ (http://www.zeromq.org/) was open sourced in 2010. In 2011 the TANGO community decided to take advantage of ZMQ. In 2012 the kernel developers successfully replaced the CORBA Notification Service with ZMQ in TANGO V8. The first part of this paper will present the software design, the issues encountered and the resulting improvements in performance. The second part of this paper will present a study of how ZMQ could replace CORBA completely in TANGO.",

The beam diagnostics system in these cyclotrons consists of many hardware devices to be controlled and monitored. Presently",
        "these hardware modules are interfaced with PC based systems using serial communication line. The ARM based embedded controller card is developed to replace the existing PC based systems with a small plug-in module that will contain the EPICS IOC and the database having the control parameters. This will have an obvious advantage of integrating the control system inside the hardware itself thus reducing the overall hardware complexities which was involved in the PC based systems. The paper explains the steps involved in designing the ARM based controller for beam diagnostics and Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Operator Interface. EPICS Channel Access embedded ActiveX components along with Microsoft Visual Basic (VB) is chosen as the OPI development platform."

Issues of PLC communication standardization in the context of CODAC environment and future development of SPSS and EPICS driver are presented here."

One component of the instrument is a 2.5 tonne selector wheel filled with a wax/steel shielding mixture which requires complex interaction between the safety interlock and motion control systems. It provides six apertures which are equipped with various neutron beam optics plus a solid ‘shutter’ section to block the beam. A standardized Galil based motion system precisely controls the movement of the wheel while a Pilz safety PLC specifies the desired position and handles other safety aspects of the instrument. A shielded absolute SSI encoder is employed to give high accuracy feedback on the position in conjunction with a number or limit switches. This paper details the challenges of creating a motion system with inherent safety",

This increased beam stability performance is considered a major asset for the beamlines user operation. To achieve this target",

It takes more than 40ms since positron pulse must be stored at newly constructed damping ring for at least 40ms. Timings of whole accelerators are precisely synchronized for such a long period. We must manage highly frequent injections even with this situation. Typically beam pulse is delivered to one of rings at every 20ms. Besides",
        "the new system must have a capability of realtime selection of injection RF-bucket - we call it \"Bucket Selection\" at KEKB - for equalizing bunch current at main rings. Bucket Selection also will be upgraded to synchronize buckets of damping ring and those of main rings. This includes the expansion of maximum delay time up to 2ms and the pulse-by-pulse shift of RF phase at 2nd half of injection Linac. We plan to upgrade the Event Timing System from \"2-layer type\"",

This will be only possible by a precise measurement with 40-times higher luminosity compared with that of KEKB. The injector linac should be upgraded to enable a 20-times smaller beam size of 50 nm at the collision point and twice-larger stored beam current with short lifetime of 10 minutes. At the same time two light source rings",

A virtual accelerator (VA) concept is introduced to enable a single linac behaving as four VAs switched by PPM",
