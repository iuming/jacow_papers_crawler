Special topology will be used for Fast Orbit Feedback with one 10Gbps switch between the beam position monitors electronics and a workstation for corrections calculation and orbit correctors. At the moment",

This presents opportunities to take advantage of changes in technologies but also many challenges in building reliable and stable controls and integrating those controls with existing RHIC systems. This also presents an opportunity to leverage on state of the art innovations and build collaborations both with industry and other institutions",

        "demands for operational flexibility of CERN accelerators have led to a need to mix within the same SPS super-cycle both high-intensity proton cycles for LHC or HiRadMat and ion cycles for the North Area. We present an active interlock designed to mitigate this hazard: Beam Current Transformers are used to measure the level of beam intensity",
        "and if above a set threshold",
        "pulsing of the extraction septa is vetoed. The safety function is implemented by means of two logically equivalent but diverse and separate interlock chains. This interlock is expected to be in place once the SPS resumes operation after the first Long Shutdown in 2014."
