        "The LHC collides protons at a rate of ~40MHz and each collision produces ~1.5MB of data from the ATLAS detector (~60TB of data per second). The ATLAS trigger system reduces the input rate to a more reasonable storage rate of about 400Hz. The Level1 trigger reduces the input rate to ~100kHz with a decision latency of ~2.5us and is responsible for initiating the readout of data from all the ATLAS subdetectors. It is primarily composed of the Calorimeter Trigger",
        "Muon Trigger",
        "and the Central Trigger Processor (CTP). The CTP collects trigger information from all Level1 systems and produces the Level-­-1 trigger decision. The LHC has now shutdown for upgrades and will return in 2015 with an increased luminosity and a center of mass energy of 14TeV. With higher luminosities",
        "the number and complexity of Level1 triggers will increase in order to satisfy the physics goals of ATLAS while keeping the total Level1 rates at or below 100kHz. In this talk we will discuss the current Central Trigger Processor",
        "the justification for its upgrade",
        "including the plans to satisfy the requirements of the 2015 physics run at the LHC."

This facility became operational in 2003 and operates from the AGS Booster synchrotron. In order to simulate the space radiation environment some of these experiments need to make use of beams of various energies. To simulate solar flare events",
        "we implemented the Solar Particle Simulator in 2005. This system put in modifications to the accelerator controls to allow beam energies to be changed automatically",

This project aims to allow NSRL to change ions as well as beam energies within a very short period of time. To do this requires modifications to existing controls as well as building new controls for a laser ion source. In this paper we describe NSRL",

The in-house developed control system has continuously been improved during the last 15 years of operation. Its top layer consists of a distributed shared memory database and several core applications which are running on a linux host. The interconnectivity to hardware devices is built up with a second layer of the control system operating on PCs and VMEs. High level applications are integrated into the control system using C and C++ libraries. An event based messaging system notifies attached applications about parameter updates in near real-time. The overall system structure and specific implementation details of the control system will be presented."
