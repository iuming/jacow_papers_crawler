        "The Control System of the CMS experiment ensures the monitoring and safe operation of over 1M parameters. The high demand for access to online and historical Control System Data calls for a scalable solution combining multiple data sources. The advantage of a Web solution is that data can be accessed from everywhere with no additional software. Moreover",
        "existing visualization libraries can be reused to achieve a user-friendly and effective data presentation. Access to the online information is provided with minimal impact on the running control system by using a common cache in order to be independent of the number of users. Historical data archived by the SCADA software is accessed via an Oracle Database. The web interfaces provide mostly a read-only access to data but some commands are also allowed. Moreover",
        "developers and experts use web interfaces to deploy the control software and administer the SCADA projects in production. By using an enterprise portal",
        "we profit from single sign-on and role-based access control. Portlets maintained by different developers are centrally integrated into dynamic pages",
        "resulting in a consistent user experience."
