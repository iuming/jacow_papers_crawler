        "has reached maturity providing most of the required functions. It is currently used by 55 organizations throughout the world involved in the development of plant systems and ITER controls. The first plant systems are expected to arrive on site in 2015 starting a five-year integration phase to prepare for first plasma operation. In this paper",
        "we report on the progress made on ITER control system over the last two years and outline the plans and strategies allowing us to integrate hundreds of plant systems procured in-kind by the seven ITER members."
