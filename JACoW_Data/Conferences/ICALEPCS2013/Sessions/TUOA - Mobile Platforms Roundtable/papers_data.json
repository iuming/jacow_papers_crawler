        "Roundtable panel discussion on the use of mobile devices in control systems. Topics include:- Are mobile devices really useful for controlling experimental equipment? - What are the pros and cons of using mobile devices for operator interfaces? - What are the pros and cons of each platform? - Are there applications for which mobile devices are better suited? - Are there applications for which mobile devices are not very well suited? - Native apps versus html5 - is there a clear advantage? - How to deploy apps - Which devices are most common tablets or phones? - Is supporting one platform enough? - What tools are people using to develop with? - What are the security concerns and how can they be mitigated?
