        "The particle detector array (KM2A) of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) project consists of 5631 electron and 1221 muon detection units over 1.2 square km area. To reconstruct the incident angle of cosmic ray",
        "sub-nanosecond time synchronization must be achieved. The White Rabbit (WR) protocol is applied for its high synchronization precision",
        "automatic delay compensation and intrinsic high band-width data transmit capability. This paper describes the design of a sub-nanosecond timing and data acquisition endpoint for KM2A. It works as a FMC mezzanine mounted on detector specific front-end electronic boards and provides the WR synchronized clock and timestamp. The endpoint supports EtherBone protocol for remote monitor and firmware update. Moreover",
        "a hardware UDP engine is integrated in the FPGA to pack and transmit raw data from detector electronics to readout network. Preliminary test demonstrates a timing precision of 29ps (RMS) and a timing accuracy better than 100ps (RMS).",

        "The timing system of the KEKB accelerator will be upgraded for the SuperKEKB project. One of difficulties at SuperKEKB is the positron injection. It takes more than 40ms since positron pulse must be stored at newly constructed damping ring for at least 40ms. Timings of whole accelerators are precisely synchronized for such a long period. We must manage highly frequent injections even with this situation. Typically beam pulse is delivered to one of rings at every 20ms. Besides",
        "the new system must have a capability of realtime selection of injection RF-bucket - we call it \"Bucket Selection\" at KEKB - for equalizing bunch current at main rings. Bucket Selection also will be upgraded to synchronize buckets of damping ring and those of main rings. This includes the expansion of maximum delay time up to 2ms and the pulse-by-pulse shift of RF phase at 2nd half of injection Linac. We plan to upgrade the Event Timing System from \"2-layer type\"",
        "which simply connect one generator and one receiver",
        "to \"cascade type\" for satisfying the new injection requirements. We report the basic design of the new timing system and recent studies about key elements of Event Timing System instruments."
