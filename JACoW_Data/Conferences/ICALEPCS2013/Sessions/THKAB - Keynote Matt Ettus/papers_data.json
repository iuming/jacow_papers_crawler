        "GNU Radio is a free software project for software radio. Matt Ettus joined the project shortly after it was founded in 2001. He soon realized that for the project to be truly successful",
        "it needed low cost hardware on which to build those radios",
        "and so he designed the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) in 2003 and 2004. Since then",
        "both projects have achieved significant growth and success. In 2010",
        "Matt's company",
        "Ettus Research",
        "was acquired by National Instruments",
        "and it continues to produce products and free software for the community. This talk will cover the history of both projects",
        "some of the technical details of the FPGA-based hardware architecture",
        "and the community experience over its 12 years of active development."
