SPSS can be easily configured by the SDD Tools of CODAC. However Open IE Communication is restricted to the PLC CPUs. This presents a challenge to implement redundant PLC architecture and use remote IO modules. Another version of SPSS is developed to support communication over Communication Processors(CP). The EPICS driver is also extended to support redundancy transparent to the CODAC applications. Issues of PLC communication standardization in the context of CODAC environment and future development of SPSS and EPICS driver are presented here."

One component of the instrument is a 2.5 tonne selector wheel filled with a wax/steel shielding mixture which requires complex interaction between the safety interlock and motion control systems. It provides six apertures which are equipped with various neutron beam optics plus a solid ‘shutter’ section to block the beam. A standardized Galil based motion system precisely controls the movement of the wheel while a Pilz safety PLC specifies the desired position and handles other safety aspects of the instrument. A shielded absolute SSI encoder is employed to give high accuracy feedback on the position in conjunction with a number or limit switches. This paper details the challenges of creating a motion system with inherent safety",

Therefore the EPICS toolkit has been started to use as the accelerator control system in 2009. The present control system of the KURRI FFAG complex is explained."

        "The instrumentation of large physics experiments needs to be synchronized down to few picoseconds. These experiments require different sampling rates for multi shot or single shot on each instrument distributed on a large area. Greenfield Technology presents a commercial solution with a Picoseconds Timing System built around a central Master Oscillator which delivers a serial data stream over an optical network to synchronize local multi channel delay generators. This system is able to provide several hundreds of trigger pulses within a 1ps resolution and a jitter less than 15 ps distributed over an area up to 10 000 m². The various qualities of this Picoseconds Timing System are presented with measurements and functions and have already been implemented in French facilities (Laser MegaJoule prototype - Ligne d’Intégration Laser-",

The target of the FOFB system is to hold the electron beam position at submicron range both in vertical and horizontal planes correcting the inestabilities up to 120Hz. This increased beam stability performance is considered a major asset for the beamlines user operation. To achieve this target",
        "the orbit position is acquired from the 88 Libera BPMs at a 10KHz sampling rate",
        "distributed through an independent network and the corrections are calculated and sent to the 176 power supplies that drive the corrector coils. All this correction loop is executed at 10 KHz and the total latency of the system is characterized and minimized optimizing the bandwidth response."
