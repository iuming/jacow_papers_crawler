        "have defined different requirements and are operated differently. This led to the development of four quite different Control Systems. Although a joint effort was done in the area of Detector Control Systems (DCS) allowing a common choice of components and tools and achieving the development of a common DCS Framework for the four experiments",

        "CTA as the next generation ground-based very-high-energy gamma-ray observatory is defining new areas beyond those related to physics; it is also creating new demands on the control and data acquisition system. With on the order of 100 telescopes spread over large area with numerous central facilities",
        "CTA will comprise a significantly larger number of devices than any other current imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope experiment. A prototype for the Medium Size Telescope (MST) of a diameter of 12 m has been installed in Berlin and is currently being commissioned. The design of the control software of this telescope incorporates the main tools and concepts under evaluation within the CTA consortium in order to provide an array control prototype for the CTA project. The readout and control system for the MST prototype is implemented within the ALMA Common Software (ACS) framework. The interfacing to the hardware is performed via the OPen Connectivity-Unified Architecture (OPC UA). The archive system is based on MySQL and MongoDB. In this contribution the architecture of the MST control and data acquisition system",
        "implementation details and first conclusions are presented."
