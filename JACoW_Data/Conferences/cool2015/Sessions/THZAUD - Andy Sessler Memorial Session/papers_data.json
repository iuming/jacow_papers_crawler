        "The ALPHA collaboration in CERN synthesizes antihydrogen by combining antiprotons with positrons in nested Penning-Malmberg traps. Roughly one or two antihydrogen are synthesized from the ~107 antiprotons that are provided by each cycle of the CERN Antiproton Deccelerator. Cooling is central to our success. Cooling methods used by ALPHA include collisional cooling of antiprotons on cold pre-trapped electrons",
        "electrons and positrons radiative cooling by cyclotron emission",
        "and evaporative cooling. The neutral trap depth for antihydrogen confinement is 0.54K",
        "which many orders of magnitude smaller than the initial energy",
        "~5MeV",
        "of the antiprotons provided by CERN. The potential energy associated with self-fields of the charged particles is a factor of 102-104 greater than the neutral trap depth. Moreover",
        "there is heating associated with various phase space manipulations",
        "include compression and mixing. Andy Sessler was",
        "up until his last years",
        "a fairly regular attendee of our group meetings and an ALPHA enthusiast. The story of cooling on ALPHA will be interspersed with stories about Andy's thoughts on cooling",
        "physics",
        "and life in general."
