      "abstract": "The 2 MeV electron cooler is operated in the COSY ring since 2013. So far electron beam energy up to 1.5 MeV was demonstrated. Dedicated electron cooling studies with proton beams up to 1.66 GeV kinetic energy and electron beam current up to 0.9 A were carried out. A reduction of proton beam emittance by one order of magnitude within a few hundred seconds was observed. Overview of HV and electron beam commissioning activities is presented. Electron cooling results are discussed.",

This report deals with the description of the experimental observation of longitudinal electron cooling of DC and bunched proton beam at 2425 MeV/c at COSY."
