        "We review computational work on single-pass dynamics for relativistic hadrons in electron cooling systems relevant to high-luminosity electron-hadron colliders *. We identify parameter regimes where binary collisions must be correctly treated and where they can be neglected. The mathematically correct derivation of non-magnetized dynamical friction is presented",
        "showing how the modified Pareto distribution of impact parameters can lead to incorrect interpretation of numerical results. We discuss important aspects of dynamical friction in magnetized electron cooling that require additional study.",

Along with cooling the stored ion beam these bunches create a coherent space charge field which can cause emittance growth. This process is investigated both analytically and via simulation.",
