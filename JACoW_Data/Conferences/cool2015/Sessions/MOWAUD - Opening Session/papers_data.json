        "it is necessary to get effective electron beam angular spread smaller than angular spread in proton beam. This requires to immerse electron beam in co-linear longitudinal magnetic field. It is assumed ' \"large\" proton amplitudes would be cooled with stochastic cooling",
        "but the small amplitudes core would be cooled with appropriate electron beam",
        "produced similar way as for our FEL. For higher charge ions to reach acceptable cooling rate is even easier."
