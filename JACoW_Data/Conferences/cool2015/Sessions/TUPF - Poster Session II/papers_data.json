        "A 1034 luminosity 100 TeV proton-antiproton collider is explored. The cross section for many high mass states is 10x higher in p-pbar than p-p collisions. Antiquarks for production can come directly from an antiproton rather than indirectly from gluon splitting. The higher cross sections reduce the synchrotron radiation in superconducting magnets and the vacuum system",
        "because lower beam currents can produce the same rare event rates. Events are also more central",
        "allowing a shorter detector with less space between quadrupole triplets and a smaller beta twiss for higher luminosity. To keep up with the antiproton burn rate",
        "a Fermilab-like antiproton source would be adapted to disperse the beam into 12 different momentum channels",
        "using electrostatic septa",
        "to increase antiproton momentum capture 12x. At Fermilab",
        "antiprotons were stochastically cooled in one debuncher and one accumulator ring. Because the stochastic cooling time scales as the number of particles",
        "12 independent cooling systems would be used",
        "each one with one debuncher/momentum equalizer ring and two accumulator rings. One electron cooling ring would follow the stochastic cooling rings. Finally antiprotons in the collider ring would be recycled during runs without leaving the collider ring",
        "by joining them to new bunches with snap bunch coalescence and longitudinal synchrotron damping."

        "the electron beam is highly bunched. Cooling of ions by a bunched electron beam has never been realized before",
        "thus it becomes a critical R&D to these projects. Recently we proposed a proof-of-concept experiment to demonstrate cooling by a bunched electron beam utilizing an existing DC cooler at IMP. Here we present a progress report of this experiment. We briefly describe the experiment and show the design parameters. We then report hardware installation and results of the bench tests. We also summarize the results of the cooling simulation studies and discuss the required beam measurement capability.",

We present a selection of computational techniques developed over the past several years for modeling the cooling physics on the ‘‘microscopic\" timescales",

        "during a single traversal of the cooling system. We will discuss modeling of the coherent electron cooling (CeC) scheme and its variants",

        "and electrostatic PIC simulations of the kicker subsections of the CeC cooler. Improved algorithms for computing the dynamical friction in single-pass frictional cooling simulations allow to control noise and correctly account for the statistics of rare but strong small-impact-parameter electron-ion collisions. We will present and briefly discuss the results of our simulations for the parameters of the CeC Proof-of-Principle Experiment at RHIC and the proposed MEIC CCR.",
