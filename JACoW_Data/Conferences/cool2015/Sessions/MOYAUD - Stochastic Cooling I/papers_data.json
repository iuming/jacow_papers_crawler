        "Due to the modularized start version (MSV) of the FAIR project with the postponed NESR",
        "the HESR (High Energy Storage Ring) became very attractive for experiments with heavy ions. Although the HESR is optimized for the storage of antiprotons it is also well suited for heavy-ion beams with slightly changes in the optics. Within the MSV only stochastic cooling and no e-cooling will be available",
        "but even the main 2-4 GHz stochastic cooling system will be capable to fulfill the beam requirements for heavy ions. Most critical parts of the active elements are the high power amplifiers. The stochastic cooling amplifiers for the HESR will be based on new GaN devices. Nonlinearities of these devices necessitate a dedicated analysis for use in stochastic cooling systems."

        "hadronic structure",
        "and quark-gluon dynamics with high-quality beams over a broad momentum range from 1.5 to 15 GeV/c. The facility provides the combination of powerful phase-space cooled antiproton beams and internal Pellet or gas jet targets to achieve the requirements of the experiment PANDA in terms of beam quality and luminosity. Recently",
        "the feasibility of the HESR has been investigated for the application of cooled heavy ion beams with the special emphasis on the experimental program of the SPARC collaboration at FAIR. In this contribution an outline of the Fokker-Planck approach and particle tracking for momentum cooling assisted by a barrier bucket cavity with an internal target is given. A comparison of the filter and filter-less TOF cooling techniques including beam feedback is presented. Simulation and experimental studies at COSY to verify the predictions of the cooling theory complete the contribution."
