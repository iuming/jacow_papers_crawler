        "Russia. Cooling will work with the high-intensity bunched beams in the 3-4.5 GeV energy range; all three dimensions will be treated simultaneously. The preparatory experimental work on stochastic cooling is carried out at accelerator Nuclotron (JINR) since 2010. During this work hardware solutions and automation techniques for system adjustment have been worked out and tested. Based on the gained experience the overall design of the NICA stochastic cooling system was also developed. The report describes the results of cooling experiments at Nuclotron",
        "the developed adjustment automation techniques and presents the design of the NICA stochastic cooling system."
