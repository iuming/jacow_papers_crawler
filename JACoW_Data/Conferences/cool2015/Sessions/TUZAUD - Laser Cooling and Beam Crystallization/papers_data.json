        "Compared to other cooling techniques laser cooling potentially provides a cooling force that increase with increasing beam energy. Thus",
        "laser cooling will be adopted at future high energy ion storage rings such as SIS 100 at FAIR. In the talk we discuss the fundamentals of laser cooling and the prospects of the technique in the light of recent developments in laser technology and new theoretical investigations on cooling transitions. We present our analysis on the choice of ions for initial test experiments in the light of recent results at ESR and CSRe. The presentation will conclude by analysing the beam dynamics of laser cooled ion beams and from these show how optical diagnostics can complement conventional beam diagnostics."
