            "Proposed next-generation muon collider will require major technical advances to achieve the rapid muon beam cooling requirements. Parametric-resonance Ionization Cooling (PIC) is proposed as the final 6D cooling stage of a high-luminosity muon collider. In PIC",
            "a half-integer parametric resonance causes strong focusing of a muon beam at appropriately placed energy absorbers while ionization cooling limits the beam's angular spread. Combining muon ionization cooling with parametric resonant dynamics in this way should then allow much smaller final transverse muon beam sizes than conventional ionization cooling alone. One of the PIC challenges is compensation of beam aberrations over a sufficiently wide parameter range while maintaining the dynamical stability with correlated behavior of the horizontal and vertical betatron motion and dispersion. We explore use of a coupling resonance to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and to shift the dynamics away from non-linear resonances. PIC simulations are presented."

The key components of this ERL are: the highly damped 5-cell superconducting RF cavity and the high-current superconducting RF gun. The gun is equipped with multi-alkaline photocathode insertion system. Gun and Linac operating RF frequency is 703.59 MHz. Current laser operates at 10 MHz. The R&D ERL is designed to generate 350 mA of average current. The unique design of merger system allows operating at low injection energy while preserves emittance. The flexible returning loop optics allowed to study different aspects of stability operation. Recently 500 pC per bunch charge and 5mA current in short pulses has been demonstrated. Some aspects of BNL R&D ERL design and beam tests results will be discussed. After ERL commissioning in BLDG 912 the ERL will be relocated to RHIC IP2 to be used for LEReC."

Possible luminosity upgrades make use of an ERL and full circulator ring and will require ultra-fast kickers that are beyond current technology. A novel approach to generating the necessary ultra fast (ns-level) RF kicking pulse involves the summation of specific subharmonics of the cooling electron bunch frequency; the resultant kicking pulse is then naturally constrained to have rise and fall times equal to the electron bunch frequency. The uniformity of such a pulse and its effects on the beam dynamics of the cooling electron bunch are discussed."

The beam position and bunch length will be measured by using a standard button-pickup BPM; while the beam emittance will be measured by using a CCD-based synchrotron light detector. Especially",
        "accurate time measurement is essential to carry out OSC experiments with a single particle. Desired time resolution is the order of 100 ps to study the cooling decrement in various lattice parameters. SiPM is an attractive solid-state device to detect a time domain synchrotron radiation photon. It can realize a fast rise time < 100 ps with a short time width 1-2 ns FWHM and its quantum efficiency is > 40 % at 420 nm. The beam instrumentation required to tune timing in the OSC insert is also discussed. It is based on the interference of radiation coming from the pickup and kicker undulators."

        "a half-integer parametric resonance causes strong focusing of a muon beam at appropriately placed energy absorbers while ionization cooling limits the beam's angular spread. Combining muon ionization cooling with parametric resonant dynamics in this way should then allow much smaller final transverse muon beam sizes than conventional ionization cooling alone. One of the PIC challenges is compensation of beam aberrations over a sufficiently wide parameter range while maintaining the dynamical stability with correlated behavior of the horizontal and vertical betatron motion and dispersion. We explore use of a coupling resonance to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and to shift the dynamics away from non-linear resonances. PIC simulations are presented."

        "The MEIC design at Jefferson Lab will collide electrons in a storage ring with ions in a separate ring. In order to enhance the luminosity",
        "the ions must be cooled in a cooling channel. The required current and charge necessary to cool the ions is on the order of 200 mA and 420 pC at an electron energy as high as 55 MeV. This is too high for a DC accelerator such as a pelletron and so the electron beam must be provided by an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). This presentation will discuss two options for such an ERL and show some early results of modeling and simulation for these designs. At least at the highest energy",
        "the beam quality seems to be good enough to provide a reasonable cooling rate for the ions."

The gun is equipped with multi-alkaline photocathode insertion system. Gun and Linac operating RF frequency is 703.59 MHz. Current laser operates at 10 MHz. The R&D ERL is designed to generate 350 mA of average current. The unique design of merger system allows operating at low injection energy while preserves emittance. The flexible returning loop optics allowed to study different aspects of stability operation. Recently 500 pC per bunch charge and 5mA current in short pulses has been demonstrated. Some aspects of BNL R&D ERL design and beam tests results will be discussed. After ERL commissioning in BLDG 912 the ERL will be relocated to RHIC IP2 to be used for LEReC."

Possible luminosity upgrades make use of an ERL and full circulator ring and will require ultra-fast kickers that are beyond current technology. A novel approach to generating the necessary ultra fast (ns-level) RF kicking pulse involves the summation of specific subharmonics of the cooling electron bunch frequency; the resultant kicking pulse is then naturally constrained to have rise and fall times equal to the electron bunch frequency. The uniformity of such a pulse and its effects on the beam dynamics of the cooling electron bunch are discussed."

        "The project of the Low Energy Positron Toroidal Accumulator (LEPTA) is under development at JINR. The LEPTA facility is a small positron storage ring equipped with the electron cooling system. The project positron energy is of 2 ' 10 keV. The main goal of the facility is to generate an intense flux of positronium atoms ' the bound state of electron and positron. Storage ring of LEPTA facility was commissioned in September 2004 and is under development up to now. The positron injector has been constructed in 2005 / 2010",
        "and beam transfer channel ' in 2011. By the end of August 2011 the experiments on injection into the ring of electrons and positrons stored in the trap were carried out. In 2012 - 2015",
        "the LEPTA trap optimization and new experiments on accumulation of electrons and positrons in the trap has been performed. Furthermore new cooler for positrons source has been designed and manufactured",
        "its assembling is in progress. The recent results are presented here."

        "The Rare-RI Ring (R3) is an isochronous storage ring to measure masses of short-lived rare nuclei by using a TOF method*. The expected precision of the measured mass will be of the order of ppm. A commissioning run using a 78Kr beam was performed in June 2015 and basic performances of R3 were verified. We succeeded in injecting a particle",
        "which was randomly produced from a DC beam from cyclotrons",
        "into the R3 individually** with a fast kicker system***",
        "and in extracting the particle from the R3 1 ms after the injection. We measured TOF of the 78Kr particles between the entrance and the exit of the R3 to check the isochronism. Through the first-order adjustment with trim-coils imbedded on the dipole magnets of the R3",
        "the isochronism on the 10-ppm order was achieved for the momentum spread of ±0.2 %. Higher-order adjustment employed in future will lead us to the isochronism on the order of ppm. In addition",
        "we confirmed that a resonance-type Schottky pick-up successfully acquired the revolution frequency information of one particle in a storage mode. In this conference",
        "the technical aspects of the R3 and prospects from the results of the beam commissioning will be discussed.",
