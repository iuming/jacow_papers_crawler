A triangular waveform is applied to control the excitation current for scanning the beam simultaneously in both horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) planes. A programme generates a raster pattern governed by a pre-settable number of X sweeps for each Y sweep. The dwell time at each of X-Y position was adjusted considering the time constant arising due to the inductance of the steerer. Multiple raster scans were used to produce uniform irradiation over the sample. The scanner has been successfully employed for uniform irradiation of GaAs substrate for photoconductive THz applications using 12C beam.",

The intensity of the stored ions is increased by 3-5 times at injection intensity of 5·108-109 ppp. The intensity of the stored beam is higher by one order of magnitude comparing with injection intensity of 108 ppp. The maximal intensity is restricted by the incoherent diffusion heating of the stack and the ion life time. The simulations of the cooling stacking injection were performed by BETACOL code. The coherent instability can be developed at a high ion intensity in presence of the electron cooling.

There the barrier voltage has been generated in the way that higher harmonic components of RF voltage are superimposed. Since then several groups tried this method and it has been utilized in a routine operation of Fermilab Antiproton Recycler . The induction synchrotron concept was proposed in 2000. Barrier bucket created by the pulse voltages has been assumed for beam confinement in this accelerator. Its concept was confirmed in the experiment using the 12 GeV PS in 2006**. From the early days of barrier bucket development chaotic-like motions of trapped particles in the phase space have attracted our concerns . However there are no systematic studies focusing on this point. The paper will discuss what causes such chaotic motions and how it is sensitive to barrier bucket parameters such as the voltage pulse profile with a finite rising/falling time and its amplitude. We will propose what counter measures are effective in order to mitigate increasing of the longitudinal emittance caused by this instability. reference for this paper to",

We have observed transverse oscillations for both Pb54+ and Ar11+ ion species at the beginning of the beam loss via the high bandwidth pickups from the tune measurement system. For these transverse oscillations a growth time comparison will be presented in order to categorize the nature of the observed ion beam loss. The chromaticity has also been measured for both ions. For Pb54+ this has been measured during the magnetic ramp by creating a radial offset with the LEIR RF system",

            "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) being built at Michigan State University for the US DOE will deliver heavy ion beams with beam power of 400 kW. SRF cavities accelerate the ions to energies above 200 MeV/u. At energies of 16-20 MeV/u a charge stripper increases the charge state just before the first bend in the linac (a second bend is located downstream). Due to the high power deposition on the stripping media and radiation damage solid strippers are not practical. The baseline design selected a liquid lithium film stripper. This stripper has been developed in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory. A stripper module is being built at MSU with an estimated completion date of December 2015. We plan to operate the stripper outside the FRIB tunnel for 18 months to learn the reliability and stability issues before final installation in the accelerator."

The ground breaking started at the end of 2010. The integration task of the different equipments into the buildings is managed by a trade-oriented integration unit gathering the accelerator integration team, the building prime contractor and a dedicated contracting assistant. All work packages are synthesized at the same time using 3D models. 3D tools are used to carry out integration, synthesis, process connections and the preparation of the future assembly. Since 2014, the buildings and process connections are received and the accelerator installation is well advanced. This contribution will describe these 3D tools, the building construction, the process connection status and our experience feedback.

            "The SPES project at Laboratori di Legnaro of INFN (Italy) is concentrating on the production of neutron-rich radioactive nuclei by the Uranium fission at a rate of 1013 fission/s. The emphasis to neutron-rich isotopes is justified by the fact that this vast territory has been little explored in the last years. The Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) will be produced by ISOL technique using the 40 MeV proton-induced fission on a Direct Target of UCx. The most critical element of the SPES project is the Multi-Foil Direct Target. Up to day the proposed target represents an innovation in term of capability to sustain the primary beam power of about 8kW. The reaction products are extracted from the target by thermal process",

The Phase II upgrade consisted of twenty additional cavities housed in three cryomodules. The upgrade brings the linac to a nominal 40 MV of effective accelerating voltage according to design specification. Moreover the upgrade was the first step to qualify a Canadian vendor (PAVAC) for the production of superconducting cavities. Each cryomodule includes bulk niobium quarter wave resonators and a 9T superconducting solenoid for transverse focusing. The linac features a single vacuum space. Over the years the linac has experienced vacuum incidents and high power rf cable failures in vacuum that were addressed during maintenance. In a recent maintenance program cavities from a single cryomodule were re-etched to improve performance. Future cavity treatments are in the plan but they are restricted by the scientific program. The status of the linac",
            "performance and future development plans will be presented. Reliability and availability of the linac will be discussed",

            "a new superconducting module was installed in the Booster section of the linac replacing three old cryomodules of split-ring resonators. The split-rings are known to cause excessive beam steering leading to beam loss which limits the maximum current in ATLAS. We are planning a second run to try to push the beam current higher and farther into the linac. The ultimate goal is to accelerate 10 pμA to the Booster exit at 5 MeV/u. Among the limitations encountered in the first run are the large beam emittance at the ECR source and the beam loss in the LEBT. The results of these attempts will be presented and discussed.",

The subject was selected by how the part is affected by RF (Radio Frequency) in the cavity operation at cryo-temperature. The QAAS consist of property analysis and checking the surface condition. Each step has criteria its own to pass the assurance and acceptance system. The method to analyze the properties and to inspect the niobium surface was described. The certificates were classified by RRR values of Nb pieces due to distribution of RRR value. The Nb properties slightly different by RRR values",

The additional glazer lens on axial injection of AVF cyclotron is one of those and it has been installed for the purpose of increasing beam transmission to the inflector in center region of cyclotron. Another development is additional buncher for the heavy ion injection like Xe beam which requires high voltage in comparison with proton case. Extension of baffle slits on injection line of Ring Cyclotron also has been done to extend the flexibility of injection orbit. Modification of low energy beam transport (LEBT) from 18GHz Superconducting ECR ion source to AVF injection axis also has been carried.",

This steerer is adapted to work as a scanner by employing a microcontroller and an interface unit for constant current bipolar power supply. A triangular waveform is applied to control the excitation current for scanning the beam simultaneously in both horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) planes. A programme generates a raster pattern governed by a pre-settable number of X sweeps for each Y sweep. The dwell time at each of X-Y position was adjusted considering the time constant arising due to the inductance of the steerer. Multiple raster scans were used to produce uniform irradiation over the sample. The scanner has been successfully employed for uniform irradiation of GaAs substrate for photoconductive THz applications using 12C beam.",

        "A novel scheme for a racetrack-shape fixed field induction accelerator (RAFFIA) capable of accelerating extremely heavy cluster ions (giant cluster ions) * is described. The key feature of this scheme is rapid induction acceleration by localized induction cells. Triggering the induction voltages provided by the signals from the circulating bunch allows repeated acceleration of extremely heavy cluster ions. Under the hypothesis that the RAFFIA is an induction synchrotron ** with an adiabatically varying circumference",
        "the given RAFFIA example is capable of realizing the integrated acceleration voltage of 50 MV per acceleration cycle for C-60 (A=720 and Q=7). Using 90° bending magnets with a reversed field strip and field gradient is crucial for assuring orbit stability in the RAFFIA. Interesting beam physics such as resonance crossing during an acceleration cycle is discussed",

      "abstract": "Barrier bucket beam trapping has some history. For the first time Griffin proposed this method and demonstrated in Tevatron project in 1983*. There the barrier voltage has been generated in the way that higher harmonic components of RF voltage are superimposed. Since then several groups tried this method and it has been utilized in a routine operation of Fermilab Antiproton Recycler . The induction synchrotron concept was proposed in 2000. Barrier bucket created by the pulse voltages has been assumed for beam confinement in this accelerator. Its concept was confirmed in the experiment using the 12 GeV PS in 2006**. From the early days of barrier bucket development chaotic-like motions of trapped particles in the phase space have attracted our concerns . However there are no systematic studies focusing on this point. The paper will discuss what causes such chaotic motions and how it is sensitive to barrier bucket parameters such as the voltage pulse profile with a finite rising/falling time and its amplitude. We will propose what counter measures are effective in order to mitigate increasing of the longitudinal emittance caused by this instability. reference for this paper to",

        "several kinds of extensions and updates have been performed in the EPICS-based RIBF control system as well as the accelerators and their components. We will here present the overview of the EPICS-based RIBF control system and its two latest updates. One is a newly installed safety system in addition to the existing two kinds of RIBF beam interlock systems following significant increase of the beam intensity extracted from the SRC. The other is development of some kinds of successors that are designed to be compatible with the existing aged controllers for magnet power supplies.",

For these transverse oscillations a growth time comparison will be presented in order to categorize the nature of the observed ion beam loss. The chromaticity has also been measured for both ions. For Pb54+ this has been measured during the magnetic ramp by creating a radial offset with the LEIR RF system",

        "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) being built at Michigan State University for the US DOE will deliver heavy ion beams with beam power of 400 kW. SRF cavities accelerate the ions to energies above 200 MeV/u. At energies of 16-20 MeV/u a charge stripper increases the charge state just before the first bend in the linac (a second bend is located downstream). Due to the high power deposition on the stripping media and radiation damage solid strippers are not practical. The baseline design selected a liquid lithium film stripper. This stripper has been developed in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory. A stripper module is being built at MSU with an estimated completion date of December 2015. We plan to operate the stripper outside the FRIB tunnel for 18 months to learn the reliability and stability issues before final installation in the accelerator."

The ground breaking started at the end of 2010. The integration task of the different equipments into the buildings is managed by a trade-oriented integration unit gathering the accelerator integration team, the building prime contractor and a dedicated contracting assistant. All work packages are synthesized at the same time using 3D models. 3D tools are used to carry out integration, synthesis, process connections and the preparation of the future assembly. Since 2014, the buildings and process connections are received and the accelerator installation is well advanced. This contribution will describe these 3D tools, the building construction, the process connection status and our experience feedback.

The Phase II upgrade consisted of twenty additional cavities housed in three cryomodules. The upgrade brings the linac to a nominal 40 MV of effective accelerating voltage according to design specification. Moreover the upgrade was the first step to qualify a Canadian vendor (PAVAC) for the production of superconducting cavities. Each cryomodule includes bulk niobium quarter wave resonators and a 9T superconducting solenoid for transverse focusing. The linac features a single vacuum space. Over the years the linac has experienced vacuum incidents and high power rf cable failures in vacuum that were addressed during maintenance. In a recent maintenance program cavities from a single cryomodule were re-etched to improve performance. Future cavity treatments are in the plan but they are restricted by the scientific program. The status of the linac",

        "a new superconducting module was installed in the Booster section of the linac replacing three old cryomodules of split-ring resonators. The split-rings are known to cause excessive beam steering leading to beam loss which limits the maximum current in ATLAS. We are planning a second run to try to push the beam current higher and farther into the linac. The ultimate goal is to accelerate 10 pμA to the Booster exit at 5 MeV/u. Among the limitations encountered in the first run are the large beam emittance at the ECR source and the beam loss in the LEBT. The results of these attempts will be presented and discussed.",

        "a heavy ion accelerator facility called RAON is being designed to produce various rare isotopes under the Rare Isotope Science Project. Electron beam ion source (EBIS) will be used for charge breeding of rare isotope beams in the ISOL system*. The electron beam simulation has been performed from an E-gun cathode to a collector by using TRAK**. The electron beam current is set to be 3A at the beam energy of 20kV",
        "and the electron beam current density can reach up to 500 A/cm2 by maximum magnetic field of about 6T. The breeding time of 132Sn33+ is calculated to be 61ms under these electron beam condition. In case of 133Cs33+",
        "the breeding time is about 67ms. The ion beam simulation has been performed for both injection and extraction operation modes by using TRAK and SIMION***. The ion transport design is based on these simulation results. In the other hand",
