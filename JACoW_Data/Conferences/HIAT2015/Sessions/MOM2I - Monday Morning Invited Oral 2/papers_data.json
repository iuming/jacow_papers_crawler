        "Recent years have witnessed a significantly increasing worldwide interest in charged particle therapy with protons and carbon ions",
        "which allows uniquely precise delivery of a high dose to the target volume while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally",
        "carbon ion beams deliver a larger mean energy per unit length of trajectory in the body than protons and X-ray beams. This unique property includes a high biological effect when used in radiotherapy. Thus",
        "we have high expectations for carbon ion radiotherapy as a promising treatment for intractable tumors that are resistant to X-ray beams.",
