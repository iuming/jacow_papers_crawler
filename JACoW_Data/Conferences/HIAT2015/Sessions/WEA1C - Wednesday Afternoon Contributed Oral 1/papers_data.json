        "superconducting cavities has been installed on-line and commissioned from June 2014. Proton beam has been accelerated to 5 MeV at CW operation mode successfully. More than 25kW proton beam has been operated stable for one hour",
        "which is the highest record among the same type linacs. In this paper",

It can deliver ions from proton to uranium. Proton and uranium ions are accelerated up to 600 MeV and 200 MeV/u respectively. The facility consists of three superconducting linacs of which superconducting cavities are independently phased. Requirement of the linac design is especially high for acceleration of multiple charge beams. In this paper",
