        "In 2007",
        "we installed a rotating disk stripper device at the final charge stripping section for the uranium (U) beam acceleration at RIKEN RI Beam Factory. The first rotating carbon disk (C-disk) stripper was useless because of its poor surface flatness and unexpected low density. In 2012",
        "we started the stable U beam operation using beryllium (Be) as the disk material. We successfully improved the flatness of the Be-disk by special polishing technique in 2014",
        "and the transmission efficiency was greatly improved as well. However",
        "it seemed to be impossible that the Be-disk withstood the heat load of the expected intensity in future",
        "considering its deformation. Then",
        "the polishing technique for the Be-disk improvement was applied to the Glassy carbon (GC) disk. The GC-disk flatness was improved maintaining high density. In addition",
        "a tested high-density highly oriented graphite sheet",
        "which is fabricated from a high polymer film in high temperature and high pressure conditions",
        "can be applied as the charge stripping disk since the better stripping efficiency and transmission value than those of Be and the C-disk were realized.",

The extraction efficiency is low since a big percentage of the accelerated beam is lost on the electrostatic deflector. Recently",

        "as a consequence",
        "mechanical constraints have been considered too. It emerges that a new wide extraction channel fulfils the beam requirements. Therefore",
