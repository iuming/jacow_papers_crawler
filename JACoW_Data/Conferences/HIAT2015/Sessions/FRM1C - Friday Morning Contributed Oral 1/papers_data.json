        "A superconducting rotating-gantry for carbon therapy is being developed. This isocentric rotating gantry can transport carbon ions with the maximum energy of 430 MeV/u to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over 0-360 degrees",
        "and is further capable of performing three-dimensional raster-scanning irradiation. The combined-function superconducting magnets were employed for the rotating gantry. The superconducting magnets with optimized beam optics allowed a compact gantry design with a large scan size at the isocenter; the length and the radius of the gantry are approximately 13 and 5.5 m",
        "respectively",
        "which are comparable to those for the existing proton gantries. Furthermore",
        "the maximum scan size at the isocenter is calculated to be as large as approximately 200 mm square for heavy-ion beams at the maximum energy of 430 MeV/u. A construction and installation of the superconducting gantry is in progress",
        "and beam commissioning will begin from this autumn. We will present a status of the superconducting rotating-gantry.",
