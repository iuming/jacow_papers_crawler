        "The ISAC-II superconducting linac is operating for almost a decade. The first installation includes twenty cavities housed in five cryomodules. The Phase II upgrade consisted of twenty additional cavities housed in three cryomodules. The upgrade brings the linac to a nominal 40 MV of effective accelerating voltage according to design specification. Moreover the upgrade was the first step to qualify a Canadian vendor (PAVAC) for the production of superconducting cavities. Each cryomodule includes bulk niobium quarter wave resonators and a 9T superconducting solenoid for transverse focusing. The linac features a single vacuum space. Over the years the linac has experienced vacuum incidents and high power rf cable failures in vacuum that were addressed during maintenance. In a recent maintenance program cavities from a single cryomodule were re-etched to improve performance. Future cavity treatments are in the plan but they are restricted by the scientific program. The status of the linac",
        "performance and future development plans will be presented. Reliability and availability of the linac will be discussed",
        "metrics that will become even more important with the advent of ARIEL.",
