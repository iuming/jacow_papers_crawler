        "This contribution describes new technique to diagnose faults with high-voltage components in electrostatic accelerators. The main application of this technique is non-invasive testing of high-voltage grading systems; measuring insulation resistance or; determining the volume and surface resistivity of insulation materials used in column posts and acceleration tubes. In addition",
        "it allows verification of the continuity of the resistive divider assembly as a complete circuit. A simple and practical fault finding data interpretation procedure has been established based on simple concepts. As a result of efficient in-situ troubleshooting and fault elimination techniques",
        "the maximum values of |ΔR/R| are kept below 2.5% at the conclusion of maintenance procedures. The 2015 and beyond acceptance margin was reduced further to below 1% by increasing the test voltage from 40 V to 100 V. The experimental verification of improved resolution has been conducted during recent scheduled accelerator maintenance in May-June 2015 when few unique fault categories have been identified by the ultra-high impedance technique.",
