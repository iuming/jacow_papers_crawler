        "We propose a separated sector cyclotron (SSC) using high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet for a next generation cyclotron. From its stability and low operating cost",
        "HTS cyclotrons are expected to apply for accelerator-driven subcritical reactors or beam cancer treatment systems. On the other hand",
        "we still have a variety of issues and challenges to implement them. As a first step",
        "we are planning to develop an HTS cyclotron as an injector for K400 ring cyclotron at RCNP. It will be the first attempt in the world. This plan will improve beam intensity in our facility and also contribute to component developments for the next generation cyclotron. The most serious issues are development of large-size HTS magnets that can be used in SSC. One-meter-size HTS dipole magnet is made for testing. Now we are going to exam the magnet and evaluate the characteristics of large HTS magnets. The result of the test will be incorporated with the sector magnet design. Moreover",
        "we have been working on conceptual design of the new injector",
        "developed magnetic field and orbit analysis programs. In this session",
        "the current status of designing HTS injector cyclotron at RCNP will be discussed.",
