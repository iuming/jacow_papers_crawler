        "aiming at an enhanced yield into the required charge states. The setup delivers short",

        "including a comparison to the present gas stripper based on a N2 gas-jet. The stripping efficiency into the desired 28+ charge state was significantly increased by up to 60 % using a hydrogen stripper target while the beam quality remained similar.",
