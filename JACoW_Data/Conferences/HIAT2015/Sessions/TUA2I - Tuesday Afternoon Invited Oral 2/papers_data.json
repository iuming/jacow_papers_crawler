        "The first phase of the Spiral 2 project dealing with the high-power superconducting linac and the two experimental areas called Neutron for Science (NFS) and Super Separator Spectrometer (S3) is well advanced. The building and conventional facilities are now ready and the project is entered in a phase during which the linac components are successively installed and commissioned (the first beam has been produced in December 2014). After having briefly recalled the project scope and parameters",
        "the constraints linked to the safety rules and the way the installation and commissioning are done will be explained. The next steps which are the DESIR low-energy experimental area and the q/A = 1/7 heavy ion second injector will be also presented.",
