        "Over one year ago the ATLAS Efficiency and Intensity Upgrade (EIU) was finished. A major portion of this upgrade was the installation of a new superconducting cryomodule for the acceleration of β = 0.077 heavy-ion beams. The EIU cryomodule is capable of supplying a voltage gain greater than 17.5 MV with a total cryogenic load of 45 W to 4.5 K",
        "12 W static and 33 W dynamic. This unit is comprised of seven 72.75 MHz quarter-wave resonators and four 9 T solenoids. This presentation will review the technology advances that resulted in exceptional operational performance of the EIU cryomodule and the ongoing development work for a new eight-cavity β = 0.11 half-wave cryomodule.",
