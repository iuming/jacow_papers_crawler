        "isotopes between protons and uranium with a charge to mass range of 1/1 to 1/7. The maximum energy ranges of these accelerated ions are 7-17 MeV per nucleon with intensities ranging from a few thousand ions/second to microampere currents. On average ATLAS delivers a different ion species and energy each week to one of six target areas. ATLAS currently operates 24 hours a day",
        "7 days per week",
        "and at least 40 weeks per year. Topics discussed will be how we handle day to day operation of the facility including start up",
        "reusing old accelerator configurations for new experiments (scaling)",
        "tuning for in-flight produced radioactive beams",
        "troubleshooting problems",
