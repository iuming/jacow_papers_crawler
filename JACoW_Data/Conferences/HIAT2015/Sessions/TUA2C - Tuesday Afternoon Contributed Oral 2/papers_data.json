        "The SPES project at Laboratori di Legnaro of INFN (Italy) is concentrating on the production of neutron-rich radioactive nuclei by the Uranium fission at a rate of 1013 fission/s. The emphasis to neutron-rich isotopes is justified by the fact that this vast territory has been little explored in the last years. The Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) will be produced by ISOL technique using the 40 MeV proton-induced fission on a Direct Target of UCx. The most critical element of the SPES project is the Multi-Foil Direct Target.

      "abstract": "The GANIL SPIRAL 2 Project is based on the construction of a superconducting ion CW LINAC (up to 5 mA - 40 MeV deuteron and 33 MeV proton beams, up to 1 mA - 14.5 MeV/u heavy ion beams) with two experimental areas named S3 ('Super Separator Spectrometer' for very heavy and super heavy element production) and NFS ('Neutron For Science'), The building studies as well as the accelerator and experimental equipment integration started in 2009. The ground breaking started at the end of 2010. The integration task of the different equipments into the buildings is managed by a trade-oriented integration unit gathering the accelerator integration team, the building prime contractor and a dedicated contracting assistant. All work packages are synthesized at the same time using 3D models. 3D tools are used to carry out integration, synthesis, process connections and the preparation of the future assembly. Since 2014, the buildings and process connections are received and the accelerator installation is well advanced. This contribution will describe these 3D tools, the building construction, the process connection status and our experience feedback.
