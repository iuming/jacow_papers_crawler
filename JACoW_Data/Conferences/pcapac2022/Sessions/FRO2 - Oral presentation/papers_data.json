        "EPICS is adopted as standard to build the complex control system which involves hundreds of IOCs and millions of records. Most of IOCs run in industrial control computers as soft IOC. However",
        "with the large amount of PVs",
        "the need has emerged to develop remote tools to monitor all the channels and IOCs. One application backed by MySQL is designed",
        "running periodically to interact with EPICS system where to take data from run-time databases via Channel Access and pvAccess. We embed scripting codes into the IOC startup script to realize that as soon as the IOC starts up",
        "the information of the server’s address",
        "the IOC installation path",
        "and all the records maintained by the IOC will be automatically pushed to the application and then stored in the database. With this necessary information",
        "we could access all the active IOCs and PVs. Another web application is designed to render servers",
        "IOCs and PVs data in MySQL on the web to give us an overall running status of the control system. We also fully consider the modularity and portability for the applications to apply and extend in none-SHINE environments.",
