        "Building a control system for a scientific facility is a complex process that requires a lot of time coordination and the cooperation of hundreds of people. The latest of our control system for 10 J 100 Hz laser system happened to be built when access to the lab was much more difficult",
        "due to the pandemic that made travel much more complex",
        "and local restrictions at one point prevented large number of people from being in the lab at the same time. This paper shows how",
        "despite the demanding working conditions",
        "we built the control system for the 10 J 100 Hz laser. The control system was designed in collaboration with CLF (STFC",
        "UK) and HiLASE (Institute of Physics",
        "ASCR). The whole process of building the laser control system was divided into stages and we had to rely on remote working. This article discusses how we adapted each stage to work remotely",
        "what tools we used",
        "how we minimised the risks",
        "and what we would have done differently if we had started from scratch.",

        "The CERN Proton Irradiation Facility (IRRAD) is a reference facility in high-energy physics for the qualification of detectors, material, and electronic components against radiation. A proton beam with a momentum of 24 GeV/c is delivered from the CERN PS accelerator to IRRAD and impinges on the components being tested, placed on remotely controlled moveable stages. This equipment, operated by dedicated control systems, allows for the precise positioning of components in or out of the beam and facilitates the handling of irradiated components, while minimising the radiation received by the IRRAD operators. Originally, the implementation of the Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) of the IRRAD control system was based on proprietary software, thus limiting it to specific operating system. To address the issues linked to such dependencies in terms of openness, ease of development and access to state-of-the-art technologies new GUIs have been designed and developed with open-license cross-platform software. In this paper, the IRRAD control system software architecture is detailed, and the lessons learned while implementing these new feature-rich GUIs are presented."
