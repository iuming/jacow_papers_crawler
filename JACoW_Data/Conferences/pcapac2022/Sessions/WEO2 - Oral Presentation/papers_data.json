        "At present two cyclotrons are operational in Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC)",
        "namely K130 Room Temperature Cyclotron (RTC) and K500 Superconducting Cyclotron (SCC). Around 2008",
        "the open source distributed control system framework",
        "EPICS was adopted for the development of RTC control system in VECC after its modernization. The journey was started with EPICS Base 3.14.8",
        "asynDriver R4-4 and MEDM. Initially",
        "the control system for precision magnet power supplies and vacuum system of RTC were implemented using EPICS. Over time",
        "other systems like beam diagnostics",
        "ion source gas flow system",
        "beam line vacuum system of RTC were integrated with EPICS control system. There are also a number of unique EPICS based developments took place in VECC. The control system of SCC is also upgraded with EPICS over time. Recently some of the cyclotron model and analysis codes are integrated with SCC control system. A MySQL based machine operational database is also developed for storing operational data. The Control System Studio (CSS) is now taken up for developing the operator interface. The evolution of EPICS based control system in VECC over time is discussed in this paper.",
