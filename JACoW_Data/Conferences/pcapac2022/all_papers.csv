pcapac2022,,WEO21,"Status of EPICS Based Control System for the Cyclotrons in VECC, Kolkata",A. Roy; N. Chaddha; S. Sahoo; VECC; Kolkata; India; At present two cyclotrons are operational in Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC); namely K130 Room Temperature Cyclotron (RTC) and K500 Superconducting Cyclotron (SCC). Around 2008; the open source distributed control system framework; EPICS was adopted for the development of RTC control system in VECC after its modernization. The journey was started with EPICS Base 3.14.8; asynDriver R4-4 and MEDM. Initially; the control system for precision magnet power supplies and vacuum system of RTC were implemented using EPICS. Over time; other systems like beam diagnostics; ion source gas flow system; beam line vacuum system of RTC were integrated with EPICS control system. There are also a number of unique EPICS based developments took place in VECC. The control system of SCC is also upgraded with EPICS over time. Recently some of the cyclotron model and analysis codes are integrated with SCC control system. A MySQL based machine operational database is also developed for storing operational data. The Control System Studio (CSS) is now taken up for developing the operator interface. The evolution of EPICS based control system in VECC over time is discussed in this paper.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; M. Yang; N. Kamikubota; K.C. Sato; J-PARC; KEK & JAEA; Ibaraki-ken; Japan; JAEA/J-PARC; Tokai-mura; Japan; KIS; Ibaraki; Japan; Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) timing system has been in operation since 2006. Over the past 16 years; there were trigger-failure events; and some of which seriously affected the operation of J-PARC ac-celerator; especially at Main Ring. To troubleshoot the source of such events more quickly; we decided to devel-op a timing read-back system to read back distributed timing signals at the device side. A PLC-type triggered scaler module was developed as a key of the system. It can count number of pulses in an accelerator cycle and store the counts in a momentary array. Using the module; customized read-back applications for various timing-related signals have been developed: (a) read-back a 25-Hz trigger clock; (b) read-back a pulsed bending magnet trig-ger; (c) read-back a magnet power-supply trigger. These applications were implemented successfully in J-PARC Main Ring; and demonstrated as countermeasure against past trigger-failure events.

pcapac2022,,THO11,Building Control System Remotely,M. Lukaszewski; K. Klys; E9; London; United Kingdom; Building a control system for a scientific facility is a complex process that requires a lot of time coordination and the cooperation of hundreds of people. The latest of our control system for 10 J 100 Hz laser system happened to be built when access to the lab was much more difficult; due to the pandemic that made travel much more complex; and local restrictions at one point prevented large number of people from being in the lab at the same time. This paper shows how; despite the demanding working conditions; we built the control system for the 10 J 100 Hz laser. The control system was designed in collaboration with CLF (STFC; UK) and HiLASE (Institute of Physics; ASCR). The whole process of building the laser control system was divided into stages and we had to rely on remote working. This article discusses how we adapted each stage to work remotely; what tools we used; how we minimised the risks; and what we would have done differently if we had started from scratch.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; B. Plötzeneder; T. Mazanec; ELI-BEAMS; Prague; Czech Republic; The Control & DAQ systems of ELI Beamlines store data inside a Cassandra cluster; and traditionally provide access and visualization via standard CS GUIs and archiver tools. In 2020; motivated by the increasing operational demands of a maturing facility; we started to develop a concept which was initially only intended as a machine-status website to expose some of this data live. Responding to wildly diverging stakeholder feedback; this evolved into a new layer for rapid data access (’archiver cache’); based on InfluxDB; with Grafana as a frontend. Fully operational since 2021; this stack has become a powerful and heavily used tool for operations; and is continuously extended to include auxiliary data sources beyond CS (building management; IT monitoring; cleanroom…).

Projects often want to use Beckhoff PLCs for applications that have to handle a large amount of signals with fast cycle times. So; how can we connect Beckhoff devices to EPICS control systems without sacrificing performance? Beckhoff offers multiple possibilities when it comes to interfacing with their PLCs or industrial PCs; such as modbus; OPC UA; or ADS protocols. While all of these could be used for the usual use cases; we believe that for more data intensive applications; ADS works best. For this reason; Cosylab developed an EPICS device support module that implements advanced ADS features; such as ADS sum commands; which provide fast read/write capabilities to your IOCs.,,use link to see paper's listing under its alternate paper code reference for this paper ※ doi:10.18429/JACoW-PCaPAC2022-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2022/talks/thpp2_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2022/papers/thpp2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2022/posters/thpp2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2022-THPP2,31

The central component for Settings Management within the FAIR Control System is based on CERN’s framework ""LHC Software Architecture"" (LSA) and enhanced by FAIR specific features. One of the most complex features is the control mechanism of storage ring operations; the so-called Storage Ring Mode. This operation mode allows to manipulate device settings while the beam is circulating in the ring. There are four different types of possible changes in the Storage Ring Mode: skipping; repetition; breakpoint and manipulation. The Storage Ring Mode was developed in late 2019 and first used with beam in 2020 at the existing heavy ion Storage Ring ESR at GSI. This contribution illustrates in detail how the Storage Ring Mode is implemented within LSA and other subsystems. It also shows how it is operated using the Expert Storage Ring Mode application.",,use link to see paper's listing under its alternate paper code,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2022/talks/thpp3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2022/papers/thpp3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/pcapac2022/posters/thpp3_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PCAPAC2022-THPP3,34

Therefore; the trip event logger is currently developed; - a fault diagnosis tool to detect errors online; inform the operators and trigger automatic supervisory actions. Further goals are to provide information for a fault tree and event tree analysis as well as a database of labeled faultydata sets for offline analysis. The tool is based on the C++ framework ChimeraTK Application Core. With this close interconnection to the control system it is possible not only to monitor but also to intervene as it is of great importance for supervisory tasks. The core of the tool consists of fault analysis modules ranging from simple ones (e.g.; limit checking) to advanced ones (model-based; machine learning; etc.).

One of the critical factors which can lead to beam degradation is the thermal drifts and the mechanical inertias present in the optical elements; such as a monochromator. This article shows a new functionality of the ALBA Electrometer (Em#); which ensures that the beamline receives the maximum possible beam intensity during the experiment. From the current reading of an ionization chamber and driving the piezo-actuator pitch of the monochromator; the Em# implements a Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm that detects the peak beam intensity while tracking it.

The ’IBPT Python tools’ were created to provide a unified interface to all aspects of the accelerator infrastructure for both short-term student projects and basic accelerator operations. Instead of creating another custom framework; these sets of tools focus on bridging the gap between well established libraries and our facility and accelerator specific needs. External and accelerator specific libraries are glued together to provide an interface in order to minimize the technical knowledge of the accelerator infrastructure needed by the end user. Well established software engineering workflows of continuous integration were implemented to provide automatic testing; packaging; API documentation and release management.

pcapac2022,,FRO22,Data Acquisition Software Pipeline for the Commissioning of the LoKI Small Angle Neutron Scattering Instrument,J.L. Walker; S. Alcock; M.J. Christensen; J.E. Houston; K. Muric; W. Potrzebowski; T.S. Richter; ESS; Copenhagen; Denmark; STFC/RAL/ISIS; Chilton; Didcot; Oxon; United Kingdom; The LoKI Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) instrument will be one of the first instruments to be commissioned at the European Spallation Source (ESS); and will contribute to the early science programme. The detector for the instrument was tested at the ISIS neutron source facility in March of 2022; and this paper outlines the data acquisition software pipeline. It consists of a readout master; an Event Formation Unit (EFU); an instance of Kafka; a NeXus file writer; and; the data reduction software; Scipp. The readout master is responsible for synchronising detector readout timestamps with an external reference; and aggregating those readouts into UDP packets sent to the EFU. The EFU processes the readout data to produce event messages containing a location and time of arrival for each neutron event detected; and acts as a Kafka producer sending event messages to Kafka. The NeXus file writer consists of a Kafka consumer that compiles event messages and other experiment data from a given time interval into a single NeXus file for further analysis. Finally; Scipp is a data reduction python library used to visualise and analyse the experiment data after an experiment is completed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; M.A. Alzubi; A. Abbadi; M. Abdellatief; A. Al-Dalleh; A. Aljadaa; B.R. Aljamal; M.F. Genisel; M. Harfouche; G. Iori; G.S. Kamel; R. Khrais; A. Lausi; S.A. Matalgah; A.S. Mohammad; Y.R. Momani; SESAME; Allan; Jordan; Experimental data collection is the essential process of acquiring experimental raw data along with its associated metadata from SESAME beamlines.
