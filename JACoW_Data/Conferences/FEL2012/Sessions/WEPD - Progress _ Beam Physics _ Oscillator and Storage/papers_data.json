It is aimed to deliver 100 fs long photon pulses to two undulator-based beamlines operating with soft X-rays (TEMPO) and hard X-rays (CRISTAL). SOLEIL storage ring is equipped with a Ti:Sa laser which produces 30 fs pulses at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 2.5 kHz. The laser beam is splitted into two branches in order to provide 2 mJ to the modulator and 1 mJ as pump pulse for the CRISTAL and TEMPO end stations. Focusing optics and beam path",

It produces a magnetic field of 1.8 T at a minimum gap of 14.5 mm. The non-zero dispersion function present in all straight sections of the storage ring will enable to easily separate the sliced bunches from the core bunches at the beamlines' location. In this paper",

        "Investigations of the laser-induced microbunching as it is related to time-sliced electron-beam diagnostics and high-gain-harmonic generation (HGHG) free-electron lasers using bright electron beams are proposed for the Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) facility at Fermilab. Initial tests at 40-50 MeV with an amplified 800-nm seed laser beam co-propagating with the electron beam through a short undulator (or modulator) tuned for the third-harmonic resonance condition followed by transport through a subsequent chicane will result in energy modulation and z-density modulation (microbunching)",
        "respectively. The latter microbunching will result in generation of coherent optical or UV transition radiation (COTR",
        "CUVTR) at a metal converter screen which can reveal slice beam size",
        "centroid",
        "and energy spread. Additionally",
        "direct assessment of the microbunching factors related to HGHG by measurement of the COTR intensity and harmonic content after the chicane as a function of seed laser power and beam parameters will be done. These experiments will be performed using the ASTA 1-MHz-rate micropulse train for up to 1ms which is unique to test facilities in the USA."
