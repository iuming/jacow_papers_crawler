        "and high-average brightness–will greatly enrich the era of x-ray FELs begun recently. If combined with a high-gain amplifier possibly with harmonic generation",
        "an XFELO would constitute an ultimate x-ray machine. The drive accelerator can either be a straight SCRF linac or an ERL in energy gain mode. Sub-Angstrom stabilization of the output x-ray pulse spacing may be feasible by locking one of the longitudinal modes to a nuclear resonance such as 57Fe",
        "opening up new opportunities for extreme x-ray metrology",
        "with potential applications to technology and fundamental physics [B. Adams and K.-J. Kim",
        "FEL2012]. A wide range of parameters is possible [R.R. Lindberg",
        "FEL2012]",
        "optimized for particular accelerator or applications",
        "such as ultra-low bunch charge for ERL [1]",
        "for short cavity length for nuclear resonance metrology",
        "etc. The prospects for an XFELO are encouraging: Diamond as a Bragg reflector has been demonstrated for near 99% reflectivity [2] and high thermal diffusivity at cryogenic temperature [3].",
