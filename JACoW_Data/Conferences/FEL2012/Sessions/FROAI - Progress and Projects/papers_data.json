        "and the experience of low emittance beam transport in the LCLS called for less conservative assumptions for the beam quality delivered to the SASE undulators. The change in beam parameters and the interests expressed by the users in the first round of workshops concerning the scientific instruments initiated changes in the undulator systems and SASE wavelength ranges. We summarize the present status and highlight recent developments in the European XFEL design."
