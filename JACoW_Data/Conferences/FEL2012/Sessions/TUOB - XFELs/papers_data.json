        "As a seeded FEL based on a single stage HGHG configuration",
        "FERMI's FEL-1 has produced very narrow bandwidth FEL pulses in the XUV wavelength region relative to those typical of SASE devices. This important feature of seeded FELs relies however upon the capability to produce high quality electron beams and with clean longitudinal phase spaces. As has been predicted previously",
        "the FEL output spectra can be modified from a simple",
        "nearly transform-limited single spike by modulation and distortions of the longitudinal phase space of the electron beam. In this work we report a study of the FEL spectra recorded at FERMI for various situations showing the effects of phase-space modulation on the FEL properties."

        "The ability to fully characterize X-ray pulses from free electron-lasers will underpin their exploitation in experiments ranging from single-molecule imaging to extreme timescale X-ray science. This issue is especially acute when confronted with the characteristics of current generation FELs operating on the principle of SASE",
        "as most parameters fluctuate strongly from pulse to pulse. Here",
        "we have extended the techniques of attosecond metrology with the use of single-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses",
        "allowing for simultaneous",
        "in-line",
        "single-shot measurement of both the arrival time and temporal profile of FEL pulses on an absolute scale. The technique is non-invasive and could be incorporated in pump-probe experiments",
        "eventually leading to characterization before and after interaction with most sample environments. Optical-laser-driven THz streaking measurements",
        "revealing X-ray pulse structure shorter than 50 fs FWHM in the soft X-ray regime at FLASH and in the ~ keV range at LCLS will be discussed. With clear potential for improvement in resolution to the sub-10 fs regime",
        "this method will ultimately allow for characterization of the shortest predicted few-femtosecond FEL pulses."
