        "proposed to improve the FEL temporal coherence and to enable more compact schemes",
        "progressed significantly during this last decade. After conventionnal laser sources",
        "eventually doubled or tripled in crystal",
        "high order harmonics generated in gas were successfully used",
        "bringing FELs in the XUV range. We are now involved in the demonstration of a new scheme",
        "using fiber based tunable ultraviolet source. Its output power and tunability are of high interest. Last results obtained with the MaxPlanck Institute and the SPARC teams are presented. Seeding can lead to complex dynamics between the electron and the light pulse. Numerical studies revealed possible pulse splitting effects. We will report on their possible observation in collaboration with the FERMI team. Future FELs may also rely on emerging accelerators generated by laser wakefiled acceleration. Recently",
