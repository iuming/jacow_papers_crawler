        "We report on recent pump-probe laser source developments for SwissFEL. The demand of ultrashort laser sources in combination with few-femtosecond x-ray Free Electron Lasers is growing since such sources are a prerequisite for cutting-edge time-resolved investigations. Equally important is the precise arrival time measurement of short X-ray pulses in respect to the optical pump. To meet those requests adequate lasers need to be developed. Of particular interest is a compact",
        "laser-based THz source (λ=60 to 300 um) delivering single-cycle pulses with amplitude of up to 1.5 MV/cm and 0.5 Tesla",
        "respectively. Such strong THz pump lasers allow parasitic use for high-precision arrival time measurement between the x-ray pulse and the optical laser at the experimental station. We show that such intense THz pulses can be efficiently generated in the so-called THz gap (1-10 THz) by means of nonlinear frequency conversion in organic crystals. We furthermore present an overview on high-power single cycle pulses in the infrared wavelength rage (λ=1-20 um) and latest progress on high-power HHG-based seeding lasers at shortest wavelengths."
