Radiation from SASE FEL with planar undulator contains visible contribution of higher odd harmonics. Knowledge of spatial properties of harmonics is of great practical interest for planning user experiments. In this report we present results of the studies of spatial properties of the radiation from SASE FELs at the European XFEL.

        "we find oscillations between two entangled states - where the entanglement appears between the electron momentum state and the Fock states of the laser and wiggler field. Compared to a two-level system with one internal degree of freedom (e.g. an atom with a ground and one excited state) the state of our system is mainly determined by the momentum of the electron in the co-moving Bambini-Renieri frame. In contrast to the classical regime here the electron propagating through the wiggler field can only emit or absorb a single laser photon. Transitions including the emission or absorption of many photons are substantially much suppressed."

Most codes follow an approach to use thin electron slices",

The RF gun consisting of two independently-tunable cells (ITC RF gun) can be operated so as to optimize the phase space distribution of the extracted electrons for the further manipulation in an alpha magnet and a 3 m accelerating structure for the short pulse generation. Tracking simulations show that very short electron pulse less than 100 fs with a bunch charge of about 20 pC can be obtained by means of the velocity bunching in the accelerating structure. In the early result of the gun commissioning",
        "it was shown that the back-bombardment (B-B) effect was rather serious for the beam quality in spite of the operation with the short pulse length and slow repetition rate. The simulation study for the B-B effect with the 2D heat transfer model turned out that low energy electrons coming back in the cathode cell have the significant contribution for the additional cathode heating rather than the higher energy electrons**. We will show the recent results of beam commissioning of the ITC RF gun and the current status of t-ACTS project.",

        "The linac of the FERMI seeded free electron laser includes a laser heater to control the longitudinal microbunching instability",
        "which otherwise is expected to degrade the quality of high brightness electron beam sufficiently to reduce the FEL power. The laser heater consists of an short undulator located in a small magnetic chicane through which an external laser pulse enters to the electron beam both temporally and spatially. The resulting interaction within the undulator produces an energy modulation of the electron beam on the scale of the optical wavelength. This modulation together with the effective R52 transport term of the chicane increases the incoherent energy spread (i.e.",
        "e-beam heating). We present the first commissioning results of this system and its impact on the electron density and energy distribution and on FEL output quality."

To achieve this while still being able to freely choose pulse patterns a pulse picker to sort the wanted from the unwanted pulses can be installed at the laser output. A promising candidate for this functionality is an acousto-optic modulator which currently is being tested at PITZ. First experimental results will be presented and discussed towards the possibility of including this device into an FEL photo injector."
