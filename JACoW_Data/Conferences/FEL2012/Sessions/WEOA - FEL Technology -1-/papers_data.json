        "The linacs driving modern single-pass FELs carry electron beams of unprecedented brightness. Their average power ranges from few watts to hundreds of kilowatts. At the same time",
        "these machines are equipped with unusual amounts of instrumentation that need to be protected from beam losses. The FEL process itself depends crucially on the precision of the magnetic field inside undulator structures that are prone to demagnetization under radiation exposure. This combination makes machine protection for FELs both a necessity and a challenge. The talk gives an overview of typical hazards and of machine protection strategies adopted at FELs in various laboratories."

        "which can significantly dilute the bend-plane (horizontal) emittance. Since simple emittance measurements* do not tell the full story",
        "we would like to see the time-dependent CSR-kicks along the length of the bunch. We present measured images and simulations of the effects of CSR seen on an intercepting beam screen just downstream of the LCLS BC1 chicane while powering a skew quadrupole magnet near the center of the chicane [ ]. The skew quadrupole maps the time coordinate of the pre-BC1 bunch onto the vertical axis of the screen",
