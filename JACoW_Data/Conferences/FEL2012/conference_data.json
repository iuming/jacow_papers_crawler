            "A method to disrupt the fundamental harmonic with phase shifters installed between undulator modules (while keeping the lasing at the third harmonic undisturbed) was proposed in [*]. If phase shifters are tuned such that the phase delay is 2π/3 (or 4π/3) for the fundamental",
            "then its amplification is disrupted. At the same time the phase shift is equal to 2π for the third harmonic",
            "i.e. it continues to get amplified without being affected by phase shifters. We note that simulations in [*] were done for the case of a monochromatic seed",
            "and the results cannot be applied for a SASE FEL. The reason is that in the latter case the amplified frequencies are defined self-consistently",
            "i.e. there is frequency shift (red or blue) depending on positions and magnitudes of phase kicks. This leads to a significantly weaker suppression effect. In particular",
            "we found out that a consecutive use of phase shifters with the same phase kicks 2π/3 (as proposed in [*] is inefficient",
            "i.e. it does not lead to a sufficiently strong suppression of the fundamental wavelength. In the present report we propose a modification of phase shifters method that can work in the case of a SASE FEL.",

The laser heater consists of an short undulator located in a small magnetic chicane through which an external laser pulse enters to the electron beam both temporally and spatially. The resulting interaction within the undulator produces an energy modulation of the electron beam on the scale of the optical wavelength. This modulation together with the effective R52 transport term of the chicane increases the incoherent energy spread (i.e.",

The X-ray optics system consists of a toroidal variable-line-space (VLS) grating with a resolving power greater than 5000 for creating a nearly transform-limited seed pulse from the upstream SASE undulator for pulse durations of the order of 25 fs",

The electron chicane system which serves to delay the electron beam to match the less than 1 ps delay from the optical system is similar to the chicane used in the hard X-ray self-seeding at LCLS.

          "abstract": "The Optical Replica Synthesizer at FLASH was first commissioned in 2008 with an 800 nm seed. This wavelength proved to be problematic due to the fact that the COTR resulting from a microbunching instability at that wavelength was often as strong or stronger than the radiation from the seeded and bunched beam. It has since been observed that the microbunches which are responsible for the unwanted COTR can be smeared out in the dogleg if they are shorter than 600 nm. This opens the possibility to try the same experiment with a shorter wavelength and avoid the problems with the unwanted background signal from the microbunching instability. This is the motivation behind a new experimental design involving a new 270 nm seed laser and a new pulse length detection device to replace the old 800 nm seed and pulse length detection device. Details about the experiment design and commissioning plans will be described.",

The wavelength range of the harmonics that will be used as seed is around 100 nm and we plan to detect the coherent harmonic signal of the second harmonic generated in the radiator.

The oscillator is powered by the spent beams that leave the HGHG radiator. Radiation from the oscillator is sent to the modulator of the HGHG section. The dynamics and stability of the radiator-first scheme is explored analytically and numerically. A single-pass map is derived using a semi-analytic model for FEL gain and saturation. Iteration of the map is shown to be in good agreement with simulations. A numerical example is presented for a soft X-ray FEL in which the oscillator operates at 13.4 nm and HGHG radiation is generated at 1.34 nm. This radiator-first configuration potentially solves (i) the challenge of finding sources to seed future FELs driven by multi-MHz superconducting RF linacs and (ii) the difficulty of producing X-ray radiation with a bunch that exits an oscillator in the more \"natural\" configuration in which the oscillator precedes the radiator.",

Longitudinal wakes in the C-band linac are used to remove the chirp to deliver small bandwidth radiation. A special mode uses these wakes to increase the energy chirp to deliver a photon bandwidth an the percent level for special applications like single shot spectroscopy. In addition a fully compressed 10 pC beam is used as a source of sub femto-second pulses. An iterative semi-analytic procedure was used to setup and optimise the setup efficiently.

The ability to stabilize both the carrier and envelope phase in these systems could give higher resolution current envelope stabilized systems while continuing to deliver ultrashort pulses for use at delivery sites. We report here on a carrier phase detector to investigate the carrier-envelope phase walk-off in fibre distribution systems and how it is affected by active stabilization of the fibre. The phase monitor uses polarisation rotation associated with sub-wavelength delays in the fibre to detect changes in the carrier phase of ultrashort pulses. We present here studies of the carrier phase stability in an actively stabilized fibre link and its implications on the feasibility of stabilizing both carrier and envelope phase in pulsed synchronisation systems.",

In this case the beam goes through slits opened in two metallic foils placed at a distance shorter than the radiation formation zone. Due to the shielding effect of the first screen a nearly background-free ODR interference pattern can be measured allowing the determination of the beam size and the angular divergence. We report here the result of the first measurements of the beam emittance using ODRI carried out at FLASH (DESY). Our result demonstrate the unique potential of this technique suitable to be used as not intercepting diagnostic in every machine with high brightness and high repetition rate electron beam."

Suppression of beam current noise below the classical \"shot-noise\" level has been known in the microwave tubes art[2]. This is the first time that it is demonstrated in the optical regime. We predict that the scheme can be extended to the XUV and possibly to shorter wavelengths with further development of technology. The fundamental current shot-noise determines the level of incoherent spontaneous radiation emission from e-beam radiators and SASE-FELs. Suppressing shot-noise would make it possible to attain spontaneous emission sub-radiance[3] and surpass the shot-noise coherence limits of seed-injected FELs",

This technique relies on an oversampling phase retrieval method on a far field coherent optical transition radiation image. This method has a number of applications as an diagnostic for the FEL amplification process and in the imaging of compressed beams. We report on the experimental demonstration of this method in the case of microbunching generated by the interaction of an external laser pulse with an electron beam traversing an undulator."

This FEL radiation is used by several groups of scientists which include biologists",

The high peak and average powers are used in experiments on material ablation and biological objects modification. The second FEL is installed on the second orbit. The first lasing of this FEL was achieved in 2009. Its radiation has almost the same average and peak powers and is delivered to the same user stations as the first FEL one",

We also discuss possible options for the future upgrade."

            "An electron bunch slicing setup is presently under construction on the SOLEIL storage ring. It is aimed to deliver 100 fs long photon pulses to two undulator-based beamlines operating with soft X-rays (TEMPO) and hard X-rays (CRISTAL). SOLEIL storage ring is equipped with a Ti:Sa laser which produces 30 fs pulses at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 2.5 kHz. The laser beam is splitted into two branches in order to provide 2 mJ to the modulator and 1 mJ as pump pulse for the CRISTAL and TEMPO end stations. Focusing optics and beam path",
            "from the laser hutch to the inside of the storage ring tunnel are presently under finalization. The energy modulation will be done in a wiggler composed of 20 periods of 164 mm. It produces a magnetic field of 1.8 T at a minimum gap of 14.5 mm. The non-zero dispersion function present in all straight sections of the storage ring will enable to easily separate the sliced bunches from the core bunches at the beamlines' location. In this paper",

Taking into account the fact that the velocity spread is caused by both the energy spread and the angular divergence",

            "Frascati - Italy). It turned out that the coherence length is comparable with the beam size and only slight variations of the coherence properties have been observed after the 5th undulator section. The technique needs a very essential setup composed only by a water suspension of commercial colloidal particles and a CCD camera. The Complex Coherence Factor is retrieved from the Fourier analysis of the interference pattern generated by the stochastic superposition of the almost spherical waves scattered by the particles and the unperturbed transmitted beam (heterodyne speckles). This approach does not require the engineering of ad-hoc devices and provides a two-dimensional map of the transverse coherence without any a-priori assumption about its functional form. The method is suitable for one-shot characterization and it works in the X-ray wavelength as well. It has been previously developed and tested to be effective with synchrotron radiation [*",

This includes beam dynamics studies to optimize the injection and compression of small charge electron bunches. A reduced photo injector laser pulse duration helps to relax the RF tolerance which scales linear with the compression factor. A new photo injector laser with sub-picosecond pulse duration in combination with a stretcher is used to optimize the initial bunch length. The commissioning of the new laser system and first experiments are described. Limitations of the presently available electron beam diagnostics at FLASH for short",
            "low charge bunches are analyzed. Improvements of the longitudinal phase space diagnostics and the commissioning of a more sensitive beam arrival time monitor are described."

The shortest possible pulse is a single longitudinal optical mode of the SASE radiation. The most direct way to realize this at FLASH would be to reduce the electron bunch length to only a few μm at the entrance of the undulator section. In the ideal case a bunch charge of 20pC is sufficient for the generation of such short bunches. A shorter bunch duration directly at the photo-cathode helps to overcome technical limitations of the bunch compression due to RF induced non-linearities and collective effects. Beam dynamic studies are being performed to optimize the parameters of the photo injector laser",

The demand of ultrashort laser sources in combination with few-femtosecond x-ray Free Electron Lasers is growing since such sources are a prerequisite for cutting-edge time-resolved investigations. Equally important is the precise arrival time measurement of short X-ray pulses in respect to the optical pump. To meet those requests adequate lasers need to be developed. Of particular interest is a compact",

We show that such intense THz pulses can be efficiently generated in the so-called THz gap (1-10 THz) by means of nonlinear frequency conversion in organic crystals. We furthermore present an overview on high-power single cycle pulses in the infrared wavelength rage (λ=1-20 um) and latest progress on high-power HHG-based seeding lasers at shortest wavelengths."

Different modes of FEL operation become possible with essentially different properties of the radiation. Radiation from SASE FEL with planar undulator contains visible contribution of higher odd harmonics. Knowledge of spatial properties of harmonics is of great practical interest for planning user experiments. In this report we present results of the studies of spatial properties of the radiation from SASE FELs at the European XFEL. We consider nonlinear mechanism of harmonic generation and trace spatial properties of the odd harmonics up to deep nonlinear regime."

Using this approach the correct shot noise at all frequencies is provided and permits \"re-binning\" of the particles to the 3D radiation grid at any time. The results for self-seeding and HGHG seeding are discussed."

Photo-induced field emission (PFE) might combine the high peak currents of photo cathodes with the low emittance of field emitted electrons. Previous investigations of PFE were performed on tip cathodes and yielded a high brilliance B ≤ 1x1013 A/m2rad2 but only low currents I ≤ 2.9 A and parasitic field emission [2]. We are investigating PFE from flat cathodes in an UHV system for PFE spectroscopy with a resolution of less than 50 meV [3]. Electric fields of up to 400 MV/m can be applied",

The X-ray optics system consists of a toroidal variable-line-space (VLS) grating with a resolving power greater than 5000 for creating a nearly transform-limited seed pulse from the upstream SASE undulator for pulse durations of the order of 25 fs",

The optical system is sufficiently compact to fit within a single 3.4 m LCLS undulator segment. The electron chicane system which serves to delay the electron beam to match the less than 1 ps delay from the optical system is similar to the chicane used in the hard X-ray self-seeding at LCLS.

The reflectivity of crystal deflectors can be switched fast enough by flipping the crystals with piezo-electric devices.

      "abstract": "The Optical Replica Synthesizer at FLASH was first commissioned in 2008 with an 800 nm seed. This wavelength proved to be problematic due to the fact that the COTR resulting from a microbunching instability at that wavelength was often as strong or stronger than the radiation from the seeded and bunched beam. It has since been observed that the microbunches which are responsible for the unwanted COTR can be smeared out in the dogleg if they are shorter than 600 nm. This opens the possibility to try the same experiment with a shorter wavelength and avoid the problems with the unwanted background signal from the microbunching instability. This is the motivation behind a new experimental design involving a new 270 nm seed laser and a new pulse length detection device to replace the old 800 nm seed and pulse length detection device. Details about the experiment design and commissioning plans will be described.",

In order to minimize the losses the transport of the drive laser is done with a minimal number of mirrors and there are neither focusing nor filtering elements between the harmonic chamber and the first undulator. This will be the first experiment that will imprint energy modulation to the electron beam by harmonics generated in gas. The wavelength range of the harmonics that will be used as seed is around 100 nm and we plan to detect the coherent harmonic signal of the second harmonic generated in the radiator. The flexibility of the set-up will allow to drive the HG process with the fundamental wavelength or the second harmonic or the combination of them.

In this scheme longitudinally coherent FEL pulses are obtained using a high gain harmonic generation (HGHG) system in which the seed power is generated in an FEL oscillator downstream of the HGHG section. The oscillator is powered by the spent beams that leave the HGHG radiator. Radiation from the oscillator is sent to the modulator of the HGHG section. The dynamics and stability of the radiator-first scheme is explored analytically and numerically. A single-pass map is derived using a semi-analytic model for FEL gain and saturation. Iteration of the map is shown to be in good agreement with simulations. A numerical example is presented for a soft X-ray FEL in which the oscillator operates at 13.4 nm and HGHG radiation is generated at 1.34 nm. This radiator-first configuration potentially solves (i) the challenge of finding sources to seed future FELs driven by multi-MHz superconducting RF linacs and (ii) the difficulty of producing X-ray radiation with a bunch that exits an oscillator in the more \"natural\" configuration in which the oscillator precedes the radiator.",

Longitudinal wakes in the C-band linac are used to remove the chirp to deliver small bandwidth radiation. A special mode uses these wakes to increase the energy chirp to deliver a photon bandwidth an the percent level for special applications like single shot spectroscopy. In addition a fully compressed 10 pC beam is used as a source of sub femto-second pulses. An iterative semi-analytic procedure was used to setup and optimise the setup efficiently.

The system is based on a MLL fibre stabilization scheme* which delivers the clock signal with ultrashort optical pulses over an actively stabilized optical fibre. While these schemes stabilize the pulse transit time through fibre",
        "they do not necessarily control the optical carrier. The ability to stabilize both the carrier and envelope phase in these systems could give higher resolution current envelope stabilized systems while continuing to deliver ultrashort pulses for use at delivery sites. We report here on a carrier phase detector to investigate the carrier-envelope phase walk-off in fibre distribution systems and how it is affected by active stabilization of the fibre. The phase monitor uses polarisation rotation associated with sub-wavelength delays in the fibre to detect changes in the carrier phase of ultrashort pulses. We present here studies of the carrier phase stability in an actively stabilized fibre link and its implications on the feasibility of stabilizing both carrier and envelope phase in pulsed synchronisation systems.",

        "mainly due to the synchrotron radiation background. This problem can be overcome by using ODRI (ODR Interference). In this case the beam goes through slits opened in two metallic foils placed at a distance shorter than the radiation formation zone. Due to the shielding effect of the first screen a nearly background-free ODR interference pattern can be measured allowing the determination of the beam size and the angular divergence. We report here the result of the first measurements of the beam emittance using ODRI carried out at FLASH (DESY). Our result demonstrate the unique potential of this technique suitable to be used as not intercepting diagnostic in every machine with high brightness and high repetition rate electron beam."

Suppression of beam current noise below the classical \"shot-noise\" level has been known in the microwave tubes art[2]. This is the first time that it is demonstrated in the optical regime. We predict that the scheme can be extended to the XUV and possibly to shorter wavelengths with further development of technology. The fundamental current shot-noise determines the level of incoherent spontaneous radiation emission from e-beam radiators and SASE-FELs. Suppressing shot-noise would make it possible to attain spontaneous emission sub-radiance[3] and surpass the shot-noise coherence limits of seed-injected FELs",

It is aimed to deliver 100 fs long photon pulses to two undulator-based beamlines operating with soft X-rays (TEMPO) and hard X-rays (CRISTAL). SOLEIL storage ring is equipped with a Ti:Sa laser which produces 30 fs pulses at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 2.5 kHz. The laser beam is splitted into two branches in order to provide 2 mJ to the modulator and 1 mJ as pump pulse for the CRISTAL and TEMPO end stations. Focusing optics and beam path",

It produces a magnetic field of 1.8 T at a minimum gap of 14.5 mm. The non-zero dispersion function present in all straight sections of the storage ring will enable to easily separate the sliced bunches from the core bunches at the beamlines' location.

Taking into account the fact that the velocity spread is caused by both the energy spread and the angular divergence",

Since SASE pulses have a poor longitudinal coherence a lot of research is ongoing to overcome the statistical fluctuations of the SASE pulses.

        "Frascati - Italy). It turned out that the coherence length is comparable with the beam size and only slight variations of the coherence properties have been observed after the 5th undulator section. The technique needs a very essential setup composed only by a water suspension of commercial colloidal particles and a CCD camera. The Complex Coherence Factor is retrieved from the Fourier analysis of the interference pattern generated by the stochastic superposition of the almost spherical waves scattered by the particles and the unperturbed transmitted beam (heterodyne speckles). This approach does not require the engineering of ad-hoc devices and provides a two-dimensional map of the transverse coherence without any a-priori assumption about its functional form. The method is suitable for one-shot characterization and it works in the X-ray wavelength as well. It has been previously developed and tested to be effective with synchrotron radiation [*",

The system works as an online tool providing HDR images at 4 Hz. An optically polished YAG:Ce crystal with the thickness of 100 um was used for the measurements. When tested with a laser beam images with the DR of about 10+5 were obtained. With the electron beam the DR was somewhat smaller due to the limitations in the time structure of the tune-up beam macro pulse."

Equally important is the precise arrival time measurement of short X-ray pulses in respect to the optical pump. To meet those requests adequate lasers need to be developed. Of particular interest is a compact",

We show that such intense THz pulses can be efficiently generated in the so-called THz gap (1-10 THz) by means of nonlinear frequency conversion in organic crystals. We furthermore present an overview on high-power single cycle pulses in the infrared wavelength rage (λ=1-20 um) and latest progress on high-power HHG-based seeding lasers at shortest wavelengths."
