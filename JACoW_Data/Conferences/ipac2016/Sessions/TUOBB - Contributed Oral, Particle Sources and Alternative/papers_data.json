        "Emittance exchange (EEX) based longitudinal current profile shaping is the one of the promising current profile shaping technique. This method can generate high quality arbitrary current profiles under the ideal conditions. The double dog-leg EEX beam line was recently installed at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) to explore the shaping capability and confirm the quality of this method. To demonstrate the arbitrary current profile generation",
        "several different transverse masks are applied to generate different final current profiles. The phase space slopes and the charge of incoming beam are varied to observe and suppress the aberrations on the ideal profile. We present current profile shaping results",
        "aberrations on the shaped profile",
        "and its suppression."

FACET-II is a new test facility to provide DOE with the unique capability to develop advanced acceleration and coherent radiation techniques with high-energy electron and positron beams. FACET-II is an opportunity to build on the decades-long experience developed conducting advanced accelerator R&D at the FFTB and FACET and re-deploy HEP infrastructure in continued service of its mission. FACET-II provides a major upgrade over current FACET capabilities and the breadth of the potential research program makes it truly unique. It will synergistically pursue accelerator science that is vital to the future of both advanced acceleration techniques for High Energy Physics",
