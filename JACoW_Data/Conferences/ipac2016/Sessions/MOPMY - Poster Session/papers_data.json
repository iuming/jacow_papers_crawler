        "An ultra-fast kicker system consist of four quarter wavelength resonator based deflecting cavities was developed that simultaneously resonates at 10 subharmonic modes of the 476.3MHz bunch repetition frequency",
        "thus every 10th bunch in the bunch train will experience a transverse kick while all the other bunches are undisturbed. This fast kicker is developed for the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) based electron Circular Cooler Ring (CCR) in the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC",
        "previously MEIC). The electron bunches can be reused 10-30 turns thus the beam current in the ERL can be reduced to 1/10 - 1/30 (150mA - 50mA) of the cooling bunch current (1.5A). In this paper",
        "several methods to synthesis such a kicker waveform will be discussed with the comparison of beam dynamics tracking in Elegant."

        "350) MHz to X-band (11.424 GHz). Output powers are from several tens of kW to ~1 MW for CW klystrons and ~100 MW for pulsed ones. The narrow-bandwidth requirement has enabled them to provide high gain (typically 40 - 50 dB) which greatly simplifies the RF drive system. Recently",

        "The vacuum-tube-based RF amplifiers are relatively inefficient and becoming obsolete as the RF world has been progressively converting to solid state technology. Currently",
        "the JLAB upgrade program requires 340 amplifiers capable of 8 kW CW at 1497 MHz while operating at more than 55-60% efficiency to replace their klystrons. Here we explore the possibility of a klystron replacement employing high electron mobility packaged GaN transistors applied in an array of Class-F amplifiers. The inputs and outputs of the many modules needed to make a complete amplifier are connected via precise",

        "combiners-dividers. We describe early prototypes of the amplifiers as well as the combiners-dividers and discuss the design features and challenges of such a scheme. This approach can be applied to other national facilities and also for replacement of the klystrons in Middle Energy Electron-Ion Collider which requires about 1.8 MW CW power in total to be produced at 952.6 MHz frequency including 2x12.5 kW power for \"crabbing\" and 0.53 MW for electron cooling."
