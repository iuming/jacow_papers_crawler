        "the transverse beam size diagnostics based on synchrotron radiation was upgraded in order to cope with the increase of the LHC beam energy to 6.5 TeV. The wavelength used for imaging was shifted to near ultra-violet to reduce the contribution of diffraction to the system resolution",
        "while in parallel",
        "a new diagnostic system based on double slit interferometry was installed to measure the beam size by studying the spatial coherence of the emitted synchrotron radiation. This method has never been implemented before in a proton machine. A Hartmann mask was also installed to identify possible wavefront distortions that could affect the system accuracy. This paper will focus on the comparison of visible and the near ultra-violet imaging and on the first experience with interferometry."

To minimize stress on accelerator components in the injection regions of the LHC and to guarantee an efficient operation these losses needed to be understood and possible mitigation techniques should be studied. Measurements with diamond particle detectors revealed the loss structure with ns-resolution for the first time. Based on these measurements",

Methods to reduce the recaptured beam in the SPS were successfully tested and verified with the diamond particle detectors.

        "beam orbit response can be precisely measured while driving the electron beam with AC current. Compared to the normal DC orbit response measurement",
        "this method eliminates the measurement errors due to orbit drift. Accurately measured orbit response matrix can be used to characterize the machine lattice. Fast corrector frequency responses have been measured using the same method",
        "by scanning the excitation frequency. This information can be used to optimize the fast orbit feedback control loop."
