        "The aim of the new muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab is to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with an unprecedented uncertainty of 140 ppb. A beam of positive muons required for the experiment is created by pion decay. Detailed studies of the beam dynamics and spin polarization of the muons are important to predict systematic uncertainties in the experiment. In this paper",
        "we present the results of beam simulations and spin tracking from the pion production target to the muon storage ring. The end-to-end beam simulations are developed in Bmad and include the processes of particle decay",

The baseline collimation layout is based on the scaling of the present LHC collimation system to the FCC-hh energy. It currently includes a dedicated betatron cleaning insertion as well as collimators in the experimental insertions to protect the inner triplets. An aperture model for the FCC-hh is defined and the geometrical acceptance is calculated at top energy taking into account mechanical and optics imperfections. Based on these studies the collimator settings needed to protect the machine are defined. The performance of the collimation system is then assessed with particle tracking simulation tools assuming a perfect machine. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

        "but never installed. Later the second harmonic RF system was proposed to cure longitudinal beam instabilities in the absence of a dedicated wideband feedback system in the LHC. For nominal intensities the longitudinal beam stability is ensured by controlled emittance blow-up during the acceleration ramp. Recently slow growing instabilities were observed at the end of long fills at 6.5 TeV as bunches shrink due to synchrotron radiation damping. For High Luminosity LHC twice higher intensities should be kept stable with new equipment installed in the ring. Additional motivations for a second RF system in the LHC have also been considered. Operation with an extra RF system is limited by the required RF configuration (phase between the two RF systems) and longitudinal beam stability. In this work requirements for the double RF systems are analyzed together with a possible range of longitudinal beam parameters."

A very low beta function at the Interaction Point (IP) is needed to achieve the required luminosity. One consequence of the low beta optics is that the beta function in the final focusing (FF) quadrupoles is extremely high. This leads to a large beam size in these magnets as well as strong sensitivity to errors which limits the dynamic aperture. These effects are stronger at injection energy where the beam size is maximum",
        "and therefore very large aperture FF magnets are required to allow a large dynamic aperture. A standard solution is a relaxed injection optics with IP beta function large enough to provide a reasonable FF aperture. This also reduces the effects of FF errors resulting in a larger dynamic aperture at injection. We describe the ion ring injection optics design as well as a beta-squeeze transition from the injection to collision optics."

A new electron cooling process simulation program has been developed to fulfill the requirements of the JLEIC electron cooler design. The new program allows the users to calculate the electron cooling rate and simulate the cooling process with either DC or bunched electron beam to cool either coasting or bunched ion beam. It has been benchmarked with BETACOOL in aspect of accuracy and efficiency. In typical electron cooling process of JLEIC",

Being adaptive to the modern multicore hardware makes it possible to further enhance the efficiency for computationally intensive problems. The new program is being actively used in the electron cooling study and cooler design for JLEIC. We will present our models and some simulation results in this paper."

One of the main effects of the solenoid field is coupling of the horizontal and vertical betatron motions which must be corrected in order to preserve the dynamical stability and beam spot size match at the IP. Additional effects include influence on the orbit and dispersion caused by the angle between the solenoid axis and the beam orbit. Meanwhile it affects ion polarization breaking the figure-8 spin symmetry. Crab dynamics further complicates the picture. All of these effects have to be compensated or accounted for. The proposed correction system is equivalent to the Rotating Frame Method. However",

A high-current storage-ring electron cooler offers a solution to both of these problems by maintaining high cooling beam quality through naturally-occurring synchrotron radiation damping of the electron beam. However",

This paper reports a development of a storage ring based cooler consisting of two sections with significantly different energies: the cooling and damping sections. The electron energy and other parameters in the cooling section are adjusted for optimum cooling of a stored ion beam. The beam parameters in the damping section are adjusted for optimum damping of the electron beam. The necessary energy difference is provided by an energy recovering SRF structure. A prototype linear optics of such storage-ring cooler is presented."

        "The initial design of a low higher order modes (HOM) impedance superconducting RF (SRF) cavity is presented in this paper. The design of this SRF cavity is for the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC). The electron ring of JLEIC will operate with electrons of 3 to 10 GeV energy. The ion ring of JLEIC will operate with protons of up to 100 GeV energy. The bunch lengths in both rings are ~12 mm (RMS). In order to maintain the short bunch length in the ion ring",
        "SRF cavities are adopted to provide large enough gradient. In the first phase of JLEIC",
        "the PEP II RF cavities will be reused in the electron ring to lower the initial cost. The frequency of the SRF cavities is chosen to be the second harmonic of PEP II cavities",

        "the same frequency SRF cavities may replace the normal conducting PEP II cavities to achieve higher luminosity at high energy. At low energies",

      "abstract": "High current Superconducting Radiofrequency (SRF) 5-cell cavities are essential for the proposed ERL-based electron-ion collider eRHIC in BNL. The HOM power generated when a single bunch traverses the cavity is estimated by the corresponding loss factor. Multiple re-circulations through the ERL create a specific bunch pattern. In this case the loss factor can be different than the single bunch loss factor. The HOM power generation can be surveyed in the time and frequency domains. We estimate the average HOM power in the eRHIC 5-cell cavity with different ERL bunch patterns using both methods. We also discuss possible solutions to reduce this HOM power. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

      "abstract": "eRHIC project is a future electron-hadron collider proposed at BNL. The proposed electron accelerator will generate up to 20 GeV polarized electrons which will collide with proton beams with energy up to 250 GeV. The proposed collider will deliver electron-nucleon luminosity of 1033- 1034 cm-2 ses−1. A superconducting RF (SRF) 5-cell elliptical cavity will be utilized in electron accelerator. This paper presents a study of higher-order modes (HOM) for this 647 MHz SRF cavity. Different types of HOM modes and their BBU instabilities were investigated for frequencies up to 3.2 GHz. Threshold current values of beam breakup are estimated by GBBU code. Further improvement on this threshold current has been explored and discussed. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",
