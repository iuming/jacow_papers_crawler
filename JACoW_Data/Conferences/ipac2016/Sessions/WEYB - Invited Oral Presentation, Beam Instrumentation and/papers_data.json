        "The Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) started an x-ray free electron laser project (PAL-XFEL) in 2011. The construction was finished at the end of 2015 and the commissioning is planned from the beginning of 2016. In the PAL-XFEL",
        "an electron beam with 200 pC will be generated from a photocathode RF gun and will be accelerated to 10 GeV by using a linear accelerator. The electron beam will pass through undulator section to produce hard X-ray radiation. For the successful commissioning and beam operation",
        "various kinds of instruments were prepared."
