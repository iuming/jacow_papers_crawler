        "The lepton collider version of the FCC study describes a future electron-positron collider with a circumference in the order of 100 km",
        "optimised for operation with collision energies in the range of 90 GeV to 350 GeV (FCC- ee). This paper presents the layout of the machine and the constraints on the design of the arc lattice in the context of the four different beam energies that are foreseen for beam operation. Special emphasis is put on the compensation of the effect of the strong synchrotron radiation losses. The beam orbit as well as the optics have to be re-optimised for a given operation energy in order to achieve the foreseen emittance of ε = 1 nm in the horizontal and 1 pm in the vertical plane. Counter measures of the so-called saw-tooth effect of the design orbit are needed as well as a compensation of the energy loss on the beam optics. The paper summarizes different scenarios of how to achieve this goal as well as the need for additional emittance fine tuning using wiggler magnets."

Another CR by the experiments asked for a vertical shaft access to the interaction hall that required a relocation of the whole accelerator. The change process made sure that the stakeholders were part of the review and decision process from the beginning and contributed to a design change acceptable to all parties involved. The poster will present the change management process and give examples of change requests that have already been processed."

At the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) at CERN the feasibility of this principle is being tested in terms of performance and achievable specifications. The high-current drive beam is generated by recombining its parts in a delay loop and a combiner ring. Preserving the drive beam emittance during the recombination process is crucial to ensure beam-current and power production stability. Present theoretical and experimental studies show that non-linear energy dependence of the transverse optics heavily spoils the quality of the recombined beam. Conventionally these effects are cured by means of non-linear corrections using sextupoles. In this work we propose a mitigation of these effects by optimising the linear lattice",

      "abstract": "The R&D of the baseline positron source target for ILC is still ongoing after TDR due to the uncertainty of rotating vacuum seal and water cooling system of the fast spinning target wheel. Different institutes around the globe have proposed different approaches to tackle this issue. A spinning target wheel system with sliding contact cooling has been proposed by ANL. The proposed system eliminated the needs of rotating vacuum seal by using magnetic torque coupler to drive the solid spinning wheel target. The energy deposited from positron production process is taken away via cooling pads sliding against the spinning wheel. A full size test wheel has been built and some initial tests have been done with promising outcomes. Results of these tests are presented in this paper along with a plan for developing a prototype. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

A charged beam with a offset from a center of a cavity is affected by the wakefield depending on the offset size in the acceleration cavity and the beam emittance is increased. This emittance blow-up can be eliminated by appropriate steering magnet control so as to cancel the wake effect in the acceleration cavity. We perform particle tracking simulation with some misalignments and beam jitter. Emittance growth by the misalignments and the beam jitter is evaluated in this report."

        "A 100 TeV center-of-mass energy frontier proton collider in a new tunnel of ~100 km circumference is a central part of CERN's Future Circular Colliders (FCC) design study. One of the major challenges for such a machine will be the beam injection and extraction. This paper outlines the recent developments on the injection and extraction kicker system concepts. For injection the system requirements and progress on a new inductive adder design will be presented together with first considerations on the injection kicker magnets. The extraction kicker system comprises the extraction kickers itself as well as the beam dilution kickers",
        "both of which will be part of the FCC beam dump system and will have to reliably abort proton beams with stored energies in the range of 8 Gigajoule. First concepts for the beam dump kicker magnet and generator as well as for the dilution kicker system are described and its feasibility for an abort gap in the 1 μs range is discussed. The potential implications on the overall machine and other key subsystems are outlined",

        "The LHC High-luminosity project requests high brightness and intensity beams from the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS). The generation of such beams is limited due to resonance effects at injection. The impact of resonances can be minimized by performing appropriate correction with dedicated magnets and by optimizing the tune working point. Currently the tune working point at injection is naturally set by the quadrupolar component generated by the one hundred combined function normal conducting magnets installed in the PS",
        "and slightly corrected by low energy quadrupole magnets. In this paper",
        "a study is presented exploiting the use of the available five auxiliary individually powered circuits to adjust the quadrupolar and higher-order multipole components for changing the tune integer at injection. Due to the non-linear contribution of each circuit to the magnetic field distribution a finite-element magnetic model was prepared to predict the required currents in the auxiliary coils. The magnetic model was benchmarked with magnetic measurements and then tested in the PS machine during dedicated machine development times."

In case of an asynchronous beam dump at 6.5 - 7 TeV a non-negligible fraction of the stored energy (360 MJ during nominal operation) will be deposited on the protection elements (TCDQ and TCDS) located downstream of the extraction kickers. These elements are designed to protect the machine aperture from the large amplitude particles resulting from the asynchronous dump. A number of checks and measurements with beam have been worked out to verify the integrity of these elements",

The precision of the beam-based technique allowed the necessary adjustments to the LBDS trigger delays to ensure the synchronous firing of the LBDS at all beam energies up to 6.5 TeV. In this paper the measurement and simulation campaign is described and the performance of the system reported."
