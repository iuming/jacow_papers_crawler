        "describes the technical solutions that have been found for meeting the design goals (including the use of permanent magnet dipoles)",
        "outlines the main challenges that will be faced in commissioning and operating the new lattice in a very demanding parameter regime",
        "and discusses how it is hoped to maximize eventual benefits for users while minimizing disruption during the upgrade process."
