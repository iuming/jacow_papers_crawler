        "The SLRI Beam Test Facility (SLRI BTF) is a part of the future upgrades of the SLRI accelerator complex. Upon completion",
        "SLRI BTF will be able to produce electron test beams with the number of electrons ranging from a few to several thousand electrons per bunch. The project is divided into three stages based on the complexity of the electron reduction setups. The simple setup for the initial stage has been implemented without any modifications to the current high-energy beam transport line (HBT) while additional elements together with an existing 4-degree dipole are required for the short-term setup in the second stage. For the last stage",
        "a new dedicated transfer line equipped with a high-resolution energy selector will be constructed to direct the electron beam from the HBT beam line to an experimental station. This project aims to provide a defined number of electrons with maximum energy of 1 GeV for calibration and testing of high energy detectors as well as other beam diagnostic instrumentations."

In 2015 a first set of experiments was conducted utilizing as key elements a novel cross-shaped lithium plasma cell and an ArF excimer laser for plasma generation. No self-modulation was observed yet because of various experimental shortcomings. The properties of the experimental setup were studied in detail and in this contribution we report about the upgrades which are projected to enable the observation of the self-modulation in the upcoming experimental run."

      "abstract": "Laser-driven wakefield acceleration (LWFA) has received much attention as it can produce GeV-level high-energy electrons in cm-scale distance*. However, the accelerated electron energies are still limited by several factors, especially by the dephasing problem that is caused by different velocities between the plasma wake wave and the accelerated electron beam. In order to increase the acceleration length restricted by the dephasing problem**, we developed a gas-cell with density-tapering, which is realized by applying different gas pressures into two gas inlets in the gas cell. In this way, the gas density and gradient can be easily controlled in the gas cell. We used the density-tapered gas-cell for laser wakefield acceleration experiments in our laboratory with a 20 TW/40 fs Ti:sapphire laser system***. The results show that the electron energy can be significantly enhanced (about twice) with the tapered density gas-cell, compared with a uniform density conventional gas-cell. In this presentation, we show the experimental results and comparison with two-dimensional (2-D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation results. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

Glass was preferred to sapphire or quartz options to ease the machining. Electrodes will be attached to the tube using a sealant resistant to high vacuum conditions and baking at high temperatures. Each electrode will be isolated from the neighbouring one using nuts or washers from a thermoplastic polymer insulator material to prevent unwanted sparking outside of the tube. In this paper",
        "general design considerations and possible working points of this plasma source are presented for a range of plasma densities from 1×1020 to 1×1022 m&#8722;3. Consideration was also given to plasma density diagnostic techniques due to critical dependence of accelerating gradient on plasma density."

The 2.45 GHz ECR injector developed by CEA-Saclay is designed to deliver 140 mA/100 keV CW D+ beam with 99% gas fraction ratio. Its LEBT presents a dual solenoid focusing system to transport and match the beam into the RFQ. Its commissioning continues in 2016 in parallel with the RFQ installation.

The RF characteristics of a pillbox-type 2.6-cell C-band RF cavity at 20 K were in agreement with the theoretical predictions. The result of the cold test for a cavity with the input coupler confirmed the same characteristics. Based on these results a refined cold model of the 20-K cryocooled photocathode RF gun has been designed using SUPERFISH and CST-STUDIO. The separation between the TM01 pi and the TM01 half-pi modes has been increased from 20 MHz to 52 MHz by extending the diameter of the cavity iris and reducing the disk thickness. The 2.6-cell structure has been modified from pillbox to ellipsoid-like type. The end-plate of the 0.6-cell cavity has a center hole for bead-pull measurements of the on-axis electric filed through the entire structure. Mounting of a photocathode assembly in the end-plate has not been considered",
        "since the purpose is solely to measure the low-power and low-temperature RF characteristics. A new design for the input coupler has been employed. The cavity will be completed early in 2016."

In the previous design",
        "the circular waveguide in the mode converter formed part of the accelerating cavity. After the cold test of the cavity completed in 2014",

        "the insertion loss in the converter is 0.2 %. The TM010 and TM011 modes excited in the circular waveguide were separated by several ten MHz from the accelerating frequency. The simulation has suggested that the amplitude of the transverse electric filed on the axis in the circular waveguide is reduced to approximately 2 % of that in the longitudinal direction."
