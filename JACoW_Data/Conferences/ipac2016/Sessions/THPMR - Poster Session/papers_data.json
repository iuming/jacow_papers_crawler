The previously defined one dimensional core-halo limit [1][2] was extended to two dimensional distributions [3][4]. This halo characterization method is applied to a classical case of transport for halo formation studies: the transport of a mismatched beam. Our method provides a core-halo limit that matches the expected halo formation mechanism with a very good precision.",

The MOGA genetic algorithm is used to optimize the lifetime and injection efficiency in this case. We used local mirror chromatic sextupole and other chromatic sextupole family for chromaticity correction in which case the genetic algorithm found solution that restores lifetime and injection efficiency. In this paper the results of MOGA simulations using various schemes for chromaticity correction and test results in presently operational optics will be discussed."
