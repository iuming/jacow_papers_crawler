The design of the magnets is finished and prototypes of innovative magnets have been built. The procurement of the magnets has started. Call for Tenders have been sent to a pre-qualified short list of magnet manufacturers. The longitudinal gradient dipoles will be assembled and measured in house. The design of the magnets",

Beams for all modes of operation are injected through one transfer channel. Extremely high acceptance of the ring (240 mm*mrad) leads to large apertures of all magnetic elements including the septum magnet. Meanwhile planned parameters of the magnetic field and magnetic field quality are comparatively strict. The present state of the design of the pulsed injection septum for the CR is presented in this article together with the concept of the injection system."

As part of a Phase I project we have studied a portable microtron that can accelerate electrons with energies of 6 MeV and above as a source for gamma and neutron production. The mass of the magnet is a significant contribution to the overall mass of the system. This paper will discuss conceptual designs for both permanent magnet and electromagnet systems. The choice of mictrotron RF frequency range is determined by the application requirements. The RF frequency influences the size of the microtron magnet and consequently its weight.

        "A helium phase separator with a condenser is under fabrication and assembled at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC). The objective of a helium phase separator with its condenser is to separate two-phase helium flow and to re-condense vaporized gaseous helium with a cryocooler of Gifford-McMahon type. We developed a 100 litre (ltr) helium phase separator with a small heat loss as a prototype. The experimental results for the total cooling capacity of the phase separator are 0.73 W at 1.67 bara",
        "which includes the effect of thermal conduction and thermal radiation from the environment. The helium liquefaction rate is 2 ltr/day with a 100 ltr vessel. The mechanism of heat transfer in phase separator was investigated and discussed. This paper presents the experiment of helium liquefaction process of 100 ltr separator with condenser",
        "which was a key component of the helium phase separator."
