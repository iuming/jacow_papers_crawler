Luminosity can therefore be used to quantify the impact of beam-beam interactions on the beam lifetimes and emittances. The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project aims to reach higher luminosities",

Higher luminosities are achieved by increasing the bunch populations and reducing the transverse beam sizes. This results in stronger beam-beam effects.

The analysis and results are discussed with possible application to the HL-LHC upgrade."

        "A good knowledge of the available aperture in the LHC is essential for a safe operation due to the risk of magnet quenches or even damage in case of uncontrolled beam losses. Experimental validations of the available aperture are therefore crucial and were in the past carried out by either a collimator scan combined with beam excitations or through the use of local orbit bumps. In this paper",
        "we show a first comparison of these methods in the same machine configuration",
        "as well as a new very fast method based on a beam-based collimator alignment and a new faster variant of the collimator scan method. The methods are applied to the LHC operational configuration for 2015 at injection and with squeezed beams and the measured apertures are presented."

The code is used for the tracking of beam halo particles and the simulation of their interaction with the collimators to study the efficiency of the LHC collimation system. Tracking simulations for heavy-ion beams require taking into account the mass to charge ratio of each particle because heavy ions can be subject to fragmentation at their passage through the collimators. In this paper we present the derivation of a Hamiltonian for multi-isotopic heavy-ion beams and symplectic tracking maps derived from it. The resulting tracking maps were implemented in the tracking software SixTrack. With this modification",

      "abstract": "In late 2015 the LHC collided lead nuclei at a beam energy of 6.37 Z TeV, chosen to match the 5.02 TeV per colliding nucleon pair of the p-Pb collision run in 2013. In so doing, it surpassed its design luminosity by a factor of 2. Besides the higher energy, the operational configuration had a number of new features with respect to the previous Pb-Pb run at 3.5 Z TeV in 2011; unusual bunch patterns providing collisions in the LHCb experiment for the first time, luminosity levelling and sharing requirements, a vertical displacement of the interaction point in the ALICE experiment, and operation closer to magnet quench limits with mitigation measures. We present a summary of the commissioning and operation and what has been learned in view of future heavy-ion operation at higher luminosity. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

This results in tune and chromaticity variations for the beams. In the first few seconds of the ramp the original hysteresis state of the magnetic field is restored - the field snaps back. These fast dynamic field changes lead to strong tune and chromaticity excursions that",

A feed-forward system applies predicted corrections during the injection plateau and to the first part of the ramp to avoid violent changes of beam conditions. This paper discusses the snapback of tune and chromaticity as observed in 2015",

In order to do so it extracts the current optics in the machine along with other crucial parameters. It also provides the functionality to match the measured orbit using virtual correctors and the measured beta functions using virtual quadrupoles. In this way an accurate effective model can be created. In order to facilitate the use of the online model a graphical user interface has been developed. In this article we describe the design of the online model and its application in different studies.

        "Electron lenses were used for head-on beam-beam compensation for the first time in the 2015 Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) 100~GeV polarized proton run. Lattices with the achromatic telescopic squeeze (ATS) scheme of β* are adopted to improve the off-momentum dynamic aperture. The phase advances between the electron lenses to one of the two collisional points are set to kπ to minimize the beam-beam resonance driving terms. In this article",
        "we present the results from weak-strong and strong-strong beam-beam simulations with head-on beam-beam compensations for these lattices. Simulations are also carried out aiming to explain the observations from operation."
