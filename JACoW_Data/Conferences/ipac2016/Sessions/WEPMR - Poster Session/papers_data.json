These devices will be tested at Fermilab's Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) within the Cryomodule Test Stand (CMTS-1) cave. The problem of magnetic pollution became one of major issues during design stage of the LCLS-II cryomodule as the average quality factor of the accelerating cavities is specified to be 2.7 x 1010. One of the possible ways to mitigate the effect of stray magnetic fields and to keep it below the goal of 5 mGauss involves the application of low permeable materials. Initial permeability and magnetic measurement studies regarding the use of 316L stainless steel material indicated that cold work (machining) and heat affected zones from welding would be acceptable."

        "Surface imperfections significantly limit the performance of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. The development of surface topography techniques aims to locate the surface flaws in an SRF cavity and profile their geometry details. This effort plays an important role of quality control in cavity productions as well as provides contour information of the defects for understanding quench mechanisms. The surface topography techniques at Cornell University include an optical inspection system and surface replica technique. In this paper",
        "we present the details of the techniques and show features found in the SRF cavities at Cornell."

This high Q has been shown to be a result of lowering of the temperature dependent BCS resistance. Here we show that this lowering of the BCS resistance is due to interstitial nitrogen in the niobium lowering the mean free path. The BCS resistance extracted from experimental data is shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions from BCS theory; that there is an optimal doping of which the mean free path is lowered to about half the intrinsic coherence length. These results provide insight into understanding the mechanisms behind nitrogen-doping and allow us to more accurately predict doping parameters to reach optimal cavity performance. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",
