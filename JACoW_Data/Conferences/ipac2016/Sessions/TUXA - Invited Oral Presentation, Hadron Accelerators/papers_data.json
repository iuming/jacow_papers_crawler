        "The linac energy reached to 400 MeV as a design value and also a beam current was upgraded to 50 mA by replacing a new ion source. At the 3 GeV synchrotron",
        "a high power beam of 8.41x1013 protons per pulse was demonstrated",
        "which was equivalent to 1 MW when the repetition would be 25 Hz. At the main ring",
        "beam loss was reduced by suppression of transverse instabilities and so on. The beam power for both the neutrino experiment and hadron experimental facility is increasing to reduce beam loss. J-PARC accelerators each have their own upgrade plan to increase beam power. The progress and future plan of J-PARC accelerators are reported in this paper."
