        "Many current and future synchrotron light sources employ harmonic cavities to lengthen the electron bunches in order to reduce the emittance dilution caused by intrabeam scattering. In some cases",
        "the harmonic cavities may be tuned to fulfill the flat potential condition. For this condition",
        "a large increase in the threshold currents of transverse coupled-bunch instabilities has been predicted and recently",
        "the physical content behind this stabilization has been better understood. With this in mind",
        "an investigation is made into the effectiveness of harmonic cavities for different machines. Frequency domain computations employing Laclare's eigenvalue method have been used to investigate the influence of several machine parameters and the results are presented."
