        "The Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free electron Laser (PAL-XFEL) project aims at the generation of X-ray FEL radiation for photon users. The machine consists of a 10 GeV normal-conducting S-band linear accelerator (linac) and two undulator beamlines initially. The hard X-ray beamline will provide FEL radiation between 0.6 and 0.1 nm or shorter. The soft X-ray line will provide FEL radiation between 4.5 and 1 nm. The linac and hard X-ray beamline construction was complete by the end of 2015. The installation of the soft X-ray line is ongoing. High power RF conditioning of the linac started in late autumn 2015. Beam commissioning of the linac started in April 2016. We report the beam commissioning status."
