        "The technical evolution of AMS is summarized. AMS is the most sensitive isotope selective detection method for long-lived radionuclides",
        "capable of measuring isotopic ratios as low as 1:1016. At present",
        "C-14 is still the most important AMS nuclide but there are many applications of other nuclides such as Be-10",

        "Cl-36",
        "Ca-41",
        "I-129",
        "and actinides. A key characteristic of any AMS system is the destruction of molecular interferences and subsequent analyses of atomic ions. In early instruments",
        "highly charged ions (> 3+ ) were used",
        "and fairly high ion energies",
        "and as a consequence",
        "large accelerators were required. Today",
        "1+ is used",
        "molecular interferences are destroyed in multiple collisions with gas atoms or molecules at energies of a few hundred keV. Thus",
        "C-14 AMS instruments develop towards lab size or tabletop devices. But",
        "low energy AMS is not limited to radiocarbon only and there is a great potential for radionuclides not interfered by nuclear isobars. These developments have launched the wide spread use of AMS in various research fields and has resulted in a boom of new AMS facilities which impact the wide variety of applications of AMS in modern research."
