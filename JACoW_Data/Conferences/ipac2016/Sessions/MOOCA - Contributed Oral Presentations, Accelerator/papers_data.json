        "installed and tested a super-compact X-Band SLED system at SLAC. It is composed of an elegant mode converter/polarizer and a single sphere energy store cavity with high Q of 94000 and diameter less than 12 cm. The available RF peak power of 50 MW can be compressed to peak average power of more than 200 MW in order to double the kick for the electron bunches in a RF transverse deflector system and greatly improve the measurement resolution for both the electron bunch and the x-ray FEL pulse. High power operation has demonstrated the excellent performance of this RF compression system without any problems in RF breakdown",
        "pulse heating and radiation. The design physics and fabrication as well as the measurement results will be presented in detail."
