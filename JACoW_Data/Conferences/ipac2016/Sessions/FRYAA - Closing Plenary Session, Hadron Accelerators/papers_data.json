        "the facility is to establish the In-flight Fragment (IF) and Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) facilities to support advanced science researches. Beam dynamics studies have progressed to cover start-to-end simulations including machine errors. There has been significant progress in sub-system prototype studies including 28-GHz ECR ion source",

The system includes the fissile fuel burner and used fuel recycle. The burner is optimized as the nuclear waste transmutation",

The 10 MeV LINAC has produced a CW proton beam in 10's kW and has been operated with the ion source being operated more than 2000 hrs. The new concept of spallation target is granular fluid target",
