        "the previous 7BA-6BA lattice resulted in having unacceptably strong gradients in quadrupoles and dipoles leading to high natural chromaticities. Several schemes that would allow for an improvement are explored",
        "such as shortening the insertion device straight sections by one or two meters to create more space for the magnetic structure",
        "lowering the dipole fields and the use of anti-bends as proposed by A. Streun. The effectiveness of each scheme is evaluated and the best combined use of them for SOLEIL is investigated. Ways to fulfil the constraints of the existing dipole beam lines are studied by introducing longitudinal gradient bends and/or multipole wigglers. The nonlinear optimisation to maximise the on and off-momentum apertures is made by using genetic algorithm-based numerical codes. A comparison of their performance and the obtained results are presented."

Eight of the twelve bending magnets are normal conducting ones. Four of them are 5 T superconducting magnets(superbend) of which bending angle is 12 degrees. The superbends are running without any trouble with refrigerator maintenance once per year. The accelerators have been operated about 1400 hours stable in a year.

        "we are required to maintain the beam current within ±0.5% of nominal",
        "and the bunch to bunch variation over the train less than 20% for all operating conditions. In this paper",
        "we discuss the algorithm used for top off",
        "simulations of various operating conditions and performance of the algorithm during operations."
