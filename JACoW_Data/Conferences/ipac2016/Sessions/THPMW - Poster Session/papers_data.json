        "The performance of the TPS dipole power supply for the dipole magnets in the TPS storage ring is important. As the output current of the power supply follows the beam current for operation at 3 GeV",
        "the power supply must deliver enormous energy to the dipole magnets. The target energy corresponds to 700 A at 800 V. The dipole supply for the TPS storage ring is a unipolar switching power supply",
        "also called a bulk power supply. The TPS dipole power supply modulates the output current regulated by the PWM signal. The switching device is an IGBT module working at frequency 2 kHz. A PID controller and a DCCT are used for feedback control of the output current. We obtained an optimal control gain with long-term stability of the output current under 10 ppm. The performance of the TPS storage ring dipole supply can thus satisfy the TPS requirement. The beam current generates 3 GeV in the TPS ring. This paper reports the excellent results."

The changes being studied include the addition of a fast Pulse Forming Line parallel to the existing Pulse Forming Network for the fast kicker magnets MKP-S. With the PFL an improved magnetic field rise time of 100 ns is targeted. Two different configuration utilizing a 2nd thyratron or two fast diode stacks have been outlined in the past. This paper presents the recent progress on the analogue circuit simulations for both options as well as measurements carried out on a test system. Modelling",
        "optimization and simulation of the entire system with diodes and a second configuration with two thyratron switches are outlined. Measurement results are given and the feasibility of the upgrade is discussed."

        "The injection kicker system for the SPS consists of sixteen magnets housed in a total of four vacuum tanks. The kicker magnets in one tank have recently limited operation of the SPS with high-intensity beam: this is due to both beam induced heating in the ferrite yoke of the kicker magnets and abnormally high pressure in the vacuum tank. Furthermore",

Hence studies of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance of the kicker magnets have been carried out to investigate effective methods to shield the ferrite yoke from the circulating beam.

        "and practical realizations for multi MW peak power pulsers will be presented. All used pulser components are manufactured by the US national industry and they are available for design and pulser fabrication. Two concepts will be discussed: (1) an approach is based on assistance of a nonlinear transmission line with ferromagnetic media and (2) an approach is based on assistance of special diodes which are working in a specific mode of operation. In both approaches the nonlinear characteristic of switching media (ferromagnetic and solid state plasma) are employed in final stage of the pulser to form the multi MW level nanosecond pulses."

        "deterioration of the abort kicker system was observed. The reduced kicks resulted in quenching the superconducting quadrupole Q4 downstream of the beam dump. Frequent re-tuning of the modulator wave form temporarily mitigated the effect",
        "which worsened during the course of the run. Beam-induced heating of the kicker ferrites was evenutally identified as the root cause of this behavior. We report our observations and discuss modifications to the kickers."
