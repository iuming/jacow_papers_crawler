      "abstract": "An experiment to measure the Coherent Smith-Purcell radiation has been installed in the SOLEIL Linac. Its aim is to produce a map of Smith-Purcell radiation emissions in several planes and compare it with theoretical predictions. Coherent Smith Purcell radiation is produced when a grating is brought close from a sufficiently short charged particles beam. The experiment consist of two detectors with 5 degrees of freedom. These two detectors can be moved around the emission point to measure the intensity of the radiation at different locations. Radiation maps are recorded parasitically by moving the detectors around during normal linac operations. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

The electrons are then filtered in LEETECH by a system of collimators",

We did not observe distinguishable peaks in cases when a significant fraction of the incident electrons had energies below a MIP.

      "abstract": "For the successful operation of various accelerator facilities a detailed bunch characterization is required. A complete description can be achieved using various diagnostic systems installed along an accelerator beamline. Ideally the diagnostic should be able to measure parameters of a single bunch in a non-destructive manner. For bunch length measurements this results in a complicated task especially for bunch duration below 1 ps. One of the possible solutions is a diagnostic based on the interaction of a low energy electron beam with electro-magnetic fields of the relativistic bunch. The bunch length can be readily deduced from the resulting scatter. In this paper bunch length measurement technique based on a low energy electron beam is introduced. Results of numerical simulations of measurements are presented. A possible setup of such diagnostic system for BERLinPro facility is proposed. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

        "The Electron Stretcher Facility ELSA provides a polarized electron beam with energies of 0.5 - 3.2 GeV for double polarization hadron physics experiments. Monitoring the vertical electron polarization by Compton polarimetry in the stretcher ring has several advantages over the established polarization measurement by Moeller polarimetry. The Compton polarimeter setup presented consists of a 40 W cw disk laser featuring two polarized photon beams colliding head-on with the stored electron beam in ELSA. A silicon strip detector measures the vertical intensity profile of the backscattered photons. The reversal of handedness of the laser beam's circular polarization results in a polarization dependent vertical shift of this profile. From a calibration using time dependent polarization build-up due to the Sokolov-Ternov effect",
        "the polarization degree of the electron beam can be extracted. After recent laser repairs as well as beamline and detector modifications",

      "abstract": "The ANKA storage ring offers different operation modes including the short-bunch mode with bunch lengths tuned down to a few picoseconds. This can lead to the occurrence of micro-bunching instabilities coupled to the emission of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in so-called 'bursts'. To study this CSR instability we use several turn-by-turn enabled detector systems to synchronously measure both the THz signal as well as bunch profiles. The different detectors are placed at different locations around the storage ring. Here we discuss the experimental setup and calibration of the various systems' synchronisation. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

        "respectively) with both short and long-term stability are the most critical. The EBPM sensitivity is also crucial for low-current beam commissioning to accomplish the first beam storage in the ring. We designed a button electrode to obtain sufficiently high-intensity signals while suppressing high-Q trapped modes leading to impedance and heating issues. We also designed a precise EBPM block and a rigid support to achieve mechanical accuracy and stability. Another challenge is the development of a reliable and stable XBPM",

A significant improvement of a blade-type XBPM or an invention of a novel XBPM detecting the core of an intense X-ray beam are necessary. The other diagnostic instrumentations can be utilized for the new ring with minor improvements."

      "abstract": "Electron bunch length measurement is of great significance for optimizing IRFEL performance. An optical autocorrelation system using coherent transition radiation (CTR) would be set up to measure the electron bunch length at the IRFEL. CTR can be occurred when short electron bunches traverse a vacuum-metal interface. A Martin-Puplett interferometer allowed measurement of the autocorrelation of the CTR signal. The basic principle and the main components of Martin-Puplett interferometer are elaborated in this paper. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

        "The UED (Ultrafast Electron Diffraction) beamline of KAERI (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute) WCI (World Class Institute) Center has been successfully commissioned. A S-band co-axial RF photogun with 1.5 cylindrically symmetric cells was used to remove multiple modes of the electric filed inside the cavity. It is designed to generate sub-picosecond electron bunches with energy up to 3.3~MeV. We have developed a system consists of an in-air Faraday cup (FC) and a preamplifier for charge measurement. Tests performed utilizing 3.3~MeV electrons show the system were able to measure ultrashort bunches with tens of femtosecond pulse duration at 10 fC sensitivity. In this paper",
        "we shall present the design",
        "calibration and test results of this system."

The 100 MeV proton beam is used in the industrial and the scientific fields such as improvement of the material characteristics and production of the isotope. The accurate measurements of the proton beam energy and profile are necessary for increasing the efficiency of the application and minimizing the inadequate radioactivation in linac structure caused by the beam loss. The proton beam energy and beam profile are measured by using the TOF (time-of-flight) method with a BPM (beam position monitor) and the ion chamber array",
