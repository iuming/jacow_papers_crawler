      "abstract": "The GEM*STAR Consortium of four companies, two universities, and two US national laboratories has formed Mu*STAR, a new company, to fund and build a profitable pilot plant to demonstrate the advantages of subcritical molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactors driven by superconducting RF proton linacs. The GEM*STAR multipurpose reactor design features new accelerator power capabilities, an internal spallation neutron target, and high temperature molten salt fuel with continuous purging of volatile radioactive fission products such that the reactor contains less than a critical mass and almost a million times fewer volatile radioactive fission products than conventional reactors. GEM*STAR is a reactor that without redesign will burn spent nuclear fuel (SNF), natural uranium, thorium, or surplus weapons material. It will operate without the need for a critical core, fuel enrichment, or reprocessing, making it an excellent design overall, and a strong candidate for export. We describe the design and plans for funding a pilot plant that could profitably dispose of excess weapons-grade plutonium. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-",

Less than 1 MeV accelerators are available for on-site inspection and less than 3.95 MeV accelerators are allowable for only bridge on-site inspection. These systems can visualize in seconds inner states of infrastructures",

        "we conducted the first inspection of the real bridge and evaluated degradation of pre-stressed concrete wires. We also demonstrated first on-site use of the 3.95 MeV system in Japan in 2015. We are also performing structural analysis to evaluate the degradation of strength. For more precise evaluation",
        "we are going to carry out a partial angle CT to reconstruct a two-dimensional inner structure. We are going to present the results and strategy of degradation evaluation of the industrial and societal infrastructures by the 950 keV / 3.95 MeV X-ray sources."

        "The number of research infrastructures which are being built with significant amount of In-Kind Contributions (IKCs) from partners and stakeholders is on the increase. One of the main advantages of the utilization of IKCs in big science projects is to enable numerous partners with technological and scientific know-how participate directly in such projects. Thus",
        "IKCs promote capacity building in technology and knowledge transfer of these partners. However",
        "management and execution of IKCs are particularly challenging. The 2nd In-Kind Contributions Workshop (IKCW 2015) was organized by the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Europe (FAIR) with the aim of sharing experiences on the procurement and management of large-scale international science projects through IKCs. This paper focuses on the analysis of the issues pertaining to how to best implement and execute IKCs from the initial phase of assignment until full delivery for both accelerator and experiments. Discussions held during IKCW 2015 are used to highlight these points further. The goal of this paper is to present the reader with a synopsis of the challenges and opportunities faced in procurement through IKCs."

        "Electropolishing is one of the best methods of Nb surface finishing of the superconducting cavity to obtain high accelerating gradient. Mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid is generally used in the electropolishing of Nb. But this solution is very dangerous and because the corrosion of the metal occurs by hydrofluoric acid",
        "all equipment must be made of high density polyethylene or fluorocarbon resin. This causes the expensive cost of electropolishing instrument. In addition",
        "this solution produces sulfur compound on the Nb surface in the electropolishing reaction. This sulfur compound can be field emission sources on the inner surface of cavity and degrades acceleration performance. In this poster",
        "we report noble electropolishing method using periodic reverse current and sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction produces no sulfur content and the equipment is less expensive because the instrument can be made of usual plastic material. As the result of experiments with Nb-coupon samples",
        "we found that the surface roughness is equivalent to the conventional electropolishing method."
