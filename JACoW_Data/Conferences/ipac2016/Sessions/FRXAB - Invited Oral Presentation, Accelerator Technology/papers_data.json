        "This talk provides a review of high voltage pulse modulators used for RF sources. Thanks to the innovation of high power semiconductor devices",
        "various types of solid state switch devices and solid state modulators have been developed and realized. They improve the stability and reliability of the accelerator operation",
        "and contribute downsizing and cost down for incoming new accelerators. This presentation addresses all relevant issues."
