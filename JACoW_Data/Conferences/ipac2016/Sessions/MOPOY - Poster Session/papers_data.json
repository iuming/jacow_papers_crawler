        "MedAustron is a medical accelerator facility for hadron therapy cancer treatment using protons and carbon ions. The Synchrotron is driven by a 0.47-3.26 MHz Finemet® loaded wideband cavity powered by 12x 1kW solid state amplifiers connected to a digital Low Level RF system. It was developed in collaboration with CERN and put to operation at MedAustron in early 2014. The main Synchrotron RF (sRF )commissioning steps for proton beams involved the setup of the adiabatic capture process",
        "the setup of the frequency and voltage ramps and feedback loops for fast acceleration and the RF jump for extraction. The adiabatic capture process was optimized in terms of energy and voltage mismatch by analyzing longitudinal empty bucket scans after beam injection into the synchrotron. The acceleration ramp optimization was based on calculations using a software tool developed in-house and adapted experimentally to minimize losses at injection and during acceleration. This paper provides an overview of the acceleration system and describes the commissioning process of the sRF system and the related beam commissioning efforts at MedAustron."

Controlled deceleration in a synchrotron equipped with an electron cooler to reduce emittances in all three planes will allow the existing AD experiments to increase substantially their antiproton capture efficiencies and render new experiments possible. Installation of the machine and lines needed for the commissioning of the ring are ongoing and commissioning is expected to start around mid-2016. The aim is to complete ELENA ring commissioning in November followed by the installation of new electrostatic transfer lines to existing experiments until autumn 2017. Status of ELENA installations and preparations for commissioning will be reported."

The key component is a cryomodule comprising a superconducting (sc) 217 MHz Crossbar-H-mode (CH) cavity surrounded by two sc 9.3T solenoids with compensation coils. The solenoid coil is made of a Nb3Sn wire; and the compensation coils at both ends of the solenoid comprises NbTi wires. The distance between solenoid lense and CH cavity has to be optimized for ideal beam matching as well as for a minimum rest field inside the cavity below the critical magnetic field. The GSI High Charge State (HLI) injector has to deliver a heavy ion beam with an energy of 1.4 MeV/u. Longitudinal matching to the demonstrator is provided by two 108.4 MHz cw room temperature λ/4 re-buncher cavity installed behind the HLI. In this paper electromagnetic simulations of the field optimization for the solenoids and the re-buncher cavities will be presented as well as first beam experiments at the beam transport line to the demonstrator cavity."

The components are in an advanced stage of manufacturing. The first components which allow the production of a 140 mA-100 keV deuteron beam have been delivered",

The third phase (short pulse) and forth phase (cw) will be the integrated commissioning of the LIPAc up to 9 MeV. The duration of the project has been recently extended up to end 2019 to allow the commissioning and operation of the whole accelerator (1MW). The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the LIPAc",

        "In preparation of the SPS as an LHC injector its impedance was significantly reduced in 1999 - 2000. A new SPS impedance reduction campaign is planned now for the High Luminosity (HL)-LHC project",
        "which requires bunch intensities twice as high as the nominal one. One of the known intensity limitations is a longitudinal multi-bunch instability with a threshold 3 times below this operational intensity. The instability is presently cured using the 4th harmonic RF system and controlled emittance blow-up",
        "but reaching the HL-LHC parameters cannot be assured without improving the machine impedance. Recently the impedance sources responsible for this instability were identified and implementation of their shielding and damping is foreseen during the next long shutdown (2019 - 2020) in synergy with two other important upgrades: amorphous carbon coating of (part of) the vacuum chamber against the e-cloud effect and rearrangement of the 200 MHz RF system. In this paper the strategy of impedance reduction is presented together with beam intensity achievable after its realisation. The potential effect of other proposals on remaining limitations is also considered."
