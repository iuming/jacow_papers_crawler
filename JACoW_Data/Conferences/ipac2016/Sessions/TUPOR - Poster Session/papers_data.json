It was found that impedance of vacuum flanges and of the already damped 630 MHz HOM of the main RF system gave for 72 bunches the comparable intensity thresholds. Possible intensity gains are defined for realistic impedance modifications and for various beam configurations (number of bunches",

The superconducting accelerator S-DALINAC at the Technische Universität Darmstadt provides electron beams in c.w. for nuclear physics experiments since 1991. It consists of a 10 MeV injector and a 40 MeV main linac where two and eight 20-cell elliptical 3-GHz cavities are operated in a liquid helium bath at 2 K. Using two recirculation beam lines the main accelerator can be used up to 3 times. Operational experiences have shown that the design-beam current of 20 μA could not be reached. One reason is the occurrence of BBU. We will report on measurements of the threshold current at various energy settings of the S-DALINAC. The results of a first test to increase the BBU limit by using skew quadrupole magnets in the first recirculation beam line will be presented."

        "Single bunch instabilities have been observed since the early stage of NSLS-II storage ring commissioning. After installing the super-conducting cavity",
        "the single bunch instability threshold current was similar at 0.7mA. The instability was eventually determined to be due to transverse mode coupling. Microwave instability has been characterized using streak camera bunch profile",
        "horizontal beam sizes at dispersion location and beam spectrums. Microwave instability threshold current dependency on bunch lengths and IUV gaps has been studied. Most recent experimental results will be presented in this paper."
