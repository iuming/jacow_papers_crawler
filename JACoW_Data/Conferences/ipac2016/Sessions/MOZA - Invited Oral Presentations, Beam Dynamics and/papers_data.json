        "The beam-beam limit is one of the most important collider parameters. For lepton colliders the empirical tune shift limits are higher than for hadron colliders",
        "which has been attributed to strong radiation damping. The beam-beam limit in hadron colliders",
        "like the LHC",
        "can be affected by noise. For future higher-energy colliders",
        "like FCC-hh or SppC",
        "the limit can be higher or lower",
        "in the presence of still rather weak synchrotron radiation. For circular lepton colliders",
        "like DAÎ¦NE",
        "SuperKEKB",
        "FCC-ee or CepC",
        "the effect of large Piwinski angle",
        "and crab waist",
        "as well as the dependence of the beam-beam limit on the number of interaction points are important questions. This presentation reviews the state of the art in weak-strong",
        "quasi-strong-strong and strong-strong beam-beam simulations and reports the various dependencies of the simulated beam-beam limit on the aforementioned parameters."
