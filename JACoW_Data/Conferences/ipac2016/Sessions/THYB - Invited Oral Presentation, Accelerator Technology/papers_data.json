        "The superconducting accelerator of the European XFEL consists of the injector part and the main linac. The injector includes one 1.3 GHz accelerator module and one 3.9 GHz third harmonic module",
        "while the main linac consists of 100 accelerator modules",
        "each housing eight 1.3 GHz TESLA-type cavities",
        "operated at an average design gradient of 23.6 MV/m. The fabrication and surface treatment by industry as well as the vertical and cryomodule RF tests of the required 808 superconducting 1.3GHz cavities are analysed and presented."
