        "A photo-injector with 4.6-cell and resonate frequency of 2.998 GHz has been designed and studied to replace the 2.5-cell RF gun + booster association. The cavity iris shape and dimensions were simulated systematically to optimize the shunt impedance. In this study",
        "electron beam reaches to 9.7 MeV with a moderate peak accelerat-ing gradient of 80 MV/m. Considering a beam charge of 1 nC/bunch",
        "average transverse emittance of ~ 5.9 πmm mrad and energy spread of ~ 0.8% can be obtained at the exit of the gun. The RF input power is only 10.2 MW due to the high shunt impedance. Asymmetry of the electric field due to the coupling port has also been studied using 3D codes for RF and beam dynamics calculations. We will present the RF design and beam calculations results."

        "Photocathode RF guns are used in the first stage of electron beam generation and acceleration. The RF gun of THOMX is a 2.5 cell standing wave copper cavity with resonance frequency of 2998.55 MHz at 30 °C under vacuum. The metal photocathode such as copper or magnesium is inserted into the backplane of the cavity. Due to high repetition rates up to 50 Hz with the average dissipated power into the internal surfaces up to 1.5 kW",
        "causing a heating and deformation of the cavity shape. Therefore",
        "the cooling system of the device has to be well designed to take under control the deformations of the structure",
        "providing a temperature increase as small and uniform as possible. For this purpose a fully coupled electromagnetic-thermal-structural finite element analysis on this gun has been performed with Ansys workbench. Numerical results show that the gun could operate at 3 μs RF pulse length and 50 Hz repetition rate with an average dissipated power of 1.5 kW. The gun average temperature is around 30 °C while the incoming water temperature is around 24°C. Internal speed of water is 2.5 m/s which corresponds to 15 l/min for the incoming water. The total pressure drop is around 0.4 bar"

        "The drive beam of CLIC requires unusually high peak and average currents which is challenging for the electron source. As an alternative to the thermionic electron gun foreseen in the baseline design",
        "a photoinjector option is under study at CERN using the PHIN photoinjector",
        "which was designed for a bunch charge of 2.3 nC and 1200 ns train length. During operation with nominal train length in 2014",

        "attributed to a heating of the Faraday cup",
        "caused a degradation of the photocathode. To overcome this problem a vacuum window has been installed to separate the Faraday cup from the rest of the vacuum system. In addition the train length has been further increased to 1600 ns to advance the beam parameters towards CLIC requirements. In this paper recent improved photocathode lifetime measurements carried out under these new conditions will be presented and compared with earlier measurements. Furthermore",
        "the utilized Cs2Te cathode has been analyzed with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) before and after its usage in PHIN to get a better understanding of photocathode surface deterioration effects",
        "which will also be discussed."

A preliminary analysis concerning the observation of deteriorated phase space acceptance in the TPS booster is given in this report.

It shows that the increase of the booster beam current by bunch train tuning indicates an upper bound of about 400 ns."

Quantitative studies building on the experience of other facilities suggest the wiggler's NdFeB magnets are at risk of demagnetization due to radiation induced by the synchrotron's 2.9 GeV electrons. We use a phenomenological model to convert simulated peak demagnetizing fields into a radiation dose corresponding to a chosen %-demagnetization",
        "and compare against an estimated dose per year due to injected beam. We find that injecting with the wiggler closed will cause 1% demagnetization in sections of its magnet blocks within 2 years of operation",

We find that radiation drops significantly when the injection efficiency is well-tuned. Our results suggest the wiggler will not receive damaging levels of radiation at closed gap so long as the injection system remains optimized."

        "manipulation with the drive laser plays a significant role in high brightness electron beam production by the photocathode RF gun. The method based on pulse stacking with birefringent crystal serials was tried to longitudinally shape ultraviolet laser pulse. Using four or five pieces of a-BBO crystals to stack an input UV pulse with appropriate initial duration into 16 or 32 sub-pulses to form quasi flattop UV laser pulse",
        "which can be applied for emittance optimization of the electron beam based on the photocathode RF gun. Moreover",
        "the negative slop of the energy transmittance of a-BBO serials is also revealed to be a passive stabilization mechanism for energy jitter reduction in the driving laser. With appropriate design of a-BBO serials",
        "this method can fulfill the requirements for driving laser in a broad scope of applications such as x-ray FELs and high-power Terahertz(THz) radiation production."
