        "CEA is committed to delivering a Medium Energy Beam Transfer line and a superconducting linac (SCL) for SARAF accelerator in order to accelerate 5mA beam of either protons from 1.3 MeV to 35 MeV or deuterons from 2.6 MeV to 40 MeV. The SCL consists in 4 cryomodules. The first two identical cryomodules host 6 half-wave resonator (HWR) low beta cavities (β = 0.09) at 176 MHz. The last two identical cryomodule will host 7 HWR high-beta cavities (β = 0.18) at 176 MHz. Low-beta and high beta cavities have been optimized to limit electric and magnetic peak fields in the cavity",
        "and to minimize the dissipated power. Manufacturing constraints and helium cooling were taken into consideration to minimize the risk during manufacturing and operation. Preliminary mechanical studies of the cavity and of the tuning system",
        "as well as preliminary studies of the couplers and pick-up antennas were carried out. This work will be presented in this poster."

The LPWA has two serous disadvantages as very high energy spread and low part of electrons capturing into acceleration. The waveguide and klystron type beam pre-modulation schemes was proposed *",
        "** to growth capturing and to limit the energy spectrum of 2-3 % for 200-300 MeV beam. One interesting effect was detected due to numerical simulation of beam dynamics in plasma channel. Not captured electrons are escape to the channel border fast and this effect should be explained. It was shown that such effect is caused by effective potential function which forms very high defocusing transverse field after its trailing edge. The results of such explanation verified by numerical simulations are discussed in report for linear and bubble LPWA modes.",

        "the cavities need to be operated under-coupled. To lower the Qext and move the optimum operating point nearer to 200kW",
        "3 stub tuners are used in the waveguide feed line. The difference in the height of the coupling waveguide on cavity and that of the vacuum side waveguide on the window assembly results in a step transition which affects the Qext. The present window/step location results in Qext higher than that without the window. The Qext can be lowered by re-locating the RF window or by shifting the step change in the waveguide cross-section from its present location. This needs modification to the Pump Out box. The pros and cons of the proposed modification to the pump out box in terms of standing waves and multipacting characteristics studied with CST Studio are discussed in this paper."
