This classical approach is not efficient and not compatible to the beam dynamics nature. 6D phase-space rotation",

Combination of bunch clipping with a mechanical slit and x-z rotation can generate micro-bunch structure which is applicable for FEL enhancement and drive beam for dielectric acceleration. We present our theoretical and simulation study on these applications."

Limited number of studies have shown that application of these systems makes it possible to develop a compact linac with high efficiency and simpler power system. Typically",

This paper describes the development of such system using DLW cells with magnetic coupling (DLW-M). Here BAS appears as an absorbing load connected to the DLW-M accelerating structure by rectangular waveguide allowing to have theoretical zero reflection at RF input. Such system also provides possibility of plain beam output energy adjustment. Studies of the structure were carried out using equivalent circuits methods and numerical 3D-modeling. Beam dynamics was calculated."

At BERLinPro bunch compression and decompression can be done in two stages in the injector and main arcs. Starting with different bunch lengths from the gun the distribution of compression between these two stages is subject to optimization. Simulations show that the length and shape of the bunch in the injector and before the linac are the limiting factors for minimal bunch length. Injector simulations have to consider space charge effects",

Optimization and simulation tools have to be chosen according to the energy regime and dominant collective effects.

In the experiment we measured both the effect on the beam of the structure wakefield and the spectral properties of the radiation excited by the beam. We began by injecting a relatively long beam–-compared to the wavelength of the radiation–-to excite the structure",
        "and then used a downstream spectrometer to infer the radiation wavelength. This was followed by injecting a shorter bunch",

Our experimental set-up was simple and not optimized for the efficient collection of the radiation by e.g. the use of tapered horns. As such it can be considered a proof-of-principle experiment.",
