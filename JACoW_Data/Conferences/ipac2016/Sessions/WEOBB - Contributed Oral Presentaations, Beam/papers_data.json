        "resolution is desired for a single-",
        "or a few-bunch fill",
        "which is not yet available with our standard BPM signal processing. This paper describes our experience with more advanced BPM ADC signal processing which allowed us to significantly improve turn-by-turn BPM resolution in single bunch mode down to the level of about one micron at ~1 nC/bunch. We also present the examples of machine studies that benefit from this BPM performance enhancement."

        "For the very low emittance beams in CLIC",
        "it is vital to mitigate emittance growth which leads to reduced luminosity in the detectors. One factor that leads to emittance growth is transverse wakefields in the accelerating structures. In order to combat this the structures must be aligned with a precision of a few um. For achieving this tolerance",
        "accelerating structures are equipped with wakefield monitors that measure higher-order dipole modes excited by the beam when offset from the structure axis. We report on such measurements",
        "performed using prototype CLIC accelerating structures which are part of the module installed in the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3) at CERN. Measurements with and without the drive beam that feeds rf power to the structures are compared. Improvements to the experimental setup are discussed",
        "and finally remaining measurements that should be performed before the completion of the program are summarized."
