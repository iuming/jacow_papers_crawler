        "Conceptual design report for the SPring-8 upgrade project (SPring-8-II) was published in November of 2014. Vacuum system for the targeted storage ring should handle some fateful boundary conditions",
        "such as miniaturization of vacuum chamber and increase in number of photon absorbers resulting from the multi-bend achromat configuration. Furthermore",
        "reuse of the existing tunnel brings the severe packing factor issue of vacuum components and the time constraints issue of one-year blackout. Considering the above circumstances",
        "a concept of 12-m long vacuum chamber with welded integral structure was proposed to omit in-situ baking. The 12-m long chamber will be evacuated to ultra-high vacuum by ex-situ baking followed by NEG activation",
        "and moved to the tunnel with special thin gate valves at both ends. Recently",
        "the chamber material has been changed from aluminum alloy to stainless steel (SS) from the viewpoints of elimination of aluminum-SS transition space",
        "beam vibration suppression",
        "and superior outgassing property. Trial production of SS chamber is proceeding to establish appropriate manufacturing processes",
        "while focusing on the accuracy of dimension and magnetic permeability."

        "A ferrite has been well known as an effective material for absorbing electromagnetic waves. Various types of the ferrite blocks have been actually used in accelerator fields as the higher-order modes (HOMs) absorbers in the vacuum beam pipes. However",
        "one of difficulties in using the ferrite is to bond it to the beam pipes with a sufficient adhesive force",
        "and to assure the contact with a high thermal conductivity in vacuum. The brazing or Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) is not so easy owing to a low thermal expansion rate and a relatively low tensile strength of the ferrite. We established a method of fabricating a ferrite block bonded to copper by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The ferrite powders are directly sintered on a copper block in the SPS process together with some metals to relax the thermal stress between them. The sintered ferrite-copper block can be brazed or welded to other metal blocks",
        "or directly on the beam pipes. Here reported are R&D results of the fabrication method",
        "and some experimental results on the properties of the ferrite-copper block."

The photocathodes developed here will ultimately be used to drive NCRF guns such as that used in VELA and the proposed CLARA light source test facility. The samples grown on Si substrates were used to investigate the morphology and thickness of the film. The samples grown onto Cu and Mo substrates were analysed and tested as photocathodes in a surface characterisation chamber",

The study reveals that a PSD measurement may not reveal a single unique behavior for a vacuum material and that multiple sources should be considered for vacuum calculations."

        "The electrum beam of the repetition rate of 50 Hz double-bunch is requested for injector linac of SuperKEKB. By development of the Yb-doped laser system",
        "more than 5.0 nC and 3.0 nC electron beam with single-bunch has been generated in the 5 Hz and 25 Hz respectively. Also more than 1.0 nC electron with double-bunch has been obtained in 25 Hz. The Yb-doped laser system is already for commissioning for the linac. Next",
        "a new laser system is development to improve the stability and reliability. The laser system starts with a 50 MHz Yb-doped fiber oscillator with the all normal dispersion (ANDi) structure. A transmission grating pair stretcher was employed to expend pulse to ~30 ps and separate the pulse to two parts with the center wavelength of 1030 nm and 1064 nm. Then the two kinds of pulses can be amplified by Yb:YAG and Nd:YAG crystals respectively. The weak pulses were amplified by the Yb-doped fiber amplifier",
        "and reduced repetition rate by a semiconductor optics amplifier (SOA) pulse picker. To obtain the mJ-class pulse energy",
        "a Yb:YAG thin-disk regenerative solid-state amplifier and a Nd:YAG rod regenerative solid-state amplifier were employed."
