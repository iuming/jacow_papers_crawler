ipac2016,,MOZA01,Simulated Beam-beam Limits for Circular Lepton and Hadron Colliders,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; The beam-beam limit is one of the most important collider parameters. For lepton colliders the empirical tune shift limits are higher than for hadron colliders; which has been attributed to strong radiation damping. The beam-beam limit in hadron colliders; like the LHC; can be affected by noise. For future higher-energy colliders; like FCC-hh or SppC; the limit can be higher or lower; in the presence of still rather weak synchrotron radiation. For circular lepton colliders; like DAΦNE; SuperKEKB; FCC-ee or CepC; the effect of large Piwinski angle; and crab waist; as well as the dependence of the beam-beam limit on the number of interaction points are important questions.

To date; however; such thyristor assemblies have not demonstrated the reliability needed for installation in short pulse; high peak power RF stations used with many pulsed electron accelerators. The fast rising current in a thyristor tends to be carried in a small region; rather than across the whole device; and this localized current concentration can cause a short circuit failure. An alternate solid-state device; the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT); can readily operate at the speed needed for the accelerator; but commercial IGBTs cannot handle the voltage and current required. It is; however; possible to assemble these devices in arrays to reach the required performance levels without sacrificing their inherent speed. Diversified Technologies; Inc. (DTI) has patented and refined the technology required to build these arrays of series-parallel connected switches.

However; these signals are a mixture of the BPM gain and beta-beat. Even though BPM gain can be fitted by analyzing the statistics of all the BPMs in a ring accelerator; we found the uncertainty is on the order of a few percent. On the other hand; the betatron phase advance; which is obtained from the correlation of two adjacent BPMs; is independent of the BPM gain and tilt error. It was found at NSLS-II that the measurement precision of the phase advance is typically 0.001 radian; which corresponds to about 0.2% of beta beat. The phase error can be corrected similarly using a response matrix; and at NSLS-II the phase error can be corrected to <0.005 radian (p-p) in less than half an hour. The same technique can be applied to the nonlinear lattice. By comparing the phase advance differences between the on- and off- orbit lattices; the sextupole strength error can be identified.

This can have varying degrees of advantage depending on acuteness of issues in a conventional scheme: - Limited flexibility and space constraint for matching section - Neglect of beam property away from matching section - Excessive envelope/magnet strength caused by matching (sub-optimal tradeoff) - Local envelope blowup inside matching section - Low tolerance to errors and lack of recourse to matching failure - Slow computation process - Unpredictable solution - Limited option/insight/control on implementing solution. A scheme was envisioned to address these; backed by recently developed matching algorithm tailored to this demand. It can be applied to any beamline configuration; including coupled 4D or intervening elements; providing deterministic; rigorous solutions allowing insight and control pre-implementation.

A complete description can be achieved using various diagnostic systems installed along an accelerator beamline. Ideally the diagnostic should be able to measure parameters of a single bunch in a non-destructive manner. For bunch length measurements this results in a complicated task especially for bunch duration below 1 ps. One of the possible solutions is a diagnostic based on the interaction of a low energy electron beam with electro-magnetic fields of the relativistic bunch.

Monitoring the vertical electron polarization by Compton polarimetry in the stretcher ring has several advantages over the established polarization measurement by Moeller polarimetry. The Compton polarimeter setup presented consists of a 40 W cw disk laser featuring two polarized photon beams colliding head-on with the stored electron beam in ELSA. A silicon strip detector measures the vertical intensity profile of the backscattered photons. The reversal of handedness of the laser beam's circular polarization results in a polarization dependent vertical shift of this profile. From a calibration using time dependent polarization build-up due to the Sokolov-Ternov effect; the polarization degree of the electron beam can be extracted. After recent laser repairs as well as beamline and detector modifications; first measurement attempts of the electron's polarization degree were conducted. The performance of the beamline and first measurements are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmb010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmb010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmb010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMB010,95

The laser generates 3.80 ps chirped pulses which are compressed to 213 fs with a grating pair. In this conference; we will report the performance of the Yb-fiber laser and results of EO sampling experiments.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmb030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmb030.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmb030_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMB030,155

A fault-tolerant mechanism should be mandatorily imposed in order to maintain short recovery time; high uptime and extremely low frequency of beam loss. This paper proposes an innovative and challenging way for compensation and rematch of cavity failure using fast electronic devices and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) instead of embedded computers to complete the computation of beam dynamics. Due to the high arithmetic-computing-speed; good portability and repeatability; it is possible to realize calculation and re-adjustment online. In order to achieve the goal of instantaneous compensation and rematch; an advanced hardware design methodology including high-level synthesis and an improved genetic algorithm will be used.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmb032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmb032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmb032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMB032,158

The preliminary design of the physical dimensions including the electrode aperture; the pipe aperture and the gap between the two electrodes is performed by calculating their effects on BPM response respectively with the equivalent circuit model. Furthermore; the mechanical structure of the Shoebox BPM is optimized by CST simulation to achieve better performance. The dependency of the BPM sensitivity and zero offset on the frequency is diminished by adding one isolating ring; which decreases coupling capacitance of electrodes and compensates ground capacitance difference of the two electrodes. Finally one prototype of the Shoebox BPM has been fabricated and tested offline.

Because of the bunch lengthening; the streak camera faced the problem; the streak image on the phosphor screen will overlap when the bunch length was above 200.5ps@5% linear error and 10% overlap. In order to solve this problem; an effective solution was to change the working frequency of the streak camera to 136MHz (two thirds of 204MHz); and then the streak image on the phosphor screen will overlap when the bunch length was above 285.6ps@5% linear error and 10% overlap.

The system was commissioned in 2011 and provided satisfactory beam-parameter measurements during LHC run 1 for lead-ions. However; for protons its usability was substantially limited due to strong interfering signals originating from the coherent motion of the particle bunch. The system has recently been upgraded with optimized travelling-wave pick-ups and an improved 4.8~GHz microwave signal path; with the front-end and the triple down-mixing chain optimized to reduce coherent signals.

The prototype structures for CLIC have four radial waveguides connected to each cell for damping wakefields and this four-fold symmetry is responsible for an octupole component of the radio-frequency fields; phase-shifted 90 degrees with respect to the accelerating mode. The octupole field causes a nonlinear dependence of the transverse beam deflection with respect to the position within the accelerating structure. By transversely moving the beam with two upstream steering magnets; and observing the deflection with beam position monitors or screens; the electromagnetic center of the structure can be found.

The luminosities measured by the CMS experiment during the scans were used to derive the convoluted beam size and orbit offset bunch-by-bunch. This contribution will elaborate on the method used to derive plane-by-plane; bunch-by-bunch emittances from the scan data; including uncertainties and corrections. The measurements are then compared to beam size estimations from absolute luminosity; synchrotron light telescopes; and wire scanners. In particular; the evolution of the emittance over the course of several hours in collisions is studied and bunch-by-bunch differences are highlighted.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmr025_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmr025.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmr025_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMR025,290

Some of the present limits can be related to systematic errors in the wire scanner calibration or; for the horizontal emittance determination; in the assumptions adopted while deconvoluting the contribution of the longitudinal plane from the measured transverse profile. We present in this paper the results of a beam-based test of the wire scanner calibration and of a general numerical deconvolution algorithm to compute the betatronic profile starting from the measured ones. In addition to the bunch train average emittance; a bunch-by-bunch transverse emittance measurement would increase the potential to understand; optimise and monitor the beam performance.

The wavelength used for imaging was shifted to near ultra-violet to reduce the contribution of diffraction to the system resolution; while in parallel; a new diagnostic system based on double slit interferometry was installed to measure the beam size by studying the spatial coherence of the emitted synchrotron radiation. This method has never been implemented before in a proton machine. A Hartmann mask was also installed to identify possible wavefront distortions that could affect the system accuracy.

To minimize stress on accelerator components in the injection regions of the LHC and to guarantee an efficient operation these losses needed to be understood and possible mitigation techniques should be studied. Measurements with diamond particle detectors revealed the loss structure with ns-resolution for the first time. Based on these measurements; recaptured beam from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) surrounding the nominal bunch train was identified as the major contributor to the injection loss signals. Methods to reduce the recaptured beam in the SPS were successfully tested and verified with the diamond particle detectors.

This is most commonly observed in photo-injectors. In this low energy regime; emittance measurement techniques such as quadrupole scans fail as they consider the beam size only depends on optical functions. The pepper-pot method is used for 2D emittance measurements in a single shot manner. In order to measure the beam emittance in space charge dominated regime by quadrupole scans; space charge term should be carefully incorporated into the transfer matrices. On the other hand; methods such as divergence interferometry via optical transition radiation (OTRI); phase space tomography using 1D projections of quadrupole scans can be suitably applied for such conditions.

To improve this situation; the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system must be measured; preferably; with high dynamic range. For this purpose we have created an intense; small (~ 1 μm) point source using a high quality laser and special focusing optics; and introduced a digital micro-mirror array in the optical system to substantially increase its dynamic range.

Here; an effort to improve the beam transfer from RIKEN's 18 GHz ECR ion source to the Low Energy Beam Transfer (LEBT) line and an optimization of the performance of the ion source is presented. Simulation studies have shown that less than 20% of the beam is currently transferred. The first goal is to measure the transverse beam emittance in real time. The emittance monitor designed and fabricated for this purpose utilizes a pepper pot plate followed by a transparent scintillator and a CMOS camera for image capture. The second goal is to find the optimal operating point of the ion source by sweeping parameters such as RF power; vacuum pressure; extraction electrode position and voltage. To this extent; modifications of the ion source took place; as well as a measurement of the magnetic field inside the ion source.

In order to eliminate beam jitter and to study bunch-by-bunch beam dynamics; a fast-gating camera has been utilized to measure single bunch transverse beam profiles. The minimum camera gate width is ~ 3ns which allows us to resolve single bunch beam dynamics along a CesrTA bunch train. Using single bunch interferometry at different bunch currents; we found that the horizontal beam sizes measured by gated camera are consistently less than those measured by a conventional CCD camera; demonstrating the elimination of turn-by-turn beam jitter with single shot capability. By stepping the camera trigger delay; we collected transverse beam profile images from each bunch in a 14ns-spacing 30-bunch train. The horizontal motion of each bunch as well as the horizontal beam size increases dramatically along an electron train but not along positron bunch trains under the same machine condition. The difference in single bunch horizontal dynamics may be a signature for the difference between electron cloud build-up for positron bunch trains versus ions present for electron bunch trains.; * S.T.

In this talk; we report on the development of radiation-resistant fiber optic strain sensors for subsequent generations of SNS target instrumentation. The sensors are extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometers (EFPIs) made from fluorine-doped single-mode fibers. The radiation induced loss of the fiber has been measured in the SNS target 13 at the energy-on-target level exceeding 500 MWhr which results in peak doses on fiber of more than 109 Gy. A superluminescent diode laser at 1300 nm is used as the light source and the strain is measured in real-time using quadrature phase shifted signals generated from a local interferometer.

RF breakdown limits the performance of high gradient RF accelerators. To understand the properties of these breakdowns; it is necessary to have diagnostics that reliably detect RF breakdowns. In X-band or S-band accelerators; RF breakdowns are detected by measuring RF pulse shortening; vacuum burst; or; if current monitors are available; spikes in the field-emitted currents. In mm-wave accelerators; all of these methods are difficult to use. In our experiments; we could not measure RF pulse shortening directly with a crystal detector because the RF pulse is very short'just a few nanoseconds'and changes in the measured signal were masked by RF amplitude jitter. To overcome this limitation; we built a single-shot spectrometer with a frequency range of 117-125 GHz and a resolution of 0.1 GHz. The spectrometer should be able to measure the widening of the spectrum caused by the shortening of nanosecond-long pulses. We present design considerations; first experimental results obtained at FACET; and planned future improvements for the spectrometer.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmr056_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmr056.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmr056_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMR056,374

By measuring the arrival time jitter of one bunch in a bunch train; the designed cavity apply a correcting accelerating or decelerating voltage to the next bunches. The input power of the cavity is provided by a solid state amplifier and will be coupled to the cavity via a loop on the body. To achieve the fs level precision of the arrival time; the cavity should be able to provide accurate accelerating voltage with a precision of 300 eV. We performed thermal simulation to find out the temperature distribution of the cavity and make sure that heating will not affect its voltage precision. The simulation results show that by using two input loops the coupling constant will vary from 4.11 to 4.13 during the operation of the cavity which effect on the bunchs' arrival time would be less than 0.25 fs.

These results prompted us to perform systematic studies of copper rf properties at cryogenic temperatures and low rf power. We placed copper cavities into a cryostat cooled by a pulse tube cryocooler; so cavities could be cooled to 4K. We used different shapes of cavities for the X-Band and S-Band measurements. Properties of the cavities were measured using a network analyzer. We calculated rf surface resistance from measured Q0 and Q external of the cavity at temperatures from 4 K to room temperature. The results were then compared to the theory proposed by Reuter and Sondheimer. These measurements are a part of studies with the goal of reaching very high operational accelerating gradients in normal conducting rf structures.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmw038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmw038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmw038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMW038,487
ipac2016,,MOPMW039,TM01 Mode Launcher for Use in High Brightness Photoguns,UCLA; Los Angeles; California; USA; M. Dal Fornopresenter; V.A. Dolgashev; SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Photo rf guns are a source of electron beams for X-ray FELs such as LCLS and European XFEL. In existing photoguns power is coupled into the cavity by waveguides through the cell walls; like LCLS; or through coaxial coupling; at the European XFEL. We are considering feeding a gun using a circular waveguide with the TM01 mode. To do that we need a mode launcher; a matched device that couples the rectangular TE01 mode waveguide to a TM01 mode in a circular waveguide. Use of the mode launcher reduces complexity of the gun cavity and increases flexibility of positioning the input waveguide relative to the gun body. Mode launchers have been successfully used at SLAC and elsewhere for X-band high gradient tests. Because the existing mode launchers were not built for high brightness guns; they have a significant quadrupole field component. High brightness rf guns have tight requirements on output beam properties; and this quadrupole component adversely affects the beam. We have designed a mode launcher free of this disadvantage. We present design considerations; methodology; and an example S-band mode launcher.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmw039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmw039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmw039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMW039,491

We observed that a confined travelling-wave mode exists in half of the accelerating structure. The experiments were conducted at FACET facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Depending on the gap width; the accelerating structure had beam-synchronous frequencies that vary from 90 to 140 GHz. When we opened the gap by more than half wavelength the synchronous wave remains trapped. Its behavior is consistent with the so called ""surface wave"".

The rf fields were excited in the structure by an ultra-relativistic electron beam generated by the FACET facility at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. We observed rf breakdowns generated in the presence of GV/m scale electric fields. We varied the rf fields excited by the FACET bunch by moving structure relative to the beam and by changing the gap between structure halves. Reliable breakdowns detectors allowed us to measure the rf breakdown rate at these different rf parameters. We measured radiated rf energy with a pyro-detector.

To achieve these requirements; multi-beam klystron and sheet-beam klystron devices have been developed. Multi-beam klystrons; at high frequency employ separate output cavities; hence they have the disadvantage that combining all the rf pulses; generated by all the beams; is challenging. Sheet-beam klystrons have problems with instabilities and with space charge forces that makes the beam not naturally confined. We are proposing an alternative approach that reduces space charge problems; by adopting geometries in which the space charge forces are naturally balanced. An example is when the electron beam is generated by a central source (well) and the electron motion corresponds to the natural expansion of the electron cloud (three-dimensional device). In this paper we will present the design and challenges of a bi-dimensional rf source; a cylindrical klystron; composed by concentric pancake resonant cavities. In this case; space charge forces are naturally balanced in the azimuthal direction.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmw042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmw042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmw042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMW042,501

The residual RF energy has to be terminated into an RF load. Higher accelerating gradients require higher RF sources and RF loads; which can stably terminate the residual RF power. This overview will outline vacuumed RF loads only. A common method to terminate multi-MW RF power is to use circulated water (or other liquid) as an absorbing medium. A solid dielectric interface (a high quality ceramic) is required to separate vacuum and liquid RF absorber mediums. Using such RF load approaches in TW linacs is troubling because there is a fragile ceramic window barrier and a failure could become catastrophic for linac vacuum and RF systems. Traditional loads comprising of a ceramic disk have limited peak and average power handling capability and are therefore not suitable for high gradient TW linacs. This overview will focus on 'vacuum dry' or 'all-metal' loads that do not employ any dielectric interface between vacuum and absorber. The first prototype is an original design of RF loads for the Stanford Two-Mile Accelerator.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmw043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmw043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmw043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMW043,504

This fast kicker is developed for the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) based electron Circular Cooler Ring (CCR) in the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC; previously MEIC).

Each cavity is fed by a tapered ridge waveguide iris input coupler and a waveguide ceramic disk window. The original couplers and cavities have been in service for more than a decade. Design optimization and tuning of the couplers were initially performed prior to installation and commissioning of the cavities. Since each DTL cavity is unique; expensive; and fully utilized for neutron production; none of the cavity structure is available as a test cavity or a spare. Maintaining spares for operations and for future system upgrade; test setup of the iris couplers for precision tuning is needed. Ideally a smaller cavity structure may be used for pretuning and RF conditioning of the iris couplers as a test cavity or a bridge waveguide.

Output powers are from several tens of kW to ~1 MW for CW klystrons and ~100 MW for pulsed ones. The narrow-bandwidth requirement has enabled them to provide high gain (typically 40 - 50 dB) which greatly simplifies the RF drive system. Recently; especially for large-scale accelerator facilities; the klystron efficiency has become one of the most demanding issues. This is because electricity cost occupies a great portion of their operating budgets and the klystron efficiency is one of the important factors determining the electricity consumption of the whole accelerator system. In this regard; we have designed a high-efficiency klystron for use in the PLS-II and PAL XFEL at PAL. The basic scheme is to re-design the cavity system to include multi-cell output cavity. In this article; we report on our preliminary design work to determine major cavity parameters including cell frequencies; inter-cell distances; and coupling to external circuits (coupling beta).,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopmy027_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopmy027.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopmy027_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPMY027,557

Both resonators oscillate in phase; as their gaps are electrically connected by short bars. They are in addition magnetically coupled via the bias loop used for cavity tuning. The cavities are equipped with a wide-band feedback system; limiting the beam loading; and a further reduction of the beam induced voltage is achieved by relays which short-circuit each half-resonator gap when the cavity is not in use. Asymmetries of the beam induced voltage observed in the two half-cavities indicate that the coupling between the two resonators is not as tight as expected. The total cavity impedance coupling to the beam may be affected differently by the contributions of both resonators. A dedicated measurement campaign with high-intensity proton beam and numerical simulation have been performed to investigate the beam-cavity interaction. This paper reports the result of the study and the work aiming at the development of a model of the system; including the wide-band feedback; which reproduces this interaction.",,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopor012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopor012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopor012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPOR012,618

In this context an upgrade of the main accelerating RF system of the Proton Synchrotron (PS) is necessary; aiming at reducing the cavity impedance which is the source of longitudinal coupled-bunch oscillations. These instabilities pose as a major limitation for the increase of the beam intensity as planned after LS2. The 10 MHz RF system consists in 11 ferrite loaded cavities; driven by tube-based power amplifiers for reasons of radiation hardness. The cavity-amplifier system is equipped with a wide-band feedback that reduces the beam induced voltage. A further reduction of the beam loading is foreseen by upgrading the feedback system; which can be reasonably achieved by increasing the loop gain of the existing amplification chain. This paper describes the progress of the design of the upgraded feedback system and shows the results of the tests on the new amplifier prototype; installed in the PS during the 2015-16 technical stop.

In this paper; we present the results of the measurements performed during a dedicated campaign; of the real part of the longitudinal coupling impedance by means of the synchronous phase shift vs beam intensity. The phase shift has been measured by using two different techniques: in one case; we injected in the machine two bunches; one used as a reference with constant intensity; and the second one changing its intensity; in the second case; more conventional; we measured the bunch position with respect to the RF signal of the 40 MHz cavities.

To achieve this end; a 2.86 ms long pulsed proton beam will be accelerated up to a final energy of 2 GeV using three suites of superconducting cavities. If a Higher Order Mode (HOM) lies on a harmonic of the bunch frequency the HOM will be resonantly driven. This will dilute the beam quality significantly. Errors in fabricating these cavities are inevitable; and this sets a tolerance on how close the HOM can be within a harmonic of the bunch frequency. The baseline design for ESS requires HOMs to be at least 5 MHz from a machine line.

Normally; the phase is determined by detecting the transient field induced by the beam. In this way the phase of each cavity is checked and adjusted typically every few months. In this paper; we present another means of beam phase determination; based on higher order modes (HOMs) excited in the 2nd monopole band by the beam inside the SC cavities. A circuit model of this HOM band is also presented. Various effects on the resolution have been studied. Circuit model simulations indicate the resolution is strongly dependent on the signal to noise ratio. Preliminary experimental results; based on a broadband setup; reveal an approximately 0.1o RMS resolution. These are in good agreement with simulation results.

ipac2016,,MOPOR043,High-gradient Structures for Proton Energy Boosters,S.S. Kurennoy; L. Rybarcyk; LANL; Los Alamos; New Mexico; USA; Increasing energy of proton beam at LANSCE from 800 MeV to 3 GeV can improve radiography resolution ~10 times. The best current practice to achieve this energy boost is to employ superconducting (SC) RF cavities with gradients about 15 MV/m after the existing linac; which results in a long and expensive booster. We propose accomplishing the same with a room-sized booster based on high-gradient (100s MV/m) room-temperature RF accelerating structures operating at low duty factors. Such high-gradient (HG) structures at very high RF frequencies have been demonstrated for electrons. However; they have never been used for protons because typical RF wavelengths are smaller than the proton bunch length. This is not a problem for proton radiography (pRad): a train of very short proton bunches with the same total length (10s ps) and charge as the original proton bunch will work as well; i.e.; will create one radiography frame. Such a compact HG pRad booster can also be about an order of magnitude cheaper than the SC one. We explore feasibility of HG structures for protons and their application for a compact pRad booster at LANSCE.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopor043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopor043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopor043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPOR043,692
ipac2016,,MOPOR046,Studies on Depolarization by Synchrotron Radiation using Elegant Particle Tracking,J.F. Schmidt; W. Hillertpresenter; ELSA; Bonn; Germany; Spin dynamics in circular electron accelerators are significantly influenced by the emission of synchrotron light. In storage rings; Sokolov-Ternov polarization build-up and radiative depolarization have crucial impact on equilibrium polarization. On shorter timescales; as in damping rings or synchrotrons with fast energy ramp; the temporal development of polarization depends on spin decoherence caused by stochastic momentum changes. Thus; especially longitudinal beam dynamics affect depolarization. This contribution presents the implementation of particle tracking with synchrotron radiation from Elegant in an in-house developed spin tracking code. Exemplary results on depolarization including synchrotron radiation are shown.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopor046_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopor046.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopor046_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPOR046,695
ipac2016,,MOPOR047,Numerical and Experimental Substantiation of the Ion Density Beam Transfer Function Measurements,D. Sauerland; W. Hillert; ELSA; Bonn; Germany; In the ELSA stretcher ring electrons are accelerated to a beam energy of 3.2 GeV utilizing a fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s. Ions being generated by collision with the residual gas molecules accumulate inside the beam potential; causing incoherent tune shifts and coherent beam instabilities. Since the ion induced incoherent tune shift rises linearly with the beam neutralisation; it offers a suitable approach for evaluating the efficiency of several ion clearing measures. It was indirectly measured using a new experimental approach: By measuring the beam transfer function using a broadband transversal kicker; one was able to perceive a shift and broadening of the tune peak. Both effects could be adequately parameterized providing a quantity proportional to the incoherent tune shift and thus the average neutralisation. The impact of incoherent effects to the coherent electron beam response during the measurement has not been subject to intensive theoretical attention yet. This leaves the obtained quantity unscaled. Here new numerical simulations and experimental investigations will be presented in order to further substantiate the results of this new method.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopor047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopor047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopor047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPOR047,698

The accelerator consists of nine so-called cryo-strings. A typical cryo-string comprises 12 accelerator modules; which will be fed by three RF stations. Furthermore; the installation of electronic racks; cables; power and water supply etc. takes place. To enable a most effective installation of the accelerator components; planning and controlling methods; which had first been developed for the RF system work package; were adapted for the entire main linear accelerator. As a first step; a process plan was developed in cooperation with the work package leaders. On the basis of this plan; the installation process is promoted by several measures: The status of the installation is precisely registered by weekly queries which enable monitoring of the progress and feedback to everyone involved. With this information at hand; the installation process can be controlled and plan deviations can be corrected.

ipac2016,,MOPOW008,Reverse Undulator Tapering for Polarization Control at XFELs,E. Schneidmiller; M.V. Yurkov; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; Baseline design of a typical X-ray FEL undulator assumes a planar configuration which results in a linear polarization of the FEL radiation. However; many experiments at X-ray FEL user facilities would profit from using a circularly polarized radiation. As a cheap upgrade one can consider an installation of a short helical afterburner; but then one should have an efficient method to suppress powerful linearly polarized background from the main undulator. We describe a method for such a suppression: an application of the reverse taper in the main undulator*. In a certain range of the taper strength; the density modulation (bunching) at saturation is practically the same as in the case of non-tapered undulator while the power of linearly polarized radiation is suppressed by orders of magnitude. Then strongly modulated electron beam radiates at full power in the afterburner. The scheme was successfully tested at LCLS** and is routinely used in user experiments.

When transverse size of the electron beam significantly exceeds diffraction limit; the mode competition effect does not provide the selection of the ground mode; and spatial coherence degrades due to contribution of the higher azimuthal modes. An important consequence of this effect are fluctuations of the spot size and pointing stability of the photon beam**. These fluctuations are fundamental and originate from the shot noise in the electron beam. The effect of pointing instability becomes more pronouncing for shorter wavelengths. We analyze in detail the case of optimized SASE FEL* and derive universal dependencies applicable to all operating and planned x-ray FELs. We show that the hard x-ray FELs driven by low energy beams may exhibit poor spatial coherence and bad pointing stability.; * E.L. Saldin; E.A. Schneidmiller and M.V. Yurkov; Opt.

One of the features of this statistical object is that probability distribution of the radiation pulse energy follows gamma distribution. Parameter of this distribution is the number of modes in the radiation pulse which is equal to inverse deviation of the energy fluctuations. Statistical analysis of the radiation energies measured within different spatial apertures allows us to determine the number of longitudinal and transverse modes. In addition; knowledge of the saturation length allows to determine the duration of the lasing part of the electron bunch; photon pulse duration; and coherence time**. Knowledge of the number of transverse modes allows one to determine the degree of transverse coherence.

Two effects can contribute to the dark current: emission of electrons from ""hot"" spots in the gun; and generation of ""ghost"" bunches due to possible leakage of the photoinjector laser. MCP based photon detector has been used for measurements of radiation energy from electron bunch. For small radiation densities the light is detected by direct illumination of the MCP plate; and for large densities a small angle scattering scheme is realized when metallic mesh scatters tiny fraction of light on the MCP plate. In the present experiment we used geometry of direct illumination of MCP plate aiming detection of ""ghost"" bunches which may generate parasitically from the laser driven electron gun. Reduction of background conditions allowed us to detect light produced by electron bunches with extremely small charges; down to a few femtocoulmb.

Injector components; such as a thermionic electron gun; two buncher cavities; a S-band standing wave accelerator; S-band travelling wave accelerator and their RF sources; were relocated from the SCSS test accelerator; which was a prototype machine of SACLA. At the downstream of a bunch compressor chicane; three C-band 40 MV/m acceleration units were newly installed to effectively boost a beam energy up to 470 MeV. Two in-vacuum undulators were remodeled by changing the period of magnet array from 15 mm to 18 mm to increase SASE intensity by a larger K-value of 2.1. Beam commissioning was started in autumn 2015. So far SASE radiation at a 33 nm wavelength driven by a 470 MeV electron beam was observed. We will install the third undulator in this winter to obtain SASE saturation and additional C-band accelerator units in the next summer to raise the maximum beam energy to 750 MeV.

Usually there are dedicated matching quadrupoles distributed in the beamline; by measuring the beam phase space the matching quadrupoles are calculated and adjusted to match to the designed Twiss parameters. Further adjustment of the quadrupoles to overcome collective effects or realistic beamline errors is typically required for performance improvement.

By varying the beam energy and undulator parameter; the radiation frequency of the THz FEL amplifier can be tunable in a broad spectral range between 1.5 and 3.0 THz. Moreover; to extract more radiation power from the electron beam within a short undulator; we employ a linearly tapered undulator in our design.

Increasing the efficiency of XFELs while achieving good longitudinal coherence can be achieved via self-seeding and undulator tapering. The efficiency of self-seeded XFELs is limited by two factors: the ratio of seed power to beam energy spread and the ratio of seed power to shot noise power. We present a method to overcome these limitations by producing a strong X-ray seed and amplifying it with a small energy spread beam. This is achieved by selectively suppressing lasing for part of the bunch in the SASE section. In this manner we can saturate with the seeding electrons and amplify the strong seed with 'fresh' electrons downstream of the monochromator. Simulations of this scenario are presented for two systems; an optimal superconducting undulator design and the LCLS. In the case of the LCLS we examine how betatron oscillations leading to selective suppression are induced by using the transverse wakefield of a parallel plate dechirper.

A transverse beam slice shift reduces this alignment and spoils projected emittance and optics matching. Coherent synchrotron radiation; specifically for over-compression going through full compression; and transverse wakefields are major contributors to this. In the case of the large-bandwidth operation; with a strong energy chirp on the bunch; this misalignments furthermore reduce the spectral bandwidth of the FEL pulse. Well-defined manipulation of dispersion allows to compensate for this slice centroid shifts; therefore enhancing lasing power and in case of the large bandwidth mode; spectral bandwidth.

When a bunch travels close to one of the jaws the particles of the bunch get a transverse kick depends upon the position of a particle in a bunch. The tail particles get more kick. The transverse force also gets a nonlinear dependence on the transverse position. The stretched bunch can be measured at the YAG screen that is 100 m downstream the dechirper. The most important aspect of this measurement is that that no synchronization is needed. The Green's function for the transverse kick was evaluated based on the precise wake field calculations of the dechirper corrugated structure*.

The goal is to discover feasible optics solutions having the horizontal emittance notably lower than the present value of 3.9 nm rad; while fulfilling all the physical requirements and without changing the current magnet structure in the lattice. The strategy adopted is a cell-wise optimization of the linear lattices in the two types of double-bend cells that constitute the SOLEIL ring. In the second step they are concatenated via finer matching. A global scan of the 5 quadrupole families for the search of stable solutions is performed. The statistical properties are given. One can easily select possible solutions without matching. For the second type of cell having 10 quadrupole families; another scan of quadrupoles and a matching using a quadrupole triplet are applied for linear optics characteristics. Finally; the nonlinear optimization is performed with modern nonlinear optimization algorithms.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopow050_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopow050.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopow050_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPOW050,827

The ThomX facility is composed by a 50-70 MeV linac; a transfer line and a 18 meters long Storage Ring (SR). The Compton scattering between the 50 MeV electron bunch of 1 nC and the 30 mJ laser pulses stacked in the Fabry-Perot cavity results in the production of photons with energies (up to 90 keV) with a maximum flux of 1013 photons/s. The ThomX construction will start shortly aiming to be completed in the middle of 2017. The preparation to the SR commissioning as far as a control system and beam physics applications are concerned is progressing gradually in order to prepare and test all the tools well ahead the start of the machine. The SR commissioning will face with many challenges providing the low energy; compactness; the nonlinear beam dynamics; the limited beam storage and need for the precision and stabilization in the Interaction Region.

These studies have been recently extended to investigate whether the non-linear kicker can be located in the injection straight downstream of the septum and outside the existing dipole kicker bump. If so; injection with a non-linear kicker becomes independent of the optics used; making it suitable for use in both standard and low alpha mode. With this configuration; the existing injection scheme could also be left in place; leaving open the possibility to study both schemes in situ before potentially removing the existing dipole kickers at a later date. In order to operate with the non-linear kicker; the injected beam needs to exit the transfer line at an angle of 3mrad; this has been successfully demonstrated during machine development time.

It was developed in collaboration with CERN and put to operation at MedAustron in early 2014. The main Synchrotron RF (sRF )commissioning steps for proton beams involved the setup of the adiabatic capture process; the setup of the frequency and voltage ramps and feedback loops for fast acceleration and the RF jump for extraction. The adiabatic capture process was optimized in terms of energy and voltage mismatch by analyzing longitudinal empty bucket scans after beam injection into the synchrotron. The acceleration ramp optimization was based on calculations using a software tool developed in-house and adapted experimentally to minimize losses at injection and during acceleration.

The HESR is designed for antiprotons with a momentum range from 1.5 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c; but will as well be suitable to provide heavy ion beams with a momentum range from approximately 0.6 GeV/c to 5.8 GeV/c. To guarantee smooth operation it is crucial to verify and improve the design with beam-dynamics simulations. Particularly the dynamic aperture is calculated as a measure of quality. Complementary to previous beam dynamics calculations based on frequency map analysis*; the dynamic aperture is calculated using a variant of the Lyapunov exponent. The first bending and focusing magnets have been delivered and the magnetic fields measured recently. So the modeled assumptions regarding the multipole imperfections of these elements are now replaced by values based on measurements.

The PS Booster; the first synchrotron in the LHC injection chain; uses three different RF systems (first; second and up to tenth harmonic) in each of its four rings. As part of the LHC Injector Upgrade the current ferrite RF systems will be replaced with broadband Finemet cavities; increasing the flexibility of the RF system. A Finemet test cavity has been installed in Ring 4 to investigate its effect on machine performance; especially beam stability; during extensive experimental studies. Due to large space charge impedance Landau damping is lost through most of the cycle in single harmonic operation; but is recovered when using the second harmonic and controlled longitudinal emittance blow-up. This paper compares beam parameters during acceleration with and without the Finemet test cavity. Comparisons were made using beam measurements and simulations with the BLonD code based on a full PS Booster impedance model.

With respect to current operations; a 50% increase in beam intensity in the rapid cycling Booster synchrotron is expected. Booster batches are combined in the Recycler ring; this process limits the allowed longitudinal emittance of the extracted Booster beam. To suppress eddy currents; the Booster has no beam pipe; magnets are evacuated; exposing the beam to core laminations and this has a substantial impact on the longitudinal impedance. Noticeable longitudinal emittance growth is already observed at transition crossing. Operation at higher intensity will likely necessitate mitigation measures. We describe systematic efforts to construct a predictive model for current operating conditions.

It aims at developing a superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) LINAC with multiple CH cavities as key components downstream the upgraded High Charge Injector (HLI) at GSI. The LINAC design is challenging; due to the requirement of intense beams in cw-mode up to a mass-to-charge-ratio of 6 while covering a broad output energy range from 3.5 to 7.3 MeV/u with minimum energy spread.

The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the research program with cooled antiprotons at FAIR. This particular high frequency for an RFQ creates difficulties; which are challenging in developing a cavity. In order to define a satisfactory geometrical configuration for this resonator; both from the RF and the mechanical point of view; different designs have been examined and compared. Very promising results have been reached with a ladder type RFQ; which has been investigated since 2013.

Because the significant velocity changes in superconducting cavity at low energy section; the effective voltage is changing with cavity phase; meanwhile the synchronous phase is non-linear with LLRF phase.

As a result the non-destructive; single-shot evaluation of the profile is one of the challenging problems which can be addressed via spectral analysis of coherent radiation generated by a charged particle bunch. To reconstruct the bunch profile from the spectrum the phase retrieval problem has to be solved. Frequently applied methods; e.g. minimal phase retrieval or other iterative algorithms; are reliable if the Blaschke phase contribution is negligible. This is neither known a priori nor can it be assumed to apply to an arbitrary bunch profile. We present a novel approach which gives reproducible; most-probable and stable reconstructions for bunch profiles that would otherwise remain unresolved by the existing techniques. The algorithm proposed uses the output of Kramers-Kronig minimum phase as both initial and boundary conditions; providing a unique solution. To assure a converging solution; new conditions linked to the independently known experimental data such as beam charge were introduced.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/mopoy048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/mopoy048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/mopoy048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-MOPOY048,955

A new SPS impedance reduction campaign is planned now for the High Luminosity (HL)-LHC project; which requires bunch intensities twice as high as the nominal one. One of the known intensity limitations is a longitudinal multi-bunch instability with a threshold 3 times below this operational intensity. The instability is presently cured using the 4th harmonic RF system and controlled emittance blow-up; but reaching the HL-LHC parameters cannot be assured without improving the machine impedance. Recently the impedance sources responsible for this instability were identified and implementation of their shielding and damping is foreseen during the next long shutdown (2019 - 2020) in synergy with two other important upgrades: amorphous carbon coating of (part of) the vacuum chamber against the e-cloud effect and rearrangement of the 200 MHz RF system.

In the storage ring based Higgs factory; the vertical beta function is not so small; but the much larger circumference enlarge the detuning term especially in horizontal direction. It is very hard to optimize the dynamic aperture in the future colliders. The particle loss may comes from different cause for different energy or different transverse coupling. The design of CEPC is still in process. The construction of SuperKEKB is nearly finished; but there still exist some problem which could reduce the performance. There are a few hundred parameters to be varied in the future colliders. The global optimization may be a good way to enlarge the dynamic aperture. Differential Evolution is a very simple population based; stochastic function minimizer which is very powerful at the same time. In this paper we show some application of the algorithm in the two machines. It has the potential to help us optimize the machine.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tuoba03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tuoba03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tuoba03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUOBA03,

Twin bunches are trains of two electron bunches that are accelerated and compressed within the same accelerating RF period. At LCLS; these bunches are used in the downstream FEL undulator to generate two X-ray pulses of different energies for pump/probe applications or de novo phase determination of protein crystals. The spectral and temporal shaping of the two bunches requires exquisite control of the compression system to vary the main parameters of the system in a controlled way (peak current; temporal delay and energy separation). I will discuss recent experimental and theoretical results on this subject. In particular I will focus on the demonstration of mJ-level two-color X-ray pulses using twin bunches; as well as the temporal and spectral control of this new mode of operation.

Free-electron lasers (FELs) are particularly susceptible to MBI; which can distort the longitudinal phase space and increase the beam's slice energy spread (SES). Past studies of MBI at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) relied on optical transition radiation to infer the existence of microbunching. With the development of the x-band transverse deflecting cavity (XTCAV); we can for the first time directly image the longitudinal phase space at the end of the accelerator and complete a comprehensive study of MBI; revealing both detailed MBI behavior as well as insights into mitigation schemes [1]. The fine time resolution of the XTCAV also provides the first LCLS measurements of the final SES; a critical parameter for many advanced FEL schemes. Detailed MBI and SES measurements can aid in understanding MBI mechanisms; benchmarking simulation codes; and designing future high-brightness accelerators.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tuoca01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tuoca01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tuoca01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUOCA01,

The mechanism follows closely the RF bunching in conventional storage rings; except that the energy modulation of by an RF system at a microwave wavelength is replaced by a seeded laser in an undulator at an optical wavelength. No FEL mechanism; and thus no FEL energy heating; is invoked. The basic idea is firstly to make the beam microbunched so that its radiation becomes coherent; and secondly to make the microbunching a steady state so that the coherent radiation is maintained at every turn. The combination of the high repetition rate of a storage ring and the enhanced radiation power by a factor of N (the number of electrons in the microbunches within one coherence length) opens the possibility as well as challenges of very high power SSMB sources. To explore its potential reach; we apply SSMB to the infrared; deep ultraviolet and EUV regions and estimate their respective power levels using,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tuxb01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tuxb01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tuxb01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUXB01,

The transverse gradient of TGU is usually given by an empirical formula simply derived from the empirical formula of a uniform-parameter undulator. In this paper; we numerically investigate the transverse magnetic field of TGUs using the RADIA code. Through many simulations for TGUs with different magnet structures; we have given the dependences of transverse gradient parameter on the cant angle; the undulator period and the average gap. Based on these results; when the cant angle is small and the rate of the gap and period is in the range of 0.4-0.6; the simulation results agree with the empirical formula well. But; with the growing of the cant angle; or with the growing of the deviation of the rate of the gap and period from the range of 0.4-0.6; the difference between the simulation results and the empirical formula becomes larger.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmb011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmb011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmb011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMB011,

HTS materials have advantages over LTS materials. Magnets can be operated at 20 K or higher temperature and the cooling structure becomes simpler. Owing to a large margin in operating temperature; it is possible to excite HTS magnets by AC or pulsed currents without quenching. After successful performance tests of proto type models; two magnets have been fabricated for practical use. A cylindrical magnet generates a magnetic field higher than 3.5 T at the center to polarized 210 neV neutrons.

Despite efficient beam absorbers; several failure modes lead to some limited beam impact on superconducting magnets. Thus it is required to understand the damage mechanisms and limits of superconducting magnets due to instantaneous beam impact. This becomes even more important due to the future upgrade of CERNs injector chain for the LHC that will lead to an increase of the beam brightness. A roadmap to perform damage tests on magnet parts has been presented previously*. The polyimide insulation of the superconducting cable is identified as one of the critical elements of the magnet. In this contribution; the experimental setup to measure the insulation degradation of LHC main dipole cables due to exposure to high temperature is described. Compressed stacks of insulated Nb-Ti cables have been exposed to a heat treatment within an Argon atmosphere. After each heat treatment; high-voltage measurements verified the dielectric strength of the insulation.

An effective tool for availability tracking is a necessity to ensure a coherent capture of fault information and relevant dependencies on operational modes and beam parameters. At the beginning of LHC Run 2 in 2015; the Accelerator Fault Tracking (AFT) tool was deployed at CERN to track faults or events affecting LHC operation. Information derived from the AFT is crucial for the identification of areas to improve LHC availability; and hence LHC physics production. For the 2015 run; the AFT has been used by members of the CERN Availability Working Group; LHC Machine coordinators and equipment owners to identify the main contributors to downtime and to understand the evolution of LHC availability throughout the year.

At KEK final cold measurements of these coils were made prior to their ultimate integration with the SuperKEKB IR magnets.

ipac2016,,TUPMB042,Sweet Spot Designs for Interaction Region Septum Magnets,BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; A fundamental consideration in designing a high energy collider Interaction Region with electron beams is to avoid production of excessive experimental detector background due to synchrotron radiation. Circumventing such radiation is especially problematic with colliding beams having quite different magnetic rigidities as occurs in both electron-hadron and asymmetric-momentum electron colliders where one must shield an incoming electron beam from the strong magnetic fields needed to focus the other beam. After reviewing some magnetic configurations used to date; we introduce a new 'sweet spot' coil concept that was invented for the eRHIC project proposed at BNL. Sweet spot coils have conductors arranged so that there is an open; low field strength path through the main high field superconducting coil structure. Sweet spot configurations tend to be more efficient than other active and passive shielding solutions. Dipole and quadrupole sweet spot magnet designs examples are presented in this paper along with ongoing R&D to implement and test these concepts.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmb042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmb042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmb042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMB042,

LHC beam is inducing important heat loads along the 27 km of beam screens due to synchrotron radiations; image current and electron clouds. These dynamic heat loads disturb significantly the cryogenic plants and automatic compensations are mandatory to operate the LHC at full energy. The LHC beam screens must be maintained in an acceptable temperature range around 20 K to ensure a good beam vacuum; especially during beam injections and energy ramping where the dynamic responses of cryogenic systems cannot be managed with conventional feedback control techniques. Consequently; several control strategies such as feed-forward compensation have been developed and deployed successfully on the machine during 2015 where the beam induced heat loads are forecast in real-time to anticipate their future effects on cryogenic systems. All these developments have been first entirely modeled and simulated dynamically to be validated; allowing then a smooth deployment during the LHC operation.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmb048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmb048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmb048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMB048,

The high-current horn and stripline design has been evolving as NuMI reconfigures for higher beam power and to meet the needs of the LBNF design. The CSU particle accelerator group has aided the neutrino physics experiments at Fermilab by producing EM simulations of magnetic horns and the required high-current striplines. In this paper; we present calculations; using the Poisson and ANSYS Maxwell 3D codes; of the EM interaction of the stripline plates of the NuMI horns at critical stress points. In addition; we give the electrical simulation results using the ANSYS Electric code.

As replacement of the well established; but limited; methods we propose streaming gas for the power transfer. The conversion of the energy by a turbo generator enables using scalable power supply / HV-generator combinations. BINP SB RAS has proposed two possibilities to build the power supply in a modular way. In the first proposal; two cascade transformers per module should be used; the first one powers 22 small HV-solenoids; the second one generates the voltage. In order to reach the final voltage; the modules are cascaded. The cascade transformers are fed by a turbo generator; which is driven by pressurised gas. The second possibility is to use two big HV-solenoids; which are powered directly by a turbo generator. The voltage could be generated for example with a Cockcroft Walton generator. A potential candidate is the Green Energy Turbine (GET) from the company DEPRAG; Germany. At the Helmholtz-Institut Mainz; two GET were tested.

To mitigate luminosity limitations arising from intra-beam scattering at such low energies; an electron cooling system is being developed. To achieve cooling; the relative velocities of the electrons and protons need to be small with maximized transverse overlap. Recombination rates of ions with electrons in the electron cooler can provide signals that can be used to tune the energies and transverse overlap to the required conditions.

Discharge for producing plasma consists of the both ion current from plasma towards the cathode and the secondary electron current from the cathode to the plasma. Secondary electron emission is the result of ion collision on the surface of the cathode. Heat generated by these collisions is considerably high; so a cooling system for ion source is crucial.

Beams of rare isotopes are produced and separated in-flight at the NSCL Coupled Cyclotron Facility and subsequently stopped in a gas cell. The rare isotopes are then continuously extracted as 1+ (or 2+) ions and transported into a beam cooler and buncher; followed by a charge breeder based on an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT). In the charge breeder; the ions are ionized to a charge state suitable for acceleration in the superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) linac; extracted in a pulsed mode and mass analyzed. The extracted beam is bunched to 80.5 MHz and then accelerated to energies ranging from 300 keV/u up to 6 MeV/u; depending on their charge-to-mass ratio. Alternatively; stable isotope ions can be accelerated injecting stable gas in the EBIT. ReA3 was commissioned recently with stable 40Ar and 39K as well as with the rare isotope beams of 46Ar and 46K. This contribution will focus on the properties and techniques used to accelerate and transport rare isotope beams and will show results obtained during the preparation of the two first experiments using the ReA facility.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmr024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmr024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmr024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMR024,

The primary proton beam (60 - 120 GeV) will be extracted from the MI-10 section of Fermilab's Main Injector. Neutrinos are produced after the protons hit a solid target and produce mesons which are subsequently focused by magnetic horns into a 194 m long decay pipe where they decay into muons and neutrinos. The parameters of the facility were determined taking into account the physics goals; spacial and radiological constraints and the experience gained by operating the NuMI facility at Fermilab.

In this study; we examine systematic errors that can arise from correlations between muon spin and transverse coordinates for the new g-2 experiment.

An EBIS employs a magnetically compressed; high energy and density electron beam to sequentially ionize atoms or ions with a low charge state*. At KOMAC; we have a compact room-temperature operated EBIS. It is additionally constructed with a magnetic mass spectrometer and a Faraday Cup to measure charge spectra. Using this measurement setup; preliminary tests are performed to find suitable operational potentials in the EBIS for a stable production of highly charge ions.

In cases where the beam is chopped; the neutralization pattern changes throughout the beginning of the pulse; causing the Twiss parameters to differ significantly from their steady state values; which; in turn; may result in beam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance; there is an alternative solution; in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT that contains the chopper. The emittance can be nearly preserved if the transition to the un-neutralized section occurs where the beam exhibits low transverse tails.

The MedAustron synchrotron uses a betatron core driven slow extraction scheme based on a third order resonance. The commissioning of the extraction from the synchrotron involved the setup of the correct orbit and optics at flattop. In order to maximize the momentum spread before extraction and optimize spill structure the RF system enforces a so called RF-phase jump to the unstable phase. Different scenarios were simulated using MADX-PTC [1] in combination with Python to overcome the static nature of PTC. Simulations have shown that the initial phase of the beam and a finite time to jump to the unstable fix point have a strong impact on the performance. Using a high frequency intensity monitor in the extraction channel (QIM); the spill structure was analysed and used for optimization.

Since confirmed the large leakage field around current circling beam line of the injection magnet; we must improve the shielding structure which make low leakage field. We started the development of the new injection septum magnet and its power supply in 2013. It can operate with 1 Hz repetition and the low leakage field which its order is 10-4 of the gap field.

One important way is to reduce the repetition period from 2.48 s to 1.3 s so that the beam power can be nearly doubled. We need to improve the septum magnets for fast extraction. We are improving the magnets and their power supplies. The present magnets which is conventional type have problem in durability of septum coil by its vibration; and large leakage field. The new magnets are eddy current type. The eddy current type does not have septum coil; but has a thin plate. We expect that there is no problem in durability; we can construct the thin septum plate; the leakage field can be reduced. The output of the present power supply are pattern current which of flat top is 10 ms width; the new one is short pulse which of one is 10 us. The short pulse consists of 1st and 3rd higher harmonic. We can expect that the flatness and reproducibility of flat top current can be improved. The calorific power can be also reduced. This paper will report the field measurement results with the eddy septum magnet systems.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmr040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmr040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmr040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMR040,

It can provide proton beam with the maximum energy of 200 MeV. The accelerator facility of XiPAF mainly contains a 7 MeV H− linac injector and a proton synchrotron accelerator. The 7 MeV H− linac injector is composed of an ECR ion source; a Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT); a Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator (RFQ) and a Drift Tube Linac (DTL). The 50 keV 10 mA H− beam (pulse width 1ms) extracted from the ion source is expected to be symmetric with the Twiss parameters alpha=0 and β=0.065 mm/mrad. The RMS normalized emittance is required to be less than 0.2 π mm·mrad. With an adjustable collimator and an electric chopper in the 1.7 m-long LEBT; the beam pulse width of 10~40μs and peak current of 6 mA can be obtained.

After extraction from each ring; the bunches are recombined in two stages; comprising septum and kicker systems; such that the accumulated bunch train is injected through a single line into the PS. Bunches from the four rings go through a different number of vertical bends; which leads to differences in the betatron and dispersion functions due to edge focussing. The fast pulsed systems at PSB extraction; recombination and PS injection lead to systematic errors of delivery precision at the injection point. These error sources are quantified in terms of emittance growth and particle loss.

Two extended straight sections (ESS) are dedicated to beam dumping system and collimation. The beam dumping system will fast-extract the beam and transport it to an external absorber; while the collimation system will protect the superconducting accelerator components installed further downstream. The high stored beam energy of about 8.5 GJ per beam means that machine protection considerations will severely constrain the functional design of the ESS and the beam dump line geometry; in addition to dominating the performance specifications of the main sub-systems like kickers and absorber blocks.

One technically challenging option under consideration is the addition of fast Pulse Forming Lines in parallel to the existing Pulse Forming Networks for the 12 kicker magnets MKP-S; targeting a system field rise time of 100 ns. An alternative option is to optimise the system to approach the existing individual magnet field rise time (2-98%) of 150 ns. This would still significantly increase the number of colliding bunches in LHC while minimising the cost and effort of the system upgrade. The observed characteristics of the present system are described; compared to the expected system rise time; together with results of simulations and measurements with 175 and 150 ns injection batch spacing.

Different schemes of an injection for LIU beams into the PS have been outlined in the past already under the aspect of individual transfer kicker rise and fall time performances. Homogeneous rise and fall time requirements in the whole PSB to PS transfer chain have been established which allowed to consider an upgrade option of the present injection kicker system operated in short circuit mode. The challenging pulse quality constraints require an improvement of the flat top and post pulse ripples. Both operation modes; terminated and short circuit mode are analysed and analogue circuit simulations for the present and upgraded system are outlined. Recent measurements on the installed kickers are presented and analysed together with the simulation data.

The beam stoppers are used for setting up the SPS extractions and transfer lines with beam without having to inject into the LHC.

ipac2016,,TUPMR051,New Spill Control for the Slow Extraction in the Multi-Cycling SPS,V. Kain; K. Cornelis; E. Effinger; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The flux of particles slow extracted with the 1/3 integer resonance from the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN was previously controlled with a servo-spill feedback system which acted on the horizontal tune such as to keep the spill rate as constant as possible during the whole extraction time. The current in two servo-quadrupoles was modulated as a function of the difference between the measured and the desired spill rate. With servo quadrupoles at a single location in the SPS ring and the SPS in multi-cycling mode; the trajectory of the slow extracted beam was seen to change from cycle to cycle depending on the current applied by the servo feedback. Hence this system was replaced by a feed-forward tune correction using the main SPS quadrupoles. In this way the spill control can now be guaranteed without changing the trajectory of the extracted beam. This paper presents the algorithm and implementation in the control system and summarizes the advantages of the new approach. The obtained spill characteristics will be discussed. The technique implemented for the additional reduction of the 50 Hz noise on the spill structure will also be briefly outlined.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmr051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmr051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmr051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMR051,

The main topic at this facility is aimed to heavy ion research. The FAIR project in comparison to the existing facility GSI extends the research area by raising the energy of ion beams. After creation of the ion beam at the ion source the state charge is low. Therefor the demand for acceleration of the beam to the highest possible energy is a highly ionized charge state of the beam. For beam stripping to get higher charge state; the traditional tools are gas stripper and foil stripper [1; 2]. Hence Plasma is suggested to be a stripper medium. In Frankfurt are different kinds of Pinch Plasmas under investigation for Stripper. The constricting effect on the plasma or conductor is produced by the magnetic field pressure resulting from the current or by the Lorentz force produced by the current flowing in its own magnetic field.

A significant fraction of the power dissipated in ultra-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions is carried by ions from bound-free pair production; which are lost in the dispersion suppressors adjacent to the experimental insertions. At higher luminosities; these ions risk to quench superconducting magnets and might limit their operation due to the dynamic heat load that needs to be evacuated by the cryogenic system. In this paper; we estimate the power deposition in superconducting coils and the magnet cold mass and we quantify the achievable reduction by deviating losses to less sensitive locations or by installing collimators at strategic positions.

Luminosity can therefore be used to quantify the impact of beam-beam interactions on the beam lifetimes and emittances. The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project aims to reach higher luminosities; approximately a factor of 7 larger than the nominal LHC at peak luminosity without crab cavities. Higher luminosities are achieved by increasing the bunch populations and reducing the transverse beam sizes. This results in stronger beam-beam effects. Here the LHC luminosity and beam intensity decay rates are analysed as a function of reducing beam separation with the aim of characterising the impact of beam-beam effects on the luminosity and beam lifetime. The analysis and results are discussed with possible application to the HL-LHC upgrade.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmw007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmw007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmw007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMW007,

While the emittance damping due to synchrotron radiation is still slower than in past or existing lepton colliders; it is significantly larger than in other hadron colliders. The slow reduction of the emittance is profitable for higher luminosity in term of transverse beam size at the interaction points and also to mitigate long-range beam-beam effects; potentially allowing for a reduction of the crossing angle between the beams during the operation. In such conditions; the strength of head-on beam-beam interactions increases; potentially limiting the beam brightness. 4D weak-strong and strong-strong simulations are performed in order to assess these limitations.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmw009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmw009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmw009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMW009,

For current LHC operation where the beam optics is fixed during periods of colliding beam; mainly ground motion induced perturbations have to be compensated. The situation will become significantly more complex when luminosity leveling will be applied following the LHC luminosity upgrades. During β* leveling the optics in the interaction region changes significantly; feed-downs from quadrupole misalignment may induce significant orbit changes that may lead to beam offsets at the collision points. Such beam offsets induce a loss of luminosity and reduce the stability margins for collective effects that is provided by head-on beam-beam. It is therefore essential that the beam offsets at the collision points are minimized during the leveling process. This paper will review sources and mitigation techniques for the orbit perturbation at the collision points during β* leveling; and present results of experiments performed at the LHC to mitigate and compensate such offsets.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmw012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmw012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmw012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMW012,

The code is used for the tracking of beam halo particles and the simulation of their interaction with the collimators to study the efficiency of the LHC collimation system. Tracking simulations for heavy-ion beams require taking into account the mass to charge ratio of each particle because heavy ions can be subject to fragmentation at their passage through the collimators. In this paper we present the derivation of a Hamiltonian for multi-isotopic heavy-ion beams and symplectic tracking maps derived from it.

It is based on 14 Roman Pots (RPs); designed to host tracking and time-of-flight detectors for measuring the kinematics of leading protons. To reach the physics goals; the RPs will finally have to approach the beams to distances of 15 beam σs (i.e. ~1.5 mm) or closer. After problems with showers and impedance heating in first high-luminosity RP insertions in 2012; the LS1 of LHC was used for upgrades in view of impedance minimisation and for adding new collimators to intercept RP-induced showers. In 2015 the effectiveness of these improvements was shown by successfully inserting the RPs in all LHC beam intensity steps to a first-phase distance of ~25 σs. This contribution reviews the measurements of debris showers and impedance effects; i.e. the data from Beam Loss Monitors; beam vacuum gauges and temperature sensors. The dependences of the observables on the luminosity are shown. Extrapolations to L=1034 cm-2 s-1 and smaller distances to the beam do not indicate any fundamental problems.

Indeed much higher rates were observed in 2015 compared to Run 1; and about 20 fills were prematurely terminated by too high losses caused by such events.

When the current is stable at low field; the harmonic components of the main circuits are subject to a dynamic variation induced by current redistribution on the superconducting cables. The Field Description of the LHC (FiDel) foresaw an increase of the decay at injection of tune (quadrupolar components) and chromaticity (sextupolar components) of about 50% with respect to LHC Run1 due to the higher operational current. This paper discusses the beam-based measurements of the decay during the injection plateau and the implementation and accuracy of the feed-forward corrections as present in 2015.

This beam power is about 70 times greater than that contained in the luminosity debris and is focussed on a specific location. As long foreseen; orbit bumps were introduced in the dispersion suppressors around the highest luminosity experiments to mitigate the risk by displacing and spreading out these losses.

This results in tune and chromaticity variations for the beams. In the first few seconds of the ramp the original hysteresis state of the magnetic field is restored - the field snaps back. These fast dynamic field changes lead to strong tune and chromaticity excursions that; if not properly controlled; induce beam losses and potentially trigger a beam dump. A feed-forward system applies predicted corrections during the injection plateau and to the first part of the ramp to avoid violent changes of beam conditions. This paper discusses the snapback of tune and chromaticity as observed in 2015; as well as the control of beam parameters during the ramp. It also evaluates the quality of the applied feed-forward corrections and their reproducibility.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmw029_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmw029.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmw029_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMW029,

Since Run 1; studies have been carried out to investigate the feasibility of combining the two operations; thus considerably reducing the duration of the operational cycle. In Run 2; the LHC is operating at the energy of 6.5 TeV that requires a much longer cycle than that of Run 1. Therefore; the performance gains from a Combined Ramp and Squeeze (CRS) is more interesting. Merging the energy ramp and the betatron squeeze could result in a gain of several minutes for each LHC cycle. With increasing maturity of LHC operation; it is now possible to envisage more complex beam manipulations; this paper describes the first machine experiment with beam; aiming at validating the combination of ramp and squeeze; which was performed in 2015; during a machine development phase.

However; the large initial energy spread of the muon beam greatly limits the efficiency of muon applications. In this paper we outline a phase rotation method to significantly increase the intensity of low-energy muons. The muons are first produced by a short pulsed proton driver; and after a drift channel they form a time-momentum correlation. A series of rf cavities is used to bunch the muons and then phase rotate the bunches so that all the bunches reaches a momentum around 100 MeV/c. Then another group of rf cavities is used to decelerate the muon bunches to low-energy. Such a method produces low-energy muons with an efficiency of 0.1 muon per 8 GeV proton; which is significantly higher than the current Mu2e experiment at Fermilab; and it provides the possibility for the next generation rare decay researches.,,D.V. Neufferpresenter reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmy008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmy008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmy008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMY008,

Simulation codes: G4beamline; MAD-X; and MCNP; more coming. Many accelerator design tools and beam optics codes were written long ago; with primitive user interfaces by today's standards. MuSim is specifically designed to make it easy to interface to such codes; providing a common user experience for all; and permitting the construction and exploration of models with very little overhead.

It can determine high-order transfer maps of combinations of particle optical elements of arbitrary field configurations. New features are being developed for inclusion in COSY to follow the distribution of charged particles through matter. To study in detail some of the properties of muons passing through material; the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map–Monte Carlo approach in which transfer map methods describe the deterministic behavior of the particles in the accelerator channel; and Monte Carlo methods are used to model the stochastic processes intrinsic to liquid and solid absorbers. The advantage of the new approach is that the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects. The gains in speed are expected to simplify the optimization of muon cooling channels which are usually very computationally demanding.

ipac2016,,TUPMY014,Muon Acceleration Concepts for Future Neutrino Factory,JLab; Newport News; Virgina; USA; Here; we summarize current state of concept for muon acceleration aimed at future Neutrino Factory. The main thrust of these studies was to reduce the overall cost while maintaining performance through exploring interplay between complexity of the cooling systems and the acceptance of the accelerator complex. To ensure adequate survival of the short-lived muons; acceleration must occur at high average gradient. The need for large transverse and longitudinal acceptances drives the design of the acceleration system to initially low RF frequency; e.g. 325 MHz; and then increased to 650 MHz; as the transverse size shrinks with increasing energy. High-gradient normal conducting RF cavities at these frequencies require extremely high peak-power RF sources. Hence superconducting RF (SRF) cavities are chosen. Here; we considered two cost effective schemes for accelerating muon beams for a stagable Neutrino Factory: Exploration of the so-called 'dual-use' linac concept; where the same linac structure is used for acceleration of both H− and muons and alternatively; the SRF efficient design based on multi-pass (4.5) 'dogbone' RLA; extendable to multi-pass FFAG-like arcs.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmy014_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmy014.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmy014_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMY014,

Using such pulses for electron acceleration offers advantages in terms of higher thresholds for materials breakdown; thus introducing a promising path towards increasing acceleration gradients. Conventional accelerator technology is based on either continuous wave or long pulse operation; where resonant or guiding structures are usually employed. We introduce novel structures for electron acceleration which operate with single-cycle pulses named as single-cycle ultrafast guns. The operating frequencies considered here are at THz wavelengths inspired by the recent progress in the optical generation of intense single-cycle THz pulses. We begin with designing guns for low energy pulses and proceed with structures designed for high energy pulses. More importantly; it is shown that the already achieved THz pulse energies of 20 uJ are enough to realize relativistic fields for electron acceleration. These structures will underpin future devices for fabricating miniaturized electron guns and linear accelerators.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupmy015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupmy015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupmy015_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPMY015,

Pyroelectric crystals can provide electrostatic fields of sufficient magnitude and uniformity to enable emission and acceleration.

We consider structures which consist of thin conducting parallel wires. It is assumed that the structure period is much less than the typical wavelength under consideration. Therefore the influence of the structure on the electromagnetic field can be described with help of the averaged boundary conditions**. We consider radiation of bunches which move along the grid but transversely to wires. Unlike previous works the bunch is assumed to have essential transversal dimensions along with definite longitudinal charge distribution. In particular we analyze the effect of reflection of the surface wave from the structure edge. For all considered situations; analytical and numerical results demonstrate that analysis of the surface waves allows estimating the size and the shape of the bunch.; * A.V. Tyukhtin et al.; Phys.

Many improvements are already foreseen in the frame of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project; but probably this intensity would still not be reachable in the SPS due to longitudinal instabilities. Recently a lot of effort went into finding the impedance sources of the instabilities. Particle simulations based on the latest SPS impedance model are now able to reproduce the measured instability thresholds and were used to determine the most critical impedance sources by removing them one by one from the model. It was found that impedance of vacuum flanges and of the already damped 630 MHz HOM of the main RF system gave for 72 bunches the comparable intensity thresholds. Possible intensity gains are defined for realistic impedance modifications and for various beam configurations (number of bunches; longitudinal emittances) and RF programs (single and double RF).

Recently we have developed and implemented a Vlasov solver* to calculate microbunching gain for an arbitrary beamline lattice design; based on the extension of early theoretical formulation** for the microbunching amplification from an initial density perturbation to the final density modulation. For more thorough analyses; in addition to the case of (initial) density to (final) density amplification; we in this paper extend the previous formulation to more general cases; including energy-to-density; density-to-energy and energy-to-energy amplifications for a recirculation machine. Such semi-analytical formulae are then incorporated into our Vlasov solver; and reasonable agreement is obtained when the semi-analytical results are benchmarked with particle tracking simulation using ELEGANT***.; * C.Y.

Since installation; these devices have been the source of strong beam instabilities. These instabilities seem to behave as trapped resonant modes of very high Q and high frequency; although a definite source has not been identified. The presence of these instabilities has necessitated operating at unusually high chromaticity for much of the light source's operations. More recently transverse feedback has been able to control the instabilities and recent developments in diagnostics have allowed some investigation of the frequency and mode response of these resonances.

In particular recirculating machines and Energy Recovery Linacs have to deal with that problem. Therefore; it is important to find strategies for increasing the threshold currents of these machines. The superconducting accelerator S-DALINAC at the Technische Universität Darmstadt provides electron beams in c.w. for nuclear physics experiments since 1991. It consists of a 10 MeV injector and a 40 MeV main linac where two and eight 20-cell elliptical 3-GHz cavities are operated in a liquid helium bath at 2 K. Using two recirculation beam lines the main accelerator can be used up to 3 times. Operational experiences have shown that the design-beam current of 20 μA could not be reached. One reason is the occurrence of BBU. We will report on measurements of the threshold current at various energy settings of the S-DALINAC. The results of a first test to increase the BBU limit by using skew quadrupole magnets in the first recirculation beam line will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupor025_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupor025.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupor025_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPOR025,

Due to a reduced quality factor of its cavities in comparison to their design values it was not possible to operate the accelerator with its maximum design energy of 130 MeV in cw mode. To provide electron beams of this energy in the future it was decided to add one recirculation beam line in order to use the main linac four times; operating the cavities on decreased accelerating gradients. The necessary modifications consist of several different aspects: A new beamline needs to be installed and other pre-existing beam line sections have to be modified for matching new boundary conditions. These new conditions are mainly a result of beam dynamics simulations and of the design of a new separation dipole magnet; which will bend the different beams energy-dependent in the various recirculation beam lines. We will present the implemented design and give a status report on the project.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupor026_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupor026.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupor026_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPOR026,

This paper shows; that the common way of using exponential fits to determine damping rates is not viable for high modulation amplitudes. It presents a new method; which is capable of acquiring damping rates of coupled-bunch modes for phase shifts up to 5°; using a bunch-by-bunch feedback system. For this purpose a specific mode is excited by the feedback system and the saturation value; i.e. the maximum excitation; is measured to calculate the damping rate. With this new method; the modulation amplitude of the RF phase modulation is swept from 0° to 5° and it can be shown; that the damping rate is proportional to the square of the modulation amplitude.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupor027_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupor027.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupor027_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPOR027,

It develops within a hundred turns and; in certain conditions; may lead to a beam loss. Various peculiar features of the instability: its occurrence only above a certain intensity threshold; and only in horizontal plane; as well as the rate of the instability; suggest that its cause is electron cloud. We studied the phenomena by observing the dynamics of stable and unstable beam. We found that beam motion can be stabilized by a clearing bunch; which confirms the electron cloud nature of the instability. The findings suggest electron cloud trapping in Recycler combined function mag-nets. Bunch-by-bunch measurements of betatron tune show a tune shift towards the end of the bunch train and allow the estimation of the density of electron cloud and the rate of its build-up. The experimental results are in agreement with numerical simulations of electron cloud build-up and its interaction with the beam.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupor029_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupor029.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupor029_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPOR029,

This classical approach is not efficient and not compatible to the beam dynamics nature. 6D phase-space rotation; e.g. z-x and x-y; gives a way to optimize the phase space distribution for various applications. In this article; we discus possible applications of the 6D phase space rotation. The x-y rotation generates the high aspect ratio beam for linear colliders directly without DR (Damping Ring).

The electron beam with an average current more than 100 μA is transported to an electron-bremsstrahlung gamma-ray converter of 2 mm thickness platinum or tungsten plate at the irradiation station. A target of 10 mm diameter is placed 3 cm behind a converter. It is enclosed with a quartz glass in the water cooling system and is irradiated for photonuclear reaction. Since the correlation between the spatial profile of bremsstrahlung gamma-rays at the target position and accelerator parameters is of our primary interest; nickel thin films are irradiated and the profiles of bremsstrahlung gamma-rays are measured by intensity distribution measurements of 57Ni radioactivity using the phosphorus imaging plate.

Different from conventional positron sources used in positron annihilation techniques; the planned positron source will be a positron production linac; similar to positron injectors used in colliders. To compress the positron pulse; the bombarding electron beam comes from a short bunch photo-injector. A computer simulation was performed using EGS4 and PARMELA code. The bombarding electron bunch is 300pC; with an energy of 30MeV. Simulations results showed that it is reasonable to expect a beam of more than 105 positrons per pulse for future positron annihilation studies.

A new 4-GeV continuous wave (CW) superconducting (SC) L-band linac is being built to provide an electron bunch rate of up to 1 MHz; with bunches rapidly switched between two FEL undulators. It is desirable to provide peak current (i.e.; pulse length) control in each FEL independently by varying the RF phase (chirp) prior to the first bunch compressor. However; the high-Q; SCRF; with its 1-ms fill-time; cannot be changed within one bunch spacing (1 us). So to provide a small chirp adjustment from bunch to bunch; we propose a short CW copper RF accelerating cavity; located just after the injector; with < 250-ns fill-time designed to adjust the beam chirp at zero-crossing phase. We examined RF cavity designs spanning RF frequencies from L-band to X-band. We considered both SW and TW structures. We found an optimal solution with 2 cm iris diameter; SW RF cavity; operating at C-band with input power of only 10 kW. If one can afford to operate with smaller diameter; from a wakefield point of view; then similar structure at X-band may require only 500 W with 5 mm iris diameter.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupow030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupow030.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupow030_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPOW030,

At BERLinPro bunch compression and decompression can be done in two stages in the injector and main arcs. Starting with different bunch lengths from the gun the distribution of compression between these two stages is subject to optimization. Simulations show that the length and shape of the bunch in the injector and before the linac are the limiting factors for minimal bunch length. Injector simulations have to consider space charge effects; whereas CSR effects are limiting compression in the arcs. The strength of these effects and optimal compression ratios changes with different bunch charges. Optimization and simulation tools have to be chosen according to the energy regime and dominant collective effects.

After the beam commissioning in December 2013; the legal current limit has been increased step-by-step like 1 uA; 10 uA; and 100 uA. Survey for the source of beam losses has been conducted in each step; and the study on beam dynamics and tuning has also been carried out. As a next step; 1 mA operation is scheduled in February 2016. In parallel to the increase in beam current; a laser Compton scattering (LCS) system which can provide high-flux X-ray to a beamline has been successfully commissioned.

The cERL comprises a 5 MeV injector; a main linac; and a recirculation loop. In the cERL; production and transportation of low-emittance and high average-current beams (tentative goals: 1 mm-mrad and 10 mA) is primarily important. At this moment (in December 2015); beam currents of up to 80 uA (CW) have successfully been transported through the recirculation loop at a beam energy of 20 MeV. Before such high-current operations; we carefully tuned up the machine so that beam losses became very small. The beam losses were watched using fast beam-loss detectors and radiation monitors while absolute losses were estimated from measured radiation levels on the roof of the shield. After careful beam-optics corrections and elimination of beam halos / tails at low-energy section; we achieved the beam losses of at most a few nA level at several locations along the loop; and those below 1 nA elsewhere in the loop. We will report these results together with the result of higher-current operation which is planned early in 2016.; * S.

We believe that beam halo makes a significant impact into the beam loss. Therefore; we are performing beam loss simulations to meet the results of the beam loss measurements*. In particular; a simulation of the bunch tail originated from the electron gun was performed to understand the mechanisms of the beam halo formation. Since some measured beam profiles demonstrated unexpected halo particles; several factors such as misalignment of beam line elements and kicks from the steering coils were added into the simulation.

At this stage the highest current; from the SRF ERL; is around 300 mA. A single turn (the beam will be transported through the accelerating section; interaction point and deceleration section of the AERL only once) Asymmetric Energy Recovery LINAC (AERL) is proposed. The RF cells in different sections of the cavity are tuned in such a way that only operating mode is uniform inside all of the cells. The AERL will drive the electron beams with typical energies of 10 - 30 MeV and peak currents above 1 A; enabling the generation of high flux UV/X-rays and high power coherent THz radiation. We aim to build a copper prototype of the RF cavity for a compact AERL to study its EM properties. The final goal is to build AERL based on the superconducting RF cavity. Preliminary design for AERL's cavity has been developed and will be presented.

Our pipe was copper and was 5 cm long; the aperture was cylindrically symmetric; with a 1 mm (radius) bore and a corrugation depth (peak-to-peak) of 60 um. In the experiment we measured both the effect on the beam of the structure wakefield and the spectral properties of the radiation excited by the beam. We began by injecting a relatively long beam–-compared to the wavelength of the radiation–-to excite the structure; and then used a downstream spectrometer to infer the radiation wavelength. This was followed by injecting a shorter bunch; and then using an interferometer (also downstream of the corrugated pipe) to measure the spectrum of the induced THz radiation. Our experimental set-up was simple and not optimized for the efficient collection of the radiation by e.g. the use of tapered horns.

Radioisotopes have a wide range of uses in medicine; and recent disruption to the supply chain has seen a renewed effort to find alternative isotopes and production methods. The design features separate sector magnets with non-scaling; non-linear field gradients but without the counter bends commonly found in FFAG's. The machine is isochronous at the level of 0.3% up to at least 28 MeV and hence able to operate in Continuous Wave (CW) mode. Both protons and helium ions can be used with this design and it has been demonstrated that proton beams with currents of up to 20 mA can be accelerated. An interesting option for the production of radioisotopes is the use of a thin internal target. We have shown that this design has large acceptance; ideal for allowing the beam to be recirculated through the target many times; the lost energy being restored on each cycle.

These work by slowing the speed of an EM wave to match the velocity of a particle beam; allowing wave-beam interactions; accelerating the beam. However conventional dielectric materials have limited interaction regions; so wave-beam energy transfer is minimal. In this paper we consider Artificial Materials (AMs); as slow wave structures; in the presence of charged particle beams to engineer Inverse-Cherenkov acceleration. AMs are periodic constructs whose properties depend on their subwavelength geometry rather than their material composition; and can be engineered to give an arbitrary dispersion relation. We show that Metamaterials; one example of an AM; can mediate an Inverse-Cherenkov interaction; but break down in high power environments due to high absorption. We consider AMs with low constitutive parameters and show they can exhibit low absorption whilst maintaining the ability to have a user defined dispersion relation; and mediate a wavebeam interaction leading to Inverse-Cherenkov acceleration.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/tupoy024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/tupoy024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/tupoy024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUPOY024,

Mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid is generally used in the electropolishing of Nb. But this solution is very dangerous and because the corrosion of the metal occurs by hydrofluoric acid; all equipment must be made of high density polyethylene or fluorocarbon resin. This causes the expensive cost of electropolishing instrument. In addition; this solution produces sulfur compound on the Nb surface in the electropolishing reaction. This sulfur compound can be field emission sources on the inner surface of cavity and degrades acceleration performance. In this poster; we report noble electropolishing method using periodic reverse current and sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction produces no sulfur content and the equipment is less expensive because the instrument can be made of usual plastic material.

The larger the horizontal emittance of the injected beam the larger the acceptance of the ring has to be. The injected beam is usually delivered by a synchrotron. In case the vertical acceptance of the ring is sufficiently large one can take advantage of the small vertical emittance reached in well aligned and tuned synchrotrons since the transverse emit-tances can be exchanged with the help of skew quadru-pole magnets. A few possible processes will be discussed: emittance exchange with static magnets in the transfer line between synchrotron and ring or emittance exchange in the synchrotron shortly before extraction with time dependent magnets.

In this paper; we propose a longitudinal on-axis injection scheme; which is based on a double-frequency RF system and in- dependently adjustment of the RF phase of each cavity to enable RF gymnastics. Such a scheme looks feasible with the state-of-art technology of fast injection kicker. Compari- son with other on-axis injection schemes is also discussed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/weoaa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/weoaa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/weoaa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEOAA02,

Further; we have made a systematic study to characterize the optical vortex from a helical undulator at UVSOR-III. Synchrotron radiation in UV region from an optical klystron undulator system consisting of two APPLE-II helical undulators and a buncher was used for the experiment. Patterns resulting from inferences between two undulator radiation carrying different angular momentums were clearly observed. To investigate the optical properties of the radiation; diffraction experiments were carried out. Specific diffraction patterns due to the phase singularity in the radiation center were clearly observed. The experimental results are compared with simulation.; * S. Sasaki; I. McNulty; Phys. Rev.

Except for 0.5 MeV/u RFQ; the linac is making use of superconducting (SC) RF technology. The beam power; which is an order of 2.5 as high as those of existing SC heavy ion linac; gives rise to many technical challenges as well as beam physics related ones. In particular; the uranium beam loss power density is approximately 30 times as high as the proton one with the same beam energy per nucleon and the same beam power. For this reason; the machine protection system needs a special care. Another example of the technical challenges is to install beam focusing solenoid as close as possible to SC cavities in order to ensure the frequent beam focusing both longitudinally and transversely.

The first two months of beam operation were dedicated to setting up the nominal cycle for proton-proton operation at 6.5 TeV/beam; and culminated with the first physics with 3 nominal bunches/ring at 13 TeV CoM on 3 June. The year continued with a stepwise intensity ramp up that allowed reaching 2244 bunches/ring for a peak luminosity of ~5·1033 cm-2s−1 and a total of just above 4 fb-1 delivered to the high luminosity experiments. Beam operation was shaped by the high intensity effects; e.g. electron cloud and macroparticle-induced fast losses (UFOs); which on a few occasions caused the first beam induced quenches at high energy.

One factor that leads to emittance growth is transverse wakefields in the accelerating structures. In order to combat this the structures must be aligned with a precision of a few um. For achieving this tolerance; accelerating structures are equipped with wakefield monitors that measure higher-order dipole modes excited by the beam when offset from the structure axis.

At the comparatively initial stage of the mass production; the error estimation in the cavity performance tests was done for understanding how precisely those measurements are done at AMTF (Accelerator Module Test Facility). There are two parameters for the error estimation in V.T. One is the cable calibration parameter; and the other is the external Q-value; which is related to the power emitted from cavity. The measurement precision in the external Q-value depends on the measurement of coupling coefficient (β) strongly. Therefore; it is essential not to miss the β measurement for the precise measurement in V.T. On the other hand; as for C.T.; the change of parameter (Kt); which is related to the evaluation of accelerating gradient; was used. As the result of the data analysis for Kt; the error was estimated to be 6%; and is related to the cavity performance degradation from V.T. to C.T.

After cooldown; the cavity conditioning; which is the main part in the performance test; is done by monitoring the radiation level measured at three locations around the cryomodule; and the heating and RF output at two HOM (Higher Order Mode) couplers. Consequently; it became clear the average accelerating gradient is 30 MV/m for STF-2 cryomodule (39 MV/m at max. and 15 MV/m at min.); and the second cavity string with four cavities had the significant performance degradation by heavy field emission due to the additional clean room work in the STF tunnel.

The waveguide and klystron type beam pre-modulation schemes was proposed *; ** to growth capturing and to limit the energy spectrum of 2-3 % for 200-300 MeV beam. One interesting effect was detected due to numerical simulation of beam dynamics in plasma channel. Not captured electrons are escape to the channel border fast and this effect should be explained. It was shown that such effect is caused by effective potential function which forms very high defocusing transverse field after its trailing edge.

The superconducting Spoke cavities are considered compact structures at low frequencies and having an excellent RF performance in both low and medium velocity regimes; therefore ESS will include a total of 26 double-spoke cavities. The testing of the double-spoke prototype cavity at high power has been conceded to Uppsala University; Sweden; where the Facility for Research Instrumentation and Accelerator development (FREIA) has been equipped with superconducting cavity test facility. A bare spoke cavity has been tested at the FREIA Laboratory with a self-exited loop at low power level to confirm its vertical test performance at IPNO.

The bunch length is about 3 mm at designed beam current of 500 mA and operating gap voltage of 3.2 MV. The short bunch length results in short Touschek lifetime and high parasitic loss of insertion device (ID). Some of the undulators are operated in vacuum at TPS; therefore the head load become an important issue. To install higher harmonic cavity is a solution for improving the Touschek lifetime and the heat load by lengthening the bunch length. The effect of installing 3rd harmonic cavity for TPS is investigated.

Advancements in technology have taken bulk niobium close to its theoretical operational limits; pushing the research to explore novel materials; such as niobium based alloys. Nitrides of niobium offer such an alternative; exhibiting a higher Tc compared to bulk niobium. Replacing then the niobium with a material with better thermal conductivity; such as copper; coated with thin films of nitrides in a multilayer S-I-S would lead to improved performance at reduced cost. Physical vapour deposition (PVD) is currently used to produce these coatings; but it suffers from lack of conformity. This issue can be resolved by using chemical vapour deposition (CVD); which is able to produce high quality coatings over surfaces with a high aspect ratio. This project explores the use of CVD techniques to deposit NbN thin films starting from their chlorinated precursors.

For reliability; the cavities are operated at lower voltages. This results in the optimum condition for beam loading being satisfied at a much lower power typically about 100 kW. For operation at 300 mA with two cavities; the RF power needed per system exceeds 200 kW. Consequently; the cavities need to be operated under-coupled. To lower the Qext and move the optimum operating point nearer to 200kW; 3 stub tuners are used in the waveguide feed line. The difference in the height of the coupling waveguide on cavity and that of the vacuum side waveguide on the window assembly results in a step transition which affects the Qext. The present window/step location results in Qext higher than that without the window. The Qext can be lowered by re-locating the RF window or by shifting the step change in the waveguide cross-section from its present location. This needs modification to the Pump Out box. The pros and cons of the proposed modification to the pump out box in terms of standing waves and multipacting characteristics studied with CST Studio are discussed in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepmb060_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepmb060.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepmb060_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPMB060,

Here we show that this lowering of the BCS resistance is due to interstitial nitrogen in the niobium lowering the mean free path. The BCS resistance extracted from experimental data is shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions from BCS theory; that there is an optimal doping of which the mean free path is lowered to about half the intrinsic coherence length.

Because at very high frequency (>10GHz); the wavelengths of HOMs are much smaller compared with accelerators dimension; the phase of those HOM will be negligible. Meanwhile; Finite Element Method (FEM) cannot lend a high resolution on evaluation the HOM field patterns due to limited meshing capability.

This paper will present the RF and mechanical designs of the 647 MHz 5-cell cavity; and status of the cavity fabrication will be addressed as well.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepmr041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepmr041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepmr041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPMR041,

A rectangular waveguide used as a natural high pass filter is a good option as high power; large spectrum HOM damper. However; its size is too big; causing a big challenge for the cooling and cryogenic system. A reliable; compact HOM damping scheme using a ridged waveguide is being developed to damp high power (> 10 kW); large spectrum HOMs ( up to 40 GHz) that may be generated in the 647 MHz 5-cell eRHIC ERL SRF linac. The size of a ridged waveguide is less than a quarter of the regular waveguide; which alleviates the thermal issue. This paper presents the design of a ridged waveguide and estimated HOM damping results using a ridged waveguide. The thermal or cooling design of the ridged waveguide will also be addressed.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepmr042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepmr042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepmr042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPMR042,

Simultaneously the energy demand of future accelerator projects is estimated to rise compared to existing facilities; leading to overall increased energy costs. Energy efficiency could counteract this trend by reducing energy consumption for a given research goal. This work aims to find recommendations for saving potential in existing research accelerators as well as guidelines for construction of future facilities.

The MPS of LIPAc manages the interlocks for a fast beam stop during anomalous beam losses or other hazardous situations. High speed processing is essential to achieve MPS goals driven by investment protection principles. Since Bragg's peak depth is dependent of energy; power densities by uncontrolled beam losses can be very damaging at low energies; the MPS principles for LIPAc are validating those for IFMIF.

A thin graphite foil with the thickness of about 300 ug/cm2 is located at the injection point to strip two electrons from H− ion and convert it to proton. The charge stripping efficiency is usually more than 99.7 %. In other words; less than 0.3 % H− ions are not accurately exchanged to protons. Most of those remaining H− ions or H0 atoms (stripped only one electron from H− ion) are eventually converted to protons by second and third graphite foils and transported to the beam dump. This beam dump consists of an iron block with the size of 0.3×0.3×0.4 m3 for beam stop and the iron block with the size of 3×3×2.5 m3 and concrete with the size of 6×6×6 m3 around the iron block for the radiation shielding.

ipac2016,,WEPMW008,Possible Beam Parameters in Double RF Operation of the CERN LHC,E.N. Shaposhnikova; J.F. Esteban Müller; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The LHC operates using a 400 MHz SC RF system. A 200 MHz NC RF system was foreseen in the LHC Design Report to improve beam capture and the bare resonators were manufactured; but never installed. Later the second harmonic RF system was proposed to cure longitudinal beam instabilities in the absence of a dedicated wideband feedback system in the LHC. For nominal intensities the longitudinal beam stability is ensured by controlled emittance blow-up during the acceleration ramp. Recently slow growing instabilities were observed at the end of long fills at 6.5 TeV as bunches shrink due to synchrotron radiation damping. For High Luminosity LHC twice higher intensities should be kept stable with new equipment installed in the ring. Additional motivations for a second RF system in the LHC have also been considered. Operation with an extra RF system is limited by the required RF configuration (phase between the two RF systems) and longitudinal beam stability. In this work requirements for the double RF systems are analyzed together with a possible range of longitudinal beam parameters.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepmw008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepmw008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepmw008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPMW008,

If the dispersion or slop of the dispersion is not zero at the collision point; beamstrahlung will also affect the transverse emittance. In this paper; we first examine the beamstrahlung properties; and show that for the proposed FCC-ee; the radiation is fairly well modelled by the classical formulae describing synchrotron radiation in bending magnets. We then derive a set of equations describing the equilibrium beam parameters in the presence of a nonzero dispersion at the collision point.

A very low beta function at the Interaction Point (IP) is needed to achieve the required luminosity. One consequence of the low beta optics is that the beta function in the final focusing (FF) quadrupoles is extremely high. This leads to a large beam size in these magnets as well as strong sensitivity to errors which limits the dynamic aperture. These effects are stronger at injection energy where the beam size is maximum; and therefore very large aperture FF magnets are required to allow a large dynamic aperture. A standard solution is a relaxed injection optics with IP beta function large enough to provide a reasonable FF aperture. This also reduces the effects of FF errors resulting in a larger dynamic aperture at injection. We describe the ion ring injection optics design as well as a beta-squeeze transition from the injection to collision optics.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepmw012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepmw012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepmw012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPMW012,

A new electron cooling process simulation program has been developed to fulfill the requirements of the JLEIC electron cooler design. The new program allows the users to calculate the electron cooling rate and simulate the cooling process with either DC or bunched electron beam to cool either coasting or bunched ion beam. It has been benchmarked with BETACOOL in aspect of accuracy and efficiency. In typical electron cooling process of JLEIC; the two programs agree very well and we have seen a significant improvement of computational speed using the new one. Being adaptive to the modern multicore hardware makes it possible to further enhance the efficiency for computationally intensive problems.

One of the main effects of the solenoid field is coupling of the horizontal and vertical betatron motions which must be corrected in order to preserve the dynamical stability and beam spot size match at the IP. Additional effects include influence on the orbit and dispersion caused by the angle between the solenoid axis and the beam orbit. Meanwhile it affects ion polarization breaking the figure-8 spin symmetry. Crab dynamics further complicates the picture. All of these effects have to be compensated or accounted for. The proposed correction system is equivalent to the Rotating Frame Method. However; it does not involve physical rotation of elements. It provides local compensation of the solenoid effects independently for each side of the IR. It includes skew quadrupoles; dipole correctors and anti-solenoids to cancel perturbations to the orbit and linear optics. The skew quadrupoles and FFQ together generate an effect equivalent to adjustable rotation angle to do the decoupling task.

Our analysis showed that the figure-8 ring configuration allows one to preserve the polarization of any ion species during beam acceleration using only small longitudinal field with an integral less than 0.5 Tm. In the racetrack booster; to preserve the polarization of ions with the exception of deuterons; it suffices to use a solenoidal Siberian snake with a maximum field integral of 30 Tm. To preserve deuteron polarization; we propose to use arc magnets for the race-track booster structure with a field ramp rate of the order of 1 T/s.

In this medium energy range; ions are not fully relativistic; which means values of their relativistic beta are slightly below 1; leading to an energy dependence of revolution time of the collider ring. On the other hand; electrons with energy 3 GeV and above are already ultra-relativistic such that their speeds are effectively equal to the speed of light. The difference in speeds of colliding electrons and ions in JLEIC; when translated into a path-length difference necessary to maintain the same timing between electron and ion bunches; is quite large.

A high-current storage-ring electron cooler offers a solution to both of these problems by maintaining high cooling beam quality through naturally-occurring synchrotron radiation damping of the electron beam. However; the range of ion energies where storage-ring electron cooling can be used has been limited by low electron beam damping rates at low ion energies and high equilibrium electron energy spread at high ion energies. This paper reports a development of a storage ring based cooler consisting of two sections with significantly different energies: the cooling and damping sections. The electron energy and other parameters in the cooling section are adjusted for optimum cooling of a stored ion beam. The beam parameters in the damping section are adjusted for optimum damping of the electron beam. The necessary energy difference is provided by an energy recovering SRF structure.

In addition; the HL-LHC upgrade will bring the accelerator beyond the nominal performance through more intense and brighter proton beams. A new generation of collimators based on advanced materials is needed to match present and new requirements. After several years of R&D on collimator materials; studying the behaviour of novel composites with properties that address different limitations of the present collimation system; solutions have been found to fulfil various upgrade challenges. This paper describes the proposed staged approach to deploy new materials in the upgraded HL-LHC collimation system.

In particular; collimators are the last line of defense in case of single-turn failures that cannot be caught by the standard interlock system. The collimator settings are conceived to protect the machine even for very rare events; like beam abort failures with a full machine. Collimator settings are established in simulations through a dedicated tracking setup but also empirically validated by beam measurements at low intensities. A benchmark of simulations is essential for reliably estimating the response of the system for future machine configurations and beam parameters.

Online orbit measurements also mean that margins in the collimation hierarchy placed specifically to cater for unknown orbit drifts can be reduced; therefore increasing the beta-star and luminosity reach of the LHC.

The design of this SRF cavity is for the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC). The electron ring of JLEIC will operate with electrons of 3 to 10 GeV energy. The ion ring of JLEIC will operate with protons of up to 100 GeV energy. The bunch lengths in both rings are ~12 mm (RMS). In order to maintain the short bunch length in the ion ring; SRF cavities are adopted to provide large enough gradient. In the first phase of JLEIC; the PEP II RF cavities will be reused in the electron ring to lower the initial cost. The frequency of the SRF cavities is chosen to be the second harmonic of PEP II cavities; 952.6 MHz. In the second phase of JLEIC; the same frequency SRF cavities may replace the normal conducting PEP II cavities to achieve higher luminosity at high energy. At low energies; the synchrotron radiation damping effect is quite weak; to avoid the coupled bunch instability caused by the intense closely-spaced electron bunches; low HOM impedance of the SRF cavities combined with longitudinal feedback system will be necessary.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepmw039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepmw039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepmw039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPMW039,

However; an important issue in building plasma based accelerators that provide particle bunches suitable for user applications will be a high transformer ratio; i.e. the ratio between maximum accelerating field in the witness and maximum decelerating fields in the driver bunch. The transformer ratio for symmetrical bunches in an overdense plasma is naturally limited to 2*. Theory and simulations show that this can be exceeded using asymmetrical bunches. Experimentally this was proven in RF-structures**; but not in PWFA. To study transformer ratios above this limit in the linear regime of a plasma wake; an experimental scheme tailored to the unique capabilities of the Photoinjector Test Facility Zeuthen PITZ; a 20-MeV electron accelerator at DESY; is being investigated.

Future experiments scheduled at the SPARC_LAB test facility aim to demonstrate the acceleration of externally injected high brightness electron beams through both schemes. In particular; in the so-called resonant PWFA a train of more than two driver electron bunches generated with the laser comb technique resonantly excites wakefields into the plasma; the last bunch (witness) is injected at the proper accelerating phase gaining energy from the wake. The quality of the accelerated beam depends strongly on plasma density and its distribution along the acceleration length.

For a beam-driven PWFA collider a sequence of cells has to be supplied with synchronised drive beam bunches. This paper is concerned with the generation; transport and distribution of these drive beam bunches in a so-called drive beam complex for a 3 TeV collider.

However, the accelerated electron energies are still limited by several factors, especially by the dephasing problem that is caused by different velocities between the plasma wake wave and the accelerated electron beam. In order to increase the acceleration length restricted by the dephasing problem**, we developed a gas-cell with density-tapering, which is realized by applying different gas pressures into two gas inlets in the gas cell. In this way, the gas density and gradient can be easily controlled in the gas cell. We used the density-tapered gas-cell for laser wakefield acceleration experiments in our laboratory with a 20 TW/40 fs Ti:sapphire laser system***. The results show that the electron energy can be significantly enhanced (about twice) with the tapered density gas-cell, compared with a uniform density conventional gas-cell.

The electron beams can be produced by the laser-driven wakefield acceleration technique. The electron beam energy can be easily adjusted between 450 MeV and 800 MeV with a tapered density plasma on the order of 1×1018 cm-3 while the driving laser power is fixed; and the high-energy electron beams can be sent through the undulator arrays for the coherent light emission. The energy-controllable electron bunches can provide an opportunity to control the radiation wave-length with the fixed gap undulators. For the tapered density profile; a capillary cell with two gas inlets can be used.

The RF characteristics of a pillbox-type 2.6-cell C-band RF cavity at 20 K were in agreement with the theoretical predictions. The result of the cold test for a cavity with the input coupler confirmed the same characteristics. Based on these results a refined cold model of the 20-K cryocooled photocathode RF gun has been designed using SUPERFISH and CST-STUDIO. The separation between the TM01 pi and the TM01 half-pi modes has been increased from 20 MHz to 52 MHz by extending the diameter of the cavity iris and reducing the disk thickness. The 2.6-cell structure has been modified from pillbox to ellipsoid-like type. The end-plate of the 0.6-cell cavity has a center hole for bead-pull measurements of the on-axis electric filed through the entire structure. Mounting of a photocathode assembly in the end-plate has not been considered; since the purpose is solely to measure the low-power and low-temperature RF characteristics. A new design for the input coupler has been employed.

An RF mode converter from square TE10 to circular TM01 mode has been employed as an RF input coupler that has a coupling coefficient of approximately 20 at 20 K to the 2.6-cell accelerating structure. In the previous design; the circular waveguide in the mode converter formed part of the accelerating cavity. After the cold test of the cavity completed in 2014; the coupler design was modified to work as a pure mode converter with a VSWR of 1 at 5712 MHz. From the design simulation using CST-STUDIO; the insertion loss in the converter is 0.2 %. The TM010 and TM011 modes excited in the circular waveguide were separated by several ten MHz from the accelerating frequency.

The X-ray source; which included a tungsten target for bremsstrahlung; was originally fabricated for on-site nondestructive inspections for infrastructures such as bridges; expressways and tunnels. Attachment of a photo-neutron target to this X-ray source allows a new mobile neutron source. Main applications of this neutron source are on-site moisture detection in infrastructures; and nuclear materials measurement in fuel debris for decommissioning Fukushima nuclear power plants. Our approach also realizes a mobile X-ray/neutron hybrid source system in the future. The beryllium was employed as target material since it had especially small threshold energy for the photo neutron production. We have developed a 60-cm-cube target station by combining a beryllium block; a graphite reflector; a polyethylene moderator; a boric acid resin layer (neutron shied); and a lead layer (gamma-ray shield).

To preserve the initial degree of polarization; several depolarizing resonances have to be compensated during the fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s. Beam depolarization; caused by crossing these resonances is studied using comprehensive numerical calculations. These depend essentially on a precise model of the actual magnetic field distributions; explicitly taking into account misalignments. Hence it is necessary to match the theoretical lattice to the actual accelerator. In a first step the alignment of all magnets has been examined and improved. This was done by using standard survey equipment and precise electronic spirit levels. In a second step the concept of response matrix fitting is used for further; beam based; lattice matching.

After PAL-XFEL equipment is aligned; if the ground and buildings go through vertical changes during operation; tilt and misalignment of equipments (correct magnet; BPM; accelerator) will cause errors in the electron beam trajectory; which will lead to changes in the beam parameter.

Since current techniques based on stretched wire or water level are difficult to implement; other options are under study. We propose a laser alignment system using positioning sensors made of camera/shutter assemblies. The goal is to implement such a positioning sensor. The corresponding studies comprise design and calibration as well as investigations of measurement accuracy and precision. On the one hand; we describe mathematically the laser beam propagation; its interaction with the shutter and image processing. On the other hand; we present experiments done with the prototype of a positioning sensor. As a result; we give practical suggestions to build the positioning sensors and we describe a calibration protocol to be applied to all sensors before measuring. In addition; we deliver estimates for measurement accuracy and precision. Our work provides the first steps towards a full alignment system.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepor017_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepor017.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepor017_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOR017,

It relies on key innovative technologies like superconducting cavities for beam rotation; named 'crab cavities'. Two crab cavities will be hosted in a superconducting cryostat working at a cold (<3 K). The position of each cavity will be monitored during the cool-down and the operation in order to comply with the tight alignment tolerances: the misalignment of a cavity axis w.r.t. the other will have to be lower than 0.5 mm and each cavity roll w.r.t. the cryostat axis will have to be lower than 1 mrad. Moreover; the monitoring system will have to be radiation hard (up to 10 MGy) and maintenance free. We propose a solution based on the Frequency Scanning Interferometry to provide the position monitoring of the crab cavities. This paper describes the design and study of such a solution; including the engineering approach; the issues encountered and the lessons learnt.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepor018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepor018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepor018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOR018,

Since the emittance of primary beams is very small; the target is easy to be destroyed if focused beams are irradiated. In the SuperKEKB LINAC; a plate called spoiler is placed in the upstream of the target to enlarge the beam spot size. If the beam control is in a correct way; radioactive rays will be observed near both the spoiler and the target. However; if the beam control is not successful and primary beams are irradiated directly on the target; significant radiations are observed only near the target. If such a behavior is observed; primary beams must be stopped to protect the target. Since the number of electrons in a bunch is quite large(~10nC); the radiation dose is expected to be very high. Therefore; the radiation detector is required to have a high radiation-tolerance over a long period of time. Diamond has a high radiation tolerance due to its strong covalent bond; and we are now developing radiation detectors using diamond crystals. In this talk; current status including beam test measurements will be shown.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepor019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepor019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepor019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOR019,

Upon smoke or gas leak detection, local safety actions are automatically performed and alarms indicating the location and type of danger are transmitted to the CERN Fire Brigade. The firefighters then size their intervention based on the information received. The increasing complexity, size and quantity of CERN installations drives safety systems to evolve in the direction of simplicity. Intuitive interfaces are required to cope with high turnover of firefighters, and the inherent multinational environment. Global overview of alarms and safety actions statuses are needed by firefighters to decide on the best strategy for intervention. In some emergency situations, it might be necessary to manually trigger remote actions. CERN is studying a new concept, inspired by French standards, where the detection and protection layers are separated and act independently, but provide a common interface. This paper presents an application of this concept for the SPS* accelerator.

As the small cross-section in the laser-particle interaction process results in negligible laser power loss; it is desirable to make the interaction inside an optical cavity to recycle the laser power. In many cases; conventional cavity locking techniques will not work since the burst normally has very small duty factor and low repetition rate and it is impossible to generate an effective control signal. In this talk; we report on the development of a doubly-resonant optical cavity scheme and its locking technique that enables a simultaneous resonance of two laser beams with different spectra and/or temporal structures. We demonstrate that such a cavity can be used to recycle burst-mode ultra-violet laser pulses with arbitrary burst lengths and repetition rates.

The nature of the machine places stringent requirements in the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system; expected to control the cavity fields within 0.01 degrees in phase and 0.01% in amplitude; which is equivalent to a longitudinal motion of the cavity structure in the nanometer range. This stability has been achieved in the past but never for hundreds of superconducting cavities in Continuous-Wave (CW) operation. The difficulty resides in providing the ability to reject disturbances from the cryomodule; which is incompletely known as it depends on the cryomodule structure itself (currently under development at JLab and Fermilab) and the harsh accelerator environment. Previous experience in the field and an extrapolation to the cavity design parameters (relatively high QLc≈ 4×107; implying a half-bandwidth of around 16 Hz) suggest the use of strong RF feedback to reject the projected noise disturbances; which in turn demands careful engineering of the entire system.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepor042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepor042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepor042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOR042,

The existing setting of the three independently powered sextupole families respective to lifetime were roughly determined by scanning their strengths against each other. As a flexible machine the sextupole families of the MLS can be regrouped into new families; which increase the complexity of the scan pro-cedure. Consequently the former strategy would be too time-consuming for refined global scan and it has to be complemented with physical constraints. Therefore a scheme has been developed to keep the chromaticity in a reasonable range during the scan and to reduce the degree of freedom; which is even more important at BESSY II with increasing number of independent sextupole cir-cuits. This paper presents the principle of sextupole scan and the experimental results at the MLS and preliminary test at BESSY II.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepow010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepow010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepow010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOW010,

Both operational improvements have matured and turned out to be especially beneficial for the advanced timing opportunities supported at BESSY. In combination with very tight injection efficiency requirements a thorough understanding of top-up injections under all operational conditions has been developed. Consequently arbitrary bunch currents can be dialed in and maintained on demand. In standard mode; a very pure camshaft bunch is available both in general for laser pump/X-ray probe and for pseudo single bunch experiments at the MHz chopper beamline. 3 constant high current bunches support the FEMTOSPEX slicing facility. An additional bunch can be resonantly excited and pulse picked via custom orbit bumps at 3 different undulator beamlines (PPRE).

The intensity of the light depends strongly on the quality of the laser-electron interaction and therefore on the energy spread and density of the electron bunches. In 2014; a significant increase of the CHG intensity was observed by phase-modulating the RF cavity voltage; which is routinely used to prolong the beam lifetime. RF phase modulation can generate multiple stable regimes (islands) in longitudinal phase space when run near an integer multiple of the synchrotron frequency resulting in a modulation of the electron density and energy spread.

A laser-induced modulation of the electron energy is converted into a density modulation (microbunching) by a magnetic chicane; giving rise to coherent emission at harmonics of the initial laser wavelength (coherent harmonic generation; CHG). As a first step towards active control of the shape and spectrum of CHG pulses; spectral studies were performed under variation of the chicane strength and the laser properties. The spectral phase of the laser pulses was controlled by tuning the compressor of the laser amplifier and was monitored using FROG (frequency-resolved optical gating). In this paper; monochromator scans as well as single-shot spectrograms of the CHG radiation are presented and compared to simulations of the laser-electron interaction and microbunching process.

Sustainability is a key guiding principle for the fourth-generation X-ray source - a beam emittance of around 100 pm.rad is pursued simultaneously with substantial energy-saving. The three key features of the design are (i) to replace the main dipole electric magnets with permanent magnets; (ii) to reduce the electron beam energy from 8 to 6 GeV; and (iii) to use the SACLA linac as an injector. Lowering the beam energy leads to reduction of (a) beam emittance; (b) magnetic fields; (c) the lengths of ID straight sections to maintain larger spaces for the magnets; and (d) the RF power consumption. Timeshare use of the SACLA linac enables beam injection to the upgraded ring with a low-emittance and short-pulsed beam as well as a reduction of injector power consumption by stopping the present injector consisting of a 1-GeV linac and a booster synchrotron.

By the reconstruction of the normal cells at the arc section; the emittance can be reduced to about 8 nmrad. The double number of the combined function short bending magnets are adopted and one present normal cell become two new normal cells. Although the lattice of the straight sections are not changed; the optics are optimized to reduce the non-linear effects of the sextupoles of the arc sections. By keeping the tune advance of the straight section as 3 for the horizontal direction and 2.5 for the vertical; the dynamic aperture as large as that of the present ring can be achieved with the magnetic errors. The difference of the optics of the straight sections are so little that the beam injection and the operation of the in-vacuum short-gap undulators can be maintained.

One of the most critical issues that are responsible for the proper functionality of the machine is the survey of the machine. An appropriate alignment of the components in accordance to each other as also to the building; provides a good quality of the beam so extensively desired by the beamline's users. This paper presents the results of the alignment in the 1.5 GeV ring; describes possible critical sectors of the ring that might influence the accuracy of the measurements and juxtapose the results with the values gained during the operational phase of the synchrotron.

On 2014; the linac waveguide system was upgraded and commissioned to allow operating with either klystron and providing a reduced beam energy of 67 MeV. The commissioning of the booster to capture the beam at a reduced energy and ramp it up to 3 GeV has required a long set-up process of the magnets at 67 MeV beam energy. Due to the dominant effect of the remnant magnetic field in the low energy regime; the scaling of the magnet settings at the beginning of the ramp did not allow to capture the beam; and more precise calibrations were measured on spare quadrupoles to ease its fine tuning. The effect of higher eddy currents induced when the dipoles start ramping; combined with the lower beam rigidity; has been also an issue to tune the dipole waveforms for the 67 MeV - 3 GeV cycle.

In this paper; we will present the approach that we applied to design and optimize a multi-bend achromat based storage ring lattice for the proposed ALS upgrade.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepow050_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepow050.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepow050_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOW050,

Normally; only a single resonating mode is actively used; although other modes can be excited by the circulating beam. Cavities used as feedback longitudinal kickers are designed with an axial mode which; appropriately excited; provides a kick to the circulating bunches for maintaining beam stability. To provide the necessary bandwidth this mode has to be strongly damped resulting in quality factors of just a few units. In the longitudinal feedback kicker cavity just installed on the ALS we have detected a second axial mode which; although a few hundreds of MHz below the 1.4 GHz design mode; is also strongly damped and has a shunt impedance high enough to be appreciably excited by the feedback amplifier coupling to the first mode. In this paper we show bench measurements on the cavity and with beam during its commissioning and discuss the interaction of the two modes resulting in a modulation of shunt impedance and phase response.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepow052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepow052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepow052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOW052,

Two undulators with a 6.5mm-vertical gap were installed in Fall 2014; replacing a wiggler in the sextant of CESR that is the home to all CHESS beam lines. In order to operate narrow gap undulators with two beams; CESR pretzel lattice was redesigned so that e- and e+ orbits are coincident in one machine sextant but separated in return arcs. In particular both e- and e+ orbits are on axis through undulators. This ""arc-pretzel"" lattice has been the basis for undulator operation. To better understand the beam dynamics and improve machine performance; we developed many simulation tools: undulator modeling; injection tracking; etc. With installation of an additional quadrupole near undulators; the CESR lattice will be further modified with a low beta waist in the insertion devices; allowing a more than two fold reduction of local beta functions. This reduction is anticipated to mitigate the effects of small aperture and undulator field errors and to enhance the xray brightness.

To make the top off commissioning smooth and efficient; a virtual machine model based on the measured beam properties was developed. The model helped to study robustness of this application operating under different conditions and optimize the input parameters. Once tested the model was transitioned to beam commissioning.

A LabView program was developed to measure the distribution of first field integral of both vertical (By) and horizontal (Bz) magnetic field components in the median plane of an air coil automatically. The program is an adaptation of the existing program, which was used to characterize magnetic properties of the phase shifters (PS). Before doing the measurements the new program automatically finds the centers of By and Bz components, which are found to match with the geometrical centers with sufficient accuracy. After the measuring procedure is complete, the results are presented as graphics output and final tables. It shows that the measurement results can fully meet the design requirements of E-XFEL.

In addition; third harmonic cavities will improve the quality of the beam by linearising the field profile and hence reducing the energy spread. There are eight 3.9 GHz cavities within a single module AH1 of E-XFEL. The beam-excited electromagnetic (EM) field in these cavities can be decomposed into a series of eigenmodes. These modes are; in general; not cut-off between one cavity and the next; as they are able to couple to each other throughout the module.

The OSC technique relies on collecting and amplifying a broadband optical signal from a pickup undulator and feeding the amplified signal back to the beam. It creates a corrective kick in a kicker undulator. Owing to its superb gain qualities and broadband amplification features; Titanium:Sapphire medium has been considered as a gain medium for the optical amplifier (OA) needed in the OSC*. A limiting factor for any OA used in OSC is the possibility of nonlinear phase distortions. In this paper we experimentally measure phase distortions by inserting a single-pass OA into one leg of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The measurement results are used to estimate the reduction of the corrective kick a particle would receive due to these phase distortions in the kicker undulator.; * A. Zholents; and M. Zolotorev.

These constraints impose the choice of a high collision rate which is based on S-band Linac whose energy is 50-70 MeV combined to an electron storage ring. As most of the performances of the electron beam at the interaction point depend on the beam quality at the ring entrance; the linear accelerator must be carefully designed and especially the photo-injector. Simulations have been carried out in order to optimise the emittance for the ring entrance. Indeed; for a bunch charge of 1 nC; space charge effects usually dominate the total beam emittance. The latter can be minimized at the end of the Linac by means of emittance compensation. The best configuration across all the parameters will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepoy024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepoy024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepoy024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOY024,

Here we report on the numerical and experimental investigation of the BBU effect in a W-band corrugated structure; for both cases of short range wakefield and long range wakefield. In the numerical part we develop a point to point (P2P) code that allows rapid and efficiency simulations of the beam dynamics effect by wakefield; which is based on the the particle-wake function coupled dynamics equation of motion.

In PAL-XFEL; a photon beam with a 0.1 nm wavelength is generated from an electron bunch based on self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). An electron bunch with an uncorrelated energy spread in a level of 3 keV; which is generated from the photocathode RF gun; may be sensitive to longitudinal micro-bunching instability. The energy spread of an electron bunch can be increased to suppress the instability by Landau damping. In order to control the uncorrelated energy spread; a laser heater system; which has a chicane with four dipoles chicane and a 0.5 m long undulator; was installed in the injector test facility (ITF) of PAL.

Therefore; it is crucial and additionally very useful to develop sophisticated though complete simulation tools. This goal is mainly motivated by our research focus on the development of compact X-ray sources based on radiation in optical undulators. The currently existing softwares are usually written to tackle special cases with particular approximations; such as 1D FEL theory; steady state; slow wave and forward wave approximation; wiggler-averaged electron motion and slices approximation. Many of the above approximations are hardly valid when sub-femtosecond bunches interact with intense optical lasers. The presented software aims the analysis of the FEL interaction without considering any of the above approximations. The developed tool apparently suffers from long computation times but offers a more accurate picture on the radiation process. In order to overcome the problem of multidimensionality; we exploit Lorentz boosted coordinate system and implement Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method combined with Particle in Cell (PIC) simulation in this frame.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepoy035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepoy035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepoy035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOY035,

Nowadays; energy and angular spread of the laser-driven beams are the main issues in application and different solutions for dedicated beam-transport lines have been proposed. In this context a system of permanent magnet quadrupoles has been realized; by INFN researchers in collaboration with SIGMAPHI company; to be used as a collection system for laser-driven protons up to 20 MeV. The definition of well specified characteristics; in terms of performances and field quality; of the magnetic lenses is crucial for the system realization and an accurate study of the beam dynamics. Hence; a method for studying the errors on the PMQ harmonic contents has been developed. It consists of different series of simulations in which magnetic and mechanical errors are introduced in the array and the harmonic content is analyzed to fix the tolerances necessary to have a good beam quality downstream the system. The method developed for the analysis of the PMQs errors and its validation is here described.

Since the product of the RF voltage and the RF frequency of the crab cavities is constant for a given crossing angle; higher frequencies are preferred in order to limit the require voltage. However; the 20cm RMS proton bunch length provides an upper limit of the useable frequencies due to the significant curvature of the RF waveform over this bunch length.

However; beam induced excitation of higher order modes (HOM) inside those superconducting cavities is a major concern for beam stability in a recirculating accelerator. Thus it is important to develop and apply proper HOM damping techniques. Current design considerations involve HOM coupler which usually introduce discontinuities in the cross section while also breaking the axisymmetry. To circumvent these issues we investigate in a layout with ring ferrites as an alternative or additional HOM damping technique. We also present an alternative superstructure setup that uses two instead of four cavities for VSR.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/wepoy059_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/wepoy059.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/wepoy059_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-WEPOY059,

In order to circumvent these issues; YACS was upgraded to support arbitrary order basis functions and curved meshes; leading to; but not limited to; isoparametric finite elements.

As high beam power is an issue from the lowest energy; careful and exhaustive beam loss predictions have to be done. High space charge implies lattice compactness making the implementation of beam diagnostics very problematic; so a clear strategy for beam diagnostic has to be defined. Beam halo becomes no longer negligible; and it plays a significant role in the particle loss process. Therefore; beam optimization must take the halo into account and beam characterization must be able to describe the halo part in addition to the core one.

In particular; with this technique one retrieves information about gradient errors; dipole corrector gain errors etc. Orbit response matrix is computed by measuring orbit deviations caused by single kicks of corrector magnets. With fitting the matrix one obtains the ion optics which best describes the real accelerator. The ORM analysis; presented in the paper; is employed to find error sources in the FAIR storage rings CR and HESR during and after the beam commissioning. The algorithm itself was implemented in Python programming language with a help of linear algebra libraries.

Non-isochronous recirculation is the common operation mode for synchrotrons or microtrons. In such a scheme the recirculation arcs provide a non-zero longitudinal dispersion; while the particle bunches are accelerated at a certain phase off-crest with respect to the maximum of the accelerating field. In few-turn linacs and microtrons such beam dynamics can be used to reduce the energy spread. To do so the longitudinal phase advance needs to be set to a half-integer number of oscillations in phase space. Then errors from linac RF-systems cancel out and the energy spread remains closely to the value at injection. In addition to the improved energy spread the beam stability of few-turn recirculators can be increased as well using such a system. We will present operational experience with the non-isochronous recirculation system of the twice recirculating superconducting accelerator S-DALINAC operated at TU Darmstadt including beam-dynamics calculations and measurements of the energy spread.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmb004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmb004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmb004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMB004,

There are also many electron linacs worldwide which use the Velocity Bunching beam compression technique; which needs solenoids wrapping the first acceleration cavity. A misalignment between the beam trajectory and the magnetic center of the solenoids produces a decrease in the beam quality and makes it necessary to find a complex steering setting to force the beam on a good orbit. In this proceeding we present a study of two beam based alignment techniques; which are correlated: the first shows a method to find the correct electromagnetic axis of an acceleration cavity; the second shows how to align the solenoids (wrapping the cavity) on this axis. Therefore the study permits to find the best steering setting and the solenoids positions corrections which have to be done.

The betatron functions in many accelerators can be computed using a lattice model trained or calibrated using a set of closed orbit responses; which is exemplified by the widely used LOCO technique. However; for some accelerators; like Duke storage ring with quad-sextupole combined function magnets; LOCO cannot be employed in any straight forward manner. In this case; direct measurements for betatron function are required. One way to determine betatron functions at the location of quadrupoles for a circular accelerator is to use the relationship between the quadrupole strength variations and the corresponding betatron tune change. In this paper; we present a set of carefully developed techniques to accurately measure the betatron functions at the location of quadrupoles; which allow us to achieve extremely high accuracy.

Especially they can bring the distortion of the linear beam optics seriously. In order to make sure the stability and the quality of the beam meeting the design goal; the effect of these insertion devices must be compensated. In this paper; a direct compensation method is applied for the wiggler in the HLSII storage ring with the particle swarm optimization.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmb023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmb023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmb023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMB023,

To achieve the design FEL performance of IR-FEL; the beam with 30 mm-mrad emittance; 5 ps rms length and 1nC bunch charge is required. We conduct error analysis in order to evaluate the tolerances of machine parameters and alignments. In this paper; we simulate the orbit corrections and emittance growth under exist of misalignments and strength errors of magnets. The simulation results show that the trajectory errors can be corrected to mm levels in the whole lattice and the emittance increase is acceptable. At the entrance of undulator; the position and angular errors can be corrected very well. So the trajectory can be controlled in the undulator to meet the requirement of FEL.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmb024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmb024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmb024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMB024,

Based on the LPA facility in SIOM that has successfully obtained quasi-monochromatic beam with the central energy of hundreds of MeV; a specific design of a beam transport line is proposed to realize FEL gain using Transverse Gradient Undulator to compensate the relatively large beam energy spread. This beamline uses a single dipole; several strong focusing quadrupoles and correcting sextupoles to match proper beta functions and linear dispersion from the LPA beam to FEL radiation.

KEK Accelerator Test Facility (ATF2); a scaled down implementation of the beam delivery system (BDS); serves for investigating the limits of electron beam focusing at the interaction point. The goal of the ultra-low beta∗ study is to lower the IP vertical beam size by lowering the betay∗ value while keeping the betax∗ value unchanged. Good control over the beam optics is therefore required. The first experience with low beta∗ optics revealed a mismatch between the optics designed in the model with respect to the beam parameters observed in the experiment. Additionally; existing methods of beam parameters characterization at the IP were biased with high uncertainties making it difficult to set the desired optics. In this paper we report on the new method introduced in ATF2 for IP beam parameters characterization which gives a good control over the applied optics and makes the ultra-low beta∗ study possible to conduct.

The antiprotons will be distributed through a network of electrostatic transfer lines to several experiments; which will replace the existing magnetic transfer lines. The existing experiments and limited space in the AD hall forces the new transfer lines into close proximity to the high-field solenoids used by some experiments to trap the antiprotons. The stray fields from the experimental magnets are known to perturb beam delivery and are a concern for operation at the decreased beam rigidity provided by ELENA. A study was carried out to investigate the influence of stray magnetic fields on the beam; including different ramping periods and operational scenarios. The analytical model of the fields used for simulation will be discussed. Furthermore; trajectory correction algorithms using MADX optic model of the lines have been investigated. The results of these studies as well as specifications of acceptable stray field limits and field attenuation requirements will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmb047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmb047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmb047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMB047,

The T-BMT equation distinctly addresses each issue. Because the EDM signal is proportional to the projection of the spin on the direction of the momentum; it is desirable to freeze the spin direction of all particles in a bunch along momentum. It can be successfully implemented in the Quasi Frozen (QFS) and Frozen (FS) Spin structures. However; in case of magnet misalignments; the induced MDM signal may arise in the same plane as the EDM signal and thereby prevent its registration.

Despite the good results; this scheme has not yet been adopted for routine operation in these machines due to the reduced injection efficiency.

The previously defined one dimensional core-halo limit [1][2] was extended to two dimensional distributions [3][4].

To achieve the emittance value of less than 0.2 nmrad at 6 GeV; we adopted a 5-bend achromat lattice with dipoles having longitudinal field gradient. In this lattice the betatron phase between the two dispersion arcs was set to (2n+1)PI to suppress dominant harmful effects of chromaticity-correcting sextupoles. By detuning this phase; optimizing sextupole strengths in a cell and introducing octupoles; we obtained a sufficient dynamic aperture (DA) for beam injection even for the symmetry-broken ring having four long straight sections and a high-beta injection section. However; the off-momentum behavior such as the non-linear chromaticity still needs to be optimized to achieve the momentum acceptance (MA) of 3% or larger. We have thus been investigating the possibility to increase both the DA and MA by introducing several phase-matched sextupole pairs.

A key ingredient in this novel extraction technique is the beam splitting in transverse phase space. This manipulation is based on adiabatic trapping in stable islands of transverse phase space and requires mastering a number of devices in the PS ring. In addition; an in-depth review of all fast extractions schemes in the PS had been required due to the development and installation of a dummy septum to shield the actual magnetic septum. In this paper; the current performance of the beam splitting and of the extraction including the shadowing effect is presented.

Control of the dynamic aperture is important for a good understanding and operation of the accelerator. The AC dipole; installed in the LHC for the diagnostic of linear and non-linear optics; could serve as a tool for the determination of the dynamic aperture. However; since the AC dipole itself modifies the non-linear dynamics; the dynamic aperture with and without AC dipole are expected to differ.

Despite the fact that shimming technique was used to minimize the nonlinear components of magnetic field integral arising from random errors; the nonlinear dynamics effects still remain. It was found that calculated dynamic field integrals are largest in the 2.2 T Hybrid Multipole Wiggler (MPW). Dynamics effects of insertion devices are attributed to the wiggling trajectory of electron in the region of magnetic field roll-off due to finite pole width.

The effect on emittance and energy spread are found to be small; however the impact on lifetime and injection are very significant if the chromaticity is corrected normally (globally). The MOGA genetic algorithm is used to optimize the lifetime and injection efficiency in this case. We used local mirror chromatic sextupole and other chromatic sextupole family for chromaticity correction in which case the genetic algorithm found solution that restores lifetime and injection efficiency.

The fast pulse signal conditioning module is adopted for preconditioning the fast pulse and DC signals that inherently have high noise levels generated from a beam voltage; a beam current and EOLC current. Those EM (Electro-Magnetic) noises are generated by thyratron switching. The amplitude of the thyratron noise is large which causes the problem at the control devices; frequently.

Especially in AC mode; during the booster ramping process; the current ramping profiles of the Quadruple Magnets have to track that of the Dipole AC power supply with precise phase and amplitude to maximize the beam energy boost efficiency. At present; analog current commands for all the booster power supplies with relative phase and amplitude information are generated externally. The current ramping profiles are pre-calculated and calibrated in a centralized manner. In this paper; an auto-calibration process using Curve-Fitting algorithm is proposed. In the new process; the current ramping profile data is first stored digitally in each power supply and then outputted to each power supply with a synchronous trigger signal in hope to eliminate the signal integrality problem inherent in analog signals; so that the beam energy boost up could be more reliable and efficient.

As the output current of the power supply follows the beam current for operation at 3 GeV; the power supply must deliver enormous energy to the dipole magnets. The target energy corresponds to 700 A at 800 V. The dipole supply for the TPS storage ring is a unipolar switching power supply; also called a bulk power supply. The TPS dipole power supply modulates the output current regulated by the PWM signal. The switching device is an IGBT module working at frequency 2 kHz. A PID controller and a DCCT are used for feedback control of the output current. We obtained an optimal control gain with long-term stability of the output current under 10 ppm. The performance of the TPS storage ring dipole supply can thus satisfy the TPS requirement. The beam current generates 3 GeV in the TPS ring.

In order to achieve these specifications; the short pulsed high voltage output and the utilization of the solid-state switch is necessary for an inductance load. In order to suppress the supplied voltage as low as as possible; it is an important feature to realize the extremely small-sized pulsar to be set near the kicker. On the basis of the experiences in developing the solid-state pulsar of 400ns/2kV using Si-MOSFET*; combination of the SiC-MOSFET and the strip-line type Blumlein pulse forming network (BPFN) was applied to the prototype driver to achieve a shorter pulse and higher power than Si-type driver. The completed pulsar accomplished a compact size (external dimensions; 300(H)x400(W)x400(D)mm). Furthermore; the targeted short-pulsed high voltage output of 123ns/12kV was obtained by 6 BPFNs serial connection to the load inductance of 800 nH.

The kicker magnets in one tank have recently limited operation of the SPS with high-intensity beam: this is due to both beam induced heating in the ferrite yoke of the kicker magnets and abnormally high pressure in the vacuum tank. Furthermore; operation with the higher intensity beams needed in the future for HL-LHC is expected to exacerbate these problems. Hence studies of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance of the kicker magnets have been carried out to investigate effective methods to shield the ferrite yoke from the circulating beam. The shielding must not compromise the field quality or high voltage behaviour of the kicker magnets and should not significantly reduce the beam aperture: results of these studies; together with measurements; are presented.

ipac2016,,THPMW034,Review on the Effects of Characteristic Impedance Mismatching in a Stripline Kicker,C. Belver-Aguilar; M.J. Barnes; L. Ducimetièrepresenter; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; A stripline kicker operates as two coupled transmission lines; with two TEM operating modes; known as odd and even modes. The characteristic impedance of these two modes is generally different; both only tend to the same value either when the electrodes are widely separated or when the electrodes are very close to the beam pipe wall. In all other cases; the even mode characteristic impedance is always higher than the odd mode characteristic impedance. The specifications required for a kicker operating in a low emittance ring are usually very challenging. In this situation it is desirable to match the even mode characteristic impedance of the striplines to the resistance of their termination.

One of the most critical components of the LBDS are the extraction kickers that must reliably switch on within the 3 us particle-free abort gap. To ensure this functionality; even in the event of a power-cut; the power generator capacitors remain charged and hence the Gate Turn-Off (GTO) switch stack has to hold the full voltage throughout beam operation. The increase of the LHC collision energy to 13 TeV has increased the voltage levels at the GTO stacks and during re-commissioning an increased rate of high-voltage (HV) related issues at the level of the GTO stack was observed. Different solutions have been analysed and an improved GTO stack will be implemented. This paper also outlines the benefit of adding more kicker magnets to improve the voltage hold off issues and to improve the tolerance to missing kickers during extraction.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmw035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmw035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmw035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMW035,

Over the years a number of pulse compressors had been demonstrated with some being bulky but efficient; like the binary pulse compressor and other being compact but less efficient; like SLED-II. An active pulse compressor had been proposed to increase the efficiency and compression ratio which relies on a high power active switch. Currently there are no practical switches that can work reliably with 100 s of megawatts of power. Most of the switches (ferroelectric; plasma-based; semiconductor) are limited by the breakdown strength of various dielectric inserts. In this paper we report on an active switch development which is based on a pure copper resonator and controlled by a single-side multipactor discharge at a metallic wall in the presence of a resonant DC magnetic field and a normal to metal rf field. The discharge is ignited by external rf power produced by inexpensive 2.45 GHz; 1-5 kW magnetrons.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmw040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmw040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmw040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMW040,

Moreover single crystal lens preserves coherence of the x-ray beam because scattering from grain boundaries; voids and impurities; typical for current beryllium lenses is minimized.

Vacuum system for the targeted storage ring should handle some fateful boundary conditions; such as miniaturization of vacuum chamber and increase in number of photon absorbers resulting from the multi-bend achromat configuration. Furthermore; reuse of the existing tunnel brings the severe packing factor issue of vacuum components and the time constraints issue of one-year blackout. Considering the above circumstances; a concept of 12-m long vacuum chamber with welded integral structure was proposed to omit in-situ baking. The 12-m long chamber will be evacuated to ultra-high vacuum by ex-situ baking followed by NEG activation; and moved to the tunnel with special thin gate valves at both ends. Recently; the chamber material has been changed from aluminum alloy to stainless steel (SS) from the viewpoints of elimination of aluminum-SS transition space; beam vibration suppression; and superior outgassing property.

Various types of the ferrite blocks have been actually used in accelerator fields as the higher-order modes (HOMs) absorbers in the vacuum beam pipes. However; one of difficulties in using the ferrite is to bond it to the beam pipes with a sufficient adhesive force; and to assure the contact with a high thermal conductivity in vacuum. The brazing or Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) is not so easy owing to a low thermal expansion rate and a relatively low tensile strength of the ferrite. We established a method of fabricating a ferrite block bonded to copper by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The ferrite powders are directly sintered on a copper block in the SPS process together with some metals to relax the thermal stress between them. The sintered ferrite-copper block can be brazed or welded to other metal blocks; or directly on the beam pipes. Here reported are R&D results of the fabrication method; and some experimental results on the properties of the ferrite-copper block.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmy002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmy002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmy002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMY002,

The RF fingers must absorb and compensate longitudinal; angular and transversal misalignments due to both thermal effects; during bake-out or cooldown processes; and mechanical movements during assembly; alignment; commissioning and operation phases. The new RF bridge concept is based on a deformable thin-walled structure in copper beryllium; which fulfils the above requirements without the need of sliding contacts. Mechanical tests have been carried out to characterize the response and the lifetime of such a component under different loading conditions. In addition; finite element models have been used to estimate the behaviour. The influence of different material grades and heat treatments on the reliability is presented.

Afterward; the LHC will undergo a long shutdown (LS2) for upgrade and maintenance. The four LHC experiments; ATLAS; ALICE; CMS and LHCb; will experience an important upgrade too. From the design point of view; the LS2 experimental beam vacuum upgrade requires multi-disciplinary approach: based on the geometrical envelope defined by experiment; the vacuum chambers size and shape must be optimized. This included Monte Carlo pressure profile simulations and vacuum stability studies in order to meet the specific pressure requests in the interaction region. Together with vacuum studies the structural analysis are performed in order to optimise chambers thickness and position of the operational and maintenance supports. The material selection for vacuum chambers in the experimental area follows the CERN ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle.

In addition; they reduce beam impedance by shielding the outer bellows required to compensate mechanical displacements between components. In order to assess the resulting beam impedance from a specific bellow/RF finger configuration; RF measurements are routinely carried out. During these measurements; it was observed that cavity modes in the volume between the fingers and the bellow undulation arise. These resonances occur at significantly higher frequencies than the expected frequency range of interest. Due to their broadband nature; the tails of the imaginary part of these resonances reach into the lower frequency range of interest where it contributes to the beam coupling impedance of the device. For proper evaluation of this contribution; a time domain delay technique in TDT (time domain transmissiometry) was used in order to overcome shortcomings that arise if the classical coaxial wire method is applied to these structures. We present the theory of our method and discuss it in view of the data measured on deformable fingers that were studied for the LHC.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmy009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmy009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmy009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMY009,

This paper describes the effect of SEY mitigation with graphene coatings on aluminium substrate. The maximum SEY (dmax) was decreased from 2.4 for bare aluminium to 1.4 with a graphene coating. Measurements were taken using an electron gun and a Faraday cup; the electron energies varied between 80 eV and 1 keV with a bias of -18 V on the sample. Other biases of -3; -5; -9; -25; -50 and -75 V were also tested however there was no effect on the SEY.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmy016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmy016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmy016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMY016,

The use of metallic thin films offers several advantages: (i) metal photocathodes present a fast response time and a relative insensitivity to the vacuum environment (ii) metallic thin films when prepared and transferred in vacuum can offer smoother and cleaner cathode surfaces. The photocathodes developed here will ultimately be used to drive NCRF guns such as that used in VELA and the proposed CLARA light source test facility. The samples grown on Si substrates were used to investigate the morphology and thickness of the film. The samples grown onto Cu and Mo substrates were analysed and tested as photocathodes in a surface characterisation chamber; where X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to determine surface chemistry and a Kelvin probe apparatus used to determine work function.

Its function is to protect the superconducting machine elements during injection in the case of a malfunction of the injection kickers. The TDIS; which will replace the TDI; is foreseen to be installed for high luminosity operation. Due to the higher bunch intensities and smaller beam emittances expected; and following the operational experiences of the TDI; a complete revision of the design of the jaws must be performed; with a main focus on the material selection. Furthermore; the new TDIS will also improve the TDI reliability by means of a robust design of the jaw positioning mechanism; the efficiency of the cooling circuit and by reducing its impedance. A simplified installation procedure and maintenance will also be an important requirement for the new design. This paper introduces the main characteristics of the TDI as LHC injection protection device; showing the needs and requirements for its upgrade.

By development of the Yb-doped laser system; more than 5.0 nC and 3.0 nC electron beam with single-bunch has been generated in the 5 Hz and 25 Hz respectively. Also more than 1.0 nC electron with double-bunch has been obtained in 25 Hz. The Yb-doped laser system is already for commissioning for the linac. Next; a new laser system is development to improve the stability and reliability. The laser system starts with a 50 MHz Yb-doped fiber oscillator with the all normal dispersion (ANDi) structure. A transmission grating pair stretcher was employed to expend pulse to ~30 ps and separate the pulse to two parts with the center wavelength of 1030 nm and 1064 nm. Then the two kinds of pulses can be amplified by Yb:YAG and Nd:YAG crystals respectively. The weak pulses were amplified by the Yb-doped fiber amplifier; and reduced repetition rate by a semiconductor optics amplifier (SOA) pulse picker. To obtain the mJ-class pulse energy; a Yb:YAG thin-disk regenerative solid-state amplifier and a Nd:YAG rod regenerative solid-state amplifier were employed.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpmy041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpmy041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpmy041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPMY041,

In order to reach such performances; an extreme focusing of the beam is required in the interaction regions with a low vertical beta function of 2 mm at the IP. Moreover; the FCC-ee physics program requires very low emittances never achieved in a collider with 2 nm for εx and 2 pm for εy; reducing the coupling ratio to 1/1000. With such requirements; any field errors and sources of coupling will introduce spurious vertical dispersion which degrades emittances; limiting the luminosity of the machine. This paper describes the tolerance study and the impact of errors will affect the vertical emittance. In order to preserve the FCC-ee performances; in particular εy; a challenging correction scheme is proposed to keep the coupling and the vertical emittance as low as possible.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpor001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpor001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpor001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOR001,

This paper presents the layout of the machine and the constraints on the design of the arc lattice in the context of the four different beam energies that are foreseen for beam operation. Special emphasis is put on the compensation of the effect of the strong synchrotron radiation losses. The beam orbit as well as the optics have to be re-optimised for a given operation energy in order to achieve the foreseen emittance of ε = 1 nm in the horizontal and 1 pm in the vertical plane. Counter measures of the so-called saw-tooth effect of the design orbit are needed as well as a compensation of the energy loss on the beam optics.

In SuperKEKB; one of a key element is a final-focus system; it reduces e−/e+ beam size to 50 nm in vertical and 10 μm in horizontal direction at an interaction point (IP). The system consists of eight superconducting quadrupole magnets and four quadrupoles are aligned on the each beam line. The quadrupole; QC1P(QC1E); which is located at the closest position to the IP on the e+(e−) beam line; generates a field gradient of about 70 T/m. An inner diameter of coil and a magnetic length for QC1P(QC1E) are 25(33) mm and 334(373) mm; respectively. The production of all quadrupole magnets are completed. To confirm their field qualities; we performed magnetic measurement for each magnet in advance to be integrated into cryostats on the beam lines. In the measurement; the quadrupoles were cooled down to 4.2 K in a test vertical cryostat and field harmonic components were measured with harmonic coils. The magnitude of error multipole components for all magnets met requirements from beam optics design.

More than 400 magnets were designed; fabricated; field-measured; installed in the tunnel and aligned in time for Phase 1 commissioning.

We have three stages; the Phase-1 is the commissioning of the machine without the final focus magnets and detector solenoid(no collision); the collision with the final focus system and the Belle II detector will be performed at the Phase-2 and Phase-3. The strategy for the luminosity upgrade is a novel ""nano-beam'' scheme found elsewhere*. In order to achieve the target luminosity; the vertical emittance has to be reduced by corrections of machine error measured by orbit responses. The vertical emittance should be achieved to be less than 6 pm(0.2 % coupling) during the Phase-1 by fully utilizing correction tools of skew quadrupole-like coils wound on sextupole magnets and power supplies for each correction coil in quadrupole magnets.

Crab waist collision scheme and small (1 mm) vertical beta function at the interaction point (IP) provide superior luminosity. At the top energy; radiation in the field of the opposite bunch (beamstrahlung) limits the beam lifetime and therefore achievable luminosity. Beamstrahlung influence depends on momentum acceptance of the lattice; the value of 2% provides acceptable lifetime. The small value of vertical beta function enhances effects of nonlinear chromaticity. The present work describes principles used in design and optimization of FCC-ee momentum acceptance optimization and are based on chromatic variations of beta function.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpor019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpor019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpor019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOR019,

A change management board oversees the process; establishes the review procedure based on the overall impact of the proposed change; decides; and monitors the implementation. This change management process has become an important factor that gives structure and direction to the ongoing design activities around the world. For example; one CR called for a harmonisation of the final focus quadrupole position between the two detector concepts; extensive studies from both experiments were carried out as part of the review process and took almost a year. Another CR by the experiments asked for a vertical shaft access to the interaction hall that required a relocation of the whole accelerator. The change process made sure that the stakeholders were part of the review and decision process from the beginning and contributed to a design change acceptable to all parties involved.

At the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) at CERN the feasibility of this principle is being tested in terms of performance and achievable specifications. The high-current drive beam is generated by recombining its parts in a delay loop and a combiner ring. Preserving the drive beam emittance during the recombination process is crucial to ensure beam-current and power production stability. Present theoretical and experimental studies show that non-linear energy dependence of the transverse optics heavily spoils the quality of the recombined beam. Conventionally these effects are cured by means of non-linear corrections using sextupoles. In this work we propose a mitigation of these effects by optimising the linear lattice; leading to a more robust and easy to operate drive beam recombination complex.

A charged beam with a offset from a center of a cavity is affected by the wakefield depending on the offset size in the acceleration cavity and the beam emittance is increased.

The generation of such beams is limited due to resonance effects at injection. The impact of resonances can be minimized by performing appropriate correction with dedicated magnets and by optimizing the tune working point. Currently the tune working point at injection is naturally set by the quadrupolar component generated by the one hundred combined function normal conducting magnets installed in the PS; and slightly corrected by low energy quadrupole magnets. In this paper; a study is presented exploiting the use of the available five auxiliary individually powered circuits to adjust the quadrupolar and higher-order multipole components for changing the tune integer at injection. Due to the non-linear contribution of each circuit to the magnetic field distribution a finite-element magnetic model was prepared to predict the required currents in the auxiliary coils.

The transport from SPS to LHC is done through the two Transfer Lines (TL); TI2 and TI8; for Beam 1 (B1) and Beam 2 (B2) respectively. During the first LHC operation period Run 1; a long term drift of the SPS orbit was observed; causing changes in the LHC injection due to the resulting changes in the TL trajectories. This translated into longer LHC turnaround because of the necessity to periodically correct the TL trajectories in order to preserve the beam quality at injection into the LHC. Different sources for the SPS orbit drifts have been investigated: each of them can account only partially for the total orbit drift observed.

The unavoidable losses intrinsic to such an extraction makes its optimisation one of the main priorities for operation; to reduce beam induced activation of the machine. The settings of the extraction systems; together with the tune sweep speed and the beam characteristics (momentum spread; emittance; etc.) are the parameters that can be controlled for spill and loss optimisation.

The RF gun of THOMX is a 2.5 cell standing wave copper cavity with resonance frequency of 2998.55 MHz at 30 °C under vacuum. The metal photocathode such as copper or magnesium is inserted into the backplane of the cavity. Due to high repetition rates up to 50 Hz with the average dissipated power into the internal surfaces up to 1.5 kW; causing a heating and deformation of the cavity shape. Therefore; the cooling system of the device has to be well designed to take under control the deformations of the structure; providing a temperature increase as small and uniform as possible. For this purpose a fully coupled electromagnetic-thermal-structural finite element analysis on this gun has been performed with Ansys workbench.

As an alternative to the thermionic electron gun foreseen in the baseline design; a photoinjector option is under study at CERN using the PHIN photoinjector; which was designed for a bunch charge of 2.3 nC and 1200 ns train length. During operation with nominal train length in 2014; a large pressure increase in the vacuum system; attributed to a heating of the Faraday cup; caused a degradation of the photocathode. To overcome this problem a vacuum window has been installed to separate the Faraday cup from the rest of the vacuum system. In addition the train length has been further increased to 1600 ns to advance the beam parameters towards CLIC requirements. In this paper recent improved photocathode lifetime measurements carried out under these new conditions will be presented and compared with earlier measurements. Furthermore; the utilized Cs2Te cathode has been analyzed with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) before and after its usage in PHIN to get a better understanding of photocathode surface deterioration effects; which will also be discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpow015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpow015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpow015_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOW015,

Simulations were carried out on the co-propagation of a field emitted; dark current halo and a photoemitted bunch in a typical 350 kV gun as used in an ERL or FEL injector; followed by a single cell buncher cavity. The photoemitted bunch repelled the halo longitudinally; leaving the area in the centre of the bunch with very low dark current; surrounded by two peaks of relatively high current at the front and back of the bunch. The peaks in current occur at all levels of dark current and were about 3.5 times the amplitude of the undisturbed dark current. The buncher caused the dark current to overcompress; forming a 'ghost' pulse an order of magnitude larger than the initial level of dark current; in front of the photoemitted bunch.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpow018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpow018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpow018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOW018,

Quantitative studies building on the experience of other facilities suggest the wiggler's NdFeB magnets are at risk of demagnetization due to radiation induced by the synchrotron's 2.9 GeV electrons. We use a phenomenological model to convert simulated peak demagnetizing fields into a radiation dose corresponding to a chosen %-demagnetization; and compare against an estimated dose per year due to injected beam. We find that injecting with the wiggler closed will cause 1% demagnetization in sections of its magnet blocks within 2 years of operation; assuming a worst case scenario. The wiggler has thus far been forced open for injections; but this will cease to be an option when CLS moves to top-up operation. In a related test; qualitative measurements of radiation during injections with the wiggler closed were taken by covering its magnets in Polaroid film. We find that radiation drops significantly when the injection efficiency is well-tuned. Our results suggest the wiggler will not receive damaging levels of radiation at closed gap so long as the injection system remains optimized.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpow036_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpow036.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpow036_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOW036,

These require a new software interface for set-point calculation based on the accelerator and timing model. Goal of the new scheme is a strict separation of the bidirectional ramp computation into an accelerator model dependent; a magnet dependent and a power supply dependent part. This introduces possible calibration/correction factors on each layer; thus allowing easy component replacement of the power supplies; the control units or even the magnets without the need for recalibration of the whole chain. In this contribution we will provide insights into the implementation of the new modeling scheme.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpoy001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpoy001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpoy001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOY001,

Using a slow resonance extraction method; it is possible to extract a quasi continuous electron beam with a maximum energy of 3.2 GeV to the test area. An external beam current of 100 pA to 1 fA can be realized. A further reduction of the beam current is envisaged as well. The beam width can be changed in both transverse directions from 1 mm to 8 mm. To dump and simultaneously measure the current of the electron beam behind the detector components a Faraday cup consisting of depleted uanium is used. The residual radiation leaving the cup is absorbed in a concrete casing. The radiation protection concept for the entire area of the new beamline was designed with the help of the Monte Carlo simulation program Fluka. In addition to the concrete casing; radiation protection walls were built to allow a safe working environment in the neighboring control room.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpoy002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpoy002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpoy002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOY002,

In the ELI-GBS; gamma rays are produced by means of Compton back-scattering to get mono-chromaticity (0; 1% bandwidth); a high flux (1013 photon/s the highest in the world); tunable directions and energies up to 19 MeV. Such gamma beam characteristic is obtained when a high-intensity laser collides a high-brightness electron-beam with energies up to 720 MeV. In order to increase the gamma beam flux; the electron beam operates at a repetition rate of 100 Hz in a multi-bunch mode: trains of 32 bunches; 16 ns apart; interact with the laser pulse recirculated 32 times through the interaction point. The EPICS Control System collects data from all sub-systems; constantly monitoring to ensure the safety of the ELI-GBS facility.

Based on long-standing experiences of HIT a very similar personnel concept was already available to be adapted to the MIT specialties. Within 9 months the directly started hiring process resulted in three technical teams with excellent engineers and technicians but with little or no accelerator experience. In parallel; three accelerator physicists were appointed for the executive team of MIT. Nevertheless for all hired persons a training program was set up consisting of technical instructions; lectures on fundamental accelerator physics and control system basics.

Previous studies of particle accelerator reliability have been undertaken using conventional techniques; such as Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD); Fault Tree Analysis (FTA); etc. Although limited data surrounding components and their failure modes limits the applicability of conventional techniques for analysing the reliability of particle accelerators. In addition industrial applications of particle accelerators; i.e. energy production; require a real time response to failure. In this paper we examine a holistic approach to accelerator reliability modelling using Electric Network Frequency (ENF) criterion to look for emergent behaviour of the particle accelerator; from complex datasets; such as beam current/charge; created by the diagnostics systems during the machines operation.

At Main Ring (MR); a discrepancy appears between the beam loss signal detected by the monitors and the residual dose measured. To understand this difference and the mechanism that produces these losses; a beam simulation study is implemented using the Strategic Accelerator Design (SAD) and Geometry and Tracking (Geant4) code. The first stage of the survey uses SAD to obtain the location of the losses around the lattice per turn. Then; Geant4 produces the secondary showers in the elements.

The main objective of HES-2 beamline is to deliver a hard X-ray FEL beam to target materials in such a manner that a coherent diffraction study is possible. This endstation is supposed to provide brilliant hard x-rays and to measure the diffraction patterns with forward scattering geometry. In particular; the instruments are designed for serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) and coherent diffraction imaging (CDI). In this poster; we introduce HES-2 beamline at PAL-XFEL in terms of two perspectives: beamline instrumentation and sample environment. In the instrumentation part; the current status of HES-2 beamline is described in details. This includes beamline layout; x-ray optics; beam diagnositics and the upcoming commissioning plan for HES-2 beamline. In the sample environment part; we aim to present scientific goals based on the sample environments for CXI and SFX respectively.

In the case of ultra-short highly charged electron accelerator; the beam is highly sensitive to timing jitter. Thus; a high level of synchronization accuracy is needed. In this paper; we describe the current synchronization system of PHIL (electron accelerator at LAL); and a new approach to synchronize PHIL externally with a high power femtosecond laser (LASERIX) . The main goal of the experience is to design and study a compact way to obtain ultra-short electron bunches (few tens to few hundreds of femtoseconds) under high charge levels (hundred pC). We continue with a description of different modifications made on PHIL timing master to adapt it to external synchronization.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpoy054_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpoy054.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpoy054_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOY054,

The RF timing distribution system is based on a 476 MHz reference line; which is converted to 2.856 GHz at 16 locations over 1.5 km distance using phase-locked DRO. The 2.856 GHz signals are amplified and split to 10 outputs; which is connected to LLRFs; BAMs; and DCMs through low timing drift cables. The jitter between two different PLDRO units is estimated to ~1 fs from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The synchronization jitter between a Ti:sapphire laser and the 2.856 GHz signal is measured less than 20 fs.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpoy057_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpoy057.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpoy057_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOY057,

To deliver beam to all four halls simultaneous-ly; a new timing pattern for electron bunches is needed at the injector. This pattern change has consequences for the frequency of the lasers at the photogun; beam behavior in the chopping system; beam optics due to space charge; and setup procedures. We have successfully demonstrated this new pattern using the three existing drive lasers. The implementation of the full system will occur when the fourth laser is added and upgrades to the Low Level RF (LLRF) are complete. In this paper we explain the new bunch pattern; the challenges for setting and measuring the pattern such as 180° RF phase ambiguity; addition of the fourth laser to the laser table and LLRF upgrade.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/thpoy060_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/thpoy060.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/thpoy060_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-THPOY060,

ipac2016,,FRXAA02,Low Energy Accelerator Mass Spectroscopy (AMS),ETH; Zurich; Switzerland; The technical evolution of AMS is summarized. AMS is the most sensitive isotope selective detection method for long-lived radionuclides; capable of measuring isotopic ratios as low as 1:1016. At present; C-14 is still the most important AMS nuclide but there are many applications of other nuclides such as Be-10; Al-26; Cl-36; Ca-41; I-129; and actinides. A key characteristic of any AMS system is the destruction of molecular interferences and subsequent analyses of atomic ions. In early instruments; highly charged ions (> 3+ ) were used; and fairly high ion energies; and as a consequence; large accelerators were required. Today; 1+ is used; molecular interferences are destroyed in multiple collisions with gas atoms or molecules at energies of a few hundred keV. Thus; C-14 AMS instruments develop towards lab size or tabletop devices. But; low energy AMS is not limited to radiocarbon only and there is a great potential for radionuclides not interfered by nuclear isobars. These developments have launched the wide spread use of AMS in various research fields and has resulted in a boom of new AMS facilities which impact the wide variety of applications of AMS in modern research.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/talks/frxaa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/papers/frxaa02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2016/posters/frxaa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-FRXAA02,
