        "The SuperKEKB commissioning has finally started. The final goal of luminosity is 40 times higher than KEKB. The injector upgrade is required to obtain the low emittance and high charge beam corresponding to the short beam life and small injection acceptance of the SuperKEKB ring. In the injector linac",
        "several new instruments have been installed. Flux Concentrator (FC) was developed for high charge positron beam production. The target bunch charge of positron beam is 4 nC. The new damping ring will be used for positron beam to reduce beam emittance to 10 mm-mrad. However",
        "electron beam must be reached to 20 mm-mrad normalized emittance at 5 nC beam charge without damping ring. Thermionic gun was used for KEKB injector and it was able to generate enough beam charge. However",
        "its emittance is too large. Therefor we developed photo cathode S-band RF gun. This new RF gun has unique accelerating cavity which called quasi-travelling wave side coupled cavity. Laser system for this photo cathode has been also developed. The laser system is constructed with Yb:YAG thin disk for high power and pulse shaping. I will illustrate the RF gun",
        "laser system and several new injector linac systems."

        "the normal conducting S-band Linac has been designed to accelerate 4·1010 particles in a bunch to 6 GeV and send two bunches per RF pulse within a repetition of 100 Hz. The FCC-ee positrons will also be created inside the linac at 4.46 GeV and accelerated to 1.54 GeV. These positrons are damped at the designed Damping Ring at that energy",
