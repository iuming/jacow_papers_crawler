        "At the energies of FCC-ee beam-beam effects get an extra dimension due to beamstrahlung - radiation in the field of the oncoming bunch. At high energies (175",
        "120 GeV) it limits the beam lifetime due to possible ingress of particles beyond the energy acceptance. At low energies (80",
        "45.5 GeV) beamstrahlung may lead to significant growth of the energy spread (and therefore the bunch length). We employed quasi-strong-strong tracking code Lifetrac to study the beam-beam effects in FCC-ee at 45.5 GeV. It was found that the collider performance here is limited by a peculiar flip-flop instability",
        "which is triggered by the bunch lengthening due to beamstrahlung. We discuss how it depends on different parameters: RF voltage",

        "it is proposed to decrease beta-x at the IP and to increase emittance-x.",
