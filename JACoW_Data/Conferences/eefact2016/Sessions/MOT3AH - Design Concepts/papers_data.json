        "VEPP-2000 e+e− collider at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics was commissioned in 2009 and collected data during three runs in whole designed energy range of 160-1000 MeV per beam. The Round Colliding Beams concept was implemented at VEPP-2000 to get a significant enhancement in beam-beam limit. The beam-beam parameter value as high as 0.12 per IP was achieved at intermediate energy. To obtain more intensive beams and achieve target luminosity at top energies the injection chain upgrade was done during 2013-2016. Presently VEPP-2000 is recommissioned and ready to start data taking."
