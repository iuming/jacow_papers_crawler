        "Introduction to the session on beam polarization and energy calibration – physics goals: precision measurements of Z (100 keV) and W masses (300 keV) – expected challenges – baseline method uses resonant depolarization for the Z and W masses – physics processes such as e+e− –> Z gamma fo the higher energy are adequate for the Higgs and top qoark masses – this requires 1) transverse polarization up to and including the W pair threshold. 2) regular depolarization using spectator bunches. 3) extrapolation from beam energy to center-of-mass energy – if the ring is too small",
        "beam polarization may not be available at the W pair threshold and another method has to be investigated to provide adequate precision.",

This paper presents some ideas which may lead to a feasible design of such devices. The idea is to employ solenoids interleaved with the arc dipoles",

        "which can rotate an initially vertical spin to any desired direction. The solenoids should be (approximately) optically transparent",
