        "This talk will overview recent progress in developing of non-evaporable getter (NEG) coatings. NEG coatings are widely used in particle accelerator as a complex solution which addresses a few problems. It is a barrier for gas diffusion from the vacuum chamber material",
        "it reduces photon and electron stimulated desorption by an order of magnitude. It provides a distributed pumping speed",
        "making NEG is the most economical and",
        "in many cases",
        "the only vacuum solution for long and narrow vacuum chambers. Another important property of NEG coating is its low SEY (after NEG activation)",
        "so it reduces a risk of e-cloud and beam induced electron mitipacting. The NEG coating surface resistance was recently studied in ASTeC. New experimental data and a model allow calculating NEG coating impedance in wide range of RF frequencies.",
