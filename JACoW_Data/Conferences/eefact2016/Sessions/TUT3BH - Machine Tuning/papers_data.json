        "Phase 1 without the final focus system and before Belle II detector roll-in. In order to accomplish a extremely high luminosity of 8x1035 cm-2s-1",
        "the nano-beam scheme is adopted. Since the vertical emittance is one of keys in this scheme",
        "optics corrections for low emittance tuning are applied. The non-interleaved sextupole scheme is utilized in the arc section. Skew quadrupole-like corrector is equipped for each sextupole. These skew quadrupole-like correctors can correct both X-Y coupling and physical vertical dispersions which induce the vertical emittance. Beta function and physical horizontal dispersion are corrected by fudge factors of quadrupoles and/or horizontal orbit bumps at the sextupoles. Overall optics performance as well as the strategy of low emittance tuning is also presented."

        "an extreme focusing of the beam is required in the interaction regions with a low vertical beta function of 2 mm at the IP. Moreover",
        "the FCC-ee physics program requires very low emittances never achieved in a collider with 1.3 nm for εx and 2 pm for εy at 175~GeV",
        "reducing the coupling ratio to around 2/1000. With such requirements",
        "any field errors and sources of coupling will introduce spurious vertical dispersion which degrades emittances",

        "a challenging correction scheme based on dispersion free steering and linear coupling correction is proposed to keep the coupling and the vertical emittance as low as possible."
