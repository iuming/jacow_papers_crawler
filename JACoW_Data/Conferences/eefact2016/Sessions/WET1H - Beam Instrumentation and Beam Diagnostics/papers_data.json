        "User operations of modern synchrotron light sources require very high stability of the electron beam in the light generating devices (wigglers and undulators)",
        "usually at the level of 5-10% of the beam size. The beam stability is provided by use of fast orbit feedback systems",
        "the essential parts of which are beam position monitors (BPMs). Since the beam emittance is very low",
        "the BPMs should provide reliable beam position measurements with sub-micron accuracy. Some aspects of design of modern BPM systems are given",
        "the measured BPM resolution is presented",
        "and some techniques of the resolution improvement are discussed.",

        "Electron beam interaction with the monochromatic laser radiation produces scattered photons and electrons due to the Compton effect. Both types of scattered particles carry the information about the polarisation (if any) and the energy of initial electrons in the beam. This report is focused on the properties of the scattered electrons. After a bending magnet these electrons leave the beam and their X-Y space distribution is supposed to be measured by the 2D pixel detector. We show that if the electron beam vertical emittance is sufficiently small",
        "the shape of this distribution is an ellipse. Measurement of the length of the X-axis of this ellipse allow to calibrate accurately the bending field integral seen by the beam. The distribution of the electrons within the ellipse depends on the initial beam polarisation",
        "allowing to measure its degree and direction. So we propose a universal Compton polarimeter with a unique feature of precise calibration of the LEP-style beam energy spectrometer. The approach is thought to be useful for the future high-energy e+/e− colliders",
        "while the feasibility tests need to be performed on existing accelerators."
