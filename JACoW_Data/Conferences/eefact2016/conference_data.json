The Round Colliding Beams concept was implemented at VEPP-2000 to get a significant enhancement in beam-beam limit. The beam-beam parameter value as high as 0.12 per IP was achieved at intermediate energy. To obtain more intensive beams and achieve target luminosity at top energies the injection chain upgrade was done during 2013-2016. Presently VEPP-2000 is recommissioned and ready to start data taking."

After a bending magnet these electrons leave the beam and their X-Y space distribution is supposed to be measured by the 2D pixel detector. We show that if the electron beam vertical emittance is sufficiently small",
            "the shape of this distribution is an ellipse. Measurement of the length of the X-axis of this ellipse allow to calibrate accurately the bending field integral seen by the beam. The distribution of the electrons within the ellipse depends on the initial beam polarisation",
            "allowing to measure its degree and direction. So we propose a universal Compton polarimeter with a unique feature of precise calibration of the LEP-style beam energy spectrometer. The approach is thought to be useful for the future high-energy e+/e− colliders",
            "while the feasibility tests need to be performed on existing accelerators."

            "Future high luminosity colliders ask for high beam power. The main task of the RF power coupler is to transfer the RF power from the generator to the cavity and to the beam. It also provides the matching between the RF generator and the cavity / beam system. Other tasks are the vacuum barrier for the beam vacuum and the connection between the low temperature of the superconducting cavity and the room temperature environment. In this talk we will discuss the requirements of power couplers for future colliders. We compare possible design approaches in respect to RF and non RF related functions and address problems of material and fabrication technologies. Many power couplers for different power levels and cavity designs are designed",

The Round Colliding Beams concept was implemented at VEPP-2000 to get a significant enhancement in beam-beam limit. The beam-beam parameter value as high as 0.12 per IP was achieved at intermediate energy. To obtain more intensive beams and achieve target luminosity at top energies the injection chain upgrade was done during 2013-2016.

These skew quadrupole-like correctors can correct both X-Y coupling and physical vertical dispersions which induce the vertical emittance. Beta function and physical horizontal dispersion are corrected by fudge factors of quadrupoles and/or horizontal orbit bumps at the sextupoles. Overall optics performance as well as the strategy of low emittance tuning is also presented."

Both types of scattered particles carry the information about the polarisation (if any) and the energy of initial electrons in the beam.

After a bending magnet these electrons leave the beam and their X-Y space distribution is supposed to be measured by the 2D pixel detector. We show that if the electron beam vertical emittance is sufficiently small",

Other tasks are the vacuum barrier for the beam vacuum and the connection between the low temperature of the superconducting cavity and the room temperature environment. In this talk we will discuss the requirements of power couplers for future colliders. We compare possible design approaches in respect to RF and non RF related functions and address problems of material and fabrication technologies.

        "it reduces photon and electron stimulated desorption by an order of magnitude. It provides a distributed pumping speed",
        "making NEG is the most economical and",
        "in many cases",
        "the only vacuum solution for long and narrow vacuum chambers. Another important property of NEG coating is its low SEY (after NEG activation)",
        "so it reduces a risk of e-cloud and beam induced electron mitipacting. The NEG coating surface resistance was recently studied in ASTeC. New experimental data and a model allow calculating NEG coating impedance in wide range of RF frequencies.",

We started the study in early 2015 and first focused on simulation where the ILC electron beams at 250 GeV is dumped into a gas chamber so as to create a plasma and therefore to achieve efficient deceleration. We will also consider energy recovery from the created plasma in the gas chamber. The article presents the current status of these studies.",
