        "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is based upon a high power heavy ion driver linac under construction at Michigan State University under a cooperative agreement with the US DOE. The construction of conventional facilities already started in the summer",
        "2013",
        "and the accelerator production began from the summer",
        "2014. FRIB will accelerate all the stable ion beams from proton to uranium beyond a beam energy of 200 MeV/u and up to a beam power of 400 kW to produce a great number of various rare isotopes using SRF linac. The FRIB SRF driver linac makes use of four kinds of SRF structures. Totally 332 two gap cavities and 48 cryomodules are needed. All SRF hardware components have been validated and are now moving to production. The SRF infrastructure also has been constructed in MSU campus. This talk will present FRIB project and challenges regarding SRF technologies. The status of SRF linac hardware validation and their production",
        "SRF infrastructure status and plan shall be addressed. The information that can be relevant for future large scale proton/ion SRF linacs will also be provided."
