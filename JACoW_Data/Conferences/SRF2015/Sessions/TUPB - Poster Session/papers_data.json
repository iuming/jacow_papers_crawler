Processes such as the high pressure rinsing and the buffer chemical polishing are being developed at Daresbury Laboratory and the manufacturing of the cavity half cells and beampipes are being optimised by Shakespeare Engineering to enable this target to be achieved. These are discussed in this paper."

Diamond is a third generation synchrotron light source with storage ring current maintained by two superconducting CESR-B cavities powered by IOT-driven RF amplifiers. In our case",
        "undesirable beam motion in the kilohertz range is predominantly driven by spectral content in the voltage across the IOTs arising from the switched mode nature of the high voltage power supply. Spectral noise on the amplifiers and beam has been identified and characterised and efforts to eliminate this noise are described. Care has been taken to maintain the overall stability of the RF at Diamond and tests have been carried out on an infrared beamline to investigate the degree to which beam noise impacts beamline operation in its different operating configurations.",

The amplitude and phase of the superbuncher and time energy lens also have to be correctly set. The linac set up procedure developed at ANU utilises a beam profile monitor in the middle of a 180 degree achromat and a new technique based on a superconducting resonator operating in a beam bunch detection mode. Both techniques are used to derive a full set of phase distributions for quick and efficient setting up of the entire linac. Verification of the superconducting phase detector is accomplished during routine linac operations and is complemented by longitudinal phase space simulations. The new technique allows better resolution for setting the resonator acceleration phase and better sensitivity to accelerating current.",

        "The ANU Heavy Ion Facility comprises a 15 MV electrostatic accelerator followed by a superconducting linac booster. The beam is foil stripped in the terminal and then stripped again to provide high charge states at the entrance to the linac. Employment of double terminal stripping allows the system to accelerate beams with mass up to 70 amu. The disadvantage of double terminal stripping is low beam intensity of few particle nA delivered to the linac. The linac encompasses twelve β=0.1 lead tin plated Split Loop Resonators (SLR) housed in four module cryostats. One of the linac set up procedures that developed at ANU utilises U-bend at the end of the linac. One special wide Beam Profile Monitor (BPM) is installed after 90 degrees magnet. The technique allows to set correct phase by observing the displacement of beam profile versus phase shift of the last phase locked resonator. In this paper a simple method has been proposed to improve sensitivity of commercially available BPM for efficient operation with low beam intensities. The system demonstrated very high stability",

The study considers the possibility to coat a copper resonator with an Nb3Sn layer by means of magnetron sputtering using an alloyed target. We present the impact of the process parameters on the as-deposited layer stoichiometry. The latter is in good agreement with previous results reported in the literature and can be tuned by acting on the coating pressure. The effect of post-coating annealing temperature on the morphology",

        "A radiofrequency (RF) cavity and cryostat dedicated to the measurement of superconducting coatings at GHz frequencies was designed to evaluate surface resistive losses on a flat sample. The test cavity consists of two parts: a cylindrical half-cell made of bulk niobium (Nb) and a flat Nb disc. The two parts can be thermally and electrically isolated via a vacuum gap",

The RF test provides simple cavity Q-factor measurements as well as calorimetric measurements of the losses on the sample.

Energy re-reflected from the circulator can systematically bias the measured cavity decay time which is used to determine the loaded quality factor. Use of the peak probe power or the minimum of the reflected power to determine the cavity resonance frequency rather than the peak of the probe/forward transfer function may lead to errors in the resonance frequency that can also affect quality factors.

The more recently developed approach is to use a digital low level RF (LLRF) system in self excited loop (SEL) mode to track the cavity frequency. Using a digital LLRF system in SEL mode has the advantage that it is much easier to lock to the cavity’s resonant frequencies and they tend to have a wider capture range. This paper will report on the system designs used to implement the 12 GeV digital LLRF system in the JLAB vertical test area. Additionally",
        "it will report on the system modifications which are being implemented so that the RF infrastructure in the VTA will be ready to support the LCLS II cryomodule production effort",
        "which is scheduled to begin in calendar year 2016.",

        "Hamburg. Testing of such a large volume of components requires a management system which can store the measurement data. In addition the system should simplify tasks which are recurrent. In the case of the system developed at AMTF",
        "communication with external databases has also been developed. An added complication is that not all the test procedures are identical for each component",
        "and therefore the management system keeps track of all work done for each of the individual components. In the case of the vertical acceptance tests for the 800 SRF cavities",
        "the management system provides an interface for specifying a decision of the next step each cavity (e.g. send for module assembly or retreatment). This paper describes the most important parts of this system.",

The superconducting heavy ion linear accelerator of the Isotope Separation and Acceleration (ISAC) facility utilizes medium beta quarter wave cavities cooled down to 4 K. The Advanced Rare IsotopE Laboratory (ARIEL) is a major expansion of the ISAC facility. ARIEL SRF electron linear accelerator (e-linac) operates nine-cell TESLA type cavities at 2 K. Both accelerators have dedicated cryogenic systems including liquid helium plants and distribution systems. In addition to accelerator cryogenic support",

TRIUMF’s SRF development involves both SRF testing facility and accelerators cryogenic support systems.
