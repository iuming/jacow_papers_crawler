The complete expulsion of the magnetic flux can lead to record-high Qs at accelerating gradients of ~20 MV/m. High Qs were achieved in ambient magnetic fields up to 190 mG. These findings open up a way to ultra-high quality factors at low temperatures and show an alternative to the sophisticated magnetic shielding implemented in modern superconducting accelerators.",

Cavities with a wide range of MFP values were tested in uniform ambient magnetic fields to measure trapped magnetic flux and resulting increase in RF surface resistance. MFP values were determined from surface impedance measurements. It was found that larger mean free paths lead to lower sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux."

        "For CW applications much effort is being expended to minimize the power dissipation (surface resistance) of niobium cavities. Previous studies have shown that residual resistance can be reduced by performing a thermal cycle",
        "a procedure of warming up a cavity after initial cooldown to about 20K and cooling it down again. It was postulated that thermocurrents during cooldown generate additional trapped magnetic flux that impacts the cavity quality factor. Here",
        "we present a more extensive study that includes measurements of two additional passband modes and that confirms the effect. A change in surface resistance of more than a factor seven was observed. In this paper",
        "we also discuss simulations that support the claim. While the layout of the cavity LHe tank system is cylindrically symmetric",
        "we show that the temperature dependence of the material parameters results in a non-symmetric current distribution."

We present the proof that the real origin of quench-related quality factor degradation is consequence only of ambient magnetic field trapped at the quench spot. Also",
