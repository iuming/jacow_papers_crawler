        "CW SRF Cavities have been used very successfully in the past in synchrotron light sources to provide high power acceleration. Here we present a novel application of higher harmonic systems of two frequencies (1.5 GHz and 1.75 GHz) to generate a beating of accelerating voltage. With such a system it is possible to store \"standard\" (some 10 ps long) and \"short\" (ps and sub-ps long) pulses simultaneously in the light source. This opens up brand new possibilities for light source users to perform dynamic and high-resolution experiments at the same facility. The demands on the SRF system and RF control are substantial and a new design",
        "based on waveguide damping",
        "is currently being developed. This system will be used for a major upgrade of the BESSY-II facility to the BESSY Variable Pulse Storage Ring (BESSY-VSR) for a next-generation storage-ring light source. We will discuss the concept",
