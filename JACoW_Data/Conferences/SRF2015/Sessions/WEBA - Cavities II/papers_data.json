The RIKEN superconducting linac consists of 14 cryomodules each of which contains four quarter-wave-resonators (QWRs) in each. The QWR operates at an rf frequency of 73 MHz in the continuous wave mode with beta as low as 0.055-1.008. A coaxial probe-type RF fundamental power-coupler which transmits RF power of several kW will be utilized for beam loading of 1.3 kW/resonator at the maximum with Qext of several x106. Tuning of the resonant frequency will be realized with a mechanical tuner pressing the resonator wall in the direction parallel to the beam. This year",

        "fabricated and installed in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The cavity operates at 4.4 K with a “quiet helium source” to isolate the cavity from environmental acoustic noise. The cavity is a beam driven quarter wave resonator. It is detuned and damped during injection and acceleration cycles and is brought to operation only at store energy. We have observed clear luminosity increase and bunch length reduction in the first operation of the cavity with Au + Au and Au + He3 collisions. The cavity voltage was limited by quenching in the Higher Order Mode coupler. This paper also discusses the cavity beam experiments with no higher order mode coupler in p + p and p + Au RHIC operation."
