SRF2015,,MOAA05,Status of the RISP Superconducting Heavy Ion Accelerator,IBS; Daejeon; Republic of Korea; Construction of the RISP heavy ion accelerator facility is in progress in Korea. The driver linac is a superconducting linac that can accelerate uranium to proton beams; delivering 400 kW beam power to various targets. Prototyping and test of the superconducting cavities and cryomodules are proceeding. Prototype superconducting cavities were fabricated through domestic vendors and their vertical tests were performed in collaboration with TRIUMF.

The complete expulsion of the magnetic flux can lead to record-high Qs at accelerating gradients of ~20 MV/m. High Qs were achieved in ambient magnetic fields up to 190 mG.

SRF2015,,MOBA03,Sensitivity of Niobium Superconducting RF Cavities to Magnetic Field,D. Gonnella; J.J. Kaufman; M. Liepe; Cornell University (CLASSE); Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; New York; USA; One important characteristic of nitrogen-doped cavities is their very high sensitivity to increased residual surface resistance from trapped ambient magnetic flux. We have performed a systematic study on the losses by trapped flux; and their dependence on the mean-free-path (MFP) of the niobium RF penetration layer. Cavities with a wide range of MFP values were tested in uniform ambient magnetic fields to measure trapped magnetic flux and resulting increase in RF surface resistance. MFP values were determined from surface impedance measurements. It was found that larger mean free paths lead to lower sensitivity to trapped magnetic flux.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/moba03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/moba03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/moba03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOBA03,34
SRF2015,,MOBA04,High-Q Operation of SRF Cavities: The Impact of Thermocurrents on the RF Surface Resistance,J.M. Köszegi; J. Knobloch; O. Kugeler; HZB; Berlin; Germany; For CW applications much effort is being expended to minimize the power dissipation (surface resistance) of niobium cavities. Previous studies have shown that residual resistance can be reduced by performing a thermal cycle; a procedure of warming up a cavity after initial cooldown to about 20K and cooling it down again. It was postulated that thermocurrents during cooldown generate additional trapped magnetic flux that impacts the cavity quality factor. Here; we present a more extensive study that includes measurements of two additional passband modes and that confirms the effect. A change in surface resistance of more than a factor seven was observed. In this paper; we also discuss simulations that support the claim. While the layout of the cavity LHe tank system is cylindrically symmetric; we show that the temperature dependence of the material parameters results in a non-symmetric current distribution.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/moba04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/moba04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/moba04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOBA04,37
SRF2015,,MOBA05,Nature of Quality Factor Degradation in SRF Cavities due to Quench,Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Superconductive quench is a well-known phenomenon that causes magnetic flux trapping in superconducting accelerating cavities increasing the radio-frequency surface resistance. This paper is addressed to the understanding of the quench-induced losses nature. We present the proof that the real origin of quench-related quality factor degradation is consequence only of ambient magnetic field trapped at the quench spot. Also; we show how the quality factor can be fully recovered after it was highly deteriorated quenching several times in presence of external magnetic field. Such phenomenon was found to be completely reliable up to certain values of applied magnetic field; above that the cavity quality factor cannot be fully recovered anymore.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/moba05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/moba05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/moba05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOBA05,41

SRF2015,,MOPB001,RF Performance of Ingot Niobium Cavities of Medium-Low Purity,G. Ciovati; P. Dhakal; P. Kneisel; G.R. Myneni; J.K. Spradlin; JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; Superconducting radio-frequency cavities made of ingot niobium with residual resistivity ratio (RRR) greater than 250 have proven to have similar or better performance than fine-grain Nb cavities of the same purity; after standard processing. The high purity requirement contributes to the high cost of the material. As superconducting accelerators operating in continuous-wave typically require cavities to operate at moderate accelerating gradients; using lower purity material could be advantageous not only to reduce cost but also to achieve higher Q0-values; because of the well-known dependence of the BCS-surface resistance on mean free path. In this contribution we present the results from cryogenic RF tests of 1.3-1.5 GHz single-cell cavities made of ingot Nb of medium (RRR=100-150) and low (RRR=60) purity from different suppliers. Cavities made of medium-purity ingots routinely achieved peak surface magnetic field values greater than 70 mT with Q0-values above 1.5·1010 at 2 K. The performance of cavities made of low-purity ingots were affected by significant pitting of the surface after chemical etching.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB001,61
SRF2015,,MOPB002,Observation of High Field Q-Slope in 3 GHz Nb Cavities,G.V. Eremeev; F.E. Hannon; JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; A degradation of the unloaded quality factor is commonly observed above about 100 mT in elliptical niobium cavities. The cause of this degradation has not been fully understood yet; but the empirically found solution of heating to about 100-120 C for 24-48 hrs. eliminates the degradation in electropolished fine grain or large grain niobium cavities. While numerous experiments related to this phenomenon have been done at 1.3 GHz and 1.5 GHz; little data exists at other frequencies; and the frequency dependence of this degradation is not clear. We have measured the unloaded quality factor of 3 GHz fine grain niobium cavities; which were chemically polished as the final treatment before RF tests in a vertical Dewar and observed the characteristic degradation in two cavities. The measurement of the quality factor degradation at different bath temperatures points to a field-dependent rather than a temperature-related effect.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB002,66

The exact dependence of the surface resistance on the magnitude of the RF field is not well understood. We present an analysis of experimental data of LT1-3 and LT1-4; 1.3 GHz single-cell nitrogen-doped cavities prepared and tested at Cornell. Most interestingly; the cavities display anti-Q slopes in the medium-field region (i.e. Rs decreases with increasing accelerating field). We extract the temperature dependent surface resistances of the cavities; analyze field dependencies; and compare with theoretical predictions. These comparisons and analyses provide new insights into the field dependence of the surface resistance and improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind the effect.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB004,74

Such cracks cause resistance to heat conduction from the RF surface to the liquid He bath. A delamination crack can negate the advances in manufacturing processes that have enhanced the thermal conductivity of Nb. Here; temperature excesses are calculated as functions of crack size and location; and the power dissipated at an imperfection in the RF surface. A disk shape of Nb sheet is modeled as having adiabatic sides. A hemispherical defect is located on the RF surface at the center of this section. A crack is modeled as a void within the Nb disk. The Kapitza resistance between the Nb surface and liquid He is varied. The results indicate that an incipient crack leads to a decrease in the magnetic flux required to cause thermal breakdown. The decrease in the field is gradual with increasing crack radius; until the crack radius nearly equals the section radius; after which the field required for breakdown decreases sharply. To a lesser extent; the field strength for thermal breakdown also decreases with increased crack depth.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,Funding: Work supported by US DOE Cooperative Agreement DE-SC0000661 and Michigan State University.,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB007,82
SRF2015,,MOPB008,Theoretical Field Limit and Cavity Surface Conditions: Nano-Scale Topography and Sub-millimeter Pit,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; The recent two theoretical papers*; ** are briefly introduced. The former addresses the superheating field (Bs) suppression due to nano-defects distributing almost continuously on the cavity surface*. We introduce a model of the nano-defect. An analytical formula for Bs suppression factor is derived. By using the formula; suppression factors of bulk or multilayer superconductors and those after various surface processing technologies can be evaluated. An application to the dirty Nb processed by EP is also presented as an example. The latter address the magnetic field enhancement (MFE) at the sub-millimeter pit on the surface of cavity; which is thought to cause quench**. There exists the famous well-type pit model; but many of pits are not well-type but have gentle slopes. Impacts of the slope angle on MFE have not been well understood. We introduce a model that can describe a pit with an arbitrary slope angle. A formula to evaluate the MFE factor is derived. A pit with a gentle slope angle yields a much smaller MFE factor than the well-type pit. The formula can be applied to the calculation of MFE factors of real pits with arbitrary slope angles.; * T.

A rather straightforward two-fluid model description of the Q-slope in the low and high field domains is extended to the case of the recently experimentally identified increase of the Q-value with the RF field obtained by so-called ""N-doping”.; This paper was initiated when one of the authors (W.W.; retiree from CERN) visited Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; NY.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan",,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB010,95

While some findings favor a fast cool-down; others suggest a slow cycle to be advantageous; and many variations to that have been investigated: the role of thermocurrents; amount of ambient magnetic field and flux trapping. This paper will investigate; how uniformly different cool-down procedures are and if they can explain the more efficient magnetic flux expulsion.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB011,100

The temperature all around the cavity is monitored during its cool down across the critical temperature; in order to visualize the different dynamics of fast and slow cool-down; which determine considerable difference in terms of magnetic field expulsion and cavity performance. The study is performed placing a single cell 1.3 GHz elliptical cavity perpendicularly to the helium cooling flow; which is representative of how SRF cavities are cooled in an accelerator. Hence; the study involves geometrical considerations regarding the cavity horizontal configuration; underling the different impact of the various magnetic field components on the surface resistance.

The study is focused on the understanding of the different parameters which determine the trapped flux surface resistance; and how this change as a function of different surface treatments. The study is performed on 1.3 GHz niobium cavities processed with different surface treatments after the 800 C bake: electro-polishing (EP); 120 C baking; and N-doping varying the time of the Nitrogen exposure. The trapped flux surface resistance normalized for the trapped magnetic flux is then analyzed as a function of the mean free path in order to find the surface treatment which minimized the trapped flux sensitivity.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb015_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB015,115

Therefore; the relationship between magnetic flux behavior and microstructural defects in carefully strained SRF Nb sheet was investigated. Laue X-ray and EBSD-OIM crystallographic analyses of large grain ingot slices were used to characterize microstructural defects and then predict which grains and sample orientations will produce desired model defects due to tensile deformation. Grain orientations were chosen to favor specific slip systems; which generate dislocations with special angles with respect to the sample surface. Nb bicrystals were also prepared to investigate the effects of grain boundaries on flux pinning. The generated defect structures were confirmed by OIM and TEM. Cryogenic magneto-optical imaging was used to directly observe the penetration of magnetic flux into the deformed Nb. These model samples have deformation that is similar to that expected in typical cavity forming processes.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB018,120

The two main mechanisms considered in such approach are the oscillation of the magnetic flux trapped in the superconductor due to the Lorentz force; and the static resistance associated to the normal conducting vortex core. The model derived shows a good description of the available experimental data; highlighting that the radio frequency vortex dissipation is mostly due to the static part of the surface resistance. We show that the surface resistance for 100% trapped flux normalized to the trapped field (expressed in nOhm/mG) can be approximated to R/B=18.3*(l f)1/2/(50.1+l) with l the mean free path in nm and f the frequency in GHz.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB020,129

We continued R&D on Quench Detectors (QD) activity for locating quench in SRF cavities via 2nd sound in superfluid helium. We investigated 2 kinds of QD: Capacitive OST (COST) and Low Response time resistive Thermometers (LRT). A test stand operating in LHe (Temperature: T0) was used for the characterization of the QD by means of precise experimental simulation of SRF cavity quench (pulsed heat flux qP). For improving spatial resolution of QD; smaller COSTs were developed and tested. We investigated the dynamic response of QD as function of different parameters (heater size/geometry; T0; qP) and data are reported. Further; a 2nd Sound Resonator (SSR); with a pair of COSTs at its 2 extremities as 2nd Sound Generator (SSG) and Detector (SSD) respectively and housing also a low heat capacity heater (SSG) and a LRT (SSD) assembly was developed.

To avoid these particulate field emitters; careful cleaning and handling of individual cavities and clean room assembly of cavity strings are common practice. Despite these elaborate processes; some particulates persist to stay on the final surface of a beam-ready cavity. Moreover; as will be shown in this contribution; new particulates accumulate after a cryomodule is placed in the accelerator tunnel. The nature of these accumulated particulates on the inner surface of a beam-accelerating cavity is largely unknown for two reasons: (1) lack of access to such surfaces; (2) lack of a workable procedure for investigation without destroying the cavity. In this contribution; we report the first study on found actual particulates on the inner surface of 5-cell CEBAF cavities in a full-scale cryomodule previously operated with beam. The nature of the studied particulates is presented.

The nitrogen doping experiment has been successfully repeated and demonstrated. But the mechanism of the nitrogen doping effect remains unclear. Nitrogen doping study on niobium samples was carried out in Peking University. The niobium samples were manual processed to avoid heat generation. The experiment condition is close to that of the Fermilab. After the nitrogen doping treatment; the samples were mildly electropolished with the thickness of 1.3μm; 1.9μm; 3.3μm; 4.2μm; 5.1μm; 5.9μm and 7.0μm. The time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements show that the samples directly after nitrogen doping have a much higher nitrogen concentration in the depth of about 90nm. When the EP removal is larger than 1.3μm; the samples’ impurity elements is remarkably reduced and their distribution is similar to each other. Also the measured results to some extent prove that EP removal can introduce H to the niobium surface.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb036_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb036.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb036_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB036,169

After each test; the cavities were thermally cycled to 120 K and then re-cooled and retested to assess if evidence of hydrogen migration might appear even at a small level. In addition; TD-5 was also tested at fixed low field (Q0 vs. T) to fit standard BCS theory.

In order to test the feasibility of these goals; four nitrogen-doped cavities have been tested at Cornell in the Horizontal Test Cryomodule (HTC) in five separate tests. The first three tests consisted of cavities assembled in the HTC with high Q input coupler. The fourth test used the same cavity as the third but with the prototype high power LCLS-II coupler installed. Finally; the fifth test used a high power LCLS-II coupler; cavity tuner; and HOM antennas. Here we report on the results from these tests along with a systematic analysis of change in performance due to the various steps in preparing and assembling LCLS-II cavities for cryomodule operation. These results represent one of the final steps to demonstrate readiness for full prototype cryomodule assembly for LCLS-II.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB041,182

Plastic deformation governed by slip is complicated in body-centered cubic metals like Nb. Besides the crystal orientation with respect to the applied stress (Schmid effect); slip is also affected by other factors including temperature; strain rate; strain history; and non-Schmid effects such as twinning/anti-twinning asymmetry and non-glide shear stresses. A clear understanding of slip is an essential step towards modeling the deep drawing of large grain ingot slices; hence predicting the final microstructure/performance of cavities. Two groups of single crystals; with and without a prior heat treatment; were deformed to 40% engineering strain in uniaxial tension. Differences in flow stresses and active slip systems between the two groups were observed; likely due to the removal of preexisting dislocations. Crystal plasticity modeling of the stress-strain behavior suggests that the non-Schmid effect is small in Nb; and that the deep drawing process might be approximated with a Schmid model.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb045_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb045.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb045_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB045,191

SEE is highly dependent on the state of the surface. During electron beam welding process; significant amount of heat is introduced into the material causing the microstructure change of Niobium (Nb). Currently; all simulation codes for field emission and multipacting are treating the inside of the cavity as a uniform; homogeneous surface. Due to its complex shape and fabricating procedure; and the sensitivity of the SEE on the surface state; it would be interesting to see if the Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) parameters vary in the surface area on and near the equator weld. For that purpose; we have developed experimental setup that can measure accurately the energy distribution of the SEY of coupon-like like samples. To test the influence of the weld area on the SEY of Nb; dedicated samples are made from a welded plate using electron beam welding parameters common for cavity fabrication.

A new spectrometer has been developed to allow sample testing with a field varying from 0 to 300mT applied along the sample face (parallel geometry) analogous to rf fields in SRF resonators.

However; the mechanism of enhancement has not been clearly explained. Our experiments explore how N2-doping influences Nb bulk and surface superconducting properties; and compare the N2-doped properties with those obtained previously with conventionally treated samples. High purity Nb-rod was mechanically deformed and post treated based on a typical SRF cavity treatment recipe. The onset of flux penetration at Hc1; and the upper and the surface critical fields; Hc2 and Hc3; were characterized by magnetic hysteresis and AC susceptibility techniques. The surface depth profile responsible for superconductivity was examined by changing AC amplitude in AC susceptibility; and the microstructure was directly observed with EBSD-OIM. We are also investigating surface chemistry for detailed composition using XPS. We have found that N2-doping at 800 °C significantly reduces the Hc3/Hc2 ratio towards the ideal value of ~1.7; and conclude that AC susceptibility is capable of following changes to the surface properties induced by N2-doping.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,Funding: Support for this work at FSU was from US DOE Award# DE-SC0009960 and the State of Florida Additional support for the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory facilities is from the NSF: NSF-DMR-1157490,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB052,214

The crystallographic texture (preferred crystal orientation) and microstructure in polycrystalline sheet varies considerably; so identifying its influence on properties is needed to achieve a better understanding of how to control properties of high purity niobium. Samples extracted from many lots produced by Tokyo Denkai and Ningxia sheet were examined. Through-thickness texture of the undeformed niobium samples was measured using electron backscattered pattern mapping. Texture is identified with pole figures; orientation distribution function; and grain misorientation relationships. Stress-strain tests were done to identify ultimate tensile stress; elongation; 0.2% yield strength; and hardening rate.

Following various doping recipes; cavity cutouts and flat niobium samples have been evaluated with XRD; SEM; SIMS and TEM in order to relate structural and compositional changes in the niobium near-surface to SRF performance. Annealing of Nb cavities with nitrogen for various durations and at various temperatures lead to a layer containing inclusions of non-superconducting Nb nitride phases; followed by unreacted Nb with an elevated N-interstitials concentration. We found that EP of the N-treated cavities removes the unwanted niobium nitride phases; confirming that performance benefits are originating from the elevated concentration of N interstitials. The role of low temperature Nb hydride precipitants in the performance limitation of N-doped cavities was evaluated by TEM temperature dependent studies.

This deficiency of knowledge limits the predictibality in raw material properties for fine grain sheets; which are less anisotropic and easier to deform uniformly than large grain sheets. Studies on modeling and simulation of deformation of Nb are also limited. Therefore design of a new manufacturing procedure becomes a costly process; because models predicting the deformation of Nb are not accurate. A polycrystal is an aggregate of single crystals. Tensile tests were performed on single crystal with different orientations; to study the deformation behavior of Nb. A number of crystal plasticity models were developed; calibrated and finally used to predict the deformation of single crystal tensile samples. This study compares the predictions of these models.

SRF2015,,MOPB058,Field Emission From a Thermally Oxidized Nb Sample,S. Lagotzky; G. Müller; Bergische Universität Wuppertal; Wuppertal; Germany; Enhanced field emission (EFE) from particulates and surface defects is one of the main field limitations of superconducting Nb cavities required for XFEL and ILC. The activation field Eact of such emitters and the emitter number density N at a given Eact is strongly influenced by the thickness of the Nb oxide layer*. Combination of this effect with surface cleaning techniques; e.g. dry ice cleaning (DIC); potentially shifts the onset of EFE to even higher Eact. Therefore; we have started to investigate a single crystal Nb sample after thermal oxidation (TO) by a heat treatment (HT) in air (T = 360°C; t = 40 min). Field emission maps showed a first emitter at 100 MV/m; and N = 30/cm² at 225 MV/m. SEM analysis of the 10 strongest emitters revealed mainly surface defects and one particulate. Subsequent removal of the oxide by a HT (T = 400°C; t = 1 h) under UHV resulted in an EFE onset at 75 MV/m and increased N to 60/cm² at 225 MV/m. In a second step the TO as well as the measurement was repeated after DIC of the surface. The resulting field maps and the SEM analysis of selected emitters will be reported.; *A.T.

In superconducting RF cavities in particular; the onset of parasitic electron effects may start at field levels as low as a few MV/m. Electron loading can be attributed to mainly three phenomena: field emission; multiple impact electron amplification; and RF electrical breakdown. Field emission has been a persistent issue despite advances in SRF technology; whereas RF electrical breakdown and multipacting can be controlled by appropriate cavity design choices. Field emission becomes a major concern when the electrons emitted are captured by the accelerating RF field and directed along the beam axis through a series of cavities or even entire cryomodules. Consequently; electrons can accumulate energy comparable to that of the main beam over similar distances. This can represent a considerable dark current; which can travel downstream or upstream depending on the field-emitting site of origin. In this paper; a method is presented that can significantly suppress the upstream field emission by design.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB061,246

In the present design the new cw-heavy ion LINAC comprises constant-beta sc Crossbar-H-mode (CH) cavities operated at 217 MHz. The advantages of the proposed beam dynamics concept applying a constant beta profile are easy manufacturing with minimized costs as well as a straightforward energy variation**. An important milestone will be the full performance test of the first CH cavity (Demonstrator); in a horizontal cryo module with beam. An advanced demonstrator setup comprising a string of cavities and focussing elements is proposed to build from 10 short CH-cavities with 8 gaps.

Beam time availability for SHE-research will be decreased due to the limitation of the UNILAC providing a proper beam for FAIR simultaneously. To keep the GSI-SHE program competitive on a high level; a standalone sc cw-LINAC in combination with the upgraded GSI High Charge State injector is planned to build. In preparation for this the first linac section (financed by HIM and partly by HGF-ARD-initiative) will be tested in 2015 as a demonstrator. After successful testing the construction of an extended cryomodule comprising two further; but shorter CH cavities is foreseen to test until end of 2017. In this contribution the measurement of the beam parameters at the entrance of CW-Demonstartor; the preliminary simulation of beam dynamics for the first stage of advanced demonstrator will be presented.

The IAC includes a new linac and a booster accelerator facility. The new facility is required for the acceleration of ions from protons to lead for colliding beam experiments with electrons in the EIC storage ring. Originally; we proposed a pulsed linac which is based upon a NC front end; < 5 MeV/u; with a SC section for energies > 5 MeV/u and capable of providing 285 MeV protons and ~100 MeV/u lead ions for injection into the IAC booster. A recent cost optimization study of the IAC suggested that lower injection energy into the booster may reduce the overall project cost with ~120 MeV protons and ~40 MeV/u lead ions. Stronger space charge effects in the booster caused by lower injection energy will be mitigated by the booster design. In this paper we discuss both linac options.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb068_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb068.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb068_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB068,265

The reactor vessel could contain fuels such as used uranium nuclear fuels or Thorium. The proton beam will be used to produce Neutrons by spallation in the reactor vessel. Technology readiness levels (TRL’s) can be used to chart technology status with respect to end goal and as such can be used to outline a road map to complete an ADS system. TRL1 defines basic principles observed and reported; whereas TRL9 is defined as system ready for full scale deployment. SRF technology when applied to ADS reflects a mix of TRL levels since worldwide many SRF Accelerators are in operation. The paper will identify the building blocks of an ADS accelerator and analyze each for technical readiness for industrial scale deployment. The integrated ADS structure is far more complex than the individual systems; but the use of proven sub-systems allows to build SRF accelerators that could deliver the beam required.

Optical inspection of around 100 EXFEL series and ILC-HiGrade cavities has been performed recently using the high-resolution OBACHT system. It is a semi-automated tool based on the Kyoto camera. To gain information about the 3D topography of surface features or defects; a replica technique has been applied additionally. This is a non-destructive surface-study method reaching resolution down to 1 μm by imprinting the details of the surface onto a hardened rubber. The footprint is subsequently investigated with a microscope or profilometer. Based on these studies; several defects on the surface have been found and classified. Most of the cavity failures leading e.g. to field limitations below 20 MV/m have been identified and corresponding feedback given to the production cycle.

It considerably reduces the usage of chemicals in the preparation of Nb cavities; typically leaving only a final light electropolishing (EP) and achieves considerably smaller roughness than in chemical treatments alone. CBP addresses in particular the removal of pits; welding spatters; deep scratches; and foreign material inclusions that occasionally occur in the production process. A mirror-smooth surface without chemical contamination is also an important enabling step for thin films. Recent results indicate; however; the need of further optimizations; mainly to reduce the surface damaged layer as well as the pollution by the polishing media. A dedicated study of the CBP process using a “coupon” cavity facilitates better polishing characterisation and optimisation by direct measurements of the roughness; removal rate; and removal profile as well as the amount of contamination left behind and determination of a best combination of the CBP and chemical polishing.

First; the variation of the HOMs during the flat-field tuning was measured. In this process; several detuning and re-tuning cycles were made to estimate the range of possible HOM frequency shifts.

In this paper we present the performance statistics of the vertical test results; as well as an analysis of the limiting criteria for the usable gradient; and finally the impact of the surface retreatment on both usable gradient and Q0.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb086_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb086.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb086_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB086,337

Future upgrade plans include the addition of a recirculating beam line to allow for either further energy increase of the beam beyond 50 MeV or to operate a free electron laser in an energy recovery mode. For both recirculating LINAC and ERL the higher order modes (HOM) have to be sufficiently suppressed to prevent beam-break-up. The design of the 1.3 GHz nine-cell cavity incorporated this requirement by including beam line absorbers on both ends of each cavity and an asymmetric beam pipe configuration on the cavity to allow trapped modes to propagate to the beam line absorbers. Measurements of the higher order modes on the completed injector cryomodule and the first cavity in the accelerating cryomodules will be shown and compared to simulations.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb088_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb088.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb088_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB088,347

Conventional SRF cavity electropolishing is based on hydrofluoric-sulfuric acid mixtures. In comparison, FARADAYIC® Bipolar EP applies pulse reverse electrolysis in dilute sulfuric acid-water solutions without hydrofluoric acid and offers substantial savings in operating and capital costs. Based on a preliminary economic analysis of the cavity processing requirements associated with the ILC, we project the cost of FARADAYIC® Bipolar EP to be about 27% that of the Baseline EP. In terms of tangible cost savings, the cost per cavity for the FARADAYIC® Bipolar EP and Baseline EP are \1,293 and \4,828, respectively. The “eco-friendly” intangible cost savings are generally accepted although the cost savings in terms of material degradation and maintenance are difficult to quantify at this time. Continued development and validation of FARADAYIC® Bipolar EP on nine cell cavities will contribute greatly to the industrialization of SRF accelerator technology. Work supported by DOE Grant Nos.

We present an approach for electropolishing of niobium materials based on pulse reverse waveforms; enabling the use of low viscosity aqueous dilute sulfuric acid electrolytes without hydrofluoric acid; or aqueous near-neutral pH salt solutions without any acid. Results will be summarized for both cavity and coupon electropolishing for bulk and final polishing steps. With minimal optimization of pulse reverse waveform parameters we have demonstrated the ability to electropolish single-cell niobium SRF cavities and achieve at least equivalent performance compared to conventionally processed cavities.

N-doping also makes cavities more sensitive to increased residual resistance due to trapped magnetic flux; making it critical to either have extremely effective magnetic shielding; or to prevent flux from being trapped in the cavity during cooldown. In this paper; we report on results of a study of flux expulsion. We discuss possible ways in which flux can be pinned in the inner surface; outer surface; or bulk of a cavity; and we present experimental results studying these mechanisms. We show that grain structure appears to play a key role and that a cavity that expelled flux poorly changed to expelling flux well after a high temperature furnace treatment. We further show that after furnace treatment; this cavity exhibited a significant improvement in quality factor when cooled in an external magnetic field.

However; till yet VEP always resulted inhomogeneous removal of a niobium (Nb) cavity along its length and bubble traces especially on the top iris of a vertically set cavity. In this work we performed lab EP and VEP experiments in order to study and solve these two problems. A coupon cavity which contains 6 disk type Nb coupons positioned at beam pipes; irises and equator was vertically electropolished to optimize VEP parameters so as to get almost uniform removal of Nb and a smooth surface of the cavity without bubble traces. Our patented unique i-Ninja cathode having 4 wings was used with an optimized rotation speed to get homogeneous removal of Nb. The homogeneous removal and the surface without bubble traces might be result of a uniform thickness of a viscous layer on the surface of the cavity cell and no accumulation of hydrogen bubbles on the top iris surface.

Also; the HPR treatment can clean or polish the RF (Radio Frequency) surface; which is critically sensitive to an applied magnetic field; by removing contaminants such as an organic oil; a remnant metal debris and dirty etchants from the cavity surface. Consequently; the HPR treatment contributes to improve quality factor during the cavity operation both by decreasing various field emission sites and by removing defects from the cavity surface.

For this reason; strict requirements are imposed during mechanical production of the cavities; specifically on the quality control of the inner surface of components; to avoid the presence of defects or scratches. Nevertheless; some defects may remain also after control or can arise from the following production steps. Understanding the evolution of the defect might shine new insight on its origin and help in defining possible repair techniques. This paper reports the topographical evolution of defects on a Nb sample polished with the standard recipe used for the 1.3 GHz cavities of the EXFEL project. Various artificial defects of different shape; dimensions; and thicknesses/depths; with geometrical characteristics similar to the one that may occur during the machining and handling of cavities; have been “ad hoc” produced on the sample of the same material used for the cell fabrication.

Since we will re-use those SRF cavities for the SuperKEKB; the performance degradation will be a serious problem. Several cavities degraded their performance significantly at high accelerating fields. The Q degradation is still acceptable for the 1.5 MV operations at SuperKEKB. However; further degradation will make the operation difficult. In order to recover the cavity performance; we developed horizontal high pressure water rinsing (HHPR). This method uses a horizontal high pressure water nozzle and inserts it directly into the cavity module. We applied this method to two degraded cavities and their degraded Q factors recovered above 109 at around 2 MV. In this paper we will present the HHPR method; high power test results after the HHPR and the residual gas analysis.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/mopb116_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/mopb116.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/mopb116_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-MOPB116,443

During clean room cavity preparation; several processes could contribute to the generation of particles. One of them is friction between hardware during assembly and disassembly. It is important to understand the behaviours that generate and propagate particles into cavities. Using a single cell cavity; particle shedding between flanges and other materials have been tested. The number of particles is recorded with an airborne particle counter; and the generated particles are examined with microscope. The migration of particles into a cavity due to different movements is studied.

A new assembly method to protect final assembly against particulates contamination has been implemented on the production line. Impact on cryomodule RF test is presented. Particle transport measurements on components used for the European XFEL accelerator module are presented. The results indicate that the nominal operation of the automated pumping and venting units will not lead to particle transport.

With such a system it is possible to store ""standard"" (some 10 ps long) and ""short"" (ps and sub-ps long) pulses simultaneously in the light source. This opens up brand new possibilities for light source users to perform dynamic and high-resolution experiments at the same facility.

SRF2015,,TUBA02,Thermal Contact Resistance at the Nb-Cu Interface,INFN/LNL; Legnaro (PD); Italy; UniNa; Napoli; Italy; Niobium thin film sputtered copper cavities are strongly limited for the application in high field accelerators by the unsolved “Q-slope” problem. In the present paper; we examine the different contributions of the niobium film; the copper substrate; the Helium-Copper interface and the Niobium-Copper Interface; proposing the hypothesis that main cause of losses is due to an enhanced thermal boundary resistance RNb/Cu at the Nb/Cu interface; due to poor thermal contact between film and substrate. So; starting from different Q vs Eacc experimental curves from different sources; and using a typical “inverse problem” method; we deduced the corresponding distribution functions generating those curves. Assuming that only a small fraction of the film over the cavity surface is in poor thermal contact with the substrate (or even partially detached); due to bad adhesion problems; we propose as a possible solution of the problem; the possibility to use higher temperatures of deposition and the adoption at the interface of a buffer layer of a material that alloys both with Copper and with Niobium.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tuba02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tuba02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tuba02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUBA02,488

Instead of measuring a flat film that allows magnetic field on both sides of the film; which does not simulate the situation on a SRF cavity correctly; an ellipsoidal bulk Nb (rugby-ball shape with ~8 mm long axis) was coated with a MgB2 film and its vortex penetration field has been measured with a SQUID magnetometer and compared with uncoated samples. After a number of measurements; vortex penetration field has been consistent with maximum critical RF field; superheating field. Here; we show that 100 nm and 200 nm thick MgB2 coating increases the vortex penetration field by up to ~70 mT; e.g.; 240 mT (200 nm MgB2 coated Nb) vs. 170 mT (uncoated Nb) at 2.8 K (lowest measurement temperature) with the trend of increasing as temperature goes down. This is consistent with recent theoretical development saying that the increase is possible even without an insulation layer; which makes the coating easier.

In 2013; theoretical studies of an ideal system with a single SC layer and a single insulator layer formed on a bulk SC were carried out; by which appropriate combinations of materials and optimum thicknesses of SC and insulator layers that can enhance field limit were revealed.

The technological challenges include realization of high quality superconductors with sharp; clean; transition to high quality dielectric materials and back to superconductor; with careful thickness control of each layer. Choosing NbTiN as the first candidate material; we have developed the tools and techniques that produce such SIS film structures and have begun their characterization. Using DC magnetron sputtering and HiPIMS; NbTiN and AlN can be deposited with nominal superconducting and dielectric parameters. Hc1 enhancement is observed for NbTiN layers with a Tc of 16.9 K for a thickness less than 150 nm. The optimization of the thickness of each type of layer to reach optimum SRF performance is underway.

SRF2015,,TUPB002,Elimination of High Frequency Noise From the Beam in the Diamond Light Source Storage Ring,C. Christou; A. Bogusz; P.J. Marten; DLS; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom; High frequency beam motion has been identified as a source of noise in infrared beamlines in a number of synchrotron light sources. Diamond is a third generation synchrotron light source with storage ring current maintained by two superconducting CESR-B cavities powered by IOT-driven RF amplifiers. In our case; undesirable beam motion in the kilohertz range is predominantly driven by spectral content in the voltage across the IOTs arising from the switched mode nature of the high voltage power supply. Spectral noise on the amplifiers and beam has been identified and characterised and efforts to eliminate this noise are described. Care has been taken to maintain the overall stability of the RF at Diamond and tests have been carried out on an infrared beamline to investigate the degree to which beam noise impacts beamline operation in its different operating configurations.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB002,525

The beam is double terminal stripped to provide high charge states at the entrance to the linac; which consists of twelve β=0.1 Split Loop Resonators (SLR). Each SLR needs to be individually tuned in phase and amplitude for optimum acceleration efficiency. The amplitude and phase of the superbuncher and time energy lens also have to be correctly set. The linac set up procedure developed at ANU utilises a beam profile monitor in the middle of a 180 degree achromat and a new technique based on a superconducting resonator operating in a beam bunch detection mode. Both techniques are used to derive a full set of phase distributions for quick and efficient setting up of the entire linac. Verification of the superconducting phase detector is accomplished during routine linac operations and is complemented by longitudinal phase space simulations. The new technique allows better resolution for setting the resonator acceleration phase and better sensitivity to accelerating current.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB024,602

The beam is foil stripped in the terminal and then stripped again to provide high charge states at the entrance to the linac. Employment of double terminal stripping allows the system to accelerate beams with mass up to 70 amu. The disadvantage of double terminal stripping is low beam intensity of few particle nA delivered to the linac. The linac encompasses twelve β=0.1 lead tin plated Split Loop Resonators (SLR) housed in four module cryostats. One of the linac set up procedures that developed at ANU utilises U-bend at the end of the linac. One special wide Beam Profile Monitor (BPM) is installed after 90 degrees magnet. The technique allows to set correct phase by observing the displacement of beam profile versus phase shift of the last phase locked resonator. In this paper a simple method has been proposed to improve sensitivity of commercially available BPM for efficient operation with low beam intensities. The system demonstrated very high stability; simplicity of operation and high reliability allowing sustained operation of the LINAC facility.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb025_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb025.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb025_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB025,607

A large panel of cavities have been coated from LEP; to LHC. For the current and future projects (HIE-ISOLDE; HL-LHC; FCC) there is a need for further higher RF-performances with focus on minimizing residual resistance Rres and maximizing quality factor Q0 of the cavities. This paper will present CERN’s developments on thin films to achieve these goals through the following main axes of research: The first one concerns the application of different coating techniques for Nb (DC-bias diode sputtering; magnetron sputtering and HiPIMS). Another approach is the investigation of alternative materials like Nb3Sn. These lines of development will be supported by a material science approach to characterize and evaluate the layer properties by means of FIB-SEM; TEM; XPS; XRD; etc. In addition a numerical tool for plasma simulation will be exploited to develop adapted coating systems and optimize the coating process; from plasma generation to thin film growth.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb027_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb027.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb027_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB027,617

Although some margin seems still available with processes such as N surface doping; long term solutions for SRF surfaces efficiency enhancement need to be pursued. Over the years; Nb/Cu technology; despite its shortcomings; has positioned itself as an alternative route for the future of superconducting structures used in accelerators. Significant progress has been made in recent years in the development of energetic deposition techniques such as Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma deposition. Nb films with very high material quality have then been produced by varying the deposition energy alluding to the promise of performing SRF films.

The plasma consists of 60-120eV Nb ions (Nb+ and Nb++) [1] that penetrate a few monolayers into the substrate [2] and enable sufficient surface mobility to ensure that the lowest energy state (crystalline structure with minimal defects) is accessible to the film [3]. One limitation of CED thinfilms is the presence of Nb macroparticles (~0.1-10 microns) that could be deleterious to high field performance of the SRF cavity. One way to remove such macroparticles [4] is to grow a thick film (~3-5 microns); followed by mechanical polishing (MP) using the finest media as might be applied in Centrifugal Barrel Polishing (CBP) to achieve a 0.4 micron surface figure; and an electropolishing (EP) step to remove ~1 micron of Nb that also removes all traces of embedded media in the film. The residual 2-4 micron Nb film should more nearly resemble the surface of a bulk Nb cavity that has been subjected to the same steps.

In order to overcome the accelerating gradient limits of bulk niobium and reduce manufacturing and operation costs; the idea of using thin layers of niobium deposited on a copper cavity is being explored. This approach has lower material cost with higher availability and more importantly higher thermal conductivity. Physical vapour deposition (PVD) method is currently the preferred method to coat superconducting cavities; but its lack of conformity renders complicated shapes such as crab cavities very difficult to coat. By using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) it is possible to deposit thin Nb layers uniformly with density very close to bulk material. This project explores the use of PECVD / CVD techniques to deposit metallic niobium on copper using NbCl5 as precursor and hydrogen as a coreagent.

In order to evaluate the SEY a new device is introduced; which is capable of quasi in-situ measurements. The latter is realized by connecting the coating-; the SEY- and a contamination chamber into one setup allowing sample transfer under UHV conditions. Even after an exposure to air carbon shows SEY values down to 0.69. This value; however; turns out to be quite sensitive with respect to the actual surface morphology.

Though subsequent cavities showed much higher quality factors; this cavity exhibited Q0 on the order of 109 caused by strong heating concentrated in one of the half cells. This paper presents an investigation into the source of this excess heating; for the purpose of process improvement; so that similar degradation can be avoided in future coatings. Through the use of temperature mapping both at Cornell and at FNAL; locations with high and low surface resistance were located; cut out from the cavity; and studied with microscopic tools. We present the RF measurements and temperature maps as well as the microscopic analyses; then conclude with plans for continued studies.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB049,681

In the quest of superconducting RF materials beyond bulk niobium; we studied the SEY of the currently most important candidates for future SRF applications: Nb3Sn; NbTiN and MgB2.

Very low losses SRF accelerating systems; together with high-efficiency cryogenics systems; have the potential of low running costs. The association to the capital cost reduction allowed by thin films coated copper cavities may represent the best overall cost-performance compromise. This strategy has been applied for instance in LEP; the LHC and HIE-ISOLDE with the niobium thin films technology. New materials must be considered to improve the quality factor of the cavities; such as Nb3Sn; which could also ideally operate at higher temperature thus allowing further energy savings. The study considers the possibility to coat a copper resonator with an Nb3Sn layer by means of magnetron sputtering using an alloyed target. We present the impact of the process parameters on the as-deposited layer stoichiometry. The latter is in good agreement with previous results reported in the literature and can be tuned by acting on the coating pressure. The effect of post-coating annealing temperature on the morphology; crystallinity and superconducting properties of the film was also investigated.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB051,691
SRF2015,,TUPB052,HTS Coatings for Impedance Reduction of Beam-Induced RF Image Currents in the FCC,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The FCC-hh presently under study at CERN will make use of 16 T superconducting dipoles for achieving 100 TeV p-p center-of-mass collision energy in a 100 km ring collider. A copper coated beam screen; like in the LHC; is envisaged to shield the 1.9 K dipole cold bores from the 28 W/m/beam of synchrotron radiation. Operating temperature should be in the 50 K range; as best compromise temperature in order to minimize the wall-plug power consumption of the cryogenic system. However; preliminary studies indicate that copper at 50 K might not provide low enough beam coupling impedance in the FCC-hh. It has then been proposed to reduce the beam impedance by a thin layer of a High-Temperature Superconductor (HTS); which will thus effectively shield the beam-induced RF image currents. Purpose of this paper is to define the basic requirements for an HTS film in the RF field induced by beam image currents and exposed to a high magnetic field; and to identify the best candidate materials and coating processes.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB052,695

Using boron film samples obtained at a large furnace system; we succeeded in obtaining superconducting MgB2 films (Tc of up to 37 K so far) by reacting them with Mg vapor. The major improvements were 1) confinement of the Mg vapor in a hot zone to mitigate the insufficient Mg pressure due to condensation on low temperature surfaces of the connected vacuum pipes and 2) reduction of cooldown time; i.e.; ~13 minutes instead of ~1 day with the large system to prevent MgB2 from decomposing.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb053_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb053.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb053_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB053,700

We prepared these materials by vapor diffusion coating on polycrystalline and single crystal niobium. The effect of changing substrate preparation; coating parameters and post-treatment were examined by AFM and SEM/EDS. The AFM data were analyzed in terms of power spectral density (PSD).

The higher critical temperature of Nb3Sn potentially allows for an increased operational temperature for SRF cavities; which promises cryogenic cost savings. We present preliminary characterization of Nb3Sn layer grown on flat Nb sample prepared by the same chemical vapor deposition method that is used for the cavity coating. SEM; TEM/EDS; TEM imaging and diffraction characterization was used in order to evaluate any chemical and structural defects that could be responsible for the limited quench field and high residual resistance. Variation of local stoichiometry was found in the Nb3Sn layer; which is in line with previous studies. Regions of decreased Sn content can have a lower Tc in comparison to the stoichiometric composition; which may be responsible for the limited performance. AES investigations of the Nb3Sn surface before and after HF-rinse were done in order to explore the mechanism that is responsible for the performance degradation of HF-rinsed Nb3Sn coated cavities.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb056_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb056.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb056_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB056,708

The SRF multilayers concept focuses on the enhancement of HC1 using thin layers (d~λ). The use of thin layers makes it easier to avoid avalanche penetration of vortices in case of local defects. Several layers are needed in order to attenuate the external field to values below Nb HC1; decoupled using dielectric layers. We don’t know yet how the predicted properties evolve in realistic conditions; hence it seems reasonable to do their optimization. Two parameters need to be measured to study their behavior in cavity operating conditions: HC1 and Rs surface resistance (especially residual). For that purpose two instruments were developed in Saclay and in Orsay. A local magnetometer allows measuring the vortex penetration on samples without the orientation and edge effects encountered in SQUID magnetometers. Its operating conditions range from 2-40 K; with field up to 150 mT; and upgradation to higher field. A pill-box cavity working on TE011 and TE012 modes with removable sample/top measures surface resistance up to 60 mT based on calorimetric method from 1.6-4.5 K.*; *SRF cavities; 3rd Harmonic Analysis,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb058_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB058,712

The RRR gauges the purity and structure of the superconductor based on the temperature dependence of electron scattering in the normal conducting state. Combining a four point probe delta pulse setup with a switch allows multiplexing of the electrical measurements to 32 samples per cooldown cycle. The samples are measured inside of an isothermal setup in a liquid helium (LHe) dewar. The isothermal setup is required for a quasistatic warmup of the samples through TC.

The test cavity consists of two parts: a cylindrical half-cell made of bulk niobium (Nb) and a flat Nb disc. The two parts can be thermally and electrically isolated via a vacuum gap; whereas the electromagnetic fields are constrained through the use of RF chokes. Both parts are conduction cooled hence the cavity halves are suspended in vacuum during operation. The flat disc can be replaced with a sample; such as a Cu disc coated with a film of niobium or any other superconducting material. The RF test provides simple cavity Q-factor measurements as well as calorimetric measurements of the losses on the sample. The advantage of this method is the combination of a compact cavity with a simple planar sample.

The system operates at 11.4 GHz; at temperatures down to 4 K; and utilizes two interchangeable hemispherical cavities (one Cu; one Nb) that can accommodate 51 mm-diameter samples on the flat side. The cavities are designed to operate with a TE032-like mode where the magnetic field is strongest on the sample surface. As a result; the sample accounts for 33% of the overall cavity loss; despite comprising less than 8% of the total surface area. For low-power testing we utilize a programmable network analyzer; while for high-power testing we connect the cavity to a 50 MW XL-4 klystron. With the Nb cavity we can measure surface resistances down to 0.7 microhm; while with the Cu cavity we can measure quenching fields up to 360 mT.

These defects reduce the efficiency of cavities and often limit the maximum attainable fields. We applied a Haar cascade artificial vision technique for automated identification; counting; and sizing of defects induced on niobium surface by Nb-H precipitates formed at cryogenic temperatures. The defects were counted and sized by a computer program and also counted and measured manually to estimate detection rate and accuracy of sizing. The overall detection rate was 53%; and the overall false positive rate was 29%. The technique that was used to automatically size the features was found to oversize the features; but oversize them consistently; resulting in a size histogram that represents the defect size distribution on the sample.

Within the ILC-HiGrade programme at DESY; as part of the XFEL cavity production; an automated image processing and analysis algorithm has been developed that recognises structural boundaries. The count of features; the length of boundaries and their orientation can be used for characterisation. Appreciable differences are observed depending on the fabrication process at the vendor and the chemical treatment applied. The potential of this framework for automated quality assurance as an integral part of large-scale cavity production will be outlined. In addition; correlations between geometrical surface properties and the maximal accelerating field of twenty cavities have been found.

While in earlier days temperature maps were used the state of the art technique nowadays is detecting the second sound wave; excited by a quench; using oscillating super-leak detector (OSTs). Typically; many OSTs surround the cavity and the quench location is determined by triangulation of the different OST signals. Convenient as the method is there is a mystery: taking the well-known velocity of the second sound wave; the quench seems to come from a place slightly above the cavity’s outer surface. In addition; not all triangulation spheres intersect in one point.

A common way to study the performance of an SRF cavity is to build an oscillator around it that is referred to as a self-exciting loop. In the standard approach; by tuning the loop phase for a maximum field level in the cavity and measuring forward and reflected waves; one finds the cavity coupling. Then; performing a time-decay measurement and finding the total quality factor; one gets Q0. However; this approach suffers from a deficiency originating from a single data-point measurement of the reflection coefficient. In our method by varying the loop phase shift; one obtains amplitudes of the reflection coefficient of the cavity as a function of its phases. The complex reflection coefficient describes a perfect circle in polar coordinates. Fitting the overdetermined set of data to that circle allows more accurate calculation of Q0 via the least-squares procedure. The method has been tested at the FREIA Laboratory on two cavities from IPN Orsay: a single spoke and a prototype ESS double spoke.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb089_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb089.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb089_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB089,810

Imperfect coupler directivity (cross-talk) can lead to large errors in the cavity coupling factor when the cavity coupling factor is significantly different than unity. Energy re-reflected from the circulator can systematically bias the measured cavity decay time which is used to determine the loaded quality factor. Use of the peak probe power or the minimum of the reflected power to determine the cavity resonance frequency rather than the peak of the probe/forward transfer function may lead to errors in the resonance frequency that can also affect quality factors. Each effect is illustrated with measurements in the Fermilab VTS; simulations and analytic calculations. If the magnitude and phase of the cavity RF signals are measured; these effects can be measured and corrected for. If only signal magnitudes are recorded or these effects are not measured; they must be treated as sources of systematic uncertainty.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb091_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb091.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb091_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB091,814

SRF2015,,TUPB094,Jefferson Lab Vertical Test Area RF System Improvement,T. Powers; M.L. Morrone; JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; RF systems for testing critically coupled SRF cavities require the ability to track the cavity frequency excursions while making accurate measurements of the radio frequency (RF) signals associated with the cavity. Two types of systems are being used at Jefferson Lab. The first; the traditional approach; is to use a voltage controlled oscillator configured as a phase locked loop such that it will track the cavity frequency. The more recently developed approach is to use a digital low level RF (LLRF) system in self excited loop (SEL) mode to track the cavity frequency. Using a digital LLRF system in SEL mode has the advantage that it is much easier to lock to the cavity’s resonant frequencies and they tend to have a wider capture range. This paper will report on the system designs used to implement the 12 GeV digital LLRF system in the JLAB vertical test area.

We will present the effort made at CEA into this direction: shield design; shield material characterization; at room and cryogenic temperature; and search and attenuation of the magnetic background present in the cryomodule during the cavities superconducting transition. This last point will be especially studied for the IFMIF project where the cryomodule houses the focusing magnets. Aspects of the cold magnetic shields for ESS will also be discussed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb100_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb100.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb100_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB100,847

Two novel side-loaded cryomodules; which allow ease of access for assembly; inspection and maintenance; have been developed for the prototype tests. The cryomodule shielding includes a thermal shield and double layer magnetic shield; consisting of a warm-outer shield; and two cold-inner shields (one per cavity). Various constraints and considerations have led to unique cold shielding; mounted inside the cavity helium vessels; resulting in several design challenges. The shielding adopts and utilises the module’s side-loaded configuration; for continuity and accessibility; while satisfying tight spatial constraints and requirements to meet the functional specification. This paper outlines the design; analysis; manufacture and assembly of the Hi-Lumi SPS test cryomodule’s thermal and magnetic shielding; which are critical to achieving the operational stability.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/tupb101_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/tupb101.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/tupb101_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-TUPB101,852
SRF2015,,TUPB102,Validation of Local Magnetic Shielding for FRIB Using a Prototype Cryomodule,S.K. Chandrasekaran; K. Saito; FRIB; East Lansing; Michigan; USA; The local magnetic shield design and cryogenic magnetic shielding material for the FRIB QWR cryomodule was validated in a two cavity; one solenoid prototype cryomodule. The magnetic fields were measured inside and outside the magnetic shielding before; during; and after operation of an 8 T superconducting solenoid. The effect of demagnetization cycles of the solenoid was also examined. The magnetic field at the cavity’s high RF magnetic field area; inside the magnetic shield and with the solenoid off; was measured using a single-axis fluxgate to be less than 0.3 μT (3 mG) after cool down of the cryomodule. A 3.07 μT (30.7 mG) residual field was observed at high magnetic field area after conclusion of solenoid operation. This was attributed to the persistent currents circulating in the superconducting solenoid. Demagnetization cycles were therefore determined to be unnecessary for FRIB cryomodules; as long as the solenoid is normal conducting when the cavity is cooled through the superconducting critical temperature.; S.K.

SRF2015,,WEA1A01,Microwave Suppression of Nonlinear Surface Resistance and the Extended Q(B) Rise in Alloyed Nb Cavities,ODU; Norfolk; Virginia; USA; The talk gives a theoretical overview of recent progress in our understanding of the field dependence of the SRF surface resistance Rs(H). A theory of microwave suppression of Rs(H) in the Meissner state of alloyed superconductors under a low-frequency; strong RF field at low temperatures is presented*. Solving equations for Rs(H) derived from a non-equilibrium BCS theory in the dirty limit shows that Rs(H) has a minimum as a function of H; mostly due to field-induced temporal oscillations of the quasiparticle density of states. The calculated field dependence Rs(H) is in good agreement with recent experiments on Ti and N alloyed Nb resonator cavities. The theory suggests that the extended Q(B) rise can be further enhanced by reducing subgap density of states by materials modifications. Applying superimposed dc and ac fields can be used to reduce the rf dissipation by tuning Rs(H0) with the dc field and also to probe the mechanism of microwave suppression of Rs(H) under equilibrium conditions.

Spoke cavities have a large number of geometric parameters which often influence multiple rf properties.

In this new project; construction of a superconducting linac is planned replacing the injector cyclotron so called RRC. The RIKEN superconducting linac consists of 14 cryomodules each of which contains four quarter-wave-resonators (QWRs) in each. The QWR operates at an rf frequency of 73 MHz in the continuous wave mode with beta as low as 0.055-1.008. A coaxial probe-type RF fundamental power-coupler which transmits RF power of several kW will be utilized for beam loading of 1.3 kW/resonator at the maximum with Qext of several x106. Tuning of the resonant frequency will be realized with a mechanical tuner pressing the resonator wall in the direction parallel to the beam. This year; we started a development of a test cryomodule with SC-QWRs. In this paper; design studies for a SC-QWR and its cryomodule; e.g.; QWR; coupler; and; tuner will be presented together with a construction schedule of the prototype.

The cavity operates at 4.4 K with a “quiet helium source” to isolate the cavity from environmental acoustic noise. The cavity is a beam driven quarter wave resonator. It is detuned and damped during injection and acceleration cycles and is brought to operation only at store energy. We have observed clear luminosity increase and bunch length reduction in the first operation of the cavity with Au + Au and Au + He3 collisions.

SRF2015,,THAA02,SRF Gun Development Overview,DESY; Hamburg; Germany; The most demanding component of a continuous wave (cw) injector is cw operating RF-gun; delivering highly populated low emittance bunches. RF-guns; both working at room temperature and superconducting; when they generate highly populated low emittance bunches have to be operated at high accelerating gradients to suppress space charge effects diluting emittance. Superconducting RF-guns are technically superior to the normal conducting devices because they dissipate orders of magnitude less power when operating at very high gradients in cw mode.

In this talk; we report mainly focus on the experiences obtained from single cell cavity fabrications. First; different Nb materials are compared; between fine grain Nb and large grain(LG) Nb from different vendors including low RRR LG Nb; in which; cavities were fabricated by electron beam welding method. Difficulty on LG cavity fabrication come from deformation due to stressed grain boundaries. In addition to nominal electron beam welded cavities; hydro-formed seamless cavities have been fabricated. Relatively large difference of equator and iris ratio cause difficulty on expansion of Nb pipes. Good qualified Nb pipe is essential and control of hydro-forming steps including annealing of materials is also important. In order to evaluate these cavity performances; vertical tests were carried out. Generally; they showed good performances.

An alternative technique to traditional shaping methods; such as deep-drawing and spinning; is Electro-Hydraulic Forming (EHF). In EHF; cavities are obtained through ultra-high-speed deformation of blank sheets; using shockwaves induced in water by a pulsed electrical discharge. With respect to traditional methods; such a highly dynamic process can yield valuable results in terms of effectiveness; repeatability; final shape precision; higher formability and reduced spring-back.

This new ring will have the same radius as the RHIC ring. Synchrotron radiation lost in the electron ring should be compensated by a CW superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity. Here we propose an 845 MHz single cell harmonic cavity. This cavity will experience a high average current (∼0.7 A) passing through it. With this consideration; this cavity design requires optimization to reduce higher order mode power. On the other hand; the cavity will operate at relatively high gradient up to 18 MV/m.

Instead of utilizing the rather standard approach of matching the output port of the dampers with a broadband coaxial or waveguide port; dissipative materials are modelled for RF field absorption. This for instance not only avoids the otherwise required definition of the number of modes considered for damping; which has an impact on the computational time; but also allows tailoring the load material to conform with experimental data of e.g. non-perfect absorbers. The new calculation scheme is presented. Findings are partially compared with those achieved with the standard waveguide port approach by means of external quality factors.

In order to understand the effects of the beam structure; analytic expressions are developed. With these expressions; the induced HOM voltage and power were calculated by assuming external Q for each HOM.

The major new feature will be the installation of 35 cryomodules (CMs) of TESLA-type; superconducting accelerating structures. It is envisioned that LCLS-II will eventually be able to deliver 300 pC; 1 kA pulses of beam at a rate of 1 MHz. At a cavity temperature of 2K; any heat generated (even on the level of a few watts) is expensive to remove. In the last linac of LCLS-II; L3–-where the peak current is highest–-the power radiated by the bunch in the CMs is estimated at 14 W (charge 300 pC option; rep rate 1 MHz). But this calculation ignores resonances that can be excited between the bunch frequency and higher order mode (HOM) frequencies in the CMs; which in principle can greatly increase this number. In this report we develop a theory of resonant build up. Then; using 500 numerically obtained modes over the frequency range 3–5 GHz; we estimate the probability of significant resonant build up in L3 of LCLS-II.

The 3.9 GHz SRF cavity is scaled down from the 1.3 GHz TESLA cavity shape; but has a disproportionately large beampipe radius for better higher-order mode (HOM) damping. The HOM and fundamental power (FPC) couplers will generate asymmetric field in the beam region; and thereby dilute the beam emittance. Meanwhile; due to the large beampipe; all but a few of the HOMs are above the beampipe cutoff. Thus the HOM damping analyses need to be performed in a full cryomodule; rather than in an individual cavity. The HOM damping in a 4-cavity cryomodule was investigated to determine possible trapped modes using the parallel electromagnetic code suite ACE3P developed at SLAC. The coupler RF kicks induced by the HOM and FPC couplers in the 3.9 GHz cavity were evaluated. A possible cavity-to-cavity arrangement is proposed which could provide effective cancellation of these RF kicks. In this paper we present and discuss the RF simulation results in the 3.9 GHz third harmonic cavity cryomodule.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,Work supported by Department of Energy under contract Number DE-AC02-76SF00515. reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB008,

Recently; a STWA structure with a feedback waveguide has been suggested. The structure was optimized and has phase advance per cell of 105° which provide 24% higher accelerating gradient than in SW cavities. Also STWA structure has no strong sensitivity of the field flatness and its length may be much longer than SW structure. With this presentation; we discuss the current status of a 3-cell L-band SC traveling wave along with the analysis of its tuning issues. Special attention will be paid to feedback loop operation with the two-coupler feed system. We also report on the development and fabrication of a niobium prototype 3-cell SC traveling wave structure to be tested at 2°K in fall 2015.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB011,

This paper describes the novel design of the cavity; with different aperture and wall angle; having better field flatness and mechanical stability; reliable surface processing facility and less beam loss. The cavity geometry has been optimized to get acceptable values of field enhancement factors; R/Q; Geometric factor; cell-to-cell coupling etc. The effective impedance of transverse and longitudinal HOMs are low enough to get rid of HOM damper for low beam current. 2-D analysis shows no possibility of multipacting. However; 3-D analysis using CST Particle Studio code confirms its presence and it can be suppressed by introducing a small convexity in the equator region. Two niobium half cells and beam pipes for the single cell cavity have been fabricated.

Good performance has been demonstrated by many cavity tests. Accompanying the great progress; the adverse impact of strong multipacting (MP) is also noted by recent test reports; consistent with modern 3D simulations. This paper will discuss MP behaviors in the single spoke resonator. In particular a phenomenological theory is developed to highlight the details of the geometry that affect MP. The analysis leads to an optimized geometry of a single spoke resonator defined here as the ‘balloon geometry’.

The cavity consists of eight electrodes and eight accelerating gaps. The RF frequency is 162.5MHz; and the designed proton input energy is 200keV. A peak field optimization has been performed for the lower surface field. The accelerating gaps are adjusted by phase sweeping based on KONUS beam dynamics. Solenoids are placed outside the cavity to provide transverse focusing. Numerical calculation shows that the transverse defocusing of the KONUS phase is about three times smaller than that of the conventional negative synchronous RF phase. The beam dynamics of a 10mA CW proton beam is simulated by the TraceWin code. The simulation results show that the beam’s size is under effective control. Both the simulation and the numerical calculation show that the cavity has a relatively high effective accelerating gradient of 2.6MV/m. Our results show that this new accelerating structure may be a possible candidate for superconducting operation at such a low energy range.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb022.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb022_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB022,

Recently; there are studies on the low RRR of niobium material with high and uniform concentration of tantalum which could be used for the fabrication of high performance SRF cavity; and hence it could reduce the fabrication cost of cavities [1]. In order to confirm the advantage of the material; a large-grain single-cell cavity was fabricated at CFF/KEK with sheets sliced from a low RRR niobium ingot with high and uniform concentration of tantalum. The resistivity measurement of sample from sliced sheet showed the RRR value of 100; whereas it is about 400 for the nominal qualification of fine-grain sheets at KEK. The low RRR large-grain single-cell cavity was already fabricated at CFF/KEK. The quality control of the fabrication processes are well under control.

As-cast ingots go through a series of steps including forging; milling; rolling; and intermediate annealing; before they are deep-drawn into a half-cell shape and subsequently electron beam welded to make a full cavity. Tube hydroforming; a manufacturing technique where a tube is deformed using a pressurized fluid; is an alternative to the current costly manufacturing process. A whole cavity can be made from a tube using tube hydroforming. This study focuses on deformation of large grain Nb tubes during hydroforming. The crystal orientation of the grains is recorded. The tube is marked with a square-circle-grid which is used to measure the strain after deformation. The deformation of the tube is going to be modeled with crystal plasticity finite element and compared with experiments. This paper only covers the characterization of the tube and the hydroforming process.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB040,

The intention for this upgrade has been to reach for higher beam energies; bunch charges and therefore an increased average beam current; which is to be injected into the superconducting; CW ELBE accelerator; where it can be used for multiple purposes; such as THz generation or Compton backscattering. Because of the increased bunch charge of this injector compared to its predecessor; it demands upgrades of the existing and/or novel approaches to alleviate the transverse emittance growth. One of these methods is the integration of a superconducting solenoid into the cryostat. Another method; the so called RF focusing; is realized by displacing the photo cathode's tip and retracting it from the last cell of the resonator. In this case; part of the accelerating field is sacrificed for a better focus of the electron bunch right at the start of its generation. Besides particle tracking simulations; a recent study; investigating on the exact position of the cathode tip with respect to the cell's back plane after tuning and cool down; has been performed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb057_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb057.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb057_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB057,

The 9-cell LCLS-II cavity will be simulated by disc springs with an equivalent spring constant. Hysteresis plots of the motor position vs. tuner position – measured via an installed linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) – will be used to determine any drift from the required performance.

Eight superconducting accelerating cavities were operated for more than ten years at KEKB electron ring and are to be used at SuperKEKB. The cavity operation at those high current accelerators requires sufficient absorption of the beam-induced HOM power. In KEKB; the absorbed HOM power of 16 kW in two ferrite dampers attached to each cavity was achieved at the beam current of 1.4 A. On the other hand; the expected HOM power at SuperKEKB is calculated to be 37 kW in the beam current of 2.6 A. To cope with the HOM power issue; we developed additional HOM dampers made of SiC to be installed to the downstream of the cavity module. From precise calculations; it was found that the additional dampers reduce the HOM power loads of the ferrite dampers more effectively than the large beam pipe model of cavity module; which is another option to reduce the HOM loads. New SiC dampers were fabricated and high power-tested. Those SiC dampers successfully absorbed the expected HOM power. In this report; we will describe the results of calculations and high-power RF tests of new SiC dampers.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb071_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb071.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb071_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB071,

The new interlock is located inside the accelerator tunnel. Several remote test capabilities ensure the correct operation of sensors for light; temperature and free electrons.

The cavities have two variants known as the RF dipole and double quarter-wave crab cavities. Each cavity has a fundamental power coupler (FPC) at 400 MHz and two or three HOM couplers. Before integration onto the cavities it is necessary to condition the FPC; and to measure the transmission on the HOM couplers at low power to ensure the operate as designed; each requiring a special test box. The FPC test box should provide a high transmission between two couplers without creating high surface fields. The low power HOM test boxes should be terminated to a load such that the natural stop and pass-bands of the couplers are preserved allowing the reflection to me measured and compared to simulations. In addition; due to the possibility of high HOM power in the LHC crab cavities; the concept of creating a broadband high power HOM coupler test box in order to condition and test the couplers at high power has been investigated. The Rf design of all test boxes is presented and discussed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB081,

Stainless steel parts that are coated on the insides with a few skin depths of copper can meet these conflicting requirements. The challenge has been the adhesion strength of copper coating on stainless steel coupler parts when using electroplating methods. These methods also require a nickel flash layer that is magnetic and can therefore pose problems. Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation (AASC) uses Coaxial Energetic Deposition (CED) from a cathodic arc plasma to grow copper films directly on stainless steel coupler parts with no Ni layer and no electrochemistry. The vacuum arc plasma consists of ~100 eV Cu ions that penetrate a few monolayers into the stainless steel substrate to promote growth of highly adhesive films with crystalline structure. Adhesion strength and coating quality of copper coatings on complex stainless steel tubes; bellows; mock coupler parts and an actual Tesla Test Facility (TTF) type coupler part; are discussed.; * Adhesion and Cu quality testing were done for us by the Fermilab Technical Division; Superconducting RF Development Department; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb083_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb083.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb083_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB083,

The system uses one superconducting RF cavity to be installed into the APS Upgrade electron storage ring and will provide a tremendous practical benefit to the majority of users by increasing the beam lifetime by 2-3 times. The 80 mm diameter; 50 Ω coaxial couplers include 4 cm (~20 dB) of adjustability. This allows optimization of bunch lengthening for a range of storage ring beam currents and fill patterns while; simultaneously; maintaining the required 0.84 MV harmonic cavity voltage. To provide bunch lengthening; the cavity/coupler system must extract RF power (up to 32 kW) from the beam. Each coupler will transmit roughly half of the total extracted power to external water-cooled loads. The design extends upon on a well-tested ANL two RF window concept; using a pair of simple rugged 80 mm diameter alumina disks.

A detachable input coupler will reduce conditioning time (can be conditioned separately); reduce cost and improve reliability. The problem with placing an extra flange in the superconducting cavity is about creating a possible quench spot at the seal place. Euclid Techlabs LLC has developed a coaxial coupler which has an on the surface with zero magnetic field (hence zero surface current). By placing a flange in that area we are able to avoid disturbing surface currents that typically lead to a quench. The coupler is optimized to preserve the axial symmetry of the cavity and rf field. The surface treatments and rf test of the proto- type coupler with a 1.3 GHz ILC-type single-cell cavity at Fermilab will be reported and discussed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text; ※ RIS/RefMan,,reference for this paper to,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/talks/thpb105_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/papers/thpb105.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2015/posters/thpb105_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2015-THPB105,

The prototype Spoke cryomodule holds two cavities and their RF power couplers and integrates all the interfaces necessary to be operational within the linac machine. It is now being fabricated and its assembly will be performed with dedicated tooling and procedures in and out of the clean room. This prototype will be tested by the end of 2015 at IPNO site and then at full power at FREIA (Uppsala university) test stand. A valve box has thus been designed to take into account the specific features of this prototype cryomodule and of the cryogenic environments of both test sites. This valve box is also considered as a prototype of the cryogenic distribution of the linac Spoke section. This element will then be used for the tests of the series cryomodules.
