For the realisation; a scaled down experimental setup with normalconducting magnets is being build. Investigations of beam transport in solenoidal and toroidal guiding fields are in progress. At the moment; a new kind of injection system consisting of a solenoidal injection coil and a special vacuum vessel is under development. It is used to inject a hydrogen beam sideways between two toroidal magnets. In parallel operation; a second hydrogen beam is transported through both magnets to represent the circulating beam. In a second stage; an ExB-Kicker will be used as a septum to combine both beams into one. The current status of the experimental setup will be shown. For the design of the experiments; computer simulations using the 3D simulation code bender were performed. Different input parameters were checked to find the optimal injection and transport channel for the experiment. The results will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopr001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopr001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopr001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPR001,41

This project consists of ion sources; Linac accelerator; synchrotrons (BRing) and several experimental terminals. During the operation of Bring; the heavy ion beams will be easily lost at the vacuum chamber along the BRing when it is used to accumulate intermediate charge state particles. The vacuum pressure bump due to the ion-induced desorption in turn leads to an increase in beam loss rate. In order to accumulate the beams to higher intensity to fulfill the requirements of physics experiments and for better understanding of the dynamic vacuum pressure caused by the beam loss; a dynamic vacuum pressure simulation program has been developed. Vacuum pressure profiles are calculated and compared with the measured data based on the current synchrotron (CSRm). Then the static vacuum pressure profiles of the BRing and one type of pump which will be used in the BRing are introduced in this paper.,Funding: National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 11305227),reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopr008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopr008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopr008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPR008,62

This exceptional extraction technique was proposed to replace the long-serving Continuous Transfer (CT) extraction; which has the drawback of inducing high activation in the ring. MTE exploits the principles of non-linear beam dynamics to perform loss-free beam splitting in the horizontal phase space. Over multiple turns; the resulting beamlets are then transferred to the downstream accelerator. The operational deployment of MTE was rendered possible by the full understanding and mitigation of different hardware limitations and by redesigning the extraction trajectories and non-linear optics; which was required due to the installation of a dummy septum to reduce the activation of the magnetic extraction septum. The results of the related experimental and simulation studies; a summary of the 2015 performance analysis; as well as more recent performance improvements are presented in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopr009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopr009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopr009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPR009,65
hb2016,,MOPR010,Machine Element Contribution to the Longitudinal Impedance Model of the CERN SPS,T. Kaltenbacher; F. Caspers; C. Vollinger; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; This contribution describes the current longitudinal impedance model of the SPS and studies carried out in order to improve; extend and update it. Specifically; new sources of impedances have been identified; evaluated and included in the model. One finding are low Q and low-frequency (LF; here below 1 GHz) resonances which occur due to enamelled flanges in combination with external cabling e.g. ground loops. These resonances couple to the beam through the gap with enamel coating which creates an open resonator. Since this impedance is important for beam stability in the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS); RF by-passes were installed on the enamelled flanges; and their significance for the SPS beam is currently under investigation. Simulations; bench and beam measurements were used to deduce model parameters for beam dynamic simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopr010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopr010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopr010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPR010,71

The two existing five-section cavities will be rearranged into four three-section cavities (using two existing spare sections); thereby increasing the total voltage from 7 MV (IRF = 1.5 A) to 10 MV (IRF = 3.0 A). Projections of the HL-LHC (High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider) era are conceived by the macro-particle simulation code BLonD; that makes use of an impedance model of the SPS; developed from a thorough survey of machine elements.

The aim is to provide beams with a brightness a factor of two higher than the present maximum achieved. The 450 GeV beams injected into the LHC are directly provided by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) via two transfer lines (TL); TI2 and TI8. Such transfer lines are both equipped with a passive protection system to protect the LHC aperture against ultra-fast failures of the extraction and transport systems. In the LHC instead; the injection protection system protects the cold apertures against possible failures of the injection kicker; MKI. Due to the increase of the beam brightness; these passive systems need to be upgraded. In this paper; the foreseen and ongoing modifications of the LHC injection protection system and the TL collimators are presented. Simulations of the protection guaranteed by the new systems in case of failures are described; together with benchmark with measurements for the current systems.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopr012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopr012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopr012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPR012,81

hb2016,,MOPR016,Mitigation of Numerical Noise for Beam Loss Simulations,IAP; Frankfurt am Main; Germany; GSI; Darmstadt; Germany; Numerical noise emerges in self-consistent simulations of charged particles; and its mitigation is investigated since the first numerical studies in plasma physics. In accelerator physics; recent studies find an artificial diffusion of the particle beam due to numerical noise in particle-in-cell tracking; which is of particular importance for high intensity machines with a long storage time; as the SIS100 at FAIR or in context of the LIU upgrade at CERN. In beam loss simulations for these projects artificial effects must be distinguished from physical beam loss. Therefore; it is important to relate artificial diffusion to artificial beam loss; and to choose simulation parameters such that physical beam loss is well resolved. As a practical tool; we therefore suggest a scaling law to find optimal simulation parameters for a given maximum percentage of acceptable artificial beam loss.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopr016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopr016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopr016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPR016,90

The code calculate the longitudinal particle motion with a wake voltage and a space charge effect. The most different point from the other codes is that a synchronous particle motion is calculated from the bending magnetic field pattern. This means the synchronous particle is independent from an acceleration frequency pattern. This feature is useful to check the adiabaticity of the synchrotron. The code also calculates the longitudinal emittance and the filling factor at an rf bucket under the multi-harmonics.

In order to study beam stability in the longitudinal plane simulations have been performed with the CERN BLonD code; using an accurate longitudinal impedance model and a reliable estimation of the longitudinal space charge. Particular attention has been dedicated to the three main features that currently let the beam go stably through the ramp: Double RF operation in bunch-lengthening mode to reduce the transverse space charge tune spread; exploitation of feedback loops to damp dipole oscillations; and controlled longitudinal emittance blow-up.

However; the mechanism leading to particle loss as beam approaches this resonance; which thus defines the limit; is not clearly understood. In this paper we explore simple models; based on single particle resonance ideas; to see if they describe useful aspects of motion as observed in simulations and experiments of 2D coasting beams on the ISIS synchrotron. Single particle behaviour is compared to 2D self-consistent models to assess when coherent motion begins to affect the single particle motion; and understand the relevance of coherent and incoherent resonance. Whilst the general problem of 2D resonant loss; with non-stationary distributions and non-linear fields is potentially extremely complicated; here we suggest that for a well-designed machine; where higher order pathological loss effects are avoided; a relatively simple model may give valuable insights into beam behaviour and control.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopr030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopr030.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopr030_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPR030,150

The losses are caused by motion non-linearity due to direct space charge and due to non-linearity introduced by large values of chromaticity sextupoles required to suppress transverse instabilities. The report aims to address the former - the suppression of incoherent space charge effects by reducing deviations from the perfect periodicity of linear optics functions. It should be achieved by high accuracy optics measurements with subsequent optics correction and by removing known sources of optics perturbations. The study shows significant impact of optics correction on the half-integer stop band with subsequent reduction of particle loss.

hb2016,,MOPL018,Scintillator Detectors for the ESS High Energy Wire Scanner,ESS; Lund; Sweden; In the ESS linac; during commissioning and restart phase; wire scanner will be used intensively to characterize the transverse beam profiles. At low energy; the mode of detection is based on Secondary Emission (SE); while at energies above 200 MeV; the primary mode of detection will be the measurement of the hadronic shower created in the thin wire. In this paper we will present the design and the output signal estimation of the shower detector; based on inorganic crystal and silicon photodetector.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopl018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopl018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopl018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPL018,232
hb2016,,MOPL020,Online Measurement of the Energy Spread of Multi-Turn Beam in the Fermilab Booster at Injection,C.M. Bhat; B. Hendricks; Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Brown University; Providence; USA; Abstract: We have developed a computer program interfaced with the ACNET environment for Fermilab accelerators to measure energy spread of the proton beam from the LINAC at an injection kinetic energy of 400 MeV. It uses a digitizing oscilloscope and provides the user the ability to configure scope settings for optimal data acquisition from a resistive wall monitor. When the program is launched; it secures complete control of the scope. Subsequently; a special “one-shot” timeline is generated to initiate the beam injection into the Booster. After the completion of the beam injection from the LINAC; a gap of about 40 ns is produced in the Booster beam using a set of kickers and line-charge distribution data is collected for next 200 μs. The program then analyzes the data to extract the gap width; beam revolution period and beam energy spread. We illustrate a case with an example. We also present results on beam energy spread as a function of beam intensity from a recent measurement.; Author would like to thank S. Chaurize; C. Drennan; W. Pellico; K. Seiya; T. Sullivan and K.

hb2016,,MOPL021,Fermilab Booster Transition Crossing Simulations and Beam Studies,C.M. Bhat; C.-Y. Tan; Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; The Fermiab Booster accelerates beam from 400 MeV to 8 GeV at 15 Hz. In the PIP (Proton Improvement Plan) era; it is required that Booster deliver 4.2·1012 protons per pulse to extraction. One of the obstacles for providing quality beam to the users is the longitudinal quadrupole oscillation that the beam suffers from right after transition. Although this oscillation is well taken care of with quadrupole dampers; it is important to understand the source of these oscillation in light of the PIP II requirements that require 6.5·1012 protons per pulse at extraction. This paper explores the results from computer simulations; machine studies and solutions to prevent the quadrupole oscillation after transition.; Author would like to thank S. Chaurize; C.

RCS accumulates and accelerates the proton beams from 80MeV to 1.6GeV for striking the target with the repetition rate of 25Hz. RCS demands low uncontrolled loss for hands on maintenance; and one needs a tight tolerance on magnet field accuracy. Magnet sorting can be done to minimize linear effects of beam dynamics. Using closed-orbit distortion (COD) and beta-beating independently as the merit function; and considering maintaining the symmetry of the lattice; a code based on traversal algorithm is developed to get the dipoles and quadrupoles sorting for CSNS/RCS. The comparison of beam distribution; collimation efficiency and beam loss are also investigated according to beam injection and beam accelerating.,Funding: Work supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (11405189)*,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/talks/mopl024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/papers/mopl024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hb2016/posters/mopl024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-MOPL024,247
