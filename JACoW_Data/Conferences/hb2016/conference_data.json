We propose window frame electro-magnets surrounding the Halbach magnets to be used as normal and skew dipoles correctors and quadrupole correctors. We will present results from OPERA-3D calculations of the effect of these corrector magnets on the magnetic field of the main quadrupole magnets and the results will be compared with experimental measurements.

The code calculate the longitudinal particle motion with a wake voltage and a space charge effect. The most different point from the other codes is that a synchronous particle motion is calculated from the bending magnetic field pattern. This means the synchronous particle is independent from an acceleration frequency pattern. This feature is useful to check the adiabaticity of the synchrotron. The code also calculates the longitudinal emittance and the filling factor at an rf bucket under the multi-harmonics. We will describe the feature of the code. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-",

The losses are caused by motion non-linearity due to direct space charge and due to non-linearity introduced by large values of chromaticity sextupoles required to suppress transverse instabilities. The report aims to address the former - the suppression of incoherent space charge effects by reducing deviations from the perfect periodicity of linear optics functions. It should be achieved by high accuracy optics measurements with subsequent optics correction and by removing known sources of optics perturbations. The study shows significant impact of optics correction on the half-integer stop band with subsequent reduction of particle loss.

The existing method uses a divergent laser beam that allows compensation of angular and momentum spread of the stripped beam. The femtosecond laser pulse has a similar property that can compensate the spread and yield efficient laser stripping. Results of simulations with realistic femtosecond laser and H− beam parameters are discussed. The proposed method may have some benefit for particular technical conditions compared with others. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-",

We propose window frame electro-magnets surrounding the Halbach magnets to be used as normal and skew dipoles correctors and quadrupole correctors. We will present results from OPERA-3D calculations of the effect of these corrector magnets on the magnetic field of the main quadrupole magnets and the results will be compared with experimental measurements.

The code calculate the longitudinal particle motion with a wake voltage and a space charge effect. The most different point from the other codes is that a synchronous particle motion is calculated from the bending magnetic field pattern. This means the synchronous particle is independent from an acceleration frequency pattern. This feature is useful to check the adiabaticity of the synchrotron. The code also calculates the longitudinal emittance and the filling factor at an rf bucket under the multi-harmonics. We will describe the feature of the code. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-HB2016-",

The losses are caused by motion non-linearity due to direct space charge and due to non-linearity introduced by large values of chromaticity sextupoles required to suppress transverse instabilities. The report aims to address the former - the suppression of incoherent space charge effects by reducing deviations from the perfect periodicity of linear optics functions. It should be achieved by high accuracy optics measurements with subsequent optics correction and by removing known sources of optics perturbations. The study shows significant impact of optics correction on the half-integer stop band with subsequent reduction of particle loss. We use realistic Booster lattice model to understand the present limitations",

The kinetic distribution functions dependent on the motion integrals allow to obtain accurate Vlasov equation solutions as KV-model does it. The method allows to solve the envelope equation both analytically and by ODE system numerical integration",
