Its 108 MHz Alvarez DTL providing acceleration from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u has suffered from material fatigue and has to be replaced by a new section. The design of the new post-stripper DTL is now under development in GSI. An optimized drift tube shape increases the shunt impedance and varying stem orientations mitigate parasitic rf-modes. This contribution is on the beam dynamics layout.",

        "it is required that Booster deliver 4.2·1012 protons per pulse to extraction. One of the obstacles for providing quality beam to the users is the longitudinal quadrupole oscillation that the beam suffers from right after transition. Although this oscillation is well taken care of with quadrupole dampers",
        "it is important to understand the source of these oscillation in light of the PIP II requirements that require 6.5·1012 protons per pulse at extraction. This paper explores the results from computer simulations",
