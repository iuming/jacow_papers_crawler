cool2019,,TUPS01,Simulation of Electron Cooling and IBS at EICC,IMP/CAS; Lanzhou; People’s Republic of China; Electron Cooling will be considered in the future project EICC. In this high energy region; electron cooling is very different from the traditional low energy case. For get high luminosity; the high intensity and long lifetime of ion beam was required with the help of electron cooling. Electron cooling and IBS were simulated in the cases of high energy and high intensity for typical ion; proton and Uranium. Some initial parameters were obtained from the simulation. It will be helpful for the understanding of high energy electron cooling.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/talks/tups01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/papers/tups01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/posters/tups01_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2019-TUPS01,77
cool2019,,TUPS02,Two-Energy Storage-Ring Electron Cooler,F. Lin; Y.S. Derbenev; G.A. Krafft; V.S. Morozov; Y. Zhang; JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; J.R. Delayen; B. Dhital; ODU; Norfolk; Virginia; USA; Cooling of ion beams to achieve a significant reduction of beam emittances is crucial to deliver high luminosities over a broad center of mass energy range in a collider. An electron-beam-based cooling system is one of the most potential approaches. It allows a small transverse beam size at the interaction point; and a small beta-star and crab crossing with a longitudinally short bunch length. Cooling also extends the luminosity lifetime by counteracting the intra-beam scattering (IBS) induced emittance degradation. In this paper; we propose a development of a storage-ring-based electron cooler consisting of two sections with significantly different energies: the cooling and damping sections. The electron energy and other parameters in the cooling section are adjusted for optimum cooling of a stored ion beam. The beam parameters in the damping section are adjusted for optimum damping of the electron beam. The necessary energy difference is provided by an energy-recovering-superconducting RF structure. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations have been performed to demonstrate a stable longitudinal motion with acceleration and deceleration of electron beams in this two-energy cooling system.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/talks/tups02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/papers/tups02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/posters/tups02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2019-TUPS02,

Their effect depends on the Coulomb interactions between the circulating beam and the cold electrons at small relative velocities. The cooling process can be modelled through different approaches and the behaviour of the cooling force; can be described by various formulas; which include different parameters. The aim of the present study is to compare the accuracy of the cooling simulations performed by two distinct beam-tracking codes: Betacool and RF-Track. Being based on different models and formulas; the two simulation tools require different parameters in order to realistically describe electron cooling. In this contribution; the impact of these parameters is discussed; and simulation predictions are compared with experimental data from LEIR (Low Energy Ion Ring) at CERN and ESR (Experimentier-Speicher-Ring) at GSI.

Beam position monitor (BPM) system for orbit measurements has been developed at BINP. The system contains 16 BPMs inside the cooling sections; 4 BPMs inside the high voltage vessels and 22 BPMs in transport channels. Continuous electron beam is modulated with 10 MHz sinusoidal signal for capability to get signals from pickup electrodes. The beam current modulation can be varied in the range of 0.3 - 5 mA. The modulation signal may be supplied to each sector of the control electrode. So; the position of one quadrant sector of the electron beam can be measured by BPM system. Comparing the positions of each sectors from BPM to BPM it is possible to analyse the shape of the electron beam in the transport channel and cooling section. The BPMs inside the cooling section can measure both electron and ion beams. It is achieved by means of switching the reference signals inside the BPM electronics. The prototypes of new BPM electronics have been fabricated and tested. The BPM electronics provides highly precise beam position measurements. Position measurement error doesn’t exceed a few micron. Design features of the BPM system; its parameters and testing results are presented in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/talks/tups08_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/papers/tups08.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/posters/tups08_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2019-TUPS08,96

However; electron cooling experiments show that there exist limits on intensity of electron beam and the stored ion beams. Meanwhile; experiments of cooling with pulsed e-beam show structure instability that should be explained.

cool2019,,TUPS11,Specifications for a new Electron Cooler for the Antiproton Decelerator (AD),G. Tranquille; L.V. Joergensenpresenter; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; In October 1979 the first electron cooling experiments at CERN were performed on the Initial Cooling Experiment (ICE) ring. Forty years later; and after two re-incarnations; the same device continues to cool beams of antiprotons on the AD; improving the quality of the particle beams delivered to the different trap experiments. However; with time; it has become increasingly difficult to obtain spare units for this device. Many sub-systems can only be replaced by newly design parts; which can be complicated to integrate in the present device. In addition; some design flaws have become apparent over the last years; which have seriously degraded the availability of the cooler. To ensure the best performance of the antimatter complex at CERN for the coming years; we have decided to build an entirely new state-of-the-art electron cooler operating at higher energies than the present device. The specifications of this new electron cooler and the expected performance will be presented in this paper.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/talks/tups11_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/papers/tups11.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/posters/tups11_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2019-TUPS11,
cool2019,,TUPS12,Commissioning the ELENA Electron Cooler,G. Tranquille; J. Cenede; S. Deschamps; A. Frassier; L.V. Joergensenpresenter; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Electron cooling is central to the success of the Extra Low ENergy Antiproton (ELENA) ring which will increase by a factor of up to 100 the number of antiprotons available for the trap experiments. Cooling is needed to reduce or eliminate the emittance blow-up caused by the deceleration process and obtain the small emittance antiproton beams needed for further deceleration and extraction to the experiments. The device that has been installed on ELENA is designed to operate at electron energies below 350 eV in an ultrahigh vacuum environment and with minimum perturbation to the ring. We present the key stages of the commissioning of the cooler (magnetic measurements; installation; setting-up etc.) which culminated in the phase-space cooling of antiprotons in ELENA at energies as low as 100 keV.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/talks/tups12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/papers/tups12.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2019/posters/tups12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2019-TUPS12,

In the experiment; a CW la-ser system with a wavelength of 220 nm was used to interact with the closed 2s1/2-2p1/2 optical transi-tion of O5+ ions. In order to cool the relativistic ion beams with only one counter-propagating CW laser; the ion beams were bunched by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the RF-buncher system.
