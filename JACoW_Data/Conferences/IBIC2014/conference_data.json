            "Recent recommendations from the Basic Energy Science Advisory Committee (BESAC) and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) will have a significant long-term impact on accelerator development at SLAC. Most importantly, in summer 2013 BESAC recommended the number of FEL photon beam-lines in the 0.2 to 4 KeV range be increased substantially. This recommendation resulted in the proposal (LCLS-II), now accepted, to build a new 4 GeV CW superconducting linac in the same housing as the existing SLAC LCLS linac. The LCLS-II project involves contributions from several US partner-labs and is now in full-swing. BESAC also supported fully integrating the two FEL-linacs so that photon beam-line equipment could be used for either the high energy low-repetition rate beam or the moderate energy very high-repetition rate beam. The P5 report, on the other hand, strongly supported US involvement in the proposed International Linear Collider development, based in Japan. Both projects rely on the L-band superconducting RF technology under development for the last 25 years. The talk will report on recent technical developments and describe plans for future work."

            "Superconducting detectors have grown in scale and sensitivity",
            "and now can greatly improve both measurements of the cosmic microwave background and x-ray spectroscopy at x-ray light sources. Superconducting x-ray spectrometers provide high spectral resolution along with high photon-collection efficiency at x-ray light sources (more than two orders of magnitude higher than provided by gratings) and simultaneous measurement of the full spectrum in each pixel. They operate by measuring a temperature pulse from the absorption of individual x-rays. The temperature pulse is sensed by a superconducting film and amplified by a superconducting amplifier. The development of multiplexed superconducting amplifiers has enabled the construction of arrays of pixels. Kilopixel x-ray calorimeter arrays are planned for both synchrotron and free-electron-laser beamlines",
            "and technology development is underway to scale to megapixel arrays",
            "which would allow nearly 2*pi solid angle coverage and extremely high count rates. Similarly",
            "the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be determined by measuring a temperature change induced by cosmic microwave background photons from a millimeter-wave telescope.

The scanner is located in MEBT with H− energy of 2.5MeV and an RF frequency 402.5MHz. The picosecond pulsed laser runs at 80.5MHz in sync with the accelerator RF. The laser beam is delivered to the beam line through a 30m optical fiber. The pulse width after the fiber transmission measures about 10ps. Scanning the laser phase effectively allows measurements to move along ion bunch longitudinal position. We are able to reliably measure production beam bunch length with this method. The biggest problem we have encountered is background signal from electrons being stripped by vacuum. Several techniques of signal detection are discussed.",

Electron bunches can be filled in up to 184 buckets with a distance between two adjacent bunches of 2 ns corresponding to the RF system frequency of 500 MHz. Arbitrary filling patterns are generated to investigate the interaction of adjacent bunches in CSR. To study the THz emission characteristics over multiple revolutions superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) film detectors are used. The intrinsic response time of YBCO thin films is in the order of a few picoseconds only. For fast",

            "a picosecond pulse sampling card and a GByte transfer data link back-end readout card. High-end graphic processing units (GPUs) perform real-time data analysis. The KAPTURE system was successfully demonstrated for readout of the intensity fluctuations in the CSR at the ANKA Storage Ring detected in THz range. Four samples are recorded in parallel for each fast pulse with programmable sampling times in the range of 3 to 100 psec. A clean jitter phase locked loop (PLL) provides a clock signal with high temporal accuracy. The back-end card receives the 4 digital samples every 2 ns with 12 bits resolution and transmits the data to the data analysis unit. The readout board is based on programmable logic FPGA and DDR3 memories for on-line data preprocessing and temporary storage. The data is transmitted to the GPU computing node by a fast data transfer links based on a bus master DMA engine connected to PCI express endpoint logic to ensure a continuous high data throughput of up to 4 GByte/s. This heterogeneous real-time system architecture based on FPGA and GPU is used for on-line pulse reconstruction and evaluations and calculates the peak amplitude of each pulse and the time between consecutive bunches with a picosecond time resolution. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed on-line for the frequency analysis of the CSR undulations. With the presented acquisition system it was possible to resolve the bursting behavior of single bunches even in a multi-bunch environment to study the bunch-bunch-interactions at ANKA. First results obtained have already been published in the synchrotron machine physic community. The monitoring of bursting for different ANKA parameters using KAPTURE system opens up new analysis and diagnostics possibilities for electron storage rings operating at short bunch lengths."

To perform time resolved experiments at the end of the facility it is essential to provide a highly stable clock signal to all subsystems. The accuracy of this signal is extremely important since it defines limitations of precise measurement devices. A laser based synchronization system is used for the synchronization with an error in sub-femtosecond range. These light pulses are carried by an optical fiber and exposed to external disturbances which changes the optical length of the fiber. For that reason the up to 4 kilometer long fibers are actively stabilized using a controller implemented on the new MicroTCA Platform. Due to the high computation resources of this platform it is possible to attack the time delay of the link system with well known model based feedback control strategies. This contribution shows the design of a model based controller for such a system and compares the control performance of the previously used PID controller with advanced control algorithms at the currently installed laboratory setup.",

            "Beam profiles in the two storage rings of the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) are measured with ionization profile monitors (IPMs). An IPM measures the distribution of electrons produced by beam ionization of background gas. These detectors have been developed at BNL in a program that began in 1996. The current detectors are a design from 2009. During the 2012 shutdown we refurbished the 2009 prototype detector and installed it in the Alternating-Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) for horizontal profiles. The commissioning tests were successful and in 2013 we built a new IPM for vertical profiles. In addition we placed coils on the backlegs of the permanent-magnet dipoles for beta-function measurements. This paper describes the AGS IPMs and shows data from the detector commissioning."

Consistency with independent measurements (luminosity-based using zero degree counters) at the colliding beam experiments STAR and PHENIX was demonstrated."

The measured profile and time structure of the UV laser on the cathode are utilized to specify the electron bunch parameters. Then a single bunch of electrons is tracked in the cavity field that was calculated by Superfish",

These beams propagating in opposite directions in a 5T solenoid have a typical rms width of 300 microns and need to overlap each other over an interaction length of about 2 m with deviations of less than ~50 microns. A new beam diagnostic tool to achieve and maintain this alignment is based on detecting electrons that are backscattered in close encounters with protons. Maximizing the intensity of these electrons ensures optimum beam overlap. The successful commissioning of these devices using 100 GeV/amu gold beams is described. Future developments are discussed that will further improve the sensitivity to small angular deviations.",

External injection experiments at REGAE (Relativistic Electron gun for Atomic Exploration) require sub-10 fs precision synchronization of laser and electron beams in order to perform a beam scan into the plasma wave by varying the delay between electron beam and laser pulses. In this paper we present a novel optical to microwave synchronization scheme",

The scheme offers a highly sensitive phase detector between a pulsed 800 nm Ti:Sa laser and a 3GHz microwave reference source. It is virtually independent of input laser power fluctuation and it offers femtosecond long-term precision. Together with the principal of operation of this setup",

An initial fast drop of the luminescence on CaF2:Eu was observed but the light output eventually approached a stable state under constant ion bombardment.

A typical characteristic curve of a pick-up is linear within a limited range from the BPM origin. At larger offsets the non-linearity of the curve is more pronounced and gets worse if the button diameter is small with respect to the beam pipe diameter. The general real-time linearization methods usually utilize linear correction combined with a simplistic polynomial",

We have developed a more rigorous methodology to suppress the non-linear effects of the BPMs through electromagnetic (EM) simulations and 2D fitting approximations.

The specifications of the monitors have been defined during an extensive study on the 4-cavity accelerating module installed at FLASH. Signals around 5.44 GHz have been chosen for higher precision measurements. However these signals propagate into the entire 1.2 m long module. Therefore in addition modes at about 9 GHz were selected for localized measurements in each cavity. The electronics has been recently installed at FLASH.

Measuring the transverse profiles of these high intensity beams is challenging and generally relies on non-invasive techniques. One such technique involves measuring the deflection of a beam of electrons with a trajectory perpendicular to the proton beam. A device such as this is already in use at the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL and a similar device will be installed shortly in the Fermilab Main Injector.

The EBPM consists of transversely mounted stripline pickups in a rectangular beam pipe section and a signal detection scheme which measures the phases of the pulses at the ends of the pickup*. It allows simultaneous measurements of the beam energy and arrival-time. This paper presents the development of a RF readout electronic based on a modified six-port discriminator as a low-cost alternative to the readout electronics based on the MTCA.4 platform for the EBPM. Based on the six-port, the beam position can be determined by means of the phase difference between the received signals from both ends of the transmission line pickup. The six-port discriminator is a linear passive component, first developed in the 70s for accurate measurements of complex reflection coefficients in microwave network analysis**. It typically consists of two hybrid couplers and two power dividers or one Wilkinson power divider and three -3dB hybrid couplers. For the measurement of the difference of two signals excited from a single source one of the hybrid coupler can be omitted. The advantage of the six port is the fact that accurate phase measurements can be performed at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies only by amplitude measurements.

The principle is based on the introduction of two ionization volumes in series with slightly different gap sizes. The ratio of detected charges in both IC's is the basic observable which is used to recalculate the efficiency of each IC. The principle of this so-called \"asymmetric ionization chamber\" (AIC) was tested with beam from the S2C2 prototype. The results show that the efficiency can be re-calculated to 0.5% precision for voltages higher than 1000 V. Together with the experimental results",

The energy recovery linac (ERL) BERLinPro will employ a 1.5 cell 1.3 GHz SRF gun cavity with normal conducting high quantum efficiency photocathode to produce a 100mA CW electron beam with high brightness. We are currently working on a compact test beamline (GunLab) to investigate the properties of the electron beam and to optimize the drive laser as well RF parameters. The motivation for GunLab is to decouple the SRF gun development from the ERL development. The goal is to measure not only the complete 6 dimensional phase space of the extracted and accelerated bunches but also to investigate dark current and beam halo. In this paper we will discuss unique features of GunLab for the phase space measurements.",

            "Heavy ion particles such as carbon ion beams are effective tools for cancer radiotherapy because of the higher dose localization and biological effectiveness by using the characteristic dose distribution with the Bragg peak. In the particle radiotherapy",
            "it is important to conform a dose distribution and deliver prescribed dose to a tumor. An ionization chamber is usually used as a beam monitor to control the prescribed dose to the target. Then new treatment research facility at National Institute of Radiological Science (NIRS) uses beam scanning irradiation system that make uniform dose distribution in the target volume by superposing dose deposit of an individual pencil beam. In order to increase dose concentration to the target and also decrease irradiation time",
            "it is necessary to minimize the pencil beam size and to increase the beam intensity. As the result",
            "the localization of the pencil beam with high intensity increases the number of general ion recombination in the beam monitor. Therefore",
            "we need to predict the ion recombination rate in the beam monitor for accurate control of the dose. For our purpose",
            "we developed calculation code to predict the ion recombination rate when the pencil beam scanning is used. The calculation code can divide a pencil beam into a sub region and calculate ion recombination rate in each sub region by using Boag theory. We present the calculation results compared with measurements for verification of our calculation code.",

The pick-up geometry is simulated to estimate its sensitivity towards the beam dipole and quadrupole moments. Turn-by-turn quadrupole moment measurement allows to calculate the frequency of beam-size oscillations. Recent beam measurements using this pick-up show clear indications of the beam-size oscillations induced by the injection mismatch. In this contribution",

        "Recent recommendations from the Basic Energy Science Advisory Committee (BESAC) and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) will have a significant long-term impact on accelerator development at SLAC. Most importantly, in summer 2013 BESAC recommended the number of FEL photon beam-lines in the 0.2 to 4 KeV range be increased substantially. This recommendation resulted in the proposal (LCLS-II), now accepted, to build a new 4 GeV CW superconducting linac in the same housing as the existing SLAC LCLS linac. The LCLS-II project involves contributions from several US partner-labs and is now in full-swing. BESAC also supported fully integrating the two FEL-linacs so that photon beam-line equipment could be used for either the high energy low-repetition rate beam or the moderate energy very high-repetition rate beam. The P5 report, on the other hand, strongly supported US involvement in the proposed International Linear Collider development, based in Japan. Both projects rely on the L-band superconducting RF technology under development for the last 25 years. The talk will report on recent technical developments and describe plans for future work."

Superconducting x-ray spectrometers provide high spectral resolution along with high photon-collection efficiency at x-ray light sources (more than two orders of magnitude higher than provided by gratings) and simultaneous measurement of the full spectrum in each pixel. They operate by measuring a temperature pulse from the absorption of individual x-rays. The temperature pulse is sensed by a superconducting film and amplified by a superconducting amplifier. The development of multiplexed superconducting amplifiers has enabled the construction of arrays of pixels. Kilopixel x-ray calorimeter arrays are planned for both synchrotron and free-electron-laser beamlines",
        "and technology development is underway to scale to megapixel arrays",
        "which would allow nearly 2*pi solid angle coverage and extremely high count rates. Similarly",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a longitudinal H− beam profile scanner that utilizes laser light to detach convoy electrons and an MCP to collect and measure these electrons. The scanner is located in MEBT with H− energy of 2.5MeV and an RF frequency 402.5MHz. The picosecond pulsed laser runs at 80.5MHz in sync with the accelerator RF. The laser beam is delivered to the beam line through a 30m optical fiber. The pulse width after the fiber transmission measures about 10ps. Scanning the laser phase effectively allows measurements to move along ion bunch longitudinal position. We are able to reliably measure production beam bunch length with this method. The biggest problem we have encountered is background signal from electrons being stripped by vacuum. Several techniques of signal detection are discussed.",

        "coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) generated by short electron bunches has been provided at the ANKA light source. Electron bunches can be filled in up to 184 buckets with a distance between two adjacent bunches of 2 ns corresponding to the RF system frequency of 500 MHz. Arbitrary filling patterns are generated to investigate the interaction of adjacent bunches in CSR. To study the THz emission characteristics over multiple revolutions superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) film detectors are used. The intrinsic response time of YBCO thin films is in the order of a few picoseconds only. For fast",

        "a novel digitizer system has been developed. The KAPTURE (KArlsruhe Pulse Taking Ultra-fast Readout Electronics) consists of a wideband low-noise amplifier",
        "a picosecond pulse sampling card and a GByte transfer data link back-end readout card. High-end graphic processing units (GPUs) perform real-time data analysis. The KAPTURE system was successfully demonstrated for readout of the intensity fluctuations in the CSR at the ANKA Storage Ring detected in THz range. Four samples are recorded in parallel for each fast pulse with programmable sampling times in the range of 3 to 100 psec. A clean jitter phase locked loop (PLL) provides a clock signal with high temporal accuracy. The back-end card receives the 4 digital samples every 2 ns with 12 bits resolution and transmits the data to the data analysis unit. The readout board is based on programmable logic FPGA and DDR3 memories for on-line data preprocessing and temporary storage. The data is transmitted to the GPU computing node by a fast data transfer links based on a bus master DMA engine connected to PCI express endpoint logic to ensure a continuous high data throughput of up to 4 GByte/s. This heterogeneous real-time system architecture based on FPGA and GPU is used for on-line pulse reconstruction and evaluations and calculates the peak amplitude of each pulse and the time between consecutive bunches with a picosecond time resolution. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed on-line for the frequency analysis of the CSR undulations. With the presented acquisition system it was possible to resolve the bursting behavior of single bunches even in a multi-bunch environment to study the bunch-bunch-interactions at ANKA. First results obtained have already been published in the synchrotron machine physic community. The monitoring of bursting for different ANKA parameters using KAPTURE system opens up new analysis and diagnostics possibilities for electron storage rings operating at short bunch lengths."

To perform time resolved experiments at the end of the facility it is essential to provide a highly stable clock signal to all subsystems. The accuracy of this signal is extremely important since it defines limitations of precise measurement devices. A laser based synchronization system is used for the synchronization with an error in sub-femtosecond range. These light pulses are carried by an optical fiber and exposed to external disturbances which changes the optical length of the fiber. For that reason the up to 4 kilometer long fibers are actively stabilized using a controller implemented on the new MicroTCA Platform. Due to the high computation resources of this platform it is possible to attack the time delay of the link system with well known model based feedback control strategies. This contribution shows the design of a model based controller for such a system and compares the control performance of the previously used PID controller with advanced control algorithms at the currently installed laboratory setup.",

An IPM measures the distribution of electrons produced by beam ionization of background gas. These detectors have been developed at BNL in a program that began in 1996. The current detectors are a design from 2009. During the 2012 shutdown we refurbished the 2009 prototype detector and installed it in the Alternating-Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) for horizontal profiles. The commissioning tests were successful and in 2013 we built a new IPM for vertical profiles. In addition we placed coils on the backlegs of the permanent-magnet dipoles for beta-function measurements. This paper describes the AGS IPMs and shows data from the detector commissioning."

The measured profile and time structure of the UV laser on the cathode are utilized to specify the electron bunch parameters. Then a single bunch of electrons is tracked in the cavity field that was calculated by Superfish",

        "the electron bunch has a relatively high energy so we ignore the space charge effect there and apply elegant to track the particles through the magnet elements and accelerator modules. The main purpose of this simulation is to find the optimized parameters for different beam transport tasks. As a first experimental result of the photoinjector",
        "energy and phase space measurement will be also presented in the paper. Both the slit mask and the quadrupole scan methods are applied to measure the beam emittance. An obvious progression will be to compare the results from this gun with those from the ELBE SRF gun I.",

These beams propagating in opposite directions in a 5T solenoid have a typical rms width of 300 microns and need to overlap each other over an interaction length of about 2 m with deviations of less than ~50 microns. A new beam diagnostic tool to achieve and maintain this alignment is based on detecting electrons that are backscattered in close encounters with protons. Maximizing the intensity of these electrons ensures optimum beam overlap. The successful commissioning of these devices using 100 GeV/amu gold beams is described. Future developments are discussed that will further improve the sensitivity to small angular deviations.",

For this second part a new optical setup including a cross correlator has been installed. The operation of the EOS has greatly benefited from the upgrade.

        "A novel emittance diagnostics technique with high sensitivity using X-ray Fresnel diffraction by a single slit has been developed to measure micron-order electron beam sizes at insertion devices (IDs) of photon beamlines. The X-ray Fresnel diffractometry (XFD)* is promising for diagnostics especially of a so-called diffraction limited storage ring (DLSR) with ultra-low emittance. In the DLSR",
        "due to inevitable field errors of strong quadrupole and sextupole magnets",
        "unwanted distortion of lattice functions and local betatron coupling will result in a different light source size at each beamline. Therefore",
        "measurements of electron beam sizes at the ID source points will be essential to ensure the absence of degradation of brilliance and transverse coherence of radiation at the beamlines. The XFD observes a double-lobed diffraction pattern that emerges by optimizing the single slit width. The principle is based on a correlation between the depth of a median dip in the double-lobed pattern and the light source size at the ID. The validity of the new technique was theoretically and experimentally studied. The achievable resolution of the XFD will be also discussed.",

A typical characteristic curve of a pick-up is linear within a limited range from the BPM origin. At larger offsets the non-linearity of the curve is more pronounced and gets worse if the button diameter is small with respect to the beam pipe diameter. The general real-time linearization methods usually utilize linear correction combined with a simplistic polynomial",

We have developed a more rigorous methodology to suppress the non-linear effects of the BPMs through electromagnetic (EM) simulations and 2D fitting approximations.

      "abstract": "For the European XFEL, new energy beam position monitors based on planar transmission lines were designed for energy measurements in the dispersive section of bunch compressor chicanes. The EBPM consists of transversely mounted stripline pickups in a rectangular beam pipe section and a signal detection scheme which measures the phases of the pulses at the ends of the pickup*. It allows simultaneous measurements of the beam energy and arrival-time. This paper presents the development of a RF readout electronic based on a modified six-port discriminator as a low-cost alternative to the readout electronics based on the MTCA.4 platform for the EBPM. Based on the six-port, the beam position can be determined by means of the phase difference between the received signals from both ends of the transmission line pickup. The six-port discriminator is a linear passive component, first developed in the 70s for accurate measurements of complex reflection coefficients in microwave network analysis**. It typically consists of two hybrid couplers and two power dividers or one Wilkinson power divider and three -3dB hybrid couplers. For the measurement of the difference of two signals excited from a single source one of the hybrid coupler can be omitted. The advantage of the six port is the fact that accurate phase measurements can be performed at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies only by amplitude measurements. This paper shows the principle of operation, developed prototype, and first test results",

        "a large area (30x30 cm2) and large gap (>3 mm) ionization chamber (IC) is presented which allows to quantify recombination losses in each beam pulse on-line. The principle is based on the introduction of two ionization volumes in series with slightly different gap sizes. The ratio of detected charges in both IC's is the basic observable which is used to recalculate the efficiency of each IC. The principle of this so-called \"asymmetric ionization chamber\" (AIC) was tested with beam from the S2C2 prototype. The results show that the efficiency can be re-calculated to 0.5% precision for voltages higher than 1000 V. Together with the experimental results",
        "the theoretical background of the recombination losses will be discussed and it will be shown how this theory is applied in a robust and simple way to correct for these losses in the proton therapy system."

The energy recovery linac (ERL) BERLinPro will employ a 1.5 cell 1.3 GHz SRF gun cavity with normal conducting high quantum efficiency photocathode to produce a 100mA CW electron beam with high brightness. We are currently working on a compact test beamline (GunLab) to investigate the properties of the electron beam and to optimize the drive laser as well RF parameters. The motivation for GunLab is to decouple the SRF gun development from the ERL development. The goal is to measure not only the complete 6 dimensional phase space of the extracted and accelerated bunches but also to investigate dark current and beam halo. In this paper we will discuss unique features of GunLab for the phase space measurements.",

        "An asymmetric capacitive pick-up was installed at GSI SIS-18 for determination of the turn-by-turn beam quadrupole moment. The pick-up geometry is simulated to estimate its sensitivity towards the beam dipole and quadrupole moments. Turn-by-turn quadrupole moment measurement allows to calculate the frequency of beam-size oscillations. Recent beam measurements using this pick-up show clear indications of the beam-size oscillations induced by the injection mismatch. In this contribution",
        "we present these measurements and discuss their relevance for the direct determination of the incoherent space charge tune shift."

We have begun to develop high position resolution BPM readout system with narrow bandpass filters (fc = 180 MHz) and 250 MSa/s 16-bit ADCs. It handles two bunches with 96 ns interval separately and has a dynamic range from 0.1 nC to 10 nC. To compensate circuit drift",
