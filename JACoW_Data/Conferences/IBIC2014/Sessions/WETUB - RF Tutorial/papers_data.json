        "RF design is a mystery to many engineers â€“ even to some who practice the art on a daily basis. It sometimes seems that a pointy hat and arcane incantations are needed to make oscillators oscillate and amplifiers amplify (and not vice-versa). Part of the mystery has to do with the many ways that ever-present parasitics undergo surprising impedance transformations",
        "as well as the sometimes counterintuitive ways that nonlinear and time-varying processes can affect noise in amplifiers",
        "oscillators and mixers. This talk will attempt to answer frequently-asked questions about these and other RF-related topics. It is hoped that attendees will ask additional questions that they would like answered."
