        "CaF2:Eu and CsI:Tl scintillators induced with H2+ ion beams in the energy range of 600-2150 keV/u has been systematically measured as a function of irradiation time. The measurements showed that the luminescence of CsI:Tl and YAG:Ce remained constant within the 1-hour continuous irradiation. An initial fast drop of the luminescence on CaF2:Eu was observed but the light output eventually approached a stable state under constant ion bombardment. We also observed that the light output of KBr initially increased and then degraded gradually with further irradiation. The CsI:Tl screen produced the highest scintillation yield and KBr the lowest."

        "Laser-Compton scattering has become an important technique for beam diagnostics of the latest accelerators. In order to develop technologies for low emittance beams",
        "an Accelerator Test facility (ATF) was built at KEK. It consists of an electron linac",
        "a damping ring in which beam emittance is reduced",
        "and an extraction line. For emittance measurement we are developing a new type of beam profile monitor which works on the principle of inverse Compton scattering between electron and laser light. In order to achieve effective collision of photon and electron",
        "a pulsed and very thin size laser is required. Laser wire is one technique of measuring a small beam size. With green lasers",
        "which are converted to second harmonics from IR pulsed laser",
        "minimum beam waist is half of the beam waist obtained using infrared (IR) laser oscillator. Therefore",
        "it is possible to obtain beam waist less than 5 μm using green laser pulse",
        "which is required for effective photon-electron collision. First",
        "pulsed IR seed laser is amplified with 1.5 meter long PCF based amplifier system. This pulsed IR laser is converted to second harmonics with a non-linear crystal. Pulsed green laser is injected inside four mirror optical cavity to obtain very small beam waist at interaction point (IP). Using a pulsed compact laser wire",
        "we can measure 10 um electron beams in vertical directions. We report the development of the pulsed green laser and parameters of compact four mirror optical cavity for effective inverse Compton scattering."

        "We have developed a beam profile monitor that allows us to measure two-dimensional electron beam profiles for highly compressed electron bunches. Such bunches have plagued profile measurements in optical transition radiation monitors in the past",
        "because coherent radiation entering the optical system has invalidated the images and even destroyed cameras. The present design makes use of a scintillating crystal",
        "and directs coherent transition radiation away from the optical axis by careful choice of the angle. When observing Snell's law of refraction as well as the Scheimpflug imaging condition",
        "a resolution better than the thickness of the scintillator can be achieved. We will present measurements performed at the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility and at the Linac Coherent Light Source. The high resolution and excellent sensitivity of this monitor make it ideal for installation in SwissFEL."
