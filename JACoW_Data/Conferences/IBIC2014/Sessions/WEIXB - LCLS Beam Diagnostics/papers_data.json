        "An extensive set of beam diagnostics has been one of the factors in the successful commissioning and operation of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) x-ray FEL over the last seven years. The originally developed and installed diagnostics were geared towards measuring the electron beam parameters of the LCLS design specifications. Since then",
        "a number of improved and new diagnostics have been implemented to accommodate a much wider range of beam parameters and to overcome the challenges of diagnostics for a high brightness electron beam. Plans for the diagnostics of the LCLS-II project with its high repetition rate and high beam power and ongoing developments will also be discussed."
