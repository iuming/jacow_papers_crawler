        "An asymmetric capacitive pick-up was installed at GSI SIS-18 for determination of the turn-by-turn beam quadrupole moment. The pick-up geometry is simulated to estimate its sensitivity towards the beam dipole and quadrupole moments. Turn-by-turn quadrupole moment measurement allows to calculate the frequency of beam-size oscillations. Recent beam measurements using this pick-up show clear indications of the beam-size oscillations induced by the injection mismatch. In this contribution",
        "we present these measurements and discuss their relevance for the direct determination of the incoherent space charge tune shift."

        "RF cavities have been used as beam position and intensity monitors. Their structure has been extensively discussed across numerous papers reporting their successful operation. The application of RF cavities as pick-ups has recently been extended to include radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities and heavy ion storage rings. These pick-ups allow for very sensitive",

A similar cavity pick-up was installed in CSRe in IMP Lanzhou (***). In this work",

        "the accelerator structure has to be aligned within 0.1 mm position error. Since BPMs are essential instruments for beam based alignment (BBA)",
        "it is required to have one magnitude better position resolution to get enough alignment results. We have begun to develop high position resolution BPM readout system with narrow bandpass filters (fc = 180 MHz) and 250 MSa/s 16-bit ADCs. It handles two bunches with 96 ns interval separately and has a dynamic range from 0.1 nC to 10 nC. To compensate circuit drift",
        "two calibration (x-direction and y-direction) pulses are output to the BPM electrodes between beam cycles (20 ms). Since it needs to achieve not only high position resolution but also good position accuracy",
        "overall non-linearity within ±0.02 dB is required and the system has to have more than ±5 mm accurate position range. We confirmed the system performance with a 3-BPM resolution tests at KEK Injector Linac and it turned out that the system has 3 μm position resolution. We plan to install this system during 2015 summer shutdown."

Unfortunately the filtering process in this electronics mixes the information from one turn to the neighboring turns. An additional demixing algorithm has been set-up to correct this artefact. The paper reports on performances and limitations of those two algorithms that are used at SOLEIL to correct the BPM data.",
