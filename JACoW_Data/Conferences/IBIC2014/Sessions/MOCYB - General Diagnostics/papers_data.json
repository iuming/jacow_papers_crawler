        "The population density along the electron’s beam vertical profile at far distance from the central core (i.e. the far-away tails or “halo”) is now quantitatively measurable by the use of bending magnet X-rays. An available beamport is equipped with two specifically adapted absorbers",
        "an Aluminium UHV window",
        "an X-ray light blocker",
        "an X-ray imager",
        "and a few motorizations. The simple and inexpensive set-up (much resembling that of an X-ray pinhole camera system for emittance measurements in Light Sources",
        "but much shorter in length) allows the recording of images of the electron density profile over the 0.5 to 6mm distance range from the core. Results",
        "obtained under various manipulations on the electron beam to vary either Touchek or residual Gas scattering and thereby the Halo levels",
        "will be presented",
        "to fully demonstrate that this Halo monitor is exploring those realms of the beam where other diagnostics can not reach ."

      "abstract": "This paper describes a longitudinal H− beam profile scanner that utilizes laser light to detach convoy electrons and an MCP to collect and measure these electrons. The scanner is located in MEBT with H− energy of 2.5MeV and an RF frequency 402.5MHz. The picosecond pulsed laser runs at 80.5MHz in sync with the accelerator RF. The laser beam is delivered to the beam line through a 30m optical fiber. The pulse width after the fiber transmission measures about 10ps. Scanning the laser phase effectively allows measurements to move along ion bunch longitudinal position. We are able to reliably measure production beam bunch length with this method. The biggest problem we have encountered is background signal from electrons being stripped by vacuum. Several techniques of signal detection are discussed.",
