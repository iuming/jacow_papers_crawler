Measuring the transverse profiles of these high intensity beams is challenging and generally relies on non-invasive techniques. One such technique involves measuring the deflection of a beam of electrons with a trajectory perpendicular to the proton beam. A device such as this is already in use at the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL and a similar device will be installed shortly in the Fermilab Main Injector. The Main Injector device is discussed in detail and some test results and simulations are shown.",

The result indicates that the bunch length is few hundreds of femtosecond. A detailed data analysis is now performing. On the other hand",
