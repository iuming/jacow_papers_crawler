At the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE); there has been an ongoing effort to determine the location of high voltage breakdowns of the accelerating radio-frequency field inside of an evacuated resonant cavity. Tests were conducted with an array of 8 X-ray detectors with each detector observing a cell of the Drift Tube Linac (DTL) cavity. The array can be moved along the DTL cavity and record X-ray emissions from a section of the cavity and their timing with respect to the RF field quench using a fast 8 channel mixed-signal oscilloscope. This new diagnostic allowed us to map the most energetic emissions along the cavity and reduce the area to investigate. A thorough visual inspection revealed that one of the ion pump grating welds in the suspected area was exposing a small gap and melting copper on both sides. Sparking across this discontinuity is believed to be a source of electrons that drive the high voltage breakdowns in the drift tube cells.,"Funding: Work supported by the United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Agency, under contract 89233218CNA000001",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/moybb6_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/moybb6.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/moybb6_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-MOYBB6,47

Fortunately; the superconducting RF (SRF) technology is well suited for generating CW electron beams in high accelerating gradient environments. Recent achievements in the SRF photoinjector realm demonstrated the ability of the modern SRF guns to provide stable operation with high-brightness beams. In this paper; we report the excellent performance of our SRF gun with CsK2Sb photocathode that was built for the Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) Proof of Principle (PoP) experiment at RHIC. The gun is generating high charge electron bunches (up to 10 nC per bunch) and low transverse emittances with the cathodes operating for months without significant loss of quantum efficiency. We will provide a brief overview of the main stages of the commissioning of our gun along with a detailed discussion of the main challenges during the operation.

BESSY and MAX IV are now using a pulsed multipole magnet as an injection kicker. The injected beam sees a field off axis for injection while the stored beam experiences no field on the magnet axis. The principle advantage of using a pulsed multipole for injection is that the stored beam motion is greatly reduced since the field on axis is negligible. The number of pulsed magnets is reduced from five in the nominal scheme (septum and four bumps) to two or three thereby reducing the possible failure modes. This also eliminates the need to precisely match the pulse shapes of four dipole magnets to achieve minimal stored beam motion outside of the bump. In this paper we discuss two schemes of injecting into the NSLS-II using a pulsed multipole magnet. The first scheme uses a single pulsed multipole located in one cell downstream of the injection septum as the injection kicker. The second scheme uses two pulsed multipoles in the injection straight to perform the injection. We discuss both methods of injection and compare each method. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/moplm01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/moplm01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/moplm01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-MOPLM01,91

The photogun employs a compact inverted-tapered-geometry ceramic insulator that extends into the vacuum chamber and mechanically holds the cathode electrode. By operating at high voltage; the photogun will provide lower beam emittance; thereby improving the beam transmission through the injector apertures; and prolong the operating lifetime of the photogun. However; high voltage increases the field emission; which can result in high voltage breakdown and even lead to irreparable damage of the ceramic insulator. This work describes the methods to minimize the electric field near the metal-vacuum-insulator interface; and to avoid high voltage breakdown and ceramic insulator damage. The triple point junction shields are designed. The simulated electric field; field emission and beam transportation will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/moplm06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/moplm06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/moplm06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-MOPLM06,102

This issue is expected to be much more severe in the APS Upgrade; owing to doubling of the stored charge and much lower emittance. An experiment was conducted in the existing APS ring to test several possible dump materials and also assess the accuracy of predictions of beam-induced damage. Prior to the experiments; extensive beam abort simulations were performed with ELEGANT to predict thresholds for material damage; dependence on vertical beam size; and even the size of the trenches expected to be created by the beam. This paper presents the simulation methods; simple models for estimating damage; and results.

napac2019,,MOPLM08,Controlling Transient Collective Instabilities During Swap-Out Injection,ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; Previous work has shown that collective instabilities at injection may reduce injection efficiency even for on-axis injection as planned for the APS-Upgrade*. Stability at injection is governed by a number of factors; including phase-space mismatch between injected and stored bunch; strength of the impedance; degree of nonlinearities; and feedback. We find that the large tune-shift with amplitude of the most recent APS-U lattice largely tames the transient instability via Landau damping; and show that using octupoles to increase the nonlinear tune shift can stabilize the transient instability at injection that plagued a previously unstable lattice.; * R.R.

napac2019,,MOPLM10,Simulation Study With Septum Field Map for the APS Upgrade,A. Xiao; M. Abliz; M. Borland; ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; One of the biggest challenges faced by the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade injection system design is the septum magnet. Not only does the required leakage field inside the stored beam chamber need to be smaller than for the present ring; the magnet has to be slightly tilted about the z-axis to provide a gentle vertical bend that brings the injected beam trajectory close to y=0 when it passes through the storage ring quadrupole magnets upstream of the straight section. This paper describes the coordinate system transformation necessary to properly model the magnet from field maps. The main field is checked by tracking the injected beam backwards; while leakage fields are included in dynamic aperture simulation and beam lifetime calculation. Simulation results show that the magnet design satisfies the physics requirement.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/moplm10_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/moplm10.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/moplm10_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-MOPLM10,116

In this case; we have utilized a low-energy spectrometer beam line located 1.3 m downstream of the gun cavity to measure the electron beam energy; energy spread; and energy jitter. The nominal energy was 6.5 MeV using a gun gradient of 110 MV/m; and the energy spread was ~17 keV when driven by a 2.5-ps rms duration UV laser pulse at the selected rf gun phase. An energy jitter of 25 keV was initially observed in the spectrometer focal plane images. This jitter was partly attributed to the presence of both the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of the 119 MHz synchronization signal provided to the phase locked loop of the drive laser oscillator. The addition of a 150-MHz low-pass filter in the 119-MHz line strongly attenuated the two harmonics and resulted in a reduced energy jitter of ~15 keV.

Due to small transverse electron beam sizes; whole beam loss events are expected to yield dose levels in excess of 10 MGy in beam-facing components; pushing irradiated regions into a hydrodynamic regime. Whole beam aborts have characteristic time scales ranging from 100s of ps to 10s of microseconds which are either much shorter than or roughly equal to thermal diffusion times. Aluminum and titanium alloy test pieces are each exposed to a series of beam aborts of varying fill pattern and charge. Simulations suggest the high energy/power densities are likely to lead to phase transitions and damage in any material initially encountered by the beam. We describe measurements used to characterize the beam aborts and compare the results with those from the static particle-matter interaction code; MARS; we also plan to explore wakefield effects.

The Particle Accumulator Ring (PAR); originally designed for up to 6 nC charge; must be upgraded to provide 20 nC single bunch beam. Our studies have shown that bunch length of the PAR beam; typically 300 ps at lower charge; increases to 800 ps at high charge due to longitudinal instabilities; which causes low injection efficiency of the downstream Booster ring. We completed beam impedance of all the PAR vacuum components recently with CST wakefield solver. 3D CAD models are directly imported into CST and various techniques were explored to improve and verify the results. The results are also cross-checked with that from GdfidL and Echo simulation. We identified 23 bellow- and 24 non-bellow flanges that contribute to as much as 50% of the total loss factor. We are considering upgrade options to reduce over all beam loading and longitudinal impedance.

The pointing stability of the low-energy electron beam; which is crucial to maintain within acceptable limits given the long beam transport; is highly dependent on the center-of-mass (CoM) stability of the laser spot on the photocathode. For reasons of accessibility during operations; the laser itself is located outside the accelerator tunnel; leading to the need to propagate the laser beam 34 m via three laser tables to the photocathode. The challenges to achieving the required CoM stability of 10 microns on the photocathode thus requires mitigation of vibrations along the transport and of weather- and season-related environmental effects; while preserving accessibility and diagnostic capabilities with proactive design.

For APS Upgrade; the injectors will need to supply full-current bunch replacement with high single-bunch charge for swap-out in the new storage ring. Significant bunch lengthening; energy spread; and synchrotron sidebands are observed in PAR at high charge. Lower-charge dynamics are dominated by potential well distortion; while higher-charge dynamics appear to be dominated by microwave instability. Before a numerical impedance model was available; a simple circuit model was developed by fitting the measured bunch distributions to the Haissinski equation. Energy scaling was then used to predict the beam energy sufficient to raise the instability threshold to 18-20 nC. With the beam in a linear or nearly linear regime; higher harmonic radio frequency (rf) gap voltage can be used to reduce the bunch length at high charge and better match the booster acceptance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/moplm21_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/moplm21.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/moplm21_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-MOPLM21,151

However; its electron emission properties are yet to be fully understood. Recently; we started to investigate femtosecond-laser-induced strong-field photoemission from nanocrystalline diamond field emitters with very sharp (~10 nm apex) tips. Initial results show that the mechanism of electron emission at ~1010 W/cm2 light intensities in the near UV to near IR range is more complex than in metals. We present our latest experimental results obtained at Stanford University; while LANL’s strong-field photoemission test stand is being commissioned. We show that strong-field photoemission occurs not only at the nano-tip’s apex; but also on flat diamond surfaces (e.g.; pyramid sides); that is why extra care needs to be taken to differentiate between emission spots on the chip.

For each Superconducting RF (SRF) cavity is desirable a separate RF source with power up to hundreds of kW with pulse duration in the millisecond range. The efficiency of the traditional RF sources (klystrons; IOTs; solid-state amplifiers) is lower than that of the magnetrons; while the cost of a unit of RF power is much higher. Therefore the magnetron-based RF sources would significantly reduce the capital and operation costs in comparison with the traditional RF sources. A recently developed an innovative technique makes possible the pulsed generation of magnetrons powered below the self-excitation threshold voltage. This technique does not require pulse modulators to form RF pulses. The magnetron operation in this regime is stable; low noise; controllable in phase and power; and provides higher efficiency than other types of RF power sources. It allows operation in pulsed modes with large duty factor.

Previously; thermoacoustic range verification (TARV) has been demonstrated in weakly scattering media with known sound speed [1]. At ATLAS; we demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of TARV relative to ultrasound (US) images despite acoustic heterogeneity and sound speed errors representing in vivo conditions [2]. 250 ns pulses deposited 0.26 Gy of 16 MeV protons and 2.3 Gy of 60 MeV helium ions into liquid targets. TA signals were detected by an US array that also generated US images. An air gap phantom displaced the Bragg peak by 6.5 mm and the scanner’s propagation speed setting was altered by ±5%. Weak and strong scatterers were placed between the Bragg peak and US array. Estimated Bragg peak locations were translated 6.5 mm by the air gap phantom and agreed with TRIM simulations to within 0.3 mm; even when TA emissions traveled through a strong acoustic scatterer. Soundspeed errors dilated; and acoustic heterogeneities deformed both US images and TA range estimates; confirming that TARV is accurate relative to US images.; [1] Hickling; et al; Med Phys; 45(7); 2018.

The electron beam is modulated through the self-modulation process in a wiggler and the taper of the undulator is optimized to amplify the XFEL pulse along the beam. In this paper; we present start-to-end numerical simulations to demonstrate the generation of two kinds of attosecond XFEL pulses at the LCLS-II: (1) two attosecond XFEL pulses with variable time delay and energy separation; and (2) isolated attosecond pulses with TW peak power.

This assessment confirmed the recommendations of the 2015 Nuclear Science Advisory Committee for an EIC with highly polarized beams of electrons and ions; sufficiently high luminosity and variable center-of-mass (CM) energy. The baseline design of Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) has been updated to 100 GeV CM energy; corresponding to 200 GeV proton energy. We here present a high-energy design for the JLEIC ion complex. It consists of a 135 MeV injector linac; a 6-GeV non figure-8 pre-booster ring and a 40-GeV large ion booster; which could also serve as electron storage ring (e-ring). The energy choice in the accelerator chain is beneficial for a future upgrade to 140 GeV CM energy.

It has been proven that these corrections are effective to eliminate the beta-beating that is generated in those important regions and that propagates around the ring. More recently; it was also shown that the beta-beating at the interaction point can also be suppressed by combining k-modulation measurements with action and phase jump analysis.

However; it wasn’t until the recent advances in compact magnets and vacuum pumping; pioneered by MAX-IV and CERN; respectively; that MBA lattices could be considered as the basis for a light source. Now; there are many projects around the world that employ an MBA lattice to achieve an emittance well below 1 nm. I will begin by briefly reviewing how the MBA lattice can achieve an ultra-low emittance. Then; I will proceed to discuss how the essential physics of the MBA drives its design; and how that in turn impacts the physics. For example; its requirement for strong magnets leads to a small dynamic aperture and physically small vacuum chambers; which in turn impacts impedance and collective effects. I will try to illustrate this interplay with advances made by many other projects; but will inevitably favor the recent progress of the APS-Upgrade project; where we are targeting a 42-pm design for hard x-rays.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/tuzbb1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/tuzbb1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/tuzbb1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-TUZBB1,

Collective effects can produce an instability severely degrading beam emittance; momentum spread and creating filamentation of the beam. Microbunching instability for beams traveling along a curved trajectory; and space charge driven parametric transverse instabilities are well-known and in-depth studied. However; none of the above include a microbunching longitudinal instability driven by modulations of the transverse beam size. This phenomenon was observed for the first time during the commissioning of the CeC PoP experiment. Based on the dynamics of this instability we named it a Plasma-Cascade Instability (PCI). PCI can strongly intensify longitudinal micro-bunching originating from the beam’s shot noise; and even saturate it. Resulting random density and energy microstructures in the beam can become a serious problem for generating high quality electron beams. On the other hand; such instability can drive novel high-power sources of broadband radiation.

For molecules like CO a dangerous buildup of positive ions is possible and a significant fraction of these ions can survive allowable clearing gaps. The instability is thus multi-turn and the weak damping required to stop the ion instabilty with an ideal clearing gap is ineffective here. The beam-beam force is highly nonlinear and a potent source of tune spread. Simulations employing several macro-particles per electron bunch and several ion macroparticles are used to estimate maximum gas densities for some common molecules.

Several different transverse masks were used to shape the beam transversely; and the transmission through the mask was around 40%. The masking is one of the easiest ways to control the profile; but this low transmission would make significant drop of the beam quality due to a higher charge requirement in the gun; and it can make thermal issues for high repetition rate or high intensity beams. At the same time; it only controls the profile not a 2D phase space. We recently proposed a scheme to generate a tunable bunch train using a EEX beamline with a transverse wiggler. This wiggler provides a sinusoidal magnetic field which makes a sinusoidal modulation on the transverse phase space. If the beam passes series of transverse wigglers with different period and strength; one can make arbitrary correlation on the horizontal position and momentum. It opens up totally new way to control all longitudinal properties including arbitrary current profile shaping without charge loss.

Emittance exchange (EEX) can be interesting option for this issue due to its longitudinal controllability. Since EEX exchanges the longitudinal phase space and transverse phase space; higher order magnets such as octupole can control the nonlinearity. In this paper; we present simulation re-sults on the suppression of the double-horn current profile using EEX based bunch compression. We use a double EEX beamline installed at the Argonne Wake-field Accelerator facility for the simulation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/tuplm16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/tuplm16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/tuplm16_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-TUPLM16,407

We propose that the TM010 mode of a single radio frequency (RF) cavity be used to dramatically reduce this energy spread in a pulsed beam. We show with analytic approximations; confirmed in simulations; that the non-linear time-energy correlations that develop in an electron gun can be undone by the RF cavity running near-crest. We derive an expression that gives the required RF field strength as a function of accelerating voltage. We explore multiple applications; including EELS and SEM. By pulsing a photocathode with commercially available; high repetition-rate lasers; our scheme could yield competitive energy spread reduction at higher currents when compared with monochromated continuous-wave sources for electron microscopes.,"Funding: National Science Foundation under Award OIA-1549132, the Center for Bright Beams",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/tuplm18_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/tuplm18.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/tuplm18_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-TUPLM18,411

Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) is a high-bandwidth cooling technique that will advance the present state-of-the-art; stochastic-cooling rate by more than three orders of magnitude. A proof-of-principle demonstration with protons or heavy ions involves prohibitive costs; risks and technological challenges; however; exploration of OSC with electrons is a cost-effective alternative for studying the beam-cooling physics; optical systems and diagnostics. The ability to demonstrate OSC was a key requirement in the design of Fermilab’s Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) ring. The IOTA program will explore the physics and technology of OSC in amplified and non-amplified configurations. We also plan to investigate the cooling and manipulation of a single electron stored in the ring. The OSC apparatus is currently being fabricated; and installation will begin in the fall of 2019.

To approach the design level of the ring intensity we had to solve major problems in overheating of the chamber components. Since the beginning of the NSLS-II commissioning; the temperature of the vacuum components has been monitored by the Resistance Temperature Detectors located predominantly outside of the vacuum chamber and attached to the chamber body. A couple of vacuum components were designed with the possibility for internal temperature measurements under the vacuum as diagnostic assemblies. Temperature map helps us to control overheating of the vacuum components around the ring especially during the current ramp-up. The average current of 475mA has been achieved with two main 500MHz RF cavities and w/o any harmonic cavities.

The Active Interlock measures the beam position and angle at all insertion devices and issues a beam dump if the beam is outside of the pre-defined window. The window is determined by thermal analysis of vacuum apertures and considers the effects of local magnets such as canting magnets; etc. Recently; it was realized that the insertion device correction coils where not considered in the initial evaluation of the envelope. The purpose of these coils is to correct for the orbit deviations caused by imperfections in the insertion devices that steer the beam. The usual effect is to negate any angle induced by the device; however; if the coil is not set properly the beam may have a larger angle than permitted by the Active Interlock even though the angle calculation does not show it.

A typical system utilizes analog to digital (ADC) and digital to analog (DAC) converters with intervening digital logic in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) for digital processing. For applications (BPMs; LLRF; etc.) requiring very high bandwidths and sampling rates; the design of the electronics is challenging.

The combined operational experience of SCUs at the APS is more than 11 years and counting. Through all these years; APS SCUs operated with the predicted or better than predicted radiation performance and with 99% availability. With this demonstrated reliability and experimentally confirmed spectral performance; the APS upgrade project is planning on leveraging the advantages of SCU technology. The present planar SCUs are comprised of ~1.1-m-long magnets; each operated within a 2-m-long cryostat; while the planar SCUs for the upgrade will have two ~1.8-m-long magnets operating within a 5-m-long cryostat. Progress is also being made in other areas of SCU development with work on an arbitrary polarizing SCU; referred to as SCAPE; and a planar SCU wound with Nb3Sn superconductor. A Nb3Sn SCU is being designed with two 1.3-m-long magnets within a 5-m-long cryostat; and installation is planned for 2021.

In continuous operation; the exit energy is limited when compared to pulsed systems. Bunch length and energy spread at the exit of the gun are incompatible with low losses in the superconducting cavity. A solenoid double-bend achromatic beamline is in operation at Niowave which allows energy and bunch length filtering of the beam leaving the gun before injection into the superconducting cavity. This system uses two solenoids and two dipoles to produce a round beam; using the edge angles of the dipoles to balance the focusing effects in the two transverse planes. The design allows beam filtering on the symmetry plane where the dispersion is maximum. Additionally; the bend angle moves the electron gun off the high-energy beam axis; allowing multiple-pass operation of the superconducting booster. This contribution will discuss the beam optics design of the double-bend achromat along with the design of the magnets and beam chambers and the operational experience with the system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/tuplh03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/tuplh03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/tuplh03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-TUPLH03,494

Superconducting Arbitrary Polarization Emitter (SCAPE) is a new concept for a universal undulator; which offers linear or circular polarization states in one device and is ideal for experiments that require polarization switching. Polarization switching relies on modulating the magnetic field in the undulator. This; however; inevitably incurs losses in superconductors; which need to be mitigated. In this study; feasibility of fast switching SCAPE has been investigated through fabricating and testing several short prototype magnets wound with different superconductors and new design concepts.

In case of halo detection; traditional wire scanner measurement utilizing carbon or tungsten wires is limited by the damage threshold of these materials. In this paper we present an electrodeless method to measure halo with a diamond scraper. This measurement utilizes a microwave resonator placed around the diamond scraper which is sensitive to charged particle-induced conductivity. Due to this transient induced conductivity in the dielectric; a microwave coupling to the resonator changes. Diamond in this case is chosen as a radiation hard material with excellent thermal properties. The absence of electrodes makes the device robust under the beam. The same measurement can be done for x-ray flux monitoring which is important for measurement feedback and calibration at modern x-ray light sources. In this case x-rays passing through the diamond sensing element enable a photo-induced conductivity and that in turn detunes the cavity placed around the diamond. Diamond being a low-Z material allows for in-line x-ray flux measurement without significant beam attenuation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/tuplh08_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/tuplh08.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/tuplh08_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-TUPLH08,503

The key component for achieving this dual injector beam mode support capability is a high-speed rf modulator (or RFM) in the LINAC RF electronics front-end; which performs the necessary rf control and the beam loading compensation of different injection beams. The original LINAC rf electronics front-end successfully supported the machine commissioning and meets the basic needs of the machine operation. The upgrade being pursued is focused on improving the RFM control performance through replacing the current analog implementation in the RFM with a much more capable digital implementation; while still maintaining the necessary control bandwidth that is required for long and short Multi-Bunch beams. A variety of modern COTS rf transmission/reception DSP technology will be incorporated in the new design.

At the core of the klystron station design is the novel solid-state switching modulators (or SSM). Compared to the conventional PFN klystron modulators; the main advantages of the SSM include the compact size requiring a smaller footprint in the LINAC; and a very flat top in the produced klystron HV pulses. The flatness of the HV pulses is very important for NSLS-II LINAC that runs multi-bunch beams to keep the beam energy dispersion within the tolerance. The principle of the SSM is fairly simple. It uses a large number of relatively low-voltage switched charging capacitor cells (or SU’s) in parallel. A specially designed; high step-up ratio; pulse transformer in the oil-tank with the same number of primary windings (as SU’s) combines the power from all the SU’s; and steps up to the required ~300kV klystron beam voltage. The operation experience at NSLS-II has proven the performance and reliability of the SSM’s.

In 2014; the abort kicker ferrites were changed; the eddy current reduction design was upgraded; and an active ferrite cooling loop installed to prevent heating. For ions the beam dump vacuum window was changed from stainless steel to a titanium alloy and the adjacent beam diffuser block carbon material was changed to allow for higher ion intensities. A thicker beam pipe was installed to prevent secondaries from quenching the adjacent superconducting quadrupole.

Each RF system has many process variables for LLRF and amplifier control located on different pages of CS-Studio. Efficient handling of all these PVs can be challenging for RF experts. Several scripts using Python have been developed to facilitate this process. User interface application has been developed using Qt Designer and PyQt package of Python; for ease of access of all scripts. These scripts are useful for mass ac-tions (for multiple systems) including turning on/ off LLRF controllers and amplifiers; resetting interlocks/ errors; chang-ing a PV value; etc. Python scripts are also used to quickly prototype the auto-start procedure for QWR cavities; which eventually is implemented on IOC driver. The application sends commands to IOC driver with device name; PV name and value to be changed. Future developments can be con-verting to state-notation language on IOC to add channel access security.

In APS-U charges of up to 17 nC per micropulse are specified with a beam geometrical horizontal emittance of 60 nm rad. Vertical beam sizes at the imaging station of ~80 µm (σ) are expected so system resolutions of <30 µm are warranted. A phased approach to enhance the imaging station performance has been initiated. Recently; the 20-year-old Chromox screen oriented at 45 degrees to the beam was replaced by a 100-micron thick YAG:Ce screen which gave an improved screen resolution of <10 micron(σ. However; the optical magnification of the system still needs to be increased. In addition; the high areal charge densities are expected to exceed the scintillator mechanism’s saturation threshold so an optical transition radiation (OTR) screen will be added to the station for high-charge studies.

As the beam power increases; the unwanted production of secondary electrons in the beam pipe; known as ‘electron cloud’ or ‘E-cloud’ may become disruptive to high intensity operation. Instrumentation has been deployed in the Fermilab Main Injector (MI) to study E-cloud. One of these is a Retard Field Analyzer (RFA) that can be used to directly measure E-cloud generation at the location of the instrument. Studies of the dependence of E-cloud on beam intensity and bunch length have been carried out. The experimental results are compared to POSINST simulations. These simulations are guided by measurements from a Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) test stand installed in the MI to measure the SEY of materials such as the beam pipe stainless steel.

For bunches of unequal charge this allows us to precisely determine the transverse kick factors. By applying local bumps; or; for in-vacuum undulators (IVUs); by varying the gap; we can also precisely measure the impedance of individual ring components.

For instance; in our IVU measurements vs. undulator gap; we can accurately determine current-dependent tuneshifts two orders of magnitude smaller than the tuneshift induced by the natural focusing of the undulator.

While synchrotron radiation in the far field has been well established; the self-consistent beam dynamics due to the near-field synchrotron radiation becomes increasingly important as high-brightness beams and coherent light sources are developed. Since it is difficult to diagnose the near fields in experiments; accurate and efficient numerical methods are essential to the design of these light sources. Here; we investigate several existing methods for the calculation of the radiation near fields; including the finite difference method; the Lienard-Wiechert method and a novel near-field method. We compare the accuracy and efficiency of these methods in both 1D and multi-dimensions; for both steady-state and dynamic beam trajectories; both radiation field and space charge field; as well as for both coherent and incoherent fields.

A simple model for jitter transfer from the drive to witness beam was developed and con-crete examples were studied for: high-brightness witness bunch injectors; high-energy boosters for FEL’s; and future Linear Colliders. For the LC application; we con-sider a superconducting Linac designed to minimize the jitter conditions of the drive beam. We use a start-to-end tracking model to simulate expected jitter performance. The tolerances on each subsystem of the driver Linac are found to be very tight; especially for magnet vibration which must be controlled at the sub-nm level.,,Work supported by the Department of Energy under Contract Number: DE-AC02-76SF00515.,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/weyba3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/weyba3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/weyba3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-WEYBA3,614
napac2019,,WEYBA4,Beam Induced Ionization Injection of Shaped Electron Bunches,N. Vafaei-Najafabadi; L.D. Amorim; Stony Brook University; Stony Brook; USA; Particle-driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerators (PWFAs) are promising candidates for future free electron laser and collider applications. In PWFAs; energy is transferred from a relativistic drive beam to a trailing bunch in a plasma wake. One of the challenges of PWFAs is reducing energy spread of the beam from typically few percent to the required 0.1% range. This can be accomplished by generating a trailing bunch with a trapezoidal density profile; which will allow the PWFA to operate in the beam-loading regime; therefore circumventing the energy-spread growth of the trailing beam during acceleration. In this work we show how the Beam Induced Ionization Injection (BIII) technique can produce a trailing bunch of electrons with a trapezoidal shape suitable for beam-loading. In BIII; the trailing beam is created by ionization injection of an impurity due to the increased field of the beam during betatron oscillations. By tailoring the longitudinal profile of the impurity; we can shape the injected trailing electron bunch to reach the beam-loading regime. We will present results of numerical simulations done to model BIII shaped beams with the Particle In Cell code OSIRIS*.; * R. A. Fonseca et al.; Lect. Notes Comput.

At energies between 16 and 20 MeV/u ions are further stripped by a charge stripper increasing the energy gain downstream in the linac. The main challenges in the stripper design are high power deposited by the ions in the stripping media and radiation damage to the media itself. To overcome these challenges; self-recovering stripper media are the most suitable solutions. The FRIB baseline choice is a high-velocity thin film of liquid lithium*. Because liquid lithium is highly reactive with air; we have implemented rigorous safety measures. Since May 2018; the lithium stripper system has been operated safely at an offline test site to accumulate operational experience. Recently; we successfully completed a 10-day long unattended continuous operation without any issue; which proved the reliability of the system. The next step is to characterize the lithium film stability with diagnostics. In 2020; we plan to bring the lithium stripper into the accelerator tunnel and commission it with ion beams.; *Jie Wei; et al.; TU1A04; Proceedings of LINAC 2012; Tel-Aviv; Israel,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/weybb4_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/weybb4.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/weybb4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-WEYBB4,636

For evaluation of beam Twiss parameters and rms emittance; we routinely use multiple profile measurements while the strength of an upstream quadrupole is varied. The change of the quadrupole strength results in a beam mismatch downstream of the profile monitor which can cause beam losses. This is not acceptable in a high energy beamline. To avoid this transverse mismatch; we developed a beam matching procedure by optimization of quadrupoles’ setting downstream of the profile monitor. Using this procedure we were able to eliminate beam losses during the quadrupole scan; and evaluate beam Twiss parameters and rms emittance.

napac2019,,WEPLM02,Finding Beam Loss Locations in a Linac with Oscillating Dipole Correctors,A.V. Shemyakin; K. Seiya; Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; RRCAT; Indore; India; The paper proposes a method of finding the beam loss locations in a linac. If the beam is scraped at an aperture limitation; moving its centroid with two dipole correctors located upstream and oscillating in sync produces a line at the corresponding frequency in spectra of current-sensitive devices downstream of the loss point. The phase of this signal contains information about the location of the beam loss. Similar lines appear also in the position signals of Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). The phases of the BPM position lines change monotonically (within each 2π) along the linac and can be used a reference system. The phase of the loss signal compared with this reference system pinpoints the beam loss location; assuming that longitudinal coordinates of the BPMs are known. If the correctors deflection amplitudes and the phase offset between their waveforms are chosen optimally and well calibrated; the same measurement provides values of the β-function and the betatron phase advance at the BPM locations. Optics measurements of this type can be made parasitically; with negligible effect on the emittance; if a long measurement time is acceptable.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/weplm02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/weplm02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/weplm02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-WEPLM02,663

In this paper; the design strategy taken to achieve flexibility and low cost and the choices made to accommodate the varieties will be discussed. The approach also allowed easy adaptation to major design changes such as replac-ing two cryo-modules with two newly designed room temperature bunchers and the addition of high-voltage bias to suppress multi-pacting in half wave resonators (HWRs). With the successful completion of the third accelerator readiness review (ARR03) commissioning in early 2019; most of the design has been validated in the real accelerator system; leaving only HWRs which are constantly undergoing tests in cryo-module bunker.

Even with a feedback system; it would be good to mitigate any driving terms with conventional means such as tuning HOM frequencies with temperature. However the latter is problematic because there will be 90 or so HOMs that are potentially harmful. A scheme is developed; utilizing the measured spectrum of HOMs; to find the best temperature setting for each cavity. We present measurements of 30 or so HOMs; and a thermal model of HOM frequencies using cavity wall power and cooling water temperature as inputs to maintain the optimum tuning condition with sufficient accuracy. The newly acquired Dimtel iGp12 processor box is central to the HOM frequency measurements.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/weplm04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/weplm04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/weplm04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-WEPLM04,670

Analysis of these data in time; frequency and spatial domains provides valuable insights into orbit stability; locations of residual noise sources; performance of feedback systems; etc. In addition; changes in FA signal spectral features are often the earliest indicators of potential equipment problems. This is why we recently implemented an Input / Output Controller (IOC) software that runs during regular user operation; and; once a minute; acquires 10 second buffers of FA data from 180 BPMs around the ring. These buffers are processed to determine the amplitudes and frequencies of the strongest spectral peaks as well as some other measures of fast beam orbit noise.

As qubit operation requires external DC fields; we started our study with a conventional closed copper cavity which naturally allows external magnetic field. In order to increase quality factor and to keep DC magnetic field control at a level less than critical field; an open SRF resonator promises much higher quality. The next step resonator is a photonic band gap (PBG) resonator. This resonator allows easy external either magnetic or electric field control. It consists of a periodic 3D set of sapphire rods assembled between two superconducting plates. The PBG resonator exploits unique properties of the crystalline sapphire. Tangent delta for sapphire in X-band is reported at 10-9 ’ 10-10 at 4 K. That is why; the Q-factor of the sapphire PBG resonator can be expected as high as 10 billions at mK temperatures which provides long relaxation times (dephasing etc.). The established PBG design implies obtaining a large Purcell factor; i.e. large ratio of quality to mode volume which is important parameter to establish strong interaction of a qubit with the cavity mode rather than RF noise.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/weplm21_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/weplm21.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/weplm21_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-WEPLM21,690

Our two-beam accelerator approach employs a beam driven bimodal cavity structure. This cavity includes (i) two modes excited by the drive beam; with the higher mode frequency three times that of the fundamental TM010 mode; (ii) a low-current accelerated beam and high-current drive beam traversing the same cavity structure. This approach has the potential advantages of (a) operating at higher acceleration gradient with lower breakdown and pulsed heating rates than that of a single-mode cavity structure at the same acceleration gradient; due to the spatiotemporal field distribution properties in the bimodal cavities; and (b) obtaining high accelerating gradient with a low energy drive beam.

A linac-based ion-beam therapy facility offers many advantages over existing synchrotron based facilities. In addition to the reduced footprint; ACCIL offers more flexibility in beam tuning; including pulse-per-pulse energy and intensity modulation and fast switching between ion species. Essential to the compactness of the ACCIL linac are high-gradient structures for low to intermediate velocity ions; capable of accelerating fields of ~ 50 MV/m. For this purpose; we have designed an S-band annular-coupled structure (ACS). An ACS has the desired qualities of high electric field limit; high shunt-impedance; large area for magnetic coupling and good cooling capacity; making it a very promising candidate for high-gradient operations.

During RHIC operations at 3.85 GeV (beam energy) with LEReC; one needs to ensure that the electron beam energy is properly matched for cooling purposes: if so; some of the circulating Au-79 ions can recombine with an electron; turning into Au-78 and circulating with a large momentum offset. Part of the LEReC commissioning steps is therefore to drive a maximized number of Au-78 ions towards a chosen location of the RHIC mechanical aperture to generate particle showers that can be detected by a Recombination Monitor outside the cryostat. This article introduces the baseline lattice design; then discusses the few scenarios considered for optimizing Au-78 losses at a given location.

To construct the semi-analytical models for these elements; we begin by formulating the simplified single-particle equations of motion; and apply typical numerical techniques to solve the corresponding six-by-six transport matrix as a function of the path coordinate. The developed semi-analytical models are demonstrated with three practical examples; where our numerical results are discussed; compared with and validated by particle tracking simulations.

This 4-rod RFQ was designed to accelerate the prebunched 80.5 MHz beams with the lowest Q/A = 1/5. However; the lack of proper cooling limited the RFQ performance to the pulsed operation with the lowest Q/A = 1/4. The design voltage for Q/A = 1/5 has never been reached even in a pulsed mode due to the sparking. In 2016 we initiated the upgrade of ReA3 RFQ to support high duty cycle (up to CW) operation with Q/A = 1/5 beams. The upgrade included the new rods with trapezoidal modulation; and new stems with improved cooling. The redesigned 80.5 MHz RFQ will consume only 65% rf power of the present RFQ for Q/A = 1/5 beam. It will provide the transmission up to 78% for 16.1 MHz beams and 89% for 80.5 MHz beams.

To achieve the required cooling times for a realistic machine configuration; it is necessary to boost the bunching of the cooler electron beam through amplification sections that utilize plasma oscillations. However; these plasma sections also amplify the intrinsic noise of the electron beam; leading to additional diffusion that can be very detrimental to the cooling. Moreover; they can exhibit nonlinear gain behavior; which reduces performance and limits the applicability of theory.

Bright muon beams generated from sources designed for muon collider and neutrino factory facilities have been shown to generate two orders of magnitude more muons per proton than the current Mu2e production target and solenoid. In contrast to the current Mu2e; the muon collider design has forward-production of muons from the target. Forward production from 8 GeV protons would include high energy antiprotons; pions and muons; which would provide too much background for the Mu2e system. In contrast; the 800 MeV PIP-II beam does not have sufficient energy to produce antiprotons; and other secondaries will be at a low enough energy that they can be ranged out with an affordable shield of ~ 2 meters of concrete.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/weplo12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/weplo12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/weplo12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-WEPLO12,865

This research focuses on simulating the cross/self-interactions between high-intense short laser pulses and an initial target for preliminary ionization. Unlike our previous studies of laser-matter interaction over preformed plasma; we will explore the injection of laser pulses to induce background plasma driven by the self-guided laser wakefield mechanism; which is used to perturb the plasma for induced dipole oscillations followed by radiation. Inducing a cylindrical spatial plasma column within the laser beam radius regime; it is expected that a stable spatially localized plasma channel will result and the emitted radiation from the plasma dipole oscillation (PDO) will not be affected by surrounding absorption; resulting in effective radiation. We will depict the injection of laser pulses accounting for parameters such as field intensity; profile and phase difference defining the coordinated pulses to assess the potential of enhancing the efficiency and spectral properties of the transverse emitted radiation due to the counter-propagating pulses interaction in plasma.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/weplo18_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/weplo18.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/weplo18_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-WEPLO18,874

We considered common operation frequencies for accelerators and identified C-band as the optimal frequency band for high gradient operations based on achievable gradients and means to control wakefields. We are putting together a high gradient C-band test facility that includes a 50 MW Toshiba klystron and cryo-coolers for operating copper NCRF accelerator cavities at long pulse duration.

Owing to the higher charge (736 nC/store) and much lower emittance (42 pm vs 2.5 nm); this issue is expected to be much more severe in the APS Upgrade. This strongly suggests that such dumps are necessary in 4th-generation electron storage rings to prevent catastrophic damage to vacuum systems when; for example; rf systems trip. However; it also implies that the dump will be damaged by each strike and will thus need to be ""refreshed; "" perhaps by moving the dump surface vertically to expose undamaged material. Xenon; a gas that solidifies at 161K; is an intriguing possibility for a beam dump material. Calculations suggest that as the beam spirals in toward a dump in a high-dispersion area the tails of the electron beam would vaporize sufficient xenon to rapidly diffuse the beam and render it harmless. The dump surface could be periodically reformed without breaking vacuum.

napac2019,,THYBB3,Compact 1 MeV Electron Accelerator,IAP/RAS; Nizhny Novgorod; Russia; S.P. Antipov; P.V. Avrakhov; Euclid TechLabs; LLC; Solon; Ohio; USA; The cost of the accelerating structure in modern medical accelerators and industrial linacs is substantial. This comes to no surprise; as the accelerating waveguide is a set of diamond-turned copper resonators brazed together. Such a multistep manufacturing process is not only expensive; but also prone to manufacturing errors; which decrease the production yield. In the big picture; the cost of the accelerating waveguide precludes the use of accelerators as a replacement option for radioactive sources. Here we present a new cheap brazeless electron accelerating structure made out of two copper plates tightened together by means of an additional stainless steel plate. This additional plate; having sharp blades; is aimed to provide vacuum inside the whole system. The designed X-band 1 MeV structure consists of eight different length cells and accelerates field-emitted electrons from copper cathode. The structure is fed by 9 GHz magnetron which produces 240 kW; 1 µs pulses.

The major factor limiting accelerating gradient is vacuum RF breakdown. The probability of such breakdowns increases with pulse length. For reliable operation; millimeter-wave structures require nanoseconds long pulses at the megawatt level. This power is available from gyrotrons; which have a minimum pulse length on the order of microseconds. In this paper; we will describe the laser-based RF switch capable of selecting 10 ns long pulses out of the microseconds long gyrotron pulses; thus enabling the use of the gyrotrons as power sources for mm-wave high gradient linac.

For instance; because of the scaling of the ponderomotive force and the critical plasma density as λ2 and 1/λ2 respectively; LWIR lasers can drive plasma wakes in laser wakefield accelerators much more efficiently than near-IR lasers while producing much bigger trapping volumes. Amplification of a picosecond pulse in high-pressure CO2 laser amplifiers is presently the only method of generating a terawatt peak power in LWIR. We recently achieved a 5-TW operation in quasi-single 2-ps pulses at 9.2 μm at 0.05 Hz repetition rate and we are currently working on reducing the pulse duration to below a picosecond as required for the realization of LWFA acceleration in the bubble regime.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/thybb6_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/thybb6.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/thybb6_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-THYBB6,

Due to the coupling of the accelerator with a subcritical reactor; a major concern is reliability and availability of the accelerator. The MYRRHA Linac consists of a room temperature 17 MeV Injector based on CH-cavities and the superconducting main Linac using different RF structures as Single Spokes; Double-Spokes and elliptical cavities. In 2017; it has been decided to stage the project and to start with the construction of a 100 MeV Linac (Injector and Single Spoke section) including a 400 kW proton target station. This facility (MINERVA) will be operational in 2026 aiming to evaluate the reliability potential of the 600 MeV Linac.

napac2019,,THZBB2,Single-Shot Wakefield Measurement System,TUB; Beijing; People’s Republic of China; A new experimental technique for the accurate measurements of wakefields is presented. Knowledge of wakefields is required for many applications ranging from the suppression of wakefields that arise from geometrical discontinuities to the enhancement of wakefields in structure and plasma based wakefield accelerators. In the past; direct measurements of wakefields were done with the drive-witness technique wherein the delay of a short witness beam trailing collinearly behind a high-charge drive beam is scanned over multiple shots and the wakefield is inferred from the energy spectrum of the witness beam. That technique is limited by shot-to-shot jitter; overlap of the drive and witness energy spectrum and the loss of all time-domain information. In this paper; we describe a new technique that overcomes these limitations by measuring the longitudinal phase space of a long witness beam and the drive beam in a single shot.

Our experiments show that the SP excitation is correlated to the acceleration of dense electron bunches of few MeV of energies along the surface of the laser-irradiated target**; and to the emission in the same direction of high order harmonics of the laser frequency***. Both emissions can be optimized by an appropriate tuning of the laser-target parameters (incidence angle; target profile and density).

Guiding of such lasers in plasma structures formed by laser heating; capillary discharges and most recently by combining these two techniques has extended the depth of interaction from millimeter to tens of centimeter scale. This has enabled generation of narrow energy spread beams initially at the 0.1 GeV scale through recent results up to 7.8 GeV. Experiments have combined two stages at low energies and staging at multi-GeV energies is being prepared; laying the foundation for future systems to extend the reach of high energy particle physics. At the GeV energy scale; compact electron beams are being used to develop novel compact photon sources including free electron lasers; and MeV photons from Thomson scattering. These have the potential to bring the power of large scientific light sources; including reduced dose and increased resolution; to applications from nuclear nonproliferation to medicine.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/thahc3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/thahc3.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/thahc3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-THAHC3,

Surface contamination of the vessel walls can severely impact the achievable field strength. Therefore; efficient and effective cleaning of the cavity surfaces is necessary to maintain optimal acceleration gradients. In situ cleaning techniques involve generating plasma discharges that remove the impurities through chemical and mechanical processes*. The benefits of these techniques are to reduce the field emission and increase stability for devices with complex geometries without the need for disassembly. Theoretical methods have emerged to increase the effectiveness of the plasma discharge cleaning; however; there is an inherent risk when attempting new methods experimentally. We have performed particle-in-cell simulations of the C100 cavity including ionization; recombination; and scattering interactions to explore the parameters of the plasma generated via EM signal. These properties provide an insight into the plasma generation and its predicted effectiveness at removing impurities.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/thahc6_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/thahc6.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/thahc6_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-THAHC6,

napac2019,,FRXBA2,Diverse Beam Profile Shapings Through Nonlinear Focusing of Multipole Magnets in a Beam Transport Line,Y. Yuri; T. Yuyama; QST/Takasaki; Takasaki; Japan; RCNP; Osaka; Japan; It is well-known that the transverse intensity distribution of a charged-particle beam can be made approximately uniform through the nonlinear focusing force using multipole (mainly; octupole) magnets in a beam transport line. This fact indicates that the proper use of multipole magnets enables the diverse beam profile shapings that cannot be achieved by common linear focusing; such as quadrupole magnets. We have; therefore; investigated the feasibility of the beam profile shaping (other than uniform profiles) by means of nonlinear focusing. Recently; we have experimentally demonstrated the formation of an ion beam with a hollow transverse distribution using octupole and sextupole magnets. It has been found that the hollow beam has a steep peak at the radial edge and that its cross-sectional shape varies diversely depending on the order and strength of the applied multipole magnets. In the presentation; the first experimental result of the hollow-beam formation will be reported together with the theoretical analysis of the behavior of a nonlinear-focused beam. Moreover; other unique beam profiles obtained through the nonlinear force of the multipole magnets will also be shown.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/frxba2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/frxba2.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/frxba2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-FRXBA2,

An EEX beamline was installed at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility in 2015. Several experiments important to the wakefield acceleration; such as a high transformer ratio from shaped bunches; have already been demonstrated. We are currently developing several applications of the EEX beamline including temporal profile shaping; THz radiation generation; time-energy correlation control; diagnostic uses of EEX etc. We will present the on-going EEX program for longitudinal phase space control taking place at the AWA facility; and discuss recently discovered new opportunities.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/talks/frxba3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/papers/frxba3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/napac2019/posters/frxba3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2019-FRXBA3,981

State-of-the-art rare isotope facilities can be based on an isotope separation on-line (ISOL) approach using mostly high-power proton beams striking a thick target where the isotopes are produced in the target; or an in-flight fragment separation (IF) approach using high-power heavy ion beams striking upon a thinner target where the isotopes continue out of the target followed by fragment separation. This tutorial class introduces high power hadron accelerators as driver machines for rare isotope production; summarizing the key design philosophy; physical and technical challenges; and current world-wide development status.
