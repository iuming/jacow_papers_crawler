        "The cost of the accelerating structure in modern medical accelerators and industrial linacs is substantial. This comes to no surprise",
        "as the accelerating waveguide is a set of diamond-turned copper resonators brazed together. Such a multistep manufacturing process is not only expensive",
        "but also prone to manufacturing errors",
        "which decrease the production yield. In the big picture",
        "the cost of the accelerating waveguide precludes the use of accelerators as a replacement option for radioactive sources. Here we present a new cheap brazeless electron accelerating structure made out of two copper plates tightened together by means of an additional stainless steel plate. This additional plate",
        "having sharp blades",
        "is aimed to provide vacuum inside the whole system. The designed X-band 1 MeV structure consists of eight different length cells and accelerates field-emitted electrons from copper cathode. The structure is fed by 9 GHz magnetron which produces 240 kW",

        "medical and security applications. The major factor limiting accelerating gradient is vacuum RF breakdown. The probability of such breakdowns increases with pulse length. For reliable operation",

        "which have a minimum pulse length on the order of microseconds. In this paper",

We will also report on the experimental demonstration of the RF switch with the high power gyrotron at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

        "Favorable wavelength scaling makes high peak-power lasers operating in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectral range (8 14 µm) attractive for several promising schemes of laser particle acceleration. For instance",
        "because of the scaling of the ponderomotive force and the critical plasma density as λ2 and 1/λ2 respectively",
        "LWIR lasers can drive plasma wakes in laser wakefield accelerators much more efficiently than near-IR lasers while producing much bigger trapping volumes. Amplification of a picosecond pulse in high-pressure CO2 laser amplifiers is presently the only method of generating a terawatt peak power in LWIR. We recently achieved a 5-TW operation in quasi-single 2-ps pulses at 9.2 μm at 0.05 Hz repetition rate and we are currently working on reducing the pulse duration to below a picosecond as required for the realization of LWFA acceleration in the bubble regime."
