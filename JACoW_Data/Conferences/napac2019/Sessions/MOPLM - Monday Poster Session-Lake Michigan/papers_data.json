      "abstract": "The NSLS-II storage ring uses the standard four bump injection scheme to inject beam off axis. BESSY and MAX IV are now using a pulsed multipole magnet as an injection kicker. The injected beam sees a field off axis for injection while the stored beam experiences no field on the magnet axis. The principle advantage of using a pulsed multipole for injection is that the stored beam motion is greatly reduced since the field on axis is negligible. The number of pulsed magnets is reduced from five in the nominal scheme (septum and four bumps) to two or three thereby reducing the possible failure modes. This also eliminates the need to precisely match the pulse shapes of four dipole magnets to achieve minimal stored beam motion outside of the bump. In this paper we discuss two schemes of injecting into the NSLS-II using a pulsed multipole magnet. The first scheme uses a single pulsed multipole located in one cell downstream of the injection septum as the injection kicker. The second scheme uses two pulsed multipoles in the injection straight to perform the injection. We discuss both methods of injection and compare each method. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

An energy jitter of 25 keV was initially observed in the spectrometer focal plane images.

The addition of a 150-MHz low-pass filter in the 119-MHz line strongly attenuated the two harmonics and resulted in a reduced energy jitter of ~15 keV.

        "originally designed for up to 6 nC charge",
        "must be upgraded to provide 20 nC single bunch beam. Our studies have shown that bunch length of the PAR beam",
        "typically 300 ps at lower charge",
        "increases to 800 ps at high charge due to longitudinal instabilities",
        "which causes low injection efficiency of the downstream Booster ring. We completed beam impedance of all the PAR vacuum components recently with CST wakefield solver. 3D CAD models are directly imported into CST and various techniques were explored to improve and verify the results. The results are also cross-checked with that from GdfidL and Echo simulation. We identified 23 bellow- and 24 non-bellow flanges that contribute to as much as 50% of the total loss factor. We are considering upgrade options to reduce over all beam loading and longitudinal impedance. Beam tracking simulation is in progress that including the longitudinal impedance results from the simulations. We report the results and methods of the CST impedance simulations."
