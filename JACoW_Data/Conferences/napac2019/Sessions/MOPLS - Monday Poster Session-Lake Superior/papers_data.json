        "Ni 20%) alloy target material and irradiated the target at the BLIP to produce the radioisotope Ge-68. Since no literature data is available on Ga4Ni’s thermal conductivity (K) and specific heat (C)",
        "measurements were carried out using thermal testing in conjunction with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Steady-state one dimensional heat conduction method was used to determine the thermal conductivity. Transient method was used to calculate the specific heat. The test setup with same methodologies can be used to assess other targets in the future. Here",
        "we will detail these studies and discuss the improved design and fabrication of this target."
