        "The paper proposes a method of finding the beam loss locations in a linac. If the beam is scraped at an aperture limitation",
        "moving its centroid with two dipole correctors located upstream and oscillating in sync produces a line at the corresponding frequency in spectra of current-sensitive devices downstream of the loss point. The phase of this signal contains information about the location of the beam loss. Similar lines appear also in the position signals of Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). The phases of the BPM position lines change monotonically (within each 2π) along the linac and can be used a reference system. The phase of the loss signal compared with this reference system pinpoints the beam loss location",
        "assuming that longitudinal coordinates of the BPMs are known. If the correctors deflection amplitudes and the phase offset between their waveforms are chosen optimally and well calibrated",
        "the same measurement provides values of the β-function and the betatron phase advance at the BPM locations. Optics measurements of this type can be made parasitically",
        "with negligible effect on the emittance",
        "if a long measurement time is acceptable."

With the successful completion of the third accelerator readiness review (ARR03) commissioning in early 2019",

For initial testing of the CXLS klystrons a hybrid digital-analog low-level RF (LLRF) driver has been developed which allows for inter-pulse phase and amplitude corrections based on feedback from waveguide-couplers.

This approach has the potential advantages of (a) operating at higher acceleration gradient with lower breakdown and pulsed heating rates than that of a single-mode cavity structure at the same acceleration gradient",
        "due to the spatiotemporal field distribution properties in the bimodal cavities; and (b) obtaining high accelerating gradient with a low energy drive beam. Recent progress in simulations and work towards an experimental test stand is presented."
