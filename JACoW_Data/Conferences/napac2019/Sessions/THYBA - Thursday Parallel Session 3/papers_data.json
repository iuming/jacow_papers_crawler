        "high energy (7 GeV)",
        "and short loss time (about 15 microseconds). Owing to the higher charge (736 nC/store) and much lower emittance (42 pm vs 2.5 nm)",
        "this issue is expected to be much more severe in the APS Upgrade. This strongly suggests that such dumps are necessary in 4th-generation electron storage rings to prevent catastrophic damage to vacuum systems when",
        "for example",
        "rf systems trip. However",
        "it also implies that the dump will be damaged by each strike and will thus need to be \"refreshed",
        "\" perhaps by moving the dump surface vertically to expose undamaged material. Xenon",
        "a gas that solidifies at 161K",
        "is an intriguing possibility for a beam dump material. Calculations suggest that as the beam spirals in toward a dump in a high-dispersion area the tails of the electron beam would vaporize sufficient xenon to rapidly diffuse the beam and render it harmless. The dump surface could be periodically reformed without breaking vacuum. Issues with the concept include the need to protect the frozen xenon from wakefield heating."
