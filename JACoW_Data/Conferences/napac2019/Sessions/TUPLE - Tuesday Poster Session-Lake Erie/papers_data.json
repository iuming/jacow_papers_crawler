        "HWR cavities (β=0.29 and β=0.53) and few room temperature devices. Each RF system has many process variables for LLRF and amplifier control located on different pages of CS-Studio. Efficient handling of all these PVs can be challenging for RF experts. Several scripts using Python have been developed to facilitate this process. User interface application has been developed using Qt Designer and PyQt package of Python",
        "for ease of access of all scripts. These scripts are useful for mass ac-tions (for multiple systems) including turning on/ off LLRF controllers and amplifiers",
        "resetting interlocks/ errors",
        "chang-ing a PV value",
        "etc. Python scripts are also used to quickly prototype the auto-start procedure for QWR cavities",

In order to fully understand and characterize the beam halo",

FRIB will produce rare-isotope beams of unprecedented intensities by impinging a 400 kW heavy-ion beam on a production target and by collecting and purifying the rare isotopes of interest with a fragment separator. A thermal imaging system (TIS) has been developed to monitor the beam spot on the production target. The main features and characteristics of optical system is presented. The prototype of optical system has been tested."

In APS-U charges of up to 17 nC per micropulse are specified with a beam geometrical horizontal emittance of 60 nm rad. Vertical beam sizes at the imaging station of ~80 µm (σ) are expected so system resolutions of <30 µm are warranted. A phased approach to enhance the imaging station performance has been initiated. Recently",

A final phase would be the use of optical diffraction radiation (ODR) as a non-intercepting",

One of these is a Retard Field Analyzer (RFA) that can be used to directly measure E-cloud generation at the location of the instrument. Studies of the dependence of E-cloud on beam intensity and bunch length have been carried out. The experimental results are compared to POSINST simulations. These simulations are guided by measurements from a Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) test stand installed in the MI to measure the SEY of materials such as the beam pipe stainless steel. The SEY has a strong influence on the E-cloud density. Results of these comprehensive studies comparing the RFA data with realistic MI simulations will be presented."
