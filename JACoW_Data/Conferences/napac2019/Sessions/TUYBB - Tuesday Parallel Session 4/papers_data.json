This talk will review current state of development of various applications using lasers for manipulating H− ion beams in accelerators. A wide range of applications will be reviewed such as beam diagnostics",
        "laser-assisted charge-exchange injection",
        "generation of arbitrary H0 pulse patterns and others. An overview of ongoing developments and prospects for other laser H− beam interactions will also be given."

        "the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator",
        "was constructed and recently commissioned at Fermilab. Beam-based diagnostics and online modelling of nonlinear systems presents unique challenges - in this paper",
        "we report on our efforts to develop optimization methods suited for such lattices. We explore the effectiveness of neural networks as fast online surrogate estimators",
        "and integrate them into a beam-based tuning algorithm. We also develop a method of knob dimensionality reduction and subsequent robust multivariate optimization for maximizing key performance metrics under complicated lattice optics constraints."
