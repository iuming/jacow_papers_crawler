        "and installation of 37 cry-omodules (CM) in order to deliver a 4 GeV CW electron beam to the FEL undulators for production of both hard and soft X-ray pulses at a repetition rate of up to 1 MHz. All of the cryomodules will operation in continuous wave mode",
        "with 35 operating at 1.3 GHz for acceleration and 2 operating at 3.9 GHz to linearize the longitudinal beam profile. The assembly and testing of the 1.3 GHz cry-omodules is nearing completion and the 3.9 GHz cry-omodules work is entering to assembly and testing phase. Roughly 60% of the cryomodules have been shipped to SLAC for installation in the accelerator enclosure. The status and challenges of these efforts will be reported in this paper."

        "two planar and one helical device are in operation in the APS storage ring",
        "and a number of devices will be installed in the APS Upgrade ring. All superconducting devices perform with very high reliability and have very minor effect on the storage ring operation. To achieve this",
        "a number of storage ring modifications had to be done",
        "such as introduction of the beam abort system to eliminate device quenches during beam dumps",
        "and lattice and orbit modifications to allow for installation of the small horizontal aperture helical device with magnet coils in the plane of synchrotron radiation."

        "an alternative optimization method is adopted to generate optimized linear and second order chromaticity setpoints for the Advanced Photon Source upgrade lattice. This method is efficient in computing time needed",
        "which is capable to generate a grid of optimized chromaticity setpoints in a relatively short time. The performance of these lattice solutions are verified by simulations with reasonable errors. These lattice solutions with different linear (or second order) chromaticity may be useful for the future APS-U commissioning and operations."
