        "also the field of publications is undergoing profound changes. Physical Review Accelerators and Beams (PRAB) was founded in 1997 as a pioneering all-electronic diamond open-access journal",
        "far ahead of its time. For many years PRAB was the fastest growing journal in the Physical Review family. Authors",

In situ cleaning techniques involve generating plasma discharges that remove the impurities through chemical and mechanical processes*. The benefits of these techniques are to reduce the field emission and increase stability for devices with complex geometries without the need for disassembly. Theoretical methods have emerged to increase the effectiveness of the plasma discharge cleaning; however",
