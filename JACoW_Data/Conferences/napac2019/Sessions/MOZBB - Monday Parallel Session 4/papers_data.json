        "the superconducting RF (SRF) technology is well suited for generating CW electron beams in high accelerating gradient environments. Recent achievements in the SRF photoinjector realm demonstrated the ability of the modern SRF guns to provide stable operation with high-brightness beams. In this paper",
        "we report the excellent performance of our SRF gun with CsK2Sb photocathode that was built for the Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) Proof of Principle (PoP) experiment at RHIC. The gun is generating high charge electron bunches (up to 10 nC per bunch) and low transverse emittances with the cathodes operating for months without significant loss of quantum efficiency. We will provide a brief overview of the main stages of the commissioning of our gun along with a detailed discussion of the main challenges during the operation. This is followed by the description of the emittance studies",
        "including our experimental results and numerical simulations."
