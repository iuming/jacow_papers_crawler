The field-emitters consist of microscopic silicon pyramids and have a typical enhancement factor of about 500. To trigger field-emission",

Alkali antimonides are efficient photocathode materials and have very low intrinsic emittance at cryogenic temperatures.* A limiting factors is the surface roughness and chemical inhomogeneity of the films.** We studied the influence of growth parameters on the morphology and composition of Cs3Sb thin films. The films are codeposited using pure element sources and transferred via UHV suitcase to a STM/XPS analysis chamber",
        "to study in particular the influence of substrate temperature and material. This platform can be expanded to more analysis and growth systems thanks to a specially designed sample holder and suitcase. An example is a new cryogenic instrument for intrinsic emittance measurements.",

        "even at nano-scale. However",
        "its electron emission properties are yet to be fully understood. Recently",
        "we started to investigate femtosecond-laser-induced strong-field photoemission from nanocrystalline diamond field emitters with very sharp (~10 nm apex) tips. Initial results show that the mechanism of electron emission at ~1010 W/cm2 light intensities in the near UV to near IR range is more complex than in metals. We present our latest experimental results obtained at Stanford University",
        "while LANL’s strong-field photoemission test stand is being commissioned. We show that strong-field photoemission occurs not only at the nano-tip’s apex",
        "but also on flat diamond surfaces (e.g.",
        "pyramid sides)",
        "that is why extra care needs to be taken to differentiate between emission spots on the chip. Qualitatively",
