        "had quality factors Q ~108",
        "providing one of the primary limitations for the achievable useful quantum superposition (aka coherence) times. In this talk I will overview how the superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity expertise in accelerators can bring the field of QIS ahead by several orders of magnitude in coherence times",
        "as well discuss the emerging Quantum Technology effort at Fermilab and the first record achievements in this area."
