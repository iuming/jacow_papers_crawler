        "The RHIC ion (polarized proton) beam intensity has increased to 4x (1.1x) of the original design specifications. In 2013 proton beam currents overcame the eddy current reduction design features in the RHIC beam abort system kicker magnets causing ferrite heating and resulting in a reduction of the kicker strength. In 2014",
        "the abort kicker ferrites were changed",
        "the eddy current reduction design was upgraded",
        "and an active ferrite cooling loop installed to prevent heating. For ions the beam dump vacuum window was changed from stainless steel to a titanium alloy and the adjacent beam diffuser block carbon material was changed to allow for higher ion intensities. A thicker beam pipe was installed to prevent secondaries from quenching the adjacent superconducting quadrupole. With these upgrades there is at least a factor 2 of safety margin for the demonstrated intensities to date. For a further increase in the intensity for RHIC and eRHIC we evaluate upgrade options for the beam abort system."

IBS is an important factor that leads to the growth of the beam emittance and hence the reduction of the luminosity in a high density ion collider ring. Electron cooling is an effective measure to overcome the IBS effect. Although JSPEC is initiated to fulfill the simulation needs in JLab Electron Ion Collider project",
        "it can be used as a general design tool for other accelerators. JSPEC provides various models of the ion beam and the electron beam and it calculates the expansion rate and simulates the evolution of the ion beam under the IBS and/or electron cooling effect. In this report",
