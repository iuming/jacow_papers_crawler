This phenomenon was observed for the first time during the commissioning of the CeC PoP experiment. Based on the dynamics of this instability we named it a Plasma-Cascade Instability (PCI). PCI can strongly intensify longitudinal micro-bunching originating from the beam’s shot noise",
        "and even saturate it. Resulting random density and energy microstructures in the beam can become a serious problem for generating high quality electron beams. On the other hand",
        "such instability can drive novel high-power sources of broadband radiation. In this paper we present our experimental observations of the PCI and the supporting results of the numerical simulations."

      "abstract": "Beam-Beam damping of the Ion Instability The electron storage ring of the proposed electron ion collider at BNL has bunch charges as large as 50 nC and bunch spacings as small as 10 ns. For molecules like CO a dangerous buildup of positive ions is possible and a significant fraction of these ions can survive allowable clearing gaps. The instability is thus multi-turn and the weak damping required to stop the ion instabilty with an ideal clearing gap is ineffective here. The beam-beam force is highly nonlinear and a potent source of tune spread. Simulations employing several macro-particles per electron bunch and several ion macroparticles are used to estimate maximum gas densities for some common molecules. A simplified model is introduced and compared with simulations. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

To approach the design level of the ring intensity we had to solve major problems in overheating of the chamber components. Since the beginning of the NSLS-II commissioning",
        "the temperature of the vacuum components has been monitored by the Resistance Temperature Detectors located predominantly outside of the vacuum chamber and attached to the chamber body. A couple of vacuum components were designed with the possibility for internal temperature measurements under the vacuum as diagnostic assemblies. Temperature map helps us to control overheating of the vacuum components around the ring especially during the current ramp-up. The average current of 475mA has been achieved with two main 500MHz RF cavities and w/o any harmonic cavities. In this paper we discuss the heating results for a 15ps bunch length (at low current) of the following vacuum components: Large Aperture BPM",
