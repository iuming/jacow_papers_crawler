        "High continuous wave (cw) current of highly charged ion beams are required for several heavy ion accelerator facilities including the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). In most cases",
        "Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance (ECR) ion sources remain the only ion source capable to meet the beam intensity requirement for these facilities. Performances of ECR ion source have increased by several order of magnitude since their inception in the 1970s mostly driven by increasing the resonance frequency with today current state of the art ECR ion source operating from 24 to 28 GHz. This paper provides an overview of recent advance in the design and operation of ECR ion source including plans to develop the next generation of ion source capable of operating above 40 GHz. A detailed account of the design and status of the new superconducting ECR ion source in construction for FRIB will also be reported."

        "A recent industrial development has made possible the use of chip-scale radiation detectors by combining a Cerium-doped Lutetium based scintillator crystal optically coupled with a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) as a detector. At the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)",
        "there has been an ongoing effort to determine the location of high voltage breakdowns of the accelerating radio-frequency field inside of an evacuated resonant cavity. Tests were conducted with an array of 8 X-ray detectors with each detector observing a cell of the Drift Tube Linac (DTL) cavity. The array can be moved along the DTL cavity and record X-ray emissions from a section of the cavity and their timing with respect to the RF field quench using a fast 8 channel mixed-signal oscilloscope. This new diagnostic allowed us to map the most energetic emissions along the cavity and reduce the area to investigate. A thorough visual inspection revealed that one of the ion pump grating welds in the suspected area was exposing a small gap and melting copper on both sides. Sparking across this discontinuity is believed to be a source of electrons that drive the high voltage breakdowns in the drift tube cells."
