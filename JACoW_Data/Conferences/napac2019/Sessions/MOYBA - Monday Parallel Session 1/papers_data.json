The first phase for the vacuum scrubbing in 2016 and the second phase focused on the verification of the novel \"nano-beam\" collision scheme were successfully completed in 2018. The modifications between Phase 1 and Phase 2 follows Phase 3 are installations of the final focus system and the Belle II detector. In order to accomplish the higher luminosity more than the predecessor KEKB",
        "the nano-beam scheme is studied with higher bunch currents to reduce the beam-beam blowup which degrade the luminosity. The new collision scheme is reviewed and the luminosity performance and overall status in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 commissioning are presented."
