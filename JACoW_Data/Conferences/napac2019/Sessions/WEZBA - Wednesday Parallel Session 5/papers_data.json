The change of the quadrupole strength results in a beam mismatch downstream of the profile monitor which can cause beam losses. This is not acceptable in a high energy beamline. To avoid this transverse mismatch",
        "we developed a beam matching procedure by optimization of quadrupoles’ setting downstream of the profile monitor. Using this procedure we were able to eliminate beam losses during the quadrupole scan",

The SNS Proton Power Upgrade will double the power deposited into the NCD foils by increasing the beam current by 50% and linac energy by 30%. This makes understanding the failure modes of the NCD foils increasingly important. In this work we report on experiments using a 30 keV",

Phase locking uses a novel approach that provides fast amplitude and phase control when coupled into a superconducting accelerator cavity [1]. The system was successfully tested at Fermilab and produced 100 kW in 1.5 ms pulses at a repetition rate of 2 pps. A locking bandwidth of 0.9 MHz was achieved with a drive signal of 269 W injected through a 4 port circulator. The phase locking signal was 25 dB below the magnetron output power. The spectrum of the phase locked magnetron was suitable for driving accelerator cavities. Phase modulation was demonstrated to 50 kHz (the limit of the available driver source). The average power was limited by available conditioning time. Scaling indicates 42 kW of average power should be achievable. Estimated cost is less than $1/Watt of delivered RF power",
