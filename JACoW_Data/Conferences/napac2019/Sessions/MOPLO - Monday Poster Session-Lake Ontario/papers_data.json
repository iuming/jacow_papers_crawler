        "For the LCLS-II project",
        "the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is installing a new superconducting RF linac capable of continuously delivering 4 GeV electron bunches spaced 1.1 microseconds apart. A spreader system is required to distribute the beam between a soft X-ray or hard X-ray undulator",
        "and a beam dump. An additional beam diverter is required in the front end of the linac to divert 100 MeV electrons to a diagnostic line. Both the spreader and diagnostic diversion systems are designed to operate on a bunch by bunch basis via the combination of fast kickers and a Lambertson septum. This paper presents a summary of the optics",
        "kicker",
        "and septum design. Of specific interest is the unique challenge associated with building a high repetition",

        "spreader capable of diverting a single bunch without disturbing neighboring bunches. Additional discussion includes the application of the spreader technology to the proposed DASEL/S30XL beamline. This beamline will acceptμbunches evenly spaced between the undulator bound bunches",
        "thus requiring a kicker with the same repetition rate as LCLS-II but a pulse width extended to approximately 600 ns."

        "The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) op-erates one of the nation’s most powerful linear accelera-tors (LINAC). Currently the facility utilizes two 750 keV Cockcroft-Walton (CW) based injectors for transporting H+ and H− beams into the 800 MeV accelerator. A Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) design is being proposed to replace the aged CW injectors. An important component of the RFQ Test Stand is the Faraday cup that is assem-bled at the end of the Low Energy Beam Transport (Phase 1 LEBT) and Medium Energy Beam Transport (Phase 3 MEBT). The Faraday cup functions simultaneously as both a beam diagnostic and as a beam stop for each of the three project phases. This paper describes various aspects of the design and analysis of the Faraday cup. The first analysis examined the press fit assembly of the graphite cone and the copper cup components. A finite element analysis (FEA) evaluated the thermal expansion proper-ties of the copper component",
        "and the resulting material stress from the assembly. Second",
        "the beam deposition and heat transfer capability were analyzed for LEBT and MEBT beam power levels. Details of the calculations and analysis will be presented."

The proposed corrugated waveguide structure will be fabricated on the internal wall of 0.5m long and 2mm nominal diameter copper tube. The estimated dimensions of these parallel corrugations are 200 µm in pitch with 100 µm side length (height and width). The length scale of the structure and requirements of the magnetic field-driven dimensional tolerances have made the structure challenging to produce.

For each Superconducting RF (SRF) cavity is desirable a separate RF source with power up to hundreds of kW with pulse duration in the millisecond range. The efficiency of the traditional RF sources (klystrons",
        "IOTs",
        "solid-state amplifiers) is lower than that of the magnetrons",
        "while the cost of a unit of RF power is much higher. Therefore the magnetron-based RF sources would significantly reduce the capital and operation costs in comparison with the traditional RF sources. A recently developed an innovative technique makes possible the pulsed generation of magnetrons powered below the self-excitation threshold voltage. This technique does not require pulse modulators to form RF pulses. The magnetron operation in this regime is stable",
