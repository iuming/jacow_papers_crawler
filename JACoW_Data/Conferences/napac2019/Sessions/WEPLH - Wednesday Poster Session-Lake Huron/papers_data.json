        "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) includes a continuous wave superconducting linear accelerator designed to deliver 400 kW ion beams with energies above 200 MeV/u. The beam commissioning of the first three cryomodules took place in the summer of 2018. A temporary diagnostic station installed after the first three cryomodules included a Silicon Detector (SiD) to measure absolute energy and bunch shape of 40Ar and 86Kr beams accelerated up to 2.3 MeV/u. The beam longitudinal emittance was evaluated by measuring bunch shapes while the bunching field amplitude of the upstream resonator was varied. In this paper",
        "we will present the SiD setup and measurement results."

        "The present RFQ of ReA3 reaccelerator at Michigan State University (MSU) has been commissioned in 2010. This 4-rod RFQ was designed to accelerate the prebunched 80.5 MHz beams with the lowest Q/A = 1/5. However",
        "the lack of proper cooling limited the RFQ performance to the pulsed operation with the lowest Q/A = 1/4. The design voltage for Q/A = 1/5 has never been reached even in a pulsed mode due to the sparking. In 2016 we initiated the upgrade of ReA3 RFQ to support high duty cycle (up to CW) operation with Q/A = 1/5 beams. The upgrade included the new rods with trapezoidal modulation",
        "and new stems with improved cooling. The redesigned 80.5 MHz RFQ will consume only 65% rf power of the present RFQ for Q/A = 1/5 beam. It will provide the transmission up to 78% for 16.1 MHz beams and 89% for 80.5 MHz beams. High reliability and efficiency of the RFQ are very important for the going-on reaccelerator upgrade to ReA6 and for future operation as a part of FRIB. The electrodes have been manufactured and are being installed. The RF and beam tests are scheduled to summer 2019."

After years of operation with high energy heavy ion beams we experienced a first permanently damaged QPD in the middle of our FY2016 Au Au run and a second damaged diode in the following year. In 2016 the run had to be interrupted by 19 days to replace the diode",
