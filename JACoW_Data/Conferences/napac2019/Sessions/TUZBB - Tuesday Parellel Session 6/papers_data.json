        "Multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattices were proposed more than 25 years ago as a way to reduce the emittance of third generation storage rings by 1-2 orders of magnitude",
        "and thereby increase the x-ray brightness by a similar factor. However",
        "it wasn’t until the recent advances in compact magnets and vacuum pumping",
        "pioneered by MAX-IV and CERN",
        "respectively",
        "that MBA lattices could be considered as the basis for a light source. Now",
        "there are many projects around the world that employ an MBA lattice to achieve an emittance well below 1 nm. I will begin by briefly reviewing how the MBA lattice can achieve an ultra-low emittance. Then",
        "I will proceed to discuss how the essential physics of the MBA drives its design",
        "and how that in turn impacts the physics. For example",
        "its requirement for strong magnets leads to a small dynamic aperture and physically small vacuum chambers",
        "which in turn impacts impedance and collective effects. I will try to illustrate this interplay with advances made by many other projects",
        "but will inevitably favor the recent progress of the APS-Upgrade project",
        "where we are targeting a 42-pm design for hard x-rays."

        "The first ever electron cooling based on the RF acceleration of electron bunches was experimentally demonstrated on April 5",
        "2019 at the Low Energy RHIC Electron Cooler (LEReC) at BNL. The critical step in obtaining successful cooling of the Au ion bunches in the RHIC cooling sections was the accurate matching of average longitudinal velocities of electron and ion beams corresponding to a relative error of less than 5·10-4 in the e-beam momentum. Since the electron beam kinetic energy is just 1.6 MeV",
        "measuring the absolute e-beam energy with sufficient accuracy and eventually achieving the electron-ion velocity matching was a nontrivial task. In this paper we describe our experience with measuring and setting the e-beam energy at LEReC."
