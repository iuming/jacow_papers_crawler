        "A straight section vacuum system (nominally 5.363 meters long) has been designed for the APS upgrade project. This vacuum system will be used in straight sections equipped with hybrid permanent magnet undulators (HPMU). The vacuum system assembly consists of the insertion device vacuum chamber (IDVC)",
        "the vacuum chamber distributed support",
        "and the photon absorber. Numerous functional requirements constrained the IDVC design. These constraints included incorporation of the beam aperture transition into the end of the aluminium vacuum chamber extrusion (storage ring aperture to IDVC aperture)",
        "thin walls (~600 microns) surrounding the beam aperture to allow for as small a magnetic gap as possible",
        "and complicated weld paths to ensure a continuous beam surface to minimize impedance. Additionally",
        "extensive FEA and raytrace analysis were performed to ensure that the chamber would not fail due to structural or thermal perturbations."

        "The NSLS-II Active Interlock is the system which protects the NSLS-II Storage Ring vacuum chamber from damage due to synchrotron radiation. The Active Interlock measures the beam position and angle at all insertion devices and issues a beam dump if the beam is outside of the pre-defined window. The window is determined by thermal analysis of vacuum apertures and considers the effects of local magnets such as canting magnets",
        "etc. Recently",
        "it was realized that the insertion device correction coils where not considered in the initial evaluation of the envelope. The purpose of these coils is to correct for the orbit deviations caused by imperfections in the insertion devices that steer the beam. The usual effect is to negate any angle induced by the device",
        "however",
        "if the coil is not set properly the beam may have a larger angle than permitted by the Active Interlock even though the angle calculation does not show it. In this paper we discuss the effect of the insertion device coils on the electron beam and the steps taken to account for this effect in the Active Interlock."
