        "Free electron lasers (FEL) and plasma wakefield accelerators (PWA) are creating more and more complicated electron bunch configurations",
        "including multi-color modes for FELs such as LCLS and LCLS-II and custom tailored bunch current profiles for PWAs such as FACET-II. These accelerators are also producing shorter and higher intensity bunches than before and require an ability to quickly switch between many different users with various specific phase space requirements. For some very exotic setups it can take hours of tuning to provide the beams that users require. In this work",
        "we present results adaptive machine learning and model independent feedback techniques and their application in both the LCLS and European XFEL to 1) control electron bunch phase space to create desired current profiles and energy spreads by tuning FEL components automatically",
        "2) maximize the average pulse output energy of FELs by automatically tuning over 100 components simultaneously",
        "3) preliminary results on utilizing these techniques for non-invasive electron bunch longitudinal phase space diagnostics at PWAs."

        "Electron beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) experiments at SLAC’s FACET-II research facility will require diagnostics that can measure the transverse position of both the drive beam and the witness beam in a single shot. This is a challenge for ordinary beam position monitors due to the close temporal spacing between the two bunches",
        "usually on the order of 300 fs. Here we will discuss the concept for an electro-optic sampling beam position monitor (EOS-BPM) that can measure the transverse position of the individual bunches with roughly 10 µm spatial resolution",
        "and 50 fs temporal resolution. The EOS-BPM has the advantage of being a non-destructive",
        "single shot measurement. It uses two EO crystals on either side of the beamline. The half-cycle THz fields of the electron beams induce a birefringence in the crystals which are probed by a chirped laser pulse. The longitudinal current profile is spectrally encoded into the probe laser",
        "while the transverse position for each bunch is encoded in the relative strength of the signal in either crystal. We present simulations demonstrating the effectiveness of an EOS-BPM in the context of PWFA experiments planned for FACET-II."
