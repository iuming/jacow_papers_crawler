        "material sciences and national security. State-of-the-art rare isotope facilities can be based on an isotope separation on-line (ISOL) approach using mostly high-power proton beams striking a thick target where the isotopes are produced in the target",
        "or an in-flight fragment separation (IF) approach using high-power heavy ion beams striking upon a thinner target where the isotopes continue out of the target followed by fragment separation. This tutorial class introduces high power hadron accelerators as driver machines for rare isotope production",
        "summarizing the key design philosophy",
        "physical and technical challenges",
        "and current world-wide development status. As an example",
        "the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) project is used to illustrate the process of establishing such facilities."
