        "which uses electron cooling techniques to compensate for intra-beam scattering and thus to improve the luminosity lifetime. During RHIC operations at 3.85 GeV (beam energy) with LEReC",
        "one needs to ensure that the electron beam energy is properly matched for cooling purposes: if so",
        "some of the circulating Au-79 ions can recombine with an electron",
        "turning into Au-78 and circulating with a large momentum offset. Part of the LEReC commissioning steps is therefore to drive a maximized number of Au-78 ions towards a chosen location of the RHIC mechanical aperture to generate particle showers that can be detected by a Recombination Monitor outside the cryostat. This article introduces the baseline lattice design",
        "then discusses the few scenarios considered for optimizing Au-78 losses at a given location. Each scenario is then simulated using new tracking tools for generating beam loss maps."

The ion rings of the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) adopted this technique in their figure-8 design. The transparent spin mode can also be setup in a racetrack with two identical Siberian snakes. There is a proposal to test the predicted features of the spin transparent mode in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)",
        "which already has all of the necessary hardware capabilities. We have earlier analytically estimated the setup parameters and developed a preliminary experimental plan. In this paper we describe simulation setup and benchmarking for the proposed experiment using a Zgoubi model of RHIC."
