Indeed",

The MIK is a real opportunity for synchrotrons wishing to upgrade their facilities. One of the first MIK developed by BESSY II in 2010 gave significant results. These results motivated SOLEIL and MAX IV to develop together their own MIK. Many technical challenges have been overcome in the area of mechanical design and manufacture as well as in magnetic and high voltage design of the MIK. Currently the first series is in operation at MAX IV and displays already outstanding performances. Optimization work is in progress."

A new technique enabling non-contact monitoring of temperature has been developed for the I23 beamline. The temperature is determined by measuring the luminescence decay constant of a Bi4Ge3O12 scintillation sensor. One of the main advantages of the non-contact thermometry system is elimination of any connections between the sensor and the readout system that makes it fully compatible with the vacuum environment and necessity of swift replacement and manipulation of the samples. The technique was applied to quantify the thermal performance of different sample mounts that has been used for MX experiment at I23 beamline. It has been shown that the magnitude of the temperature rise across the sample mounts varies in wide range from 60 to 110 K while the temperature of goniometer was 40 K. The obtained results not only explain previous empirical finding but also demonstrated how this technique can aid studies of the complex relationships between various parameters influencing the heat conductance and temperature of the samples.",

Thereby the so called von Hamos geometry provides high detection efficiency due to sagittal focusing using cylindrically bent crystals. To maximize the detection efficiency a full-cylinder optic can be applied. A novel calibratable von Hamos X-ray spectrometer based on up to two full-cylinder optics was developed at the PTB. To realize the full-cylinder geometry Highly Annealed Pyrolytic Graphite (HAPG) [1] was used. Besides its good bending properties this mosaic crystal shows highly integrated reflectivity while offering low mosaicity ensuring high resolving power [2]. The spectrometer enables chemical speciation of elements in an energy range from 2.4 keV up to 18 keV. The design and commissioning of the spectrometer will be presented together with first results using synchrotron radiation as excitation source. The spectrometer combines high efficiency with high spectral resolution (ten times better than in commercial WDS systems) in a compact arrangement also suitable for laboratory arrangements.",

The cyclotron extractor design allows negative ion stripping to extract protons between 35 and 70 MeV. The extractor is consistent with the requirement for high current operation with a minimum of intervention. Twenty-two extractor foils are available in any selection sequence on each side of the cyclotron. The foil exchange is performed in vacuum so that an exchange takes about 2 minutes while obeying safety protocols. The 22 foils are contained in a cartridge that can be quickly exchanged through a vacuum load lock minimizing operator exposure. An added benefit is that the extractor modular design reduces the operational space requirement outside of the cyclotron thus reducing the vault footprint and shielding requirement.",

Finite-element analysis is used to calculate the crystal thermal deformations and optimize the cooling structure by changing crystal size and cooling structure. Optimization results are displayed. The heat absorbers consist of two copper cooling clamped to the crystal side faces via an indium foil in order to ensure a good thermal contact and to relax the thermal deformation. Those absorbers are each composed of 16 cooling fins regularly spaced and carved from the cooper block. The cooling fluid of high fin position is higher than the silicon crystal surface. The cooling structure can dissipate a heat load up to 800W& power density 10W/mm2. reference for this paper using",

For the standard chamber the upstream distributed absorber cannot protect the entire chamber from direct BM radiation because there is a limitation for its design: the beam impedance of the machine. Based on new studies of collective effects it has been concluded that it's possible to implement modifications on the upstream distributed absorber and protect the chamber from lateral collision of BM radiation keeping the beam impedance of the machine inside of a safe range. In spite of that still there is a contribution of the tails of BM radiation. In this paper we describe the behavior of the new aluminium vacuum chamber for different thermal load conditions using water and air for refrigeration. Also we present the design of the modified OFHC upstream distributed absorber."

For the current ALBA dipole chamber the ID vertical polarized light hits the upper and lower walls because of the very narrow vertical aperture between the cooling channels.

Two In-vacuum Undulators (IU22) with lengths of 3 m and 2 m were used as the Insertion Device (ID) to provide intense synchrotron radiation for the CXS beamline. To achieve the coherent performance",

A single-crystal diamond filter was also adopted to maintain the coherence of x-ray. The protection of bremsstrahlung radiation for this beamline was designed specifically based on the optical layout. This paper will introduce the detailed mechanical design and current status for the CXS beamline."

The small apertures dictate that the walls of the vacuum chambers act as distributed photon ab-sorbers. The vacuum chambers must be designed robustly so a thorough understanding of the synchrotron ray trac-ing with beam missteering is required. A MatLab program has been developed to investigate 3D ray tracing with beam missteering. The program dis-cretizes local phase spaces of deviation possibilities along the beam path in both the horizontal and vertical planes of motion and then projects rays within a 3D mod-el of the vacuum system. The 3D model contains ele-ments in sequence along the beam path which represent both chamber segments and photon absorbers. Ray strikes are evaluated for multiple worst-case criteria such as local power intensity or strike offset from cooling channels. The worst case results are plotted and used as boundary conditions for vacuum chamber ther-mal/structural analyses. The results have also helped inform decisions about practical beam position limits.",

This approach can restrict the opportunities for some companies to include their own specialist manufacturing capability to provide a more effective and cost efficient solution. A new approach is suggested following the recent experience at Diamond Light Source. The manufacture of high stiffness welded fabrications up to 13m in length for the I21 RIXS Spectrometer is used as an example. The I21 RIXS Spectrometer design was optimised for stiffness and control of vibration. The use of Finite Element Analysis enabled different design options and compromises to be explored utilising the supplier's capabilities. The final design was tested during manufacture to verify the FEA model. With the I21 RIXS Spectrometer commissioned the data collected shows the final stability performance of the system including detector stability over full experiment durations has met the scientific goals of the design.",

The requirement that the analyser was to be mounted on a diffractometer meant the construction needed to be as lightweight and as compact as possible. This provided opportunities to explore new collaborative ways of working with both in-house and external suppliers. The paper describes the approach taken to develop lightweight aluminium vacuum chambers working with a company specialising in additive layer manufacturing. In addition",

A novel requirement for the analyser is to have a detector mounted on a rotation axis in vacuum. The results of working with the in-house detector group to develop a design to with all the necessary thermal and electrical connections are described. The paper also describes further use of additive layer manufacturing to produce prototypes that allows the design of a cable management system to be optimised where previously using 3d CAD models had proved unsatisfactory."

            "beamline P01 at Petra III DESY is providing monochromatic X-Rays at energies down to 2.5keV. An in-house developed High Resolution Monochromator (HRM) for High Vacuum (5x10-7mbar) was assembled and installed in early summer 2017. As a core component a high precision goniometer was designed. A piezo actuator provides the required angular range of 40°. The angular resolution is specified with 0.5microrad and is controlled by an encoder. Three goniometers can be moved independently along the three linear directions. The linear movements are assembled by low cost linear guide components and driven by toothed wheels and toothed bars or by spindles directly attached to the motor shaft. First beamtimes in 2017 with channel cut Si (111) crystals showed promising results - HRM providing x-rays with a bandwidth of 100meV (at 2.840keV). The resolution of the goniometers is better than 0",

An in-house developed High Resolution Monochromator (HRM) for High Vacuum (5x10-7mbar) was assembled and installed in early summer 2017. As a core component a high precision goniometer was designed. A piezo actuator provides the required angular range of 40°. The angular resolution is specified with 0.5microrad and is controlled by an encoder. Three goniometers can be moved independently along the three linear directions. The linear movements are assembled by low cost linear guide components and driven by toothed wheels and toothed bars or by spindles directly attached to the motor shaft. First beamtimes in 2017 with channel cut Si (111) crystals showed promising results - HRM providing x-rays with a bandwidth of 100meV (at 2.840keV). The resolution of the goniometers is better than 0",

The MIK is a real opportunity for synchrotrons wishing to upgrade their facilities. One of the first MIK developed by BESSY II in 2010 gave significant results.

Many technical challenges have been overcome in the area of mechanical design and manufacture as well as in magnetic and high voltage design of the MIK.

A main feature of the TPS CPMU is its low-intrinsic-phase errors by the installation of force-compensation modules on the out-of-vacuum girders in a four-support-points configuration. Moreover",
        "adjusting the spring settings one can obtain very low undulator phase errors. In this paper",

By adding two repulsive magnet arrays beside center array the magnetic force between girders can be reduced from 70kN to near zero. Such an approach can result in a significant reduction of the undulator volume",

      "abstract": "Measurement of the temperature of cryogenically cooled samples in a vacuum environment is a challenging task that requires specialist technical solutions. A new technique enabling non-contact monitoring of temperature has been developed for the I23 beamline. The temperature is determined by measuring the luminescence decay constant of a Bi4Ge3O12 scintillation sensor. One of the main advantages of the non-contact thermometry system is elimination of any connections between the sensor and the readout system that makes it fully compatible with the vacuum environment and necessity of swift replacement and manipulation of the samples. The technique was applied to quantify the thermal performance of different sample mounts that has been used for MX experiment at I23 beamline. It has been shown that the magnitude of the temperature rise across the sample mounts varies in wide range from 60 to 110 K while the temperature of goniometer was 40 K. The obtained results not only explain previous empirical finding but also demonstrated how this technique can aid studies of the complex relationships between various parameters influencing the heat conductance and temperature of the samples.",

Thereby the so called von Hamos geometry provides high detection efficiency due to sagittal focusing using cylindrically bent crystals. To maximize the detection efficiency a full-cylinder optic can be applied. A novel calibratable von Hamos X-ray spectrometer based on up to two full-cylinder optics was developed at the PTB. To realize the full-cylinder geometry Highly Annealed Pyrolytic Graphite (HAPG) [1] was used. Besides its good bending properties this mosaic crystal shows highly integrated reflectivity while offering low mosaicity ensuring high resolving power [2]. The spectrometer enables chemical speciation of elements in an energy range from 2.4 keV up to 18 keV. The design and commissioning of the spectrometer will be presented together with first results using synchrotron radiation as excitation source. The spectrometer combines high efficiency with high spectral resolution (ten times better than in commercial WDS systems) in a compact arrangement also suitable for laboratory arrangements.",

The extractor is consistent with the requirement for high current operation with a minimum of intervention. Twenty-two extractor foils are available in any selection sequence on each side of the cyclotron. The foil exchange is performed in vacuum so that an exchange takes about 2 minutes while obeying safety protocols. The 22 foils are contained in a cartridge that can be quickly exchanged through a vacuum load lock minimizing operator exposure. An added benefit is that the extractor modular design reduces the operational space requirement outside of the cyclotron thus reducing the vault footprint and shielding requirement.",

Those absorbers are each composed of 16 cooling fins regularly spaced and carved from the cooper block. The cooling fluid of high fin position is higher than the silicon crystal surface.

For the standard chamber the upstream distributed absorber cannot protect the entire chamber from direct BM radiation because there is a limitation for its design: the beam impedance of the machine. Based on new studies of collective effects it has been concluded that it's possible to implement modifications on the upstream distributed absorber and protect the chamber from lateral collision of BM radiation keeping the beam impedance of the machine inside of a safe range. In spite of that still there is a contribution of the tails of BM radiation. In this paper we describe the behavior of the new aluminium vacuum chamber for different thermal load conditions using water and air for refrigeration. Also we present the design of the modified OFHC upstream distributed absorber."

The LOREA Insertion Device (ID) consists of an Apple II undulator with a period of 125 mm. For the current ALBA dipole chamber the ID vertical polarized light hits the upper and lower walls because of the very narrow vertical aperture between the cooling channels. To solve this problem some modifications must be implemented both in the dipole chamber and in the crotch absorber located inside of the dipole. The new crotch absorber",

The design has been optimized taking into account the standard thermo-mechanical design criteria as well as the reflective effects of the ID radiation from the opening towards the walls of the dipole chamber."

        "a polychromator placed 1m upstream of the sample. The movement of the sample and the need for the laser to follow it put strong constraints on the mechanical design of the whole setup. We will present the layout of laser facility",

The small apertures dictate that the walls of the vacuum chambers act as distributed photon ab-sorbers. The vacuum chambers must be designed robustly so a thorough understanding of the synchrotron ray trac-ing with beam missteering is required. A MatLab program has been developed to investigate 3D ray tracing with beam missteering. The program dis-cretizes local phase spaces of deviation possibilities along the beam path in both the horizontal and vertical planes of motion and then projects rays within a 3D mod-el of the vacuum system. The 3D model contains ele-ments in sequence along the beam path which represent both chamber segments and photon absorbers. Ray strikes are evaluated for multiple worst-case criteria such as local power intensity or strike offset from cooling channels. The worst case results are plotted and used as boundary conditions for vacuum chamber ther-mal/structural analyses. The results have also helped inform decisions about practical beam position limits.",

This approach can restrict the opportunities for some companies to include their own specialist manufacturing capability to provide a more effective and cost efficient solution. A new approach is suggested following the recent experience at Diamond Light Source. The manufacture of high stiffness welded fabrications up to 13m in length for the I21 RIXS Spectrometer is used as an example. The I21 RIXS Spectrometer design was optimised for stiffness and control of vibration. The use of Finite Element Analysis enabled different design options and compromises to be explored utilising the supplier's capabilities. The final design was tested during manufacture to verify the FEA model. With the I21 RIXS Spectrometer commissioned the data collected shows the final stability performance of the system including detector stability over full experiment durations has met the scientific goals of the design.",

One project is developing of standardization and modularization beamline components for the Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) and Taiwan Light Source (TLS) beamlines. The components including the high heat load masks, white/mono beam slits, phosphor screens type beam monitor system, beam shutters, common chambers, and support tables/stands, are selected as the standards so far. Many advanced concepts and materials are applied for the developing components to improve their stability and reliability. The other project is planning to design a monitor and control system for the beamline components. Some EPICS compatible instruments are being partially tested and will be applied to the new beamlines at TPS.[1-3] The log of beamline status for all beamlines will be recorded and stored in an archive. The purpose of these projects will save not only the cost but also the manpower on construction for several beamlines in time. reference for this paper using",

An in-house developed High Resolution Monochromator (HRM) for High Vacuum (5x10-7mbar) was assembled and installed in early summer 2017. As a core component a high precision goniometer was designed. A piezo actuator provides the required angular range of 40°. The angular resolution is specified with 0.5microrad and is controlled by an encoder. Three goniometers can be moved independently along the three linear directions. The linear movements are assembled by low cost linear guide components and driven by toothed wheels and toothed bars or by spindles directly attached to the motor shaft. First beamtimes in 2017 with channel cut Si (111) crystals showed promising results - HRM providing x-rays with a bandwidth of 100meV (at 2.840keV). The resolution of the goniometers is better than 0",

Three goniometers can be moved independently along the three linear directions.

        "21 of the 28 X-ray undulator beamlines have the same sets of a double-crystal monochromator (DCM) and a cryogenically cooling system. A remaining problem is vibration for the forthcoming upgraded SPring-8. For certain experiments",
        "vibration seems to fluctuate the source position. The virtual fluctuation",
        "which increases the effective source size",
        "degrades high-density nanobeam made by direct projection of the source. When a DCM is placed at 40 m downstream from a source with 6-um size",
        "the vibration should be 50 nrad to suppress 20%-increase of the source size. The vibration was over 800 nrad in 2011. We have continued improving low-vibration flexible tubes for transport tube of liquid nitrogen",
        "high-rigidity tilt stages",
        "and temperature controllers of the coolant. The latest-version refinements were carried out to 5 DCMs in 2017FY. The vibrations were reduced to about 110 nrad in 4 DCMs and 55 nrad for one."
