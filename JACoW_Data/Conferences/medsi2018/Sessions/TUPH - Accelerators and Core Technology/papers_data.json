Many technical challenges have been overcome in the area of mechanical design and manufacture as well as in magnetic and high voltage design of the MIK.

This paper describes technical challenges presented by both the magnetic design and the interface constraints for the magnet. A prototype magnet was built",

        "The upgrade of the ESRF (ESRF-EBS) is a highly challenging project in many respects. One major challenge is to manufacture vacuum chambers within extremely tight tolerances. Indeed the chamber envelope is constrained by the very limited space available between the beam stay clear and the magnets pole tips",
        "requiring profile tolerances of just 500 um over the full length of the chamber for a width of 55 mm. An additional challenge is guaranteeing the perpendicularity (up to 0.75 mrad) between the CF flanges and the chamber body. While a design using discrete removable absorbers was chosen",
        "one family of chambers contains a distributed absorber required to protect the insertion devices from 600 W of upstream dipole X-rays. Two companies have been selected to produce a total of 296 stainless steel chambers. Given the unusual tolerance requirements",
        "the manufacturers have been obliged to adapt and develop their production techniques to overcome the challenges. During manufacture",
        "vacuum leaks were discovered on some of the BPM buttons. This paper will also present the two techniques that ESRF has developed in order to prevent the integration of potentially leaking buttons."
