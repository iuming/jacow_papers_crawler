        "we will present in a didactic way the essential properties of synchrotron light",
        "and the basic physical phenomena underlying the interaction between synchrotron light and matter: scattering and absorption. The main classes of techniques that beamlines offer to the users community",
        "namely diffusion-diffraction",
        "spectroscopy and imaging",
        "will then be presented. A special emphasis will be given to the huge increase of brilliance",
        "and thus of coherence",
        "that the new generation of synchrotrons have pledged to provide."
