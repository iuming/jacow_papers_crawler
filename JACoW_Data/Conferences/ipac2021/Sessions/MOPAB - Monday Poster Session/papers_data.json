In order to mitigate the risk of magnet quenches during periods of short beam lifetime in future High-Luminosity (HL-LHC) operation",

The simulated power deposition levels for the adopted HL-LHC collimator configuration and settings are used to assess the quench margin by comparison with the present estimated quench levels."

        "The protection of the tertiary collimators (TCTs) and the LHC triplet aperture in case of a so-called asynchronous beam dump relies on the correct retraction between the TCTs and the dump region absorbers. A new method to validate this retraction has been proposed",
        "and a proof-of-principle experiment was performed at the LHC. The method uses a long orbit bump to mimic the change of the beam trajectory caused by an asynchronous firing of the extraction kickers. It can",

        "spontaneous and asynchronous firing of abort kicker modules (pre-fires) have to be avoided. A new triggering circuit for the abort kickers was implemented with relatively slow mechanical relays in series with the standard fast thyratron tubes. The relays prevents unwanted pre-fires during operation",
        "but comes at the expense of a long latency - about 7 milliseconds - between the removal of beam permit and the actual firing of the abort kickers. Protection considerations of RHIC’s superconducting magnets forbid delaying energy extraction from the main dipoles and quadrupoles for too long after a quench. The beam has thus to circulate in both RHIc rings for a few milliseconds as the current in dipole and quadrupole circuit is being extracted. We present the results of delayed abort experiments conducted in July 2018 with the analysis of fast orbit and tune measurements and discuss the safety implications of this implementation for future RHIC operation."

A unique feature of VEPP-4M is the high precision beam energy calibration by resonant polarization technique which allows conducting of interesting experiments despite the low luminosity of the collider. Recently we have started new luminosity acquisition run above 2 GeV. The hadron cross section was measured from 2.3 GeV to 3.5 GeV has been done. The luminosity run for gamma-gamma physics has been started. The luminosity at ψ(1S)-meson has been obtained. For the beam energy calibration the laser polarimeter is used.

The longitudinal equations of motion and the Hamiltonian were expanded to high order terms of the energy deviation of particles in a beam. Roots of third order equation for three leading terms of momentum compaction factor and free energy independent term were derived in a form suitable for analytical estimations. Averaged quadratic terms of closed orbit distortions caused by misalignment of magnetic elements in a ring lead to orbit lengthening independent of particle energy deviation. Particle transverse excursions were estimated and are taken into account. Simulations have been bench-marked on existing experiments at Metrology Light Source (MLS) in Berlin (Germany) and SOLEIL (France). Parameters of three simultaneous beams and alpha buckets at MLS and SOLEIL have been reproduced with high accuracy. A computer model of KARA was used to predict behavior and the dynamics of possible simultaneous beams in the ring.",

        "small-aperture vacuum chambers provide limited conductance for pumping. Non-evaporable getter (NEG) coatings will be used in the SR to support the vacuum. Ion pumps and cold-cathode gauges are typically located away from the vacuum chamber transporting the beam. Measuring gas bremsstrahlung (GB) photons in low-conductance chambers provides a method to determine the pressure at the beam location. We report on GB measurements made in the ID-25 beamline. A Pb:Glass calorimeter radiator generates Cherenkov radiation when high-energy photons cause pair-production within the glass. A photomultiplier tube converts the light pulses to electrical signals. Data was obtained during normal machine operations starting in January 2020. Data collection was facilitated using a 4-channel ITech Beam Loss Monitor FPGA that allows for control of thresholds and attenuation settings in both counting and pulse-height acquisition modes. Count rates and spectra were recorded for the three primary fill patterns typically used during SR operations as well as during gas injection experiments; results of these measurements will be presented."

In 2016 investigations of upgrading PETRA III into a diffraction limited storage ring at 10 keV have been started. The ambitious goal is to achieve an emittance in the range of 10-30 pm*rad. For the conceptual design report (CDR) of PETRA IV a lattice based on hybrid multi-bend achromats (HMBA) has been chosen. It consists of eight arcs connected by eight long straight sections whereas each arc consists of eight HMBA cells. While this lattice variant has an advantage in terms of simplicity of magnet and girder design it is challenging in regards of multipole strengths and beam dynamic properties. However",

        "the use of reverse bends in the undulator cells allows smaller beta functions at the undulators for an increased brilliance. The design and the beam dynamic properties of this combi lattice are discussed in this paper and compared to the lattice based on HMBA cells."

        "The most recent measurement of muon g-2 results in a 3.8σ discrepancy with the equally precise theoretical prediction. The J-PARC muon g-2/EDM experiment (E34) is in preparation to decipher this discrepancy and unravel the new physics beyond the standard model. The precision goal for g-2 is 0.1 ppm. To achieve this precision goal a novel 3-D spiral injection scheme has been devised to inject and store the beam into a small diameter MRI-type storage magnet for E34. The new injection scheme features smooth injection with high storage efficiency for the compact magnet. However",
        "the spiral injection scheme is an unproven idea",
        "therefore",
        "a Spiral Injection Test Experiment (SITE) at KEK Tsukuba Campus is underway to establish this injection scheme. Due to the axial symmetric field of the solenoid magnet",
        "a strongly XY-coupled beam is required. To produce the required phase space for the solenoid-type storage magnet",
        "a beam transport line consisting of three rotatable quadrupole magnets has been designed and built for SITE. The vertical beam size reduction by means of phase space matching and other geometrical information has been successfully measured by the wire scanners."

These lattice designs are optimised by evolving the networks over many iterations with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The final set of solutions represent the most effi- cient and feasible lattices which satisfy the design constraints. It is up to the lattice designer to choose a design that best suits the intended application. The automated algorithm presented here randomly samples from all possible lattice layouts and reaches the global optimum over many iterations. The requirements of an efficient extraction scheme in hadron therapy synchrotrons impose stringent constraints on the lat- tice optical functions. Using this algorithm allows us to find the global optimum that is tailored to these constraints and to fully utilise the flexibilities provided by new technology."

A change in sextupole strength changes the closed orbit and the tune of the beam in a storage ring. Measuring both therefore allows conclusions about the beam size in the sextupole. Here we derive the pertinent formula and discuss the applicability to storage rings. In particular we investigate the measurement accuracy that can be achieved at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. The Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring underwent a major upgrade in 2018 with the goal of reducing the emittance by a factor of four. A variety of beam size measurement methods have been developed to monitor the positron beam size",

We have compared two kinds of beam dynamics of BISOL RFQ with and without a Multi-Harmonic Buncher (MHB) bunching the continuous wave beam up-stream of the RFQ. The results indicate that it is possible to keep transverse emittance growth within tolerable limits while the longitudinal emittance is much smaller than the design without an external buncher. The acceleration of multi-charge beams simultaneously in the RFQ is also discussed in this paper."

Such monitor will be installed as part of the High Luminosity LHC upgrade at CERN in the Hollow Electron Lens (HEL). The HEL represents a new collimation stage increasing the diffusion rate of halo particles by placing a high intensity hollow electron beam concentrically around the LHC beam. The gas jet monitor will use the fluorescence radiation resulting due to the beam-gas interaction to create an image of the profiles of both hollow electron and LHC beams However",

        "Low emittance electron beams are of high importance at facilities like the LCLS-II at SLAC. Emittance dilution effects due to off-axis beam transport for a TESLA-type cryomodule (CM) have been shown at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology facility. The results showed the correlation between the electron beam-induced cavity high-order modes (HOMs) and submacropulse centroid slewing and oscillation downstream of the CM. Mitigation of emittance dilution can be achieved by reducing the HOM signals and the variances in the submacropulse beam positions downstream of the CM. Here we present a Machine Learning based optimization and model construction for HOM signal level reduction using Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes. To gather training data we performed experiments using single bunch and 50 bunch electron beams with charges up to 125 pC/b. We measured HOM signals of all cavities and beam position with a set of BPMs downstream of the CM. The beam trajectory was changed using V/H125 corrector set located upstream of the CM. The results presented here will inform the LCLS-II injector commissioning and will serve as a prototype for HOM reduction and emittance preservation."

Cavity detuning can result in an increase of operational power and/or in a cavity quench. Such SRF cavities have bandwidths on the order of 10 Hz and detuning requirements can be as tight as 10 Hz. Passive methods to mitigate vibration sources and their impact in the cryomodule/cavity environment are widely used. Active resonance control techniques that use stepper motors and piezoelectric actuators to tune the cavity resonance frequency by compensating for microphonics detuning have been investigated. These control techniques could be further improved by applying Machine Learning (ML)",

Schlieren imaging is a well known technique used in aerodynamic studies to visualise gas flow. This technique is explained in the paper along with a gist of other flow visualisation techniques. An Z-type schlieren imaging setup used to view the high density flow features of a pulsed supersonic gas jet inside vacuum is described in detail. Flow around a Pitot probe in supersonic flow was simulated and the resultant density profile obtained was compared with the image obtained using schlieren imaging. The flow features including a detached shock around the tip of the probe was observable at medium and high vacuum after processing the image. Image processing algorithms and tools useful for this application are also discussed."

        "Two high energy beam transport (HEBT) cavities have been designed to provide the longitudinal beam bunching between drift tube linac and superconducting super-buncher of the superconducting linear (SC-LINAC) accelerator. The spiral type cavities were chosen over standard quarter wave-type geometry due to its higher shunt impedance. The TRACE-3D ion-optical codes have been used to determine the bunching voltage and physical location of the cavities. The two-gap RF cavity requires 80 kV/gap to provide the longitudinal beam bunching at the entrance of the superconducting buncher. The CST-MWS simulations were performed to design the spiral type bunching cavities. The various parameters including shunt impedance",

The ratio of drift tube radius to the gap was optimized to achieve the maximum effective electric field with minimum field penetration within the gap. The SolidWorks software has been used to prepare a mechanical model for the fabrication."

Acceleration of nanoparticles (NPs) via DC accelerators has been shown to be feasible in dust accelerator labs such as the Heidelberg dust accelerator and the 3 MV hypervelocity dust accelerator at the Colorado Center for Lunar Dust and Atmospheric Studies. In contrast",

The properties of multi-gap RF accelerators also allow an on-the-fly tradeoff between specific impulse and thrust."

        "CEA Paris-Saclay is responsible for the delivery of 30 cryomodules (9 medium beta (β = 0.67) and 21 high beta (β = 0.86) ones). Each cryomodule contains 4 elliptical cavities equipped with a radio frequency power coupler. The ESS nominal pulse is 1.1 MW maximum peak power over a width of 3.6 ms at a repetition rate of 14 Hz. The design of the couplers for medium beta and for high beta cavities is the same",
        "except a small difference of the antenna penetration to adjust the Qext. The mass production of the 120 couplers started and all the medium beta couplers have been conditioned at room temperature. The first cryomodules equipped with the power couplers were successfully tested at high RF power and with cavities at 2K reaching the ESS nominal pulse. The main issue at the start of the series production could be fixed and it was due to bad TiN coatings that caused abnormal dielectric losses in the window. Thus",
        "this paper deals with the TiN coating defect",
        "presents the conditioning procedure and gives a conditioning report of these 36 couplers."

Reaching this right frequency can be challenging due to the narrow frequency range defined by the tuning sensitivity of the cavity and the capability of the tuner. Mechanical deformation until plasticity is attained is of great interest to tune SRF cavities when large frequency shift is needed. But once a cavity is dressed with its helium tank",

An original mechanical tuning of Spoke dressed cavities consists in increasing the pressure inside the helium tank to induce a permanent deformation of the cavity walls. The frequency shift induced by nonlinear deformation is numerically evaluated in order to determine the pressure increments. Both methods were successfully performed on the cavities of the ESS accelerator and of the Myrrha project."

The field onset of flux penetration into a superconductor is an important parameter of merit of alternative superconducting materials other than Nb which can enhance the performance of SRF cavities. There is a need for a simple and efficient technique to measure the onset of field penetration into a superconductor directly. We have developed a Hall probe experimental setup for the measurement of the flux penetration field through a superconducting sample placed under a small superconducting solenoid magnet which can generate magnetic fields up to 500 mT. The system has been calibrated and used to measure different bulk and thin film superconducting materials. This system can also be used to study SIS multilayer coatings that have been proposed to enhance the vortex penetration field in Nb cavities."

A novel concept using fixed field alternating gradient (FFA) optics enables a large energy acceptance (LEA) as beams of varying energies can traverse the beamline at multiple physical positions given the same magnetic field. This presents the potential to provide faster",
