      "abstract": "VEPP-2000 electron-positron collider operating in the beam energy range of 150-1000 MeV is the only machine originally designed for and successfully exploiting Round Beams Concept. After injection chain upgrade including link to the new BINP injection complex VEPP-2000 proceeded with data taking since 2017 with luminosity limited only by beam-beam effects. At the low energies (300-600 MeV/beam) the novel technique of effective emittance controlled increase by weak coherent beam shaking allowed to suppress the limiting flip-flop effect and resulted in additional luminosity gain factor of 4. The averaged delivered luminosity at the omega-meson production energy (2*391 MeV) achieved L = 2*1031cm-2s−1/IP. At the top energies above nucleon-antinucleon production threshold the stable operation with luminosity of L = 5*1031cm-2s−1/IP resulted in high average data taking rate of 2 pb-1/day in 2020. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The misalignment of solenoids not only provides closed orbit distortions but also harmful for dynamic aperture reduction due to strong nonlinear fringe fields.

This represents a superb solution fulfilling all cancer treatment requirements for all energies without changing any parameters. The proton energy range is between 60-250 MeV. The beam arrives to the patient focused at each required treatment energy. The scanning system is place between the end of the gantry and the patient. There are multiple advantages of this design: easy operation",

It consists of three dipole magnets with laminated yokes made of 0.1-mm-thick permalloy sheets and the coil currents of the three magnets are independently controlled by three power supplies with the maximum current of 10 A. The maximum closed orbit bump made by the chicane magnetic field has the longitudinal dispersion(R56) of -6 mm. The coil-current ratio of the three dipole magnets was tuned after installation to make its orbit bumps closed and then the chicane magnet was used in the FEL operation.

Recently KEK has launched an infrared FEL project with a competitive funding. The purpose of this project is to build a mid-infrared FEL at the cERL, and to use that FEL as a light source for construction of the processing database required for industrial lasers. The FEL system is composed of two 3-m undulators and a matching section between them, and generates light with a maximum pulse energy of 0.1 micro-J at the wavelength of 20 microns with an 81.25 MHz repetition rate. The FEL is also expected to become a proof-of-concept machine for ERL base FELs for future EUV lithography."

It has recently been experimentally demonstrated and currently many facilities worldwide intend to incorporate it in user operation. The EEHG process relies on very accurate and complex transformations of electron beam phase space by means of a series of undulators coupled to lasers and dispersive chicanes. As a result of the phase space manipulation",

Each module is made up of a group of 4 TW sections assembled on a single girder and fed by one klystron by means of one rf pulse compressor system and a low attenuation circular waveguide network that transports the rf power to the input hybrids of the sections. The pulse compressor is based on a single Barrel Open Cavity (BOC). The BOC use a ’whispering gallery’ mode which has an intrinsically high quality factor and operates in a resonant rotating wave regime. Compared to the conventional SLED scheme it requires a single cavity instead of two cavities and a 3-dB hybrid. A new brazeless mechanical design has been proposed and is described in the present paper together with the electro-magnetic and thermo-mechanical simulations."

Here we present a novel way of using the overlap of laser and beam radial fields to locally liberate electrons from the tunneling ionization of the non-ionized gas species. These liberated ultracold electrons gain sufficient energy to be trapped in the accelerating phase at the back of the plasma blowout. This method of controlled injection has advantages in precision timing since injection is locked to peak beam current and has the potential of generating beams with very low emittance and energy spread. This method has been investigated using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. This scenario corresponds to a planned experiment",

The EU-funded InnovaTron project aims at designing an innovative compact high-intensity self-extracting cyclotron able to deliver proton beams with currents up to 5 mA or more for the direct production of Tc-99m. It could be also used for production of high quantities of other frontier medical radioisotopes. The proton beams exit without using an electrostatic deflector to overcome its current limitations. A prototype cyclotron was built by IBA in 2001. Currents up to 2 mA were extracted from it. However",

More than 99% of negative hydrogen ions complete the charge stripper in the primary stripper foil during the injection process. The remaining ions will lead to the in-dump after the secondary foil or absorbed by the negative hydrogen scraper.

        "The Proton Power Upgrade Project at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will double the proton power capability from 1.4 to 2.8 MW. This will be accomplished through an energy increase from 1.0 to 1.3 GeV and a beam current increase from 26 to 38 mA. The energy increase will be accomplished through the addition of 7 cryomodules to the linear accelerator (Linac). The beam current increase will be supported by upgrading several radio-frequency systems in the normal-conducting section of the Linac. Upgrades to the accumulator ring injection and extraction regions will accommodate the increase in beam energy. A new 2-MW-capable target and supporting systems will be developed and installed. Conventional facility upgrades include build-out of the existing klystron gallery and construction of a tunnel stub to facilitate future beam transport to the second target station. The project received approval to proceed with construction in October 2020. Procurements are in progress, and some installation activities have already occurred. Most of the installation will take place during three outages in 2022-2023. The project early finish is planned for 2025."

Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) is an attractive candidate for FPNS project. Accelerator Facility was designed and operated for an extended period as a 0.8-MW Meson Factory. Existing setup of the LANSCE accelerator complex can nearly fulfill requirements of the fusion neutron source station. The primary function of the upgraded accelerator systems is the safe and reliable delivery of a 1.25-mA continuous proton beam current at 800-MeV beam energy from the switchyard to the target assembly to create 1 MW power of proton beam interacting with a solid tungsten target. The present study describes existing accelerator setup and further development required to meet the needs of FPNS project."

The mu-e conversion violates the lepton flavor universality and its discovery indicates a proof of the physics beyond the standard model of the particle physics. The experiment utilizes a high-intensity primary proton-beam of J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex). The proton beam is injected to a target about 700mm long to generate a high intensity muon beam so as to accumulate huge statistics and achieve the final goal of a sensitivity of 10-16. Construction of the experimental facility is underway at a high pace towards an engineering run in 2022 and the first physics run in 2023. In this presentation",

        "The interest in controlling emittance dilution effects due to off-axis beam transport in accelerator cavities and the resulting dipolar modes is especially important for the facilities with lower emittance beams. The Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility has a unique configuration of two single cavities after the photocathode rf gun followed by a cryomodule. The second capture cavity (CC2) was run 15 kHz off resonance and without rf power while a 25-MeV beam was injected into it. The beam centroid effects were tracked by 10 rf button BPMs with bunch-by-bunch position readout capability downstream in a 12-m drift. Possible LRW effects seemed to dominate our previously observed near-resonant HOM effects at mode 14 in this cavity. This mode also shifted in frequency compared to that of the tuned case based on direct measurements. Submacropulse vertical position slewing of 1400 microns at 11 m downstream was observed with a 125 pC/bunch",
        "50 bunches per macropulse",

We now have extended our investigations to short-range wakefields (SRWs) in these cavities. The latter result in submicropulse effects where the transverse wakefields cause head-tail centroid shifts. We used a Hamamatsu C5680 UV-visible synchroscan streak camera to synchronously sum the OTR from each of the 50 micropulses in the macropulse. We generated the y-t effect in the 41-MeV beam by purposely steering the beam off axis in y at the entrance of the first capture cavity. The head-tail transverse kicks within the 11-ps-long micropulses of 500 pC each were observed at the 100-micron level for steering off-axis in one cavity and several 100 microns for two cavities. These SRW results will be compared to simulations from the ASTRA model of a single micropulse in FAST. Since the SRW kicks go inversely with energy",

This improvement can be achieved by an upgrade of the existing digital MicroTCA.4-based LLRF control scheme by beam-based feedback.

Acceleration in the first section up to 185.5 MeV is done with a room temperature copper linac which consists of both Drift Tube Linac (DTL) and Coupled Cavity Linac (CCL) Radio Frequency (RF) cavities. The second section consists of 81 Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities which accelerate the beam to the final beam energy of 1 GeV. The linac is currently capable of delivering an average beam power output of 1.44 MW with typical yearly operating hours of around 4500 hours.

Nb3Sn is one of the most competitive candidates, since it increases the superheating field, allows the operation temperature up to 4K, and improves cavity efficiency. Surface roughness and grain boundaries, however, significantly affect the RF performance of current Nb3Sn cavities. Here, we explore a post laser annealing technique to reduce the surface roughness. In doing so, we deposited a TiN laser-absorber on Nb3Sn and Nb surfaces, and then annealed the samples by laser scanning via different laser systems. The Nb3Sn surface roughness was minimized to 101 nm (Ra) by laser annealing via 308 nm, 35 ns pulses. Surface imaging and Fourier analysis revealed laser annealing is able to remove sharp edges and <1 um wavelength features. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "Following successful prototyping and testing of single- & 5-cell LSF shape cavities *, **, the first 9-cell LSF shape cavity LSF9-1 was successfully constructed using an innovative process at JLab with the in-house facilities. The cavity was then shipped to KEK for post-fabrication mechanical adjustment and ILC TDR style treatment and surface processing. Cold testing was carried out at the JLab VTA facility, instrumented with a suite of Kyoto instruments. Favorable values for the bath pressure detuning sensitivity and Lorentz force detuning coefficient were experimentally measured, validating the design improvement in cell stiffeners. Pass-band measurements indicate 4 out of 9 cells reaching gradient capability of > 45 MV/m, including 2 cells reaching 51 MV/m. Cornell OST detectors identified the cell and location responsible for the current hard quench limit. Multipacting-like barriers observed in end cells are investigated both analytically and numerically. The cavity was shipped to FNAL and received a light EP at the joint ANL/FNAL facility for further cold testing at Jlab. Two new 9-cell LSF cavities are being constructed including one made of large-grain niobium material."

Highly modular yet compact are desired. A total number of 112 amplifier modules of 3 kW each are combined in a multi-stage power combining topology. The final output is of 9-3/16\" 50 Ω coaxial rigid line. Each amplifier module consists of 3 LDMOS transistors with individual circulator and load. Thermal simulations of the amplifier module have been conducted to optimize cooling capabilities for both travelling-wave and full-reflection operation scenarios. High efficiency",
        "sufficient redundancy and excellent RF performances of the 260-kW system are demonstrated. A control system is also integrated and EPICS is used to manage the monitored data. The design and test results of the amplifier system are presented in this paper."

We have studied the use of high-temperature superconducting coated conductors as possible coating materials for the beam screen of the FCC-hh. In addition",
        "amorphous carbon coating and laser-based surface treatment techniques are effective surface treatments to lower the secondary electron yield and minimise the electron cloud build-up. We have developed and adapted different experimental setups based on resonating structures at frequencies below 10 GHz to study the response of these coatings and their modified surfaces under the influence of RF fields and DC magnetic fields up to 9 T. Taking the FCC-hh as a reference",
        "we will show that the surface resistance for REBCO-CCs is much lower than that of Cu. Further we show that the additional surface modifications can be optimised to minimise their impact on the surface impedance. Results from selected coatings will be presented."

This work presents a framework of FLUKA and Geant4 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the Adaptix system including the X-ray beam generation and the final image quality. The results show that MC methods offer an insight into the performance details of such an innovative device at different levels between the X-ray emitter array and the detector. As such",
        "a large portion of the design and optimisation of such novel X-ray imaging systems can be done with a single toolkit. Finally",
        "the modularity of the approach allows other tools to be imported at various steps within the framework and thus provide answers to questions that cannot be addressed by general-purpose MC codes."

        "a low-pressure design beam superimposed windows (250 µm Mylar and 150 µm polyethylene) for the Threshold Cherenkov counters (XCET) has been modelled and verified for its implementation. The XCET is a detector used to count the number of selected charged particles in the beam by adjusting the pressure that leads to the emission of Cherenkov photons only above certain pressure threshold. Simultaneously",
        "the charged particles pass from a vacuum environment to the pressurized refractive gas vessel through a solid interface. Minimal material in this solid interface is therefore crucial to avoid interactions of the low-energy particles which may lead to beam intensity loss or background production. Hence",
        "thin and low-density materials are required to mitigate multiple scattering and energy loss of the incoming particles while still allowing the needed pressures inside the counter vessel. A XCET validation methodology was conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA)",
        "followed by experimental validations performing burst pressure tests and using Digital Image Correlation (DIC)."
