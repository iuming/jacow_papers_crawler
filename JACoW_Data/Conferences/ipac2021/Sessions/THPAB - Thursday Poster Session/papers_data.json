        "Solaris storage ring is currently operating with three insertion devices. The IDs installed are the APPLE II type elliptically polarised undulators (EPU). The UARPES beamline is operating with the long period length EPU of 120 mm (EPU120) which has a significant impact on the linear optics and tune shift. The linear optics compensation of the EPU120 impact is realised by local adjustment of SQFO quadrupole/sextupole focusing gradient and defocusing gradient in the flanking dipoles. Two additional EPUs with period lengths of 58 and 46.6 mm are recently installed for next beamlines PHELIX and DEMETER",
        "respectively and are under commissioning now. To reduce the impact of all undulators movement the additional correction coils are installed and the correction feedforward tables has been determined experimentally. Additionally to keep the tune at the nominal values the tune feedback is planned to be implemented. Within this presentation the effect of all existing insertion devices on the linear optics based on measurements and simulations to be discussed. Moreover the nonlinear effects",
        "especially the impact on dynamic aperture of Solaris storage ring will be investigated."

The extremely short bunch lengths (few fs) and narrow undulator gaps (4 mm) drastically increase the impact of resistive wall wakefields on the lasing process. The longitudinal resistive wall wakefield impedance is calculated in the framework of the surface impedance approach",
        "in accordance with anomalous skin effect (ASE) theory. The dependence of the electron energy loss factor and the correlated energy spread of the bunch on the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) for both copper and aluminum is much higher for long (100 fs) than for ultra-short (6 fs) bunches. This is due to a known property of the longitudinal wakefield impedance - the field acting on a single particle traversing a resistive vessel does not depend on the conductivity of the vessel. The wakefields generated by the ultra-short bunch are already close to that of a single-particle regime and this leads to interesting consequences which are discussed in the present work."

The enlarged aperture accommodates a non-evaporable getter (NEG)-coated stored beam chamber to better achieve the required vacuum. A prototype septum magnet has been built and measurements confirm the cancellation of a peak leakage field even though the value is six times larger than the design. The leakage field measured at the upstream (US) end cancels the downstream (DS) end as was expected by design. The measured and simulated leakage field and the stored beam trajectories are reported."

Such undulators would have a low K value a priori limiting their photon energy tunability. Considering integration of separate magnetic arrays of distinct periods in a solenoid to compose a global assembly can help suppress this possible drawback. Magnetic design and radiative performance of such an insertion device are presented."

Well-established electron beam-based procedures allow finding a straight trajectory for the electrons defined by the beam position monitors (BPM) between the undulators. A bending of the trajectory in between the BPMs cannot be seen by these methods. A general field offset inside the undulators has the effect that the synchrotron radiation is emitted at a different angle at the beginning and the end of the undulator which can result in a degradation of the FEL-gain especially for very short wavelengths. We report on how the spectral and spatial characteristics of the monochromatized radiation of a single undulator can be used to minimize the field offset in situ with the help of correction coils."

        "an ERL test facility to be based at IJCLab in France. Previous simulations have shown that the baseline DC gun based injector can achieve the required emittance at the booster linac exit. The quality of the 500 pC bunches must then be preserved with space charge through the merger at total beam energy of 7 MeV keeping the emittance below 6 mm mrad. The beam dynamics in the merger were simulated using the code OPAL and optimised using a genetic algorithm. Three possible merger schemes were investigated. The goal of the optimisation was to minimise the emittance growth while also achieving the required Twiss parameters to match onto the spreader at the main linac exit. A three dipole solution is then examined in more detail."

It has been realized that ionization cooling inherently produces a plasma of free electrons inside the absorber material",

One of the major challenges in producing magnetized beams is fine-tuning the longitudinal magnetic field on the cathode surface and maintaining the desired field uniformity over the emission area. In this paper",

        "we pursue an idea to directly measure the voltage of the electrode gap by utilizing the fact that dark current electrons accelerated in the gap of the electrostatic extraction septum generate Bremsstrahlung X-rays when hitting the anode. The high-energy cut-off of the X-ray spectra then corresponds to the voltage of the electrode gap. Measurements of the X-ray spectra at the extraction septum of SIS18 have been performed using a solid-state CdTe detector. This technique provides an in-situ measurement of the voltage applied to the electrostatic extraction channel and has proven to be a useful diagnostics tool."

        "The ORBIT code has been widely used for beam dynamics simulations including injection and acceleration in high-intensity hadron synchrotrons. When the ORBIT’s 1D longitudinal tracking was employed for the acceleration process in CSNS/RCS",
        "the longitudinal emittance in eV-s was found decreasing substantially during acceleration",
        "though the adiabatic condition is still met during this process. This is against the Liouville theorem that predicts the preservation of the emittance during acceleration. The recent machine study in the accelerator and the simulations with a self-made code demonstrate that the longitudinal emittance is almost invariant",
        "which further indicates that the ORBIT longitudinal tracking might be incorrect. A detailed check-over in the ORBIT code source finds that the longitudinal finite difference equation used in the code is erroneous when applied to an acceleration process. The new code format PyORBIT has the same problem. After the small secondary factor is included in the code",
        "ORBIT can produce results keeping the longitudinal emittance invariant. This paper presents some details about the study."

Recent development in CeC cooling theory requires the accelerator to deliver high-quality electron bunches with low beam noise. In this paper",

        "Pulse generators with multi kV/kA pulses are necessary for the particle accelerator environment for beam transfer magnets. Traditionally these generators are using thyratrons - until recently the only switches capable of switching such pulses within tens of ns. There is a strong demand to replace thyratrons with semiconductor switches to avoid their future obsolescence. Very promising candidates are components from the family of fast ionization dynistors triggered by impact ionization. Their sub-nanosecond switching time and extreme current densities can provide performances superior to that of thyratrons. Recent investigations showed that impact ionization triggering is feasible also in cheap industrial thyristors. The main issue is the generation of triggering pulses with slew rates in the multi kV/ns region and with the required output current for charging the parasitic capacitance of the thyristor. We present an approach of generating > 1 kV/ns pulses by ultra-boosted gate driving of HV SiC MOS transistors. We found that the MOS lifetime under these extreme triggering conditions can still reach more than 108 pulses",

In the process of doing so it will: 1. generate electricity in a cost-competitive manner, 2. significantly reduce the waste-stream volume per Gigawatt-hour generated, 3. greatly reduce the radio-toxic lifetime of the waste stream. As many states and countries now prohibit licensing of new nuclear plants until a national strategy has been established for the long-term disposal of their nuclear waste, Mu*STAR can be an important enabler for new nuclear facilities. This is especially important in the light of climate change, as nuclear energy is the only carbon-free technology for a base-load generation that is readily expandable.",
