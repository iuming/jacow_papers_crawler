        "most works have been done using analytic formulae with simple numerical estimation. They are still in the basis of designs. The extraordinary title of the this was given by the organizers. I would like to select a few of such formulae and explain the history.",

        "The particle accelerator and materials research communities have long enjoyed a synergistic relationship",
        "dating back at least to the first studies of materials using synchrotron radiation produced at particle accelerators. At present a new generation of advanced synchrotrons and x-ray free electron lasers are emerging. These advances are coincident with a push in materials research to understand phenomena at unprecedented length and time scales",
        "including a focus on the mesoscale properties of materials. Further",
        "photons are not the only accelerator-produced particle of interest to materials research",
        "both as a probe and as a means of generating perturbed states of matter. This presentation will not only reprise recent progress but also speculate about future opportunities.",
