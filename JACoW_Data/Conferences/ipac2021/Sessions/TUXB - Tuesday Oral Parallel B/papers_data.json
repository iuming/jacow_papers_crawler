        "Efficient acceleration and manipulation of high-brightness electron beams using terahertz waves in a compact setup has been recently a hot research topic in acceleration community. Previous works have achieved multi-MV/m acceleration gradient and dozens of keV energy gain while leaving room for further improvements in the high-energy regime. Here",
        "we experimentally demonstrate whole-bunch acceleration and cascaded terahertz-driven acceleration of a relativistic beam with a record energy gain of 204 keV. A terahertz-driven all-optical electron source is now under development",
        "which hold great potential for terahertz-driven ultrafast electron diffraction and related scientific discoveries."

        "Plasma-wakefield accelerators driven by intense particle beams promise to significantly reduce the size of future high-energy facilities. These applications require an energy-efficient acceleration process with a well-controlled energy spectrum",
        "both of which can be achieved simultaneously by tailoring the plasma wakefield. A prerequisite for such control of the wakefield is its precise measurement. Here we discuss a new measurement technique that enables femtosecond-level sampling of the longitudinal electric fields and that is particularly powerful due to its operational simplicity*. Using this method",
        "we experimentally demonstrated optimal beam loading in a nonlinear electron-driven plasma accelerator by wakefield flattening at the few-percent level**. Bunches were accelerated at a gradient of 1.3 GV/m and with an energy-transfer efficiency of (42±4)% while preserving per-mille energy spreads with full charge coupling. These results open the door to the high-quality operation of future plasma accelerators through precise control of the acceleration process.",

It is designed to produce 360 keV electrons with 500 kW of input power supplied by a 110 GHz gyrotron. Multiple gun structures were electroformed in copper using a high precision diamond-turned mandrel. The field emission cathode is a rounded copper tip located in the first cell. The cavity resonances were mechanically tuned using azimuthal compression.

        "There is a strong need for intense positron sources for future colliders. A crystal-based hybrid positron source could be an alternative to conventional sources based on the e- conversion into e+ in a thick target. The basic idea of the hybrid source is to split the e+ converter into a gamma-quanta radiator plus a gamma-to-positron converter*. In such a scheme an e- beam crosses a thin axially oriented crystal with emission of \"channeling radiation\"",
        "characterized by a considerably larger amount of photons w.r.t. standard bremsstrahlung**. The net result is an increase in the number of e+ produced at the converter target. In the hybrid scheme",

This is a factor of 4 higher than the current state-of-the-art for cyclotrons and a factor of 10 compared to what is commercially available. All areas of physics that call for high cw currents can greatly benefit from this result; e.g. particle physics",
