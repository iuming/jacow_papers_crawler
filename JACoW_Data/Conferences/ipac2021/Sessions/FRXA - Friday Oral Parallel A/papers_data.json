        "The beam injector for the SPring-8 storage ring (SR) was switched from the booster synchrotron to the SACLA linac",
        "a driver for X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). The low-emittance beam from SACLA (~100 pm rad",
        "8 GeV) is delivered to the SR through a 600m-long beam transport line. This low-emittance beam can be applied to the new low-emittance storage ring after the SPring-8 upgrade planed in the coming years. The shutdown of the booster synchrotron and 1-GeV linac saves energy consumption and operation cost. To provide the electron beam injected to the SR on demand for the top-up injection during the XFEL operation",
        "the SACLA linac must be synchronized to the desired bucket of the SR",
        "the beam energy and route must be switched shot-to-shot",
        "and the XFEL performance must not be degraded. We developed a precise synchronization system",
        "on-demand beam route and parameter switching system",
        "a pulsed magnet for the switchyard",
        "isolated bunch purification system",
        "etc. In this presentation",
        "we will show the design and performance of each component for the beam injection and the results from beam commissioning of the accelerator and transport line."
