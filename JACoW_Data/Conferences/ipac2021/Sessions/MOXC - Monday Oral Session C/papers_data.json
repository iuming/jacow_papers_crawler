        "such as FCC-ee in Europe and CEPC in China",
        "will rely on the crab waist collision scheme with a large Piwinski angle. Differently from the past generation colliders both luminosity and beam-beam tune shifts depend on the bunch length in such a collision scheme. In addition",
        "for the future circular colliders with extreme beam parameters in collision several new effects become important such as beamstrahlung",
        "coherent X-Z instability and 3D flip-flop. For all these effects the longitudinal beam dynamics plays an essential role and should be taken into account for the collider luminosity optimization. In this paper we discuss an impact of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance on the collider performance."

      "abstract": "Highly spin polarized electron beams are required for the operation of a wide range of accelerators and instruments. The production of such electrons requires the use of Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) activated GaAs-based cathodes operated in photoelectron guns. Because of their extreme sensitivity to poor vacuum conditions the degradation of the photoemission process is so strong that NEA activated GaAs-based photocathodes can only survive in the extreme vacuums typical of DC gun. State-of-the-art on photocathode technology for spin polarized beam productions are summarized. Recent results on the use of robust NEA coating based on the Cs-Te and Cs-Sb leading to improved operational lifetime of a high spin polarization photocathode are reviewed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "they have to provide near to interstellar conditions such as an ultrahigh vacuum of or less than 1E-14 mbar and cryogenically cooled environments for the stored particles. This allows extremely long observation periods to investigate quantum state properties and opens up completely new insights in different fields of physics. The electrostatic cryogenic storage ring CSR at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg was conceived",
