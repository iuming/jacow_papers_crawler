        "is necessary for the radiation from different electrons to add in phase and therefore cohere. Recently at the MLS it has been shown that in dedicated isochronous optics an electron beam energy modulation induced by an externally applied 1064-nm-wavelength laser in an undulator leads to the formation of sub-um microbunches one turn later*",

The first of its kind practical realization of a two-dimensional integrable system in a strongly-focusing storage ring was demonstrated allowing among other things for stable beam circulation near or at the integer resonance. Also presented will be the highlights of the world’s first demonstration of optical stochastic beam cooling and other selected results of IOTA’s broad experimental program."
