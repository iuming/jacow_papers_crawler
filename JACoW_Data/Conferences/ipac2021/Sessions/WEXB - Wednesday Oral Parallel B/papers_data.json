      "abstract": "CEA in Kind contribution to the ESS superconducting LINAC includes 30 elliptical medium and high-beta cryomodules. CEA is in charge of the production of all the components (except the cavities delivered by LASA and STFC) as well as the assembly of the cryomodules and a few cryogenic and RF tests. The power couplers operating at a maximum power of 1.1MW on a 3.6ms pulse at 14Hz are conditioned at high RF power on a dedicated stand. The assembly of the cryomodules is performed at CEA by a private Company under the supervision of CEA. This paper presents the status of the cryomodules production and the infrastructure dedicated to this project at CEA Saclay. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

It accelerates muons from 0.34 MeV to 4.3 MeV at an operating frequency of 324 MHz. The cavity can be miniaturized by introducing the alternative phase focusing (APF) method that enables transverse focusing only with an E-field. The APF IH-DTL cavity was modeled by a three-dimensional field analysis",

        "the field error due to the fabrication errors and thermal expansion during operation causes an emittance growth. It was evaluated that the optimized tuners can suppress the emittance growth to less than 10%. In this paper",
        "the detailed design of the APF IH-DTL including the tuner will be reported."
