        "the ESRF-EBS. This storage ring is the first to implement the Hybrid Multi-Bend Achromat lattice (HMBA). The HMBA lattice provides a reduction of the horizontal emittance of approximately a factor 30 with respect to the former Double Bend Achromat (DBA) structure",
        "considerably improving the brilliance and transverse coherence of the ESRF accelerator complex while maintaining large horizontal acceptance and excellent lifetime performance. In this report",
        "the characteristics of the HMBA lattice will be reviewed and the beam commissioning results and first operation experience of the new ESRF storage ring will be presented."

        "an increase in spectral brightness of two to three orders of magnitude in the 10-100 keV X-ray energy range will be realized. The project includes nine new high performance beamlines and fifteen enhanced beam-lines that will exploit the high brightness and coher-ence of the new facility. The project is in full swing",
        "more than 50% complete by cost",
        "and is on schedule for first beam sometime in mid-2024",
        "a slip of 10 months from the original schedule due to the impact of COVID-19. Project status",
        "challenges and outstanding issues will be discussed in this article."
