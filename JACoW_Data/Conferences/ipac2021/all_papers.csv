Formation of bunches or sub-bunches shorter than the radiation wavelength; i.e.; microbunching; is necessary for the radiation from different electrons to add in phase and therefore cohere. Recently at the MLS it has been shown that in dedicated isochronous optics an electron beam energy modulation induced by an externally applied 1064-nm-wavelength laser in an undulator leads to the formation of sub-um microbunches one turn later*; providing the basis for the implementation of steady-state microbunching in electron storage rings to generate high-repetition; high-power coherent radiation.

Differently from the past generation colliders both luminosity and beam-beam tune shifts depend on the bunch length in such a collision scheme. In addition; for the future circular colliders with extreme beam parameters in collision several new effects become important such as beamstrahlung; coherent X-Z instability and 3D flip-flop. For all these effects the longitudinal beam dynamics plays an essential role and should be taken into account for the collider luminosity optimization. In this paper we discuss an impact of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance on the collider performance.,"Funding: This work is supported by National Key Programme for S&T Research and Development, China (Grant No. 2016YFA0400400), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11775238, No. 11775239).",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/moxc01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/moxc01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/moxc01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOXC01,25
ipac2021,,MOXC02,Improved Lifetime of a High Spin Polarization Superlattice Photocathode,BNL; Upton; New York; USA,,Highly spin polarized electron beams are required for the operation of a wide range of accelerators and instruments. The production of such electrons requires the use of Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) activated GaAs-based cathodes operated in photoelectron guns. Because of their extreme sensitivity to poor vacuum conditions the degradation of the photoemission process is so strong that NEA activated GaAs-based photocathodes can only survive in the extreme vacuums typical of DC gun. State-of-the-art on photocathode technology for spin polarized beam productions are summarized. Recent results on the use of robust NEA coating based on the Cs-Te and Cs-Sb leading to improved operational lifetime of a high spin polarization photocathode are reviewed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/moxc02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/moxc02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/moxc02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOXC02,31
ipac2021,,MOXC03,The Interstellar Space in an Electrostatic Cryogenic Storage Ring,MPI-K; Heidelberg; Germany; Traditionally; particle accelerators have been built to provide increasingly high energies and intensities to reproduce the very first moments of our Universe after the Big Bang to investigate for example the formation of the building blocks of matter. In the last decade; however; the interest also focuses on the formation and dynamics of molecules in the early and today’s Universe; which places completely different demands on particle accelerators. High energies are not needed. Instead; they have to provide near to interstellar conditions such as an ultrahigh vacuum of or less than 1E-14 mbar and cryogenically cooled environments for the stored particles. This allows extremely long observation periods to investigate quantum state properties and opens up completely new insights in different fields of physics. The electrostatic cryogenic storage ring CSR at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg was conceived; designed and constructed to achieve these goals and is successfully in operation since 2015. This talk will sum up motivation; design; construction and first results obtained with the CSR; a worldwide unique machine with great new opportunities.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/moxc03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/moxc03.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/moxc03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOXC03,

In particular; we present an empirical analysis of halo losses in IR6 using LHC Run 2 (2015-2018) beam loss monitor measurements.

Another constraint is the contribution to the ring impedance of the collimation system; which can be decreased through an optimized insertion optics; featuring large values of the beta functions. In this article we report on first studies of such an optics for the CERN LHC.

In the LHC Run 2; local linear coupling in the Interaction Regions (IR) has been proven to have a severe impact on beam size and hence the luminosity - up to a 50% decrease -; making its handling a target for Run 3 and High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). However; current measurement methods are not optimised for local IR coupling. In this contribution; an approach to accurately minimise IR local coupling based on correlated external variables such as the |C-| is proposed.

As such; it implies a complete redesign of the experimental high-luminosity insertions of ATLAS and CMS. The progressive evolution of the new layout and optics requires a continuous analysis of the radiation environment; to which magnets and other equipment are exposed to.

At high energy colliders with Siberian snakes; a single magnet spin flipper does not work because of the large spin tune spread and the generation of multiple; overlapping resonances. Over past decade; RHIC spin flipper design has evolved and a sophisticated spin flipper; constructed of nine-dipole magnets; was developed to flip the spin in RHIC.

The longitudinal emittance out of injectors needs to fit in the 28MHz cavities in RHIC. At two lower energies (4.6 and 3.85 GeV/c); the 9MHz RF cavities were used; which set different requirements from injectors. Extensive beam studies were carried out to establish needed beam parameters; such as bunch intensities and longitudinal emittances.

The existing injector complex will be reused with few modifications. However; the SLS booster synchrotron has not been studied since the initial commissioning in years 2000-2001. We plan to apply an emittance exchange in the booster to lower the horizontal emittance; which is a critial parameter for the injection. Here; we present improvements to the SLS booster as a preparation for SLS 2.0 upgrade project. The vertical beam size is decreased by 50\% by the use of vertical orbit correctors without beam position monitors; leading also to suppression of vertical dispersion and a factor 10 reduction of the transverse coupling coefficient. The emittance exchange reflected these improvements in the horizontal emittance; achieving a factor of 9-10 reduction. Lastly; a fast head-tail instability limiting the injection rate into the storage ring is discovered and subsequently suppressed by correcting the chromaticities.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab020_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB020,103

However; in the presence of dispersion the usage of regular quadrupole scans will lead to erroneous estimates of the beam parameters. The standard solution to this problem is to measure the dispersion and then subtract it in the post-analysis of the quadrupole scan measurements assuming the design energy spread. Here we show that the dispersive contribution to the beam size can be included in the quadrupole scan procedure; forming a linear system of equations that can be solved to obtain both the betatronic and dispersive beam parameters.

In case of a direct impact; the nominal beam of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) would penetrate more than 30 meters into a solid copper target. The penetration depth due to the time structure of the particle beam is; thus; significantly longer than predicted from purely static energy-deposition simulations with 7 TeV protons. This effect; known as hydrodynamic tunnelling; is caused by the beam-induced density depletion of the material at the target axis; which allows subsequent bunches to penetrate deeper into the target. Its proper simulation requires; therefore; to sequentially couple an energy-deposition code and a hydrodynamic code for the different target densities.

A new triggering circuit for the abort kickers was implemented with relatively slow mechanical relays in series with the standard fast thyratron tubes. The relays prevents unwanted pre-fires during operation; but comes at the expense of a long latency - about 7 milliseconds - between the removal of beam permit and the actual firing of the abort kickers. Protection considerations of RHIC’s superconducting magnets forbid delaying energy extraction from the main dipoles and quadrupoles for too long after a quench. The beam has thus to circulate in both RHIc rings for a few milliseconds as the current in dipole and quadrupole circuit is being extracted. We present the results of delayed abort experiments conducted in July 2018 with the analysis of fast orbit and tune measurements and discuss the safety implications of this implementation for future RHIC operation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab026_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab026.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab026_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB026,126

In order to obtain a good estimate of the luminosity evolution; it is imperative to have an accurate understanding of the burn-off. Typically; this is calculated based on the inelastic cross-section; as it provides a direct estimate of the number of protons that participate in inelastic collisions; and are hence removed. Likewise; protons that participate in elastic collisions will remain in the machine acceptance; still contributing to luminosity.

Recent developments of the SixTrack code allow it to interface with Pythia; thus allowing for more precise simulations to obtain a better estimate of the diffractive part of the cross-section.

Several analytical models used to describe the evolution of DA as a function of time; and to extrapolate to realistic time scales that would not be reachable otherwise due to computational limitations; have been successfully developed. Even though these models have been quite successful in the past; the fitting procedure is rather sensitive to several details. Machine Learning (ML) techniques; which have been around for decades and have matured into powerful tools ever since; carry the potential to address some of these challenges. In this paper; two applications of ML approaches are presented and discussed in detail. Firstly; ML has been used to efficiently detect outliers in the DA computations. Secondly; ML techniques have been applied to improve the fitting procedures of the DA models; thus improving their predictive power.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab028_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB028,134

Thus; a significant reduction of the center-of-mass energy spread would open up great opportunities in the search for new physics in rare decays of narrow resonances; the search for new narrow states with small partial e+e− width. The existing monochromatization scheme is only suitable for head-on collisions; while e+e− colliders with crossing angles (the so-called Crab Waist collision scheme) can provide much higher luminosity. In this report; a new monochromatization method for colliders with a large crossing angle is discussed*. The contribution of the beam energy spread to the spread of the center-of-mass energy is canceled by introducing an appropriate energy-angle correlation at the interaction point; the relative RMS mass spread of about (3-5)10-6 seems possible. Limitations of the proposed method are also considered. This monochromatization scheme is very attractive for the Upsilon-meson region and below.; * V.I.Telnov; Monochromatization of e+e− colliders with a large crossing angle; arXiv:2008.13668,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB033,152

Roots of third order equation for three leading terms of momentum compaction factor and free energy independent term were derived in a form suitable for analytical estimations. Averaged quadratic terms of closed orbit distortions caused by misalignment of magnetic elements in a ring lead to orbit lengthening independent of particle energy deviation.

On the other hand; the energy change required by fitting with the amplitude tune dependence change is too large to be explained by the RF frequency change and the change of the sum of correctors in the period of the measurements. To explain this apparent contradiction; our analysis shows the long term storage ring circumference change can explain the apparent energy change. Our data indeed shows a seasonal change of the amplitude tune dependence over long term observation. This clearly also indicated a relation to long term closed orbit drift. Hence the current work indicates a new strategy to study how to use amplitude tune dependence as a guideline to analyze long term lattice parameter shifts and closed orbit drift; and improve the orbit and machine performance stability.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB039,175

Whilst an earlier design for a replacement based on TME cells was able to meet the target values of <30 nm.rad and <40 ps respectively [***; ****]; several technical constraints have led to a rethink of this solution. The revised booster lattice utilises a larger number of cells based on combined-function magnets with lower peak fields that still meets the emittance and bunch length goals. In addition; the new ring has been designed to have low impedance to maximise the extracted charge per shot.

Several collimators installed in the vacuum chamber will be used as beam dump in the storage ring operation. Preliminary simulations showed that the temperature rise caused by the beam power deposited on the collimators will far exceed the melting point of the collimator material. In order to cure this problem; special kickers are proposed to be installed in the ring to modulate the beam during beam dumping; thereby increasing the size of the beam hit on the collimators.

Because the maintenance of the leakage needed the total replacement of the magnet; the water circulation was stopped permanently; and accordingly; the light absorber was installed upstream in the storage ring to prevent the synchrotron light of the bending magnet from coming to the septum wall. This treatment temporally worked well; but the beam injection efficiency was decreased to about 30% due to the physical aperture narrowed by the absorber. With the desired replacement of septum magnet to maintainable out-vacuum type; the injection section upgrading was simultaneously planned to recover and improve the injection efficiency.

The ultra-short; nearly single-spike; SASE pulse is amplified to saturation; where a four-crystal monochromator selects a narrow bandwidth seed for the second bunch.

In 2016 investigations of upgrading PETRA III into a diffraction limited storage ring at 10 keV have been started. The ambitious goal is to achieve an emittance in the range of 10-30 pm*rad. For the conceptual design report (CDR) of PETRA IV a lattice based on hybrid multi-bend achromats (HMBA) has been chosen. It consists of eight arcs connected by eight long straight sections whereas each arc consists of eight HMBA cells. While this lattice variant has an advantage in terms of simplicity of magnet and girder design it is challenging in regards of multipole strengths and beam dynamic properties. However; only a part of all eight arcs will be used for undulator beamlines. This offers the possibility to choose a more relaxed optics design in the arcs without undulators while preserving the ultra-low emittance. In addition; the use of reverse bends in the undulator cells allows smaller beta functions at the undulators for an increased brilliance. The design and the beam dynamic properties of this combi lattice are discussed in this paper and compared to the lattice based on HMBA cells.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab109_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab109.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab109_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB109,399

Two 180 bending magnets have 2.7 T field strength; which provide broadband radiation in VUV and soft X-ray range. The injector is a 150 MeV microtron. The beam injection is made twice a day with a 5 hour interval. Although the accelerators are being operated stably; the large emittance of 400nm makes it difficult to compete with high brilliance light sources of new generations.

As such; APS-U will require on-axis injection. The injectors will need to supply full-current bunch replacement in the ring; therefore; the injected bunch charge will be up to five times higher than what is typical for APS. A program was conducted to measure the radiation dose above the injector transport line to the APS storage ring for both normal operation conditions and controlled loss scenarios. Standard survey meters were used to record the dose. A review of the dose data identified opportunities to minimize the potential dose under normal APS-U high charge operation and fault conditions; these include improving the supplemental shielding and adding engineered controls.

Current THz accelerators are limited by significant losses during transport of THz radiation from the generating nonlinear crystal to the electron acceleration structure. In addition; the spectral properties of high-field THz sources make it difficult to couple THz radiation into accelerating structures. Dielectric accelerator structures reduce these losses because THz radiation can be coupled laterally into the structure; as opposed to metallic structures where THz radiation must be coupled along the beam path.

While bulk crystals were predicted to offer unparalleled TV/m gradients that are at least two orders of magnitude higher than gaseous plasmas; crystal-based acceleration has not been realized in practice. We have developed the concept of nanoplasmonic crunch-in surface modes which utilizes the tunability of collective oscillations in nanomaterials to open up unprecedented tens of TV/m gradients. Particle beams interacting with nanomaterials that have vacuum-like core regions; experience minimal disruptive effects such as filamentation and collisions; while the beam-driven crunch-in modes sustain tens of TV/m gradients. Moreover; as the effective apertures for transverse and longitudinal crunch-in wakes are different; the limitation of traditional scaling of structure wakefields to smaller dimensions is significantly relaxed.

SWFA is a novel acceleration scheme in which high-charge electron bunches are passed through a power extractor structure to produce a high-intensity wakefield. This wakefield can then be used to accelerate a witness bunch in the same beamline or passed to a separate acceleration beamline. MIT’s approach uses a specialized metamaterial for the power extractor design. By using a metamaterial; we can overcome some of the challenges faced by other SWFA techniques. Here; we discuss the Stage 3 experiment. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 experiments successfully demonstrated the functionality of the metamaterial approach by generating high power RF pulses using the 65 MeV electron beam at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility.

ipac2021,,MOPAB178,"Systematic Effects Limiting the Sensitivity of ""Magic Energy"" Proton EDM Rings","C. Carli; M. Haj Tahar; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Proposals to measure a possible Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of protons in an electro-static storage ring are studied by a world-wide community. The machine is operated at the so-called ""magic energy"" to satisfy the ""frozen spin"" condition such that; without imperfections and with the well known magnetic moment of the particle; the spin is always oriented parallel to the direction of movement. The effect of a finite EDM is a build-up of a vertical spin component. Any effect; other than a finite EDM; leading as well to a build-up of a vertical spin limits the sensitivity of the experiment. Such ""systematic effects"" are caused by machine imperfections; such as magnetic fields inside the magnetic shield surrounding the ring; and misalignments of electro-static elements or of the RF cavity. Operation of the machine with counter-rotating beams helps mitigating some of the effects. The most dangerous effects are those; which cannot be disentangled from an EDM by combining measurements from both counter-rotating beams; such as an average residual radial magnetic field penetrating the magnetic shield or a combination of magnetic fields and misalignments of electric elements.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab178_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab178.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab178_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB178,602

An AC dipole has been installed in the AGS Booster to preserve polarization as helions are accelerated to |Ggamma|=10.5. Extraction from the AGS Booster at |Ggamma|=7.5 is possible but: would involve crossing an intrinsic resonance in the AGS; and would be the lowest rigidity beam injected into the AGS; and therefore experiences strong distortions of the optical functions because of the AGS two partial snakes. This lower rigidity would exacerbate the optical distortions from the snake; reducing the dynamic aperture. A comparison of the dynamic aperture of protons at Ggamma=4.5 to that of helions at |Ggamma|=7.5 and |Ggamma|=10.5 show that extraction at |Ggamma|=10.5 provides a larger dynamic aperture.

The slow extraction of particles from the synchrotron follows a third order resonance extraction scheme. Currently; for every change of extraction energy a new spill needs to be generated. Besides the beam-on time of the particle delivery; every spill is also comprised of non-delivery time components e.g. the multiturn injection; acceleration or magnet conditioning. For small tumor target volumes; this non-delivery time is the major contribution to the overall treatment time. A dedicated performance improvement project (supported with a grant from the state of lower Austria) was executed with the goal to reduce these non-delivery times without affecting important clinical beam parameters such as the beam size or penetration depth. The implemented reduction of the non-delivery time >50% could be achieved; resulting in beam-on time reductions for reference treatment plans between 25% (largest proton PTV) and 58% (smallest carbon PTV).

These lattice designs are optimised by evolving the networks over many iterations with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The final set of solutions represent the most effi- cient and feasible lattices which satisfy the design constraints. It is up to the lattice designer to choose a design that best suits the intended application. The automated algorithm presented here randomly samples from all possible lattice layouts and reaches the global optimum over many iterations. The requirements of an efficient extraction scheme in hadron therapy synchrotrons impose stringent constraints on the lat- tice optical functions.

Previously; rapid-cycling synchrotron (RCS) and Linac solutions were considered for this purpose. In this paper; we consider the Linac version that produces 8 GeV H− beam for injection into the Recycler Ring (RR) or Main Injector (MI). The Linac takes ~1 GeV beam from the PIP-II Linac and accelerates it to ~2 GeV in a cw SRF linac; followed by a ~2-8 GeV pulsed linac using 1300 MHz cryomodules. The linac components incorporate recent improvements in SRF technology. The linac configuration and beam dynamics requirements are presented. Injection options are discussed.

ipac2021,,MOPAB191,Method Development for Cavity Failure Compensation in a Superconducting Linac,LPSC; Grenoble Cedex; France; Reliability is a major challenge within the perspective of improving the performances and sustainability of MegaWatt class accelerators. To optimize the operational costs of such accelerators the availability requirements are becoming more and more challenging. These requirements are even more stringent in the case of Accelerator Driven systems (ADS). As an example; for the MYRRHA (Multipurpose Hybrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) ADS demonstrator; the actual availability limit is set to a maximum of 10 beam interruptions (longer than 3 seconds) over a 3-month operating cycle. For this purpose; the accelerator design is based on a redundant and fault-tolerant scheme to enable rapid mitigation of a cavity failure. The adopted strategy is to apply for local compensation: a failed cavity is compensated by several neighboring cavities. Beam dynamics studies and method developments to apply such a failure compensation scheme are here reviewed. First simulation results for superconducting linac retuning and potential future improvements will be discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab191_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab191.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab191_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB191,647

Now; the routine output beam power has been increased to 100kW. However; the horizontal bare orbit in the ring is large (15mm) and the number of correctors is small; which brings great challenges to the ramp-up of beam power. It is found that the bare orbit in AC mode is 3-4mm larger than that in DC mode. The reason is that the AC dipoles field error is larger than DC dipoles field error. Therefore; it is proposed to sort dipoles again according to the AC dipoles field error. In order to reduce the risk of beam commissioning; fewer magnets should to be moved to achieve smaller orbit. The best results of moving two to six magnets were calculated.

Edwards and L.C. Teng with the standard ICA approach; it is though possible to retrieve the mixing matrix; as the form of the original uncoupled motion is known. At the same time arises the possibility to recalculate the parameters of Edwards and Teng through a system of equations of the one turn map components. It can be shown as a proof of concept; that the parameters can be reconstructed up to high accuracy for a simulated; non-perturbed signal.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab215_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab215.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab215_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB215,711

The new pair of arcs would provide six or seven new beam passes; going through this magnet array; allowing the energy to be nearly doubled using the existing CEBAF SRF cavity system. One of the immediate accelerator design tasks is to develop a proof-of-principle FFA arc magnet lattice that would support simultaneous transport of 6-7 passes with energies spanning a factor of two. We also examine the possibility of using combined function magnets to configure a cascade; six-way beam split switchyard.

It provides the opportunity for precision physics experiments with a 1 mA c.w. electron beam in its initial phase. In this phase experiments with unpolarised; high density 1019 atoms cm2 gas jet targets are foreseen at the Mainz Gas Internal Target Experiment (MAGIX). To allow experiments with thin polarised gas targets with sufficiently high interaction rates in a later phase; the beam current has to be increased to up to 100 mA; which would pose significant challenges to the existing ERL machine. Thus; it is proposed here to use MESA in pulsed operation with a repetition rate of several kHz to fill a storage ring; providing a quasi c.w. beam current to a thin gas target. For this purpose; the existing optics need to be extended and adapted; a suitable injection and extraction scheme is necessary and beam target interaction must be investigated. First considerations on these topics are presented here.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab217_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab217.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab217_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB217,719

On experimental requirements; the beam must be stored in a compact storage orbit with a diameter of 66 cm; which is about 1/20th smaller than that of the previous experiment. To be realized; we adopt an unprecedented injection technique called the three-dimensional spiral injection scheme. In this scheme; the beam is injected from upward of the solenoidal storage magnet. The vertical beam motion along the solenoid axis is controlled by a few 100 ns pulse kicker. Once the beam is guided into the center fiducial storage volume; the muon beam is stored by the weak focusing magnetic field. Therefore; stable and accurate control of the pulse kicker is one of the major technical challenges to realize the ultra-precise measurement of the muon spin precession.

In this paper; based on the transfer matrix formalism and the CSR point-kick model; we report the detailed theoretical analysis and derive the condition for a triple-bend achromat with stable optics in which the first-order longitudinal dispersion (i.e.; R56) and the CSR-induced emittance growth can be eliminated. The derived condition suggests a new way of designing the bending magnet beamline that can be applied to the free-electron laser (FEL) spreader and energy recovery linac (ERL) recirculation loop.,"Funding: National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11922512), Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. Y201904), National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFA0401900)",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab245_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab245.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab245_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB245,786

The results showed the correlation between the electron beam-induced cavity high-order modes (HOMs) and submacropulse centroid slewing and oscillation downstream of the CM. Mitigation of emittance dilution can be achieved by reducing the HOM signals and the variances in the submacropulse beam positions downstream of the CM.

The world’s first near-field EO sampling monitor at an electron storage ring was developed and installed at the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator) and optimized to detect longitudinal bunch profiles. This experiment with other diagnostic techniques builds a distributed; synchronized sensor network to gain comprehensive data about the phase-space of electron bunches as well as the produced coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). These measurements facilitate studies of physical conditions to provide; at the end; intense and stable CSR in the THz range.

The EOSD technique allows single-shot; phase-sensitive measurements of the far-field radiation on a turn-by-turn basis at rates in the MHz range. Therefore; the resulting THz radiation from the dynamics of the bunch evolution; e.g. the microbunching; can be observed with high temporal resolution. This far-field setup is part of the distributed sensor network at KARA. Additionally to the information acquired from the near-field EOSD spectral decoding and the horizontal bunch profile monitor; it enables to monitor the longitudinal phase-space of the bunch.

The required devices are simple: several quadrupole magnets and a beam profile monitor. Beam sizes are measured from the beam profile monitor with different quadrupole settings to bring the beam through its waist and then fitted to a quadratic equation to determine the Twiss parameters. measured data from a quadrupole scan taking the beam through its waist is fitted to a quadratic equation and this allows determining the Twiss parameters. However; with increasing beam intensity; the transfer function becomes non-linear and this causes a deviation of the fitted emittance from its real value; making it no longer useful. In this contribution; a genetic algorithm is applied to find the optimum quadrupole scan fit in space-charge dominated electron beams. Results from simulations using different space charge levels are presented and scenarios identified where this method can be applied.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab295_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab295.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab295_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB295,935

The PPRE bunch is excited in the horizontal plane by a quasi-resonant incoherent perturbation to increase the emittance of this bunch**. Therefore; the synchrotron light of the PPRE bunch can be separated by collimation from the radiation of the main bunch train at dedicated beamlines for timing users. The properties of the PPRE bunch depend on the storage ring settings and on the excitation parameters. It is not trivial to distinguish between the wanted intrinsic bunch broadening and an additional position fluctuation of the PPRE bunch. Using the potential of the new diagnostics beamline with the possibility to observe an additional spatial dimension with a fast streak camera; we introduce a new method to study the properties of the PPRE bunch***. Applying a statistical analysis to a series of single-turn images enables distinguishing between horizontal orbit motion and the broadening of the bunch due to the excitation.

Usually; optimizing certain beam objectives comes at the expense of others. Additionally; there are many input parameters and a limited number of diagnostics. Therefore; accelerator tuning becomes a multi-objective optimization problem with a limited number of observations. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization was recently proposed as an efficient method to find the Pareto front for an online accelerator tuning problem with reduced number of observations. In order to experimentally test the multi-objective Bayesian optimization method; a novel accelerator diagnostic is being designed to measure multiple beam quality metrics of an electron beam at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility. Here; we present a design consisting in a pepper-pot mask; a dipole magnet and a scintillation screen; which allows a simultaneous measurement of the electron beam energy spread and vertical emittance.

The XSR diagnostic beamline; operational in the wavelength region of 0.05 - 0.15 nm; in Canadian Light Source (CLS) is qualified to measure the beam position with X-ray radiation. Using the corrector magnets in CLS lattice made of 12 identical double-bend achromats (DBA) cells; vertical iterations can be executed parallel to the beam’s original orbit. The outcomes of this experiment are: 1) the vertical beam positions that are monitored by BPMs; and 2) the X-ray image of the beam that is projected through the pinhole.

In supersonic gas jet based beam profile monitors; the high density jet flows through various differentially pumped skimmer stages before being shaped into a sheet. Schlieren imaging is a well known technique used in aerodynamic studies to visualise gas flow. This technique is explained in the paper along with a gist of other flow visualisation techniques. An Z-type schlieren imaging setup used to view the high density flow features of a pulsed supersonic gas jet inside vacuum is described in detail. Flow around a Pitot probe in supersonic flow was simulated and the resultant density profile obtained was compared with the image obtained using schlieren imaging. The flow features including a detached shock around the tip of the probe was observable at medium and high vacuum after processing the image.

The detection hardware is designed for use with the Tesla superconducting cavities of LCLS-II at SLAC** and is based on a prototype already in use at Fermilab. The HOM signal passes through a bandpass filter that is centered on several cavity dipole modes and a zero bias Schottky diode detects its magnitude. Direct comparisons were made between the FNAL chassis and the SLAC prototype for identical beam steering conditions. To support measurements with bunch charges as low as 10 pC; the SLAC detector has RF amplification between the bandpass filter and the diode detector.

This experiment uses a novel method using the low-emittance muon beam achieved by cooling and re-acceleration. In the muon linac consisting of four different accelerating cavities; the main cause of the emittance growth is the beam mismatch between the different cavities. Especially for the cavity in the low-beta section (ß=0.08-0.27); the longitudinal acceptance is narrow and beam mismatch has a significant impact. In order to perform beam matching in the low-beta cavity; a new beam monitor that can measure the low-emittance muon beam with high time resolution is required. Therefore; we developed a bunch width monitor (BWM) using a microchannel plate. The time resolution of the BWM was measured to be 40 picoseconds on the test bench using a picosecond pulse laser. It means that the BWM is possible to perform diagnosis with a phase accuracy of 1% for the acceleration phase of 324 MHz. We also evaluated factors that limit the current time resolution.

We show that: 1) given only these two 2D projections; their product is the analytic MENT solution to the 4D distribution; and 2) additional 2D projections provide information on inter-plane coupling in the MENT reconstruction of the 4D phase space which can be solved numerically. At the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS); laser wires in the high energy beam transport (HEBT) enable non-invasive two-slit type transverse phase space measurements. Laser wires play the role of the first slit whereas physical wires downstream of a drift act as the second slit. We reconstruct the 4D phase space in the HEBT using all four horizontal/vertical permutations of the two slits where: 1) the two configurations with parallel slits constitute ordinary 2D phase space measurements in either plane; and 2) the two configurations with perpendicular slits carry coupling information.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab326_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab326.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab326_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB326,

To generate the FEL; an electron bunch should be compressed along the longitudinal direction. The measurement of the bunch length is key to optimize the bunch compression. We plan to measure the bunch length by deflecting cavities in the burst mode. The deflecting cavities are required to be a time resolution of 33 fs in order to not only measure the bunch length but also resolve the structure inside the electron bunch. To achieve the requirement; we developed a c-band cavity whose RF input port is compact. The deflecting cavity is a single cell and normal conducting cavity. The deflection mode of the cavity is TM110. The 12 cavities will be located at the exit of undulators.

To manage this effect; we proposed a TBL compensation technique using a wide-band longitudinal kicker cavity*. In the future KEK-LS storage ring; for example; the kicker cavity should provide a compensation voltage of 50 kV with a -3dB bandwidth (BW) of about 5 MHz; as well as its higher-order modes (HOM) should be damped sufficiently. In this presentation; we report our conceptual design of the kicker cavity. We employed the single-mode (SM) cavity concept so that harmful HOMs are dumped by rf absorbers on the beam pipes. The distinctive feature of the SM cavity is its simple structure since it has no HOM damper on the cavity. Another feature is its low R/Q by which the TBL effect in the kicker cavity itself can be reduced significantly. We employed a frequency of 1.5 GHz (third-harmonic) and R/Q of 60 orms through optimizations. Using this kicker cavity with a double rf system; a bunch lengthening by a factor of 4.3 (i.e.; 40.9 ps) is expected for the KEK-LS case.; * N.Yamamoto et al.; Phys. Rrev. Acc.

We propose to use multicell cavities for their compactness; the reduced number of required ancillaries and the ease of control for a reduced number of cavities.

The first segment has been manufactured before the others; so it could be thoroughly tested in order to validate the chosen technological approach for the RFQ; as it uses polymeric vacuum gaskets and bolts instead of brazing. In this paper we report on the tests run with the segment and their results. Vacuum tests; metrology measurements; low power RF tests as well as extensive tuning tests measuring the cavity resonant quadrupolar frequency as a function of cooling water temperature have been done. Experimental results are compared to the expected values obtained from numerical simulations. We describe the experimental set-ups for the measurements and the simulations. Results are analyzed with the aim of validating the design; and also to provide predictions for tuning and operation of the whole RFQ.

The test is capable of conditioning single cell accelerating cavities for operation at surface electric fields up to 300 MV/m. The rf field is coupled into the cavity from a WR187 waveguide through a mode launcher that converts the fundamental mode of the rectangular waveguide into the TM01 mode of the circular waveguide. Several designs for mode launchers were considered and the final design was chosen based on a compromise between the field enhancements; bandwidth; and simplicity and cost of fabrication.

For this purpose; we proposed a normal-conducting 1.5 GHz harmonic cavity* of TM020-type**. Thanks to its low R/Q (68 ohms) and high unloaded Q (34; 000); bunch gap transient in the harmonic cavity can be reduced to ~20% as compared to that in a typical TM010 cavity. Furthermore; harmful parasitic modes in this cavity can be heavily damped by installing ferrites where no magnetic fields of TM020-mode exist. However; some of the parasitic modes; e.g. TM021 and TM120 modes; are difficult to damp because their field patterns are similar to that of the TM020 mode. To damp such modes effectively; we optimized the cavity inner shape by tailoring the curvature at the cavity equator; the shape of the nose cones; and introducing ""bumps"" on the inner wall. Our goals of the coupling impedances are fxR < 2.4[kohm GHz] and RT < 23 kohm/m in the longitudinal and the transverse planes; respectively. As a result of optimization; we almost achieved these goals. To confirm our simulation results; fabrication of a low-power test cavity is in progress.; * N . Yamamoto et al.; Phys. Rev. Acc.

In this paper; we derive a model that can extend the existing signal monitoring applications for the LHC protection systems with machine learning. Our hybrid model combines an existing threshold-based system with a SVM by using signals; manually validated by experts. Even with a limited amount of data; the SVM learns to integrate the expert knowledge and contributes to a better classification of safety-critical signals.

In particular; the finite conductivity of the beam pipe walls is a major source of impedance and instabilities. A reliable electromagnetic (EM) characterisation of different coating materials is required up to hundreds of GHz due to very short bunches. We propose two different measurement techniques for an extended frequency characterization: (i) a THz time domain setup based on the signal transmission response of a tailored waveguide to infer the coating EM properties from 100 to 300 GHz or even further*.**. This technique has been tested both on NEG and amorphous Carbon films. (ii) a resonant method; based on dielectric cavities; to evaluate the surface resistance Rs of thin conducting samples at low (GHz) frequencies***.

It has been proposed to use a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) to efficiently address this problem. The stray magnetic field of the ECR ion source can be used to provide focusing against the space charge blow-up when using the Direct Plasma Injection Scheme (DPIS) developed for laser ion sources. The RFQ will focus and transport the injected beam; eliminating most of the charge states extracted from the ECR ion source. This narrowing of the charge state distribution is a filter; reducing the low energy beam transport problem; as well as the emittance growth for the desired beam.

Multipactor zone would be expended by several times than that in static states with assumptions of fixed voltage and no beam loading. The dynamic of multipactor in the RF filling process was simulated by coupling with parameters of external circuit with the developed simulation code; and test in experiments with a parallel-plate resonator. Threshold of RF voltage; which means the lower boundary of peak voltage of multipactor zone; had been quantified with different cavity parameters. When we increased the gap length; the measured threshold became larger due to the ionization in background gas. Then the secondary emission factor would be increased in simulation for consistence with the experiment results. Additionally; some multipactor phenomenon could not be predicted precisely because the simulation code did not take account of ionization. The hysteresis of phase and energy of ionization electrons would be a new driving factor for the growth of multipactor in certain conditions.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab361_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab361.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab361_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB361,

While bulk mechanical properties are known to significantly affect breakdown propensity; the underlying mechanisms coupling RF fields to bulk plastic deformation in experimentally relevant thermo-electrical loading conditions remain to be identified at the atomic scale. Here; we present results of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to investigate possible modes of coupling. We consider the activation of Frank-Read (FR) sources; which leads to dislocation multiplication; under the action of bi-axial thermal stresses and surface electric-field. With a charge-equilibration formalism incorporated in a classical MD model; we show that a surface electric field acting on an either preexisting or dislocation-induced surface step; can generate a long-range resolved shear stress field inside the bulk of the sample.

The FG and LG cavities were deformed greatly and the pressure dropped suddenly at 3.4 MPa and 1.6 MPa; respectively. The frequency shifted up to 3.4 MHz and 1.3 MHz; respectively. There was no leak after the pressure test; so the cavity did not rupture under above pressure. The result of the pressure at LG cavity is less half than that of the FG cavity.

To achieve this a variety of RF systems are required. They must provide for capture; formation and storage of Ampere-class beams in the electron and hadron storage rings (ESR and HSR); fast acceleration of high-charge polarized electron bunches in the rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS); provision of cold high current electron bunches in the high-energy cooler ERL and precise high-gradient crabbing of electrons and hadrons either side of the interaction point. The challenges include strong HOM damping in the storage ring cavities and cooler ERL; very high fundamental mode power in the ESR and cooler injector; extremely stable low-noise operation of the crab cavities; mitigation of transient beam loading from gaps; and operating over a wide range of energies and beam currents.

Each cryomodule contains 4 elliptical cavities equipped with a radio frequency power coupler. The ESS nominal pulse is 1.1 MW maximum peak power over a width of 3.6 ms at a repetition rate of 14 Hz. The design of the couplers for medium beta and for high beta cavities is the same; except a small difference of the antenna penetration to adjust the Qext. The mass production of the 120 couplers started and all the medium beta couplers have been conditioned at room temperature. The first cryomodules equipped with the power couplers were successfully tested at high RF power and with cavities at 2K reaching the ESS nominal pulse. The main issue at the start of the series production could be fixed and it was due to bad TiN coatings that caused abnormal dielectric losses in the window.

The RF field inside the cavities has to be controlled better than ±0.1% (peak to peak) in amplitude and ±0.1 deg (peak to peak) in phase. Considering that the RF frequency is 166.6 MHz; which is well within the analog bandwidth of modern high-speed ADCs and DACs; direct RF sampling and direct digital modulation can be achieved. A digital LLRF system utilizing direct sampling has therefore been developed with embedded experimental physics and industrial control system (EPICS) in the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The performance in the lab has been characterized in a self-closed loop with a residual peak-to-peak noise of ±0.05% in amplitude and ±0.03 deg in phase; which is well below the HEPS specifications.

Reaching this right frequency can be challenging due to the narrow frequency range defined by the tuning sensitivity of the cavity and the capability of the tuner. Mechanical deformation until plasticity is attained is of great interest to tune SRF cavities when large frequency shift is needed. But once a cavity is dressed with its helium tank; the only accessible part is its beam pipe; reducing the mechanical action to a push/pull action. This limited possibility has hence to be skilfully associated with chemical etching. An original mechanical tuning of Spoke dressed cavities consists in increasing the pressure inside the helium tank to induce a permanent deformation of the cavity walls. The frequency shift induced by nonlinear deformation is numerically evaluated in order to determine the pressure increments. Both methods were successfully performed on the cavities of the ESS accelerator and of the Myrrha project.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab392_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab392.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab392_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB392,

There is a need for a simple and efficient technique to measure the onset of field penetration into a superconductor directly.

The program outlined here is based on neural network architecture and aims to speed up analysis of Comet Assay images and provide accurate; quantifiable assessment of the DNA damage levels apparent in individual cells. The Comet Assay is an established technique in which DNA fragments are spread out under the influence of an electric field; producing a comet-like object. The elongation and intensity of the comet tail (consisting of DNA fragments) indicate the level of damage incurred. Many methods to measure this damage exist; using a variety of algorithms. However; these can be time consuming; so often only a small fraction of the comets available in an image are analysed. The automatic analysis presented in this contribution aims to improve this.

Beams of ions like Carbon are an advanced way to irradiate tumours but more research is needed; while the higher investment costs than for other radiation treatments have so far limited the European facilities to only four. This initiative aims at being strongly innovative; beyond the existing European designs. While the initial baseline relies on a conservative warm-magnet synchrotron; superconducting magnets for an advanced version of the synchrotron and for the gantry are being developed; with a potential for reductions in size; cost; and power consumption. Both warm and superconducting designs feature high beam intensity for faster treatment; and flexible extraction for novel treatment methods.

Not only are the LINACs complex; the harsh environment of LMICs cause frequent breakdowns resulting in downtimes ranging from days to months. Recent research has identified a disparity between LMICs and High Income Countries (HICs) and determined the Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) as a component needing re-evaluation. The MLC causes over 30% of the problems in RT LINACs; but the modes of failure and quantify the extent of the damage done are yet to be quantified. Using data from across Indonesia; we show the pathways to failure of RT Machines and frequency of breakdowns over time. A component of the MLC needs to be replaced every 9.98 faults per 1000 patients treated and the MLC itself breaks down on average every 36±1.8 days. When comparing the downtime by leaf width; the data shows 5mm leaves contribute 18.27±6.5% to all breakdowns while 10mm makes up 15.87±4.3%. These results outline the need to reassess the current generation of RT LINACs and ultimately work towards guiding future designs to be robust enough for all environments.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab415_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab415.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab415_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB415,

Specific developments have been carried out in BDSIM to advance its efficiency toward such applications; and a detailed 4D Monte-Carlo scoring mechanism has been implemented. It produces tallies such as the spatial-energy differential fluence in arbitrary scoring meshes. The feature makes use of the generic boost::histogram library and allows an event-by-event serialisation and storage in the ROOT data format. The pyg4ometry library is extended to improve the visualisation of critical features such as the complex geometries of BDSIM models; the beam tracks; and the scored quantities.

The benefits of particle therapy (PT) are well identified however its utilisation is still limited by high facility costs and technological challenges. A possibility to address both of these can be considered by improvements to the beam delivery system (BDS). Existing beamlines and gantries transport beams with a momentum range of ±1% and consequently; adjustments in depth or beam energy require all the magnetic fields to be changed. The speed to switch energies is a limiting constraint of the BDS and a determinant of the overall treatment time. A novel concept using fixed field alternating gradient (FFA) optics enables a large energy acceptance (LEA) as beams of varying energies can traverse the beamline at multiple physical positions given the same magnetic field. This presents the potential to provide faster; higher quality treatments at lower costs; with the capability to deliver advanced PT techniques such as multi-ion therapy. We explore the applicability and benefits of a LEA BDS.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/mopab417_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/mopab417.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/mopab417_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB417,

When accelerating fully stripped helium ions (alpha particles); hydrogen molecular ions can also be accelerated to the same energy with a small tuning of the machine due to having almost the same mass-to-charge ratio; yielding a proton beam of double current after the beam exits the vacuum window towards the target.

For the APS-Upgrade; we plan to mitigate coherent ion instability using a compensated gap scheme. To study incoherent effects (such as emittance growth); an IONEFFECTS element has been incorporated into the particle tracking code ELEGANT. The simulations include multiple ionization; transverse impedance; and charge variation between bunches. Once these effects are included; the simulations show good agreement with measurements at the present APS. We have also installed a gas injection system; which creates a controlled pressure bump of Nitrogen gas in a short section of the APS ring. The resulting ion instability was studied under a wide variety of beam conditions. For cases with no or insufficient train gaps; large emittance growth was observed.

With such a spacing; electron cloud effects are much more severe than with the 50-ns spacing; which had been used in the previous run. Beam-induced conditioning of the beam chambers mitigated the e-cloud formation to an extent that allowed an effective exploitation of 25 ns beams. Nevertheless; even after years of conditioning; e-cloud effects remained very visible; affecting beam stability and beam quality; and generating strong heat loads on the beam screens of the superconducting magnets with puzzling features. In preparation for the High Luminosity LHC upgrade; remarkable progress has been made in the modeling of the e-cloud formation and of its influence on beam stability; slow losses and emittance blow up; as well as in the understanding of the underlying behavior of the beam-chamber surface.

Landau damping depends strongly on the bunch distribution; which is often assumed to be Gaussian in the transverse planes. In this paper; we introduce and explain an instability mechanism observed in the LHC; where Landau damping is eventually lost due to a diffusion that modifies the transverse bunch distribution. The mechanism is caused by a wide-spectrum noise that excites the transverse motion of the beam; which consequently produces wakefields that drive a narrow-spectrum diffusion. It is shown that this diffusion efficiently lowers the stability diagram at the frequency of the least stable coherent mode; leading to a loss of Landau damping after a latency. A semi-analytical model agrees with measurements in dedicated latency experiments performed in the LHC. This instability mechanism explains the need for a stability margin in octupole current in the LHC; relative to the amount needed to stabilize a Gaussian beam. We detail the impact of this mechanism and possible mitigations for the LHC and HL-LHC.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tuxa06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tuxa06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tuxa06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUXA06,

The purpose of the harmonic cavities is to extend the bunch length in a dual energy storage ring as such a longer bunch length may be very useful in a cooling application.

A crystal-based hybrid positron source could be an alternative to conventional sources based on the e- conversion into e+ in a thick target. The basic idea of the hybrid source is to split the e+ converter into a gamma-quanta radiator plus a gamma-to-positron converter*. In such a scheme an e- beam crosses a thin axially oriented crystal with emission of ""channeling radiation""; characterized by a considerably larger amount of photons w.r.t. standard bremsstrahlung**. The net result is an increase in the number of e+ produced at the converter target. In the hybrid scheme; only photons reach the converter; thereby reducing the Peak Energy Deposition Density (PEDD) in the target. Here we present the results of a test conducted at the DESY TB with 5.6 GeV e- interacting with a W crystal. A huge enhancement in the radiated energy and in the photon emission has been recorded and reproduced with Monte Carlo simulations***. This study is relevant for the design of the FCC-ee positron source. Indeed; through Monte Carlo; we also investigated the best parameters of the crystal radiator suited for the FCC-ee e+ source.; * R. Chehab et al. PAC’89; 10.1109/PAC.1989.73147  ** X.Artru et al.

This is a factor of 4 higher than the current state-of-the-art for cyclotrons and a factor of 10 compared to what is commercially available. All areas of physics that call for high cw currents can greatly benefit from this result; e.g. particle physics; medical isotope production; and energy research. This increase in beam current is possible in part because the cyclotron is designed to include and use vortex-motion; allowing clean extraction. Such a design process is only possible with the help of high-fidelity codes; like OPAL. Another novelty is the use of an RFQ embedded in the cyclotron yoke to bunch the beam during axial injection. Finally; using H2+ relieves some of the space charge constraints during injection. In this paper; we will give an overview of the project and then focus on the design and simulations of the cyclotron itself. We will describe the physics; computational tools; and simulation results.

LCLS-II has shown over 300 cavities with an average Q0 of more than 3·1010 at 16 MV/m and represents an overwhelming success of the doping protocol. LCLS-II-HE will add an additional 23 superconducting cryomodules to the LCLS-II linac; requiring cavities to operate at similar levels of high Q0 but at 21 MV/m instead of 16 MV/m. Nitrogen-doped cavities have been historically plagued by lower quench fields than other cavity preparation methods. Therefore; an R&D effort was launched to improve upon the quench fields of doped cavities while maintaining the high Q0. Here we present results on single-cells and 9-cells from new doping recipe pursuits; transfer of these new recipes to cavity vendors; and results on vendor-produced 9-cell cavities. This program has led to the discovery of the importance of the cold electropolish for producing higher quench fields.

FE-FRTs have no moving parts and allow cavity frequencies to be changed extremely quickly (on the timescale of 100s of ns or less). They are of particular interest for SRF cavities as they can be placed outside the liquid helium environment and without an FE-FRT it’s typically very difficult to tune SRF cavities quickly. FE-FRTs can be used for a wide variety of use cases including microphonics suppression; RF switching; and transient beam loading compensation. This promises entirely new operational capabilities; increased performance and cost savings for a variety of existing and proposed accelerators.

When such surfaces are used as cryogenic components in accelerators; they will undergo thermal fluctuation; photon; and e-irradiation. A rigorous evaluation of their overall behavior in such vacuum conditions is clearly required. Our studies on thermal desorption of gas from LASE have shown that the morphology gives rise to a vaster and higher desorption temperature (T) with respect to what has been observed from a flat surface**. This implies that gas desorption from LASE will occur in an unexpected T range; but also that cryosorbed gas will be on those surfaces at temperatures and quantities very different from what is expected to occur on flat surfaces. This gas can participate in other desorption mechanisms; such as e-desorption. Here we report some measurements of e-desorption yield from such LASE treated surfaces at low T. Such results can be useful to predict the gas quantity finally delivered in accelerators’ cryogenic vacuum from a porous surface under e-irradiation.; * R. Valizadeh et al.; Appl. Surf.

Conventionally; multiple UED shots with varying time delays are needed to map out the entire dynamic process. The measurement precision is limited by the timing jitter between the pulses of laser pump and UED probe. We show that; by converting the longitudinal time of an electron bunch to the transverse position of a Bragg peak on the detector; one can obtain the full lattice dynamic process in a single electron pulse. We propose a novel design of a time-resolved UED with the capability of capturing a wide range of dynamic features in a single diffraction image. The work presented here is not only an extension of the ultrashort-pulse pump/long-pulse probe scheme being used in transient spectroscopy studies for decades but also advances the capabilities of MeV UED for future applications with tunable electron probe profile and detecting time range with femtosecond resolution. Furthermore; we present numerical simulations illustrating the capability of acquiring a single time-resolved diffraction image based on the case-by-case studies of lattice dynamic behavior.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tuxc06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tuxc06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tuxc06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUXC06,

(2) Quadrupole magnets with an oval aperture allow larger gradients than a circular aperture; provided the beam is more extended in one axis than the other; as usual for a quadrupole in a focussing system. These can be used in compact hadron therapy gantries. (3) New collider complexes often require multiple rings for acceleration or top-up; accumulation; collision and cooling.

The low emittance optics has an enhanced sensitivity to the magnet misalignments and field errors; especially for the final focus quadrupole misalignment. The magnet imperfection will cause the closed orbit distortion and optics distortion. The correction scheme for these magnet imperfections includes the closed orbit correction; the dispersion correction; the beta function correction and the betatron coupling correction.

This ambitious luminosity goal can only be achieved; if all technological boundaries are being pushed. One such area is the captured positron number; which is primarily determined in the capture section within the positron source and specifically by its optical matching device. It is responsible for transforming the phase-space of the outgoing particles produced in the target for the succeeding accelerator sections. The plasma lens is a new candidate for this task.

This is known as regenerative beam breakup (BBU) instability and it sets the beam threshold current for the stable beam operation. A study by Setiniyaz et al.~[Setiniyaz2020] showed the filling pattern and recombination schemes of multi-turn energy recovery linacs (ERLs) can create many different beam loading transients; which can have a big impact on the cavity fundamental mode voltage and RF stabilizes. In this work; we extend the study of the filling pattern and recombination schemes to the BBU instabilities and threshold current. In the ERLs; the accelerated and decelerated bunches can be ordered differently while they pass through the cavity and form different filling patterns. Each pattern has a unique bunch energy sequence and bunch arrival times and hence interacts with cavity uniquely and thus drives BBU differently. In this paper; we introduce a simulation tool to investigate the filling pattern dependence of the ERL BBU instability.; * S. Setiniyaz; R. Apsimon; and P. H. Williams; Phys. Rev. Accel.

In spite of the inherently nonlinear nature of FEL optical guiding; the ABCD matrix we find is able to predict the evolution of the FEL mode size and centroid to a high degree of accuracy across a large range of input mode characteristics. This scheme enables extremely fast simulation of transverse dynamics; which in turn greatly simplifies numerical studies of seeded FEL systems. Of particular interest in that regard is the x-ray regenerative amplifier free-electron laser; in which the x-ray beam propagates through an optical cavity many hundreds of times; thereby making traditional simulation methods cumbersome and time consuming.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab084_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab084.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab084_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB084,

It has recently been experimentally demonstrated and currently many facilities worldwide intend to incorporate it in user operation. The EEHG process relies on very accurate and complex transformations of electron beam phase space by means of a series of undulators coupled to lasers and dispersive chicanes. As a result of the phase space manipulation; electrons are bunched at a high harmonic of the seed laser wavelength allowing coherent emission at few nm wavelength. Dispersion occurring in strong chicanes is imperative for implementation of this scheme and effective electron bunching generation. However; strong chicanes at the same time can be source of beam instability effects; such as Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR); that can significantly grow in these conditions and suppress the bunching process. Therefore; there is a common need to investigate such effects in detail.

This jitter is of interest to the Cavity-Based XFEL (CBXFEL)* project at SLAC; which will lase seven undulators inside an X-ray cavity of four diamond Bragg mirrors. The CBXFEL cavity has a narrow angular bandwidth; thus large angular jitters cause X-rays to leak out of the cavity and degrade cavity efficiency. To understand contributors to angular pointing jitter; we studied the pointing jitter of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) Hard X-ray Undulator line (HXU). Monochromatic and pink X-rays were characterized at the X-ray Pump Probe (XPP) instrument. We found pulses with high monochromatized pulse energy and small electron beam orbit in the undulator have the lowest angular pointing jitter. We present here our measurement results; discuss why these factors correlate with pointing stability; and propose a strategy for CBXFEL to reduce angular pointing jitter and account for angular pointing jitter in cavity efficiency measurements.,"Funding: This work was supported by the Department of Energy, Laboratory Directed Research and Development program at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, under contract DE-AC02-76SF00515.; *Gabriel Marcus et al.

RF kicks can depend on the RF waveform of the accelerating structure; so controlling this effect is particularly important when two or more electron bunches are accelerated within an RF fill time. Multibunch modes have been successfully developed for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) accelerator at SLAC; * and are being continually improved to accommodate new experiments. One such experiment; the Cavity-Based XFEL (CBXFEL)** project will require two electron bunches separated by 218.5 ns which must be identical in energy and orbit. To reduce variation in energy and orbit between the two bunches; we studied the RF kicks produced by each of 75 accelerator segments in the LCLS linac at several RF timings. Here; we discuss these measurements and propose a method to correct RF kicks in the LCLS accelerator using corrector dipoles and quadrupoles.; * F.-J. Decker; et al.

Robust evaluation of the eigenmode spectrum of a multimode laser beam has various applications in laser development; research; and utilization. In this work; a general eigenmode decomposition method for a multimode laser beam has been developed based on Bayesian analysis. This problem is transformed into a linear system and then solved using a Gaussian probabilistic model. Using Bayesian analysis; prior knowledge about the mode content is further incorporated into the solution to improve the results for laser beams contaminated with complex disturbances. The decomposition of the beam image from the incoherent intensity addition of HG modes is discussed with different types of noise or disturbances. The simulation results have been used to show the robustness of this method. This method can be straightforwardly extended into other cases such as the wavefront decomposition into the coherent superposition of HG and LG modes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab117_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab117.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab117_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB117,

When the beam pass through the dechirper module; strong longitudinal and transverse wakefields can be excited to introduce a correlated energy chirp and a kick along the bunch. However; due to the relatively small gap of dechirper; beam halo particles hitting the dechirper module can lead to energy deposition and generate additional radiation; which can cause serious damage to the downstream undulators.

Intrinsic wakefield dephasing from self-modulation of proton bunch can lead to complex evolution of the bunch and wakefield; making it difficult to design an experimental setup for witness beam injection. Using the particle-in-cell code FBPIC; ** we investigate in detail the trends of seed electron and driver proton bunch parameter sensitivity to the phase of wakefield in time in the proton bunch frame. We focus on the parameters affecting the phase of the wakefield through the beam’s radial dynamics; such as beam emittance; radial size; energy; and beam to plasma density ratio. Parameter variations are compared to those in the case of the phase of wakefield driven by a non-evolving seed bunch.; *F. Batsch; arXiv:2012.09676 [physics.plasm-ph] **R. Lehe; M. Kirchen; I.A.

Here we present a novel way of using the overlap of laser and beam radial fields to locally liberate electrons from the tunneling ionization of the non-ionized gas species. These liberated ultracold electrons gain sufficient energy to be trapped in the accelerating phase at the back of the plasma blowout. This method of controlled injection has advantages in precision timing since injection is locked to peak beam current and has the potential of generating beams with very low emittance and energy spread.

The excitation can produce plasma blowout conditions using very low emittance beams despite having a small charge per bunch. The resulting plasma density perturbation is extremely nonlinear locally; but preserves the resonant response of the plasma electrons at the plasma frequency. This excitation can produce plasma blowout conditions using very low emittance beams despite having a small charge per bunch. To match the resonance condition; the plasma wavelength has to be equal to the laser period of a few microns. This corresponds to a high density plasma resulting in extremely large wakefield amplitudes. Matching the beam into such a dense plasma requires an extremely short focusing beta function.

To form a stable accelerated electron bunch; a method is usually used that involves the formation of the same accelerating fields at the location of the bunch.

The effect of the presence of a witness-beam (the effect of the spatial charge distribution of the witness beam) (see [*; **]) to compensate the energy spread of the positron beam in plasma wakefield accelerators has been studied. This paper presents the results of a numerical simulation on the optimization of the parameters of the driver-bunch and witness-bunch for the formation of a self-consistent longitudinal distribution of the accelerating plateau-type field; which leads to the same values of the wakefield for the whole bunch of accelerated particles and minimizing bunch degradation during acceleration by means of an ion-driver-bunch with external injection into the plasma wake accelerator. The dependence of the longitudinal distribution of the accelerating wakefield on the density and shape of the accelerated bunch in the blowout regime was investigated.

The use of Nb3Sn allows to operate SRF cavities at higher temperatures (4K) with low power dissipation which is within the reach of commercially available closed-cycle cryocoolers. Euclid is developing a continuous wave (CW); 1.5-cell; MeV-scale SRF conduction cooled photogun operating at 1.3 GHz. In this paper; the technical details of the design and first experimental data are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab167_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab167.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab167_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB167,

We discuss plans to use microbunched electron cooling (MBEC) to achieve this. The principle of this method is that the hadron beam will copropogate with a beam of electrons; imprinting its own density modulation on the electron beam. These electron phase space perturbations are amplified before copropogating with the hadrons again in a kicker section. By making the hadron transit time between modulator and kicker dependent on hadron energy and transverse offset; the energy kicks which they receive from the electrons will tend to reduce their longitudinal and transverse emittances. We discuss details of the analytic theory and searches for optimal realistic parameter settings to achieve a maximal cooling rate while limiting the effects of diffusion and electron beam saturation.

This involves having the hadron beam imprint on a beam of electrons; enhancing the perturbations in the electron beam using the microbunching instability; and feeding back on the original hadron beam to correct deviations in hadron energy; and; through the use of dispersion; the transverse emittances. This process has been modelled analytically in the linear regime*. However; in order to maximize the cooling rate; we wish to know how much saturation in the electron beam is acceptable before the effects of nonlinearity cause significant deviations from the analytic results. To understand this; we have developed a code to do fast one-dimensional plasma simulations of hadrons and electrons as they move through the MBEC section of the EIC. In addition to permitting us to understand the effects of saturation; other effects are included which do not fit easily in the analytic formalism.; * G. Stupakov and P.

It is almost exclusively produced with a few ageing research reactors worldwide. In response to growing concerns about Tc-99m availability and its increasing demand; alternative production routes are being explored. The EU-funded InnovaTron project aims at designing an innovative compact high-intensity self-extracting cyclotron able to deliver proton beams with currents up to 5 mA or more for the direct production of Tc-99m. It could be also used for production of high quantities of other frontier medical radioisotopes. The proton beams exit without using an electrostatic deflector to overcome its current limitations. A prototype cyclotron was built by IBA in 2001. Currents up to 2 mA were extracted from it.

The high beam current and power impose challenges to the design and tuning of the machine and the RF amplitude and phase have to be set within 1% and 1 degree of the design values. The usual method used to define the RF set-point is signature matching; which can be a time consuming and challenging process; and new techniques to meet the growing complexity of accelerator facilities are highly desirable. In this paper we study the usage of Machine Learning to determine the RF optimum amplitude and phase.

One tube reached the end of life in 2020; it was the first case in the RCS after 60; 000 hours operation time. This means the reduced filament voltage works well because the tube has been running beyond an expected life time suggested by the tube manufacturer. However; an electron emission from the filament is decreased by the reduced filament voltage. Although the large amplitude of the anode current is necessary for the high intensity beam acceleration to compensate an wake voltage; a solid-state amplifier to drive a control grid circuit almost reaches the output power limit because of the poor electron emission. We changed the filament voltage reduction rate from 15 % to 5 %; the required power of the solid-state amplifier was fairly reduced; whereas the accelerated beam power was same.

Despite being widely used; a full theoretical understanding of beam matching in 6D phase space remains elusive. Here; we present an analytical treatment of 6D beam matching of a high-intensity beam onto an RF structure. We begin our analysis within the framework of a linear model; and apply the averaging method to attain a matched solution for a set of 3D beam envelope equations. We then consider the nonlinear regime; where the beam size is comparable with the separatrix size. Starting with a Hamiltonian analysis in 6D phase space; we attain a self-consistent beam profile and show that it is significantly different from the commonly used ellipsoidal shape. Subsequently; we analyze the special case of equilibrium with equal space charge depression between all degrees of freedom.

The mu-e conversion violates the lepton flavor universality and its discovery indicates a proof of the physics beyond the standard model of the particle physics. The experiment utilizes a high-intensity primary proton-beam of J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex). The proton beam is injected to a target about 700mm long to generate a high intensity muon beam so as to accumulate huge statistics and achieve the final goal of a sensitivity of 10-16. Construction of the experimental facility is underway at a high pace towards an engineering run in 2022 and the first physics run in 2023. In this presentation; we would like to present a current status of the COMET facility construction.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab210_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab210.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab210_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB210,

Next step will be the preparation phase for the construction of the facility. The DONES facility aims at developing a database of fusion-like radiation effects on materials to be used in future fusion reactors up to damage levels expected in the EU DEMO. It will be based on an intense neutron source created by an accelerated deuteron beam (125 mA CW; 40 MeV) impinging on a liquid lithium curtain. The DONES Accelerator Systems (AS) will be responsible of delivering this 5 MW D+ beam with very high availability. The beam acceleration will be performed by several stages: an ion source and LEBT; an RFQ; a MEBT; an SRF Linac and a HEBT transporting and delivering an optimized profile down to the target. A high power RF system and several ancillaries will ensure the equipment is properly operated. This contribution will report the present status of the AS design; the main challenges faced; the R&D programme to overcome them; and the prospects for the construction and commissioning of the DONES accelerator in Granada (Spain).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab211_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab211.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab211_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB211,

TRIBs have been successfully generated in BESSY II and MLS at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie GmbH (HZB). They offer the possibility of generating a second stable orbit and; by populating the orbit with a different electron bunch pattern; allow to effectively have two distinct radiation sources in the same machine individually tailored to different user needs. We demonstrate the generation of TRIBs by order of non-linearity on simple lattice configurations by only treating the drift space as the non-linear element. Moreover; we also insert other non-linear magnets to show how they modify the already generated TRIBs from the drift spaces. We conclude by giving a qualitative analysis of the occurring effects; which provides a guideline as to when the linear approximation is insufficient and the non-linear contribution has to be taken into account.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab213_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab213.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab213_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB213,

This mode was offered with free range of motion of the 12 out of vacuum undulators installed at the BESSY II ring. Diagnostics of the island orbit were limited to a single camera monitoring bending magnet radiation from a single dipole. A significant motion of the island orbit was observed on this diagnostic and correlated with undulator motion.

As a consequence; we believe that the comprehensive studies of the parametric resonance induced by RF modulation are necessary for understanding the physics picture better and seeking new possibilities of applications of this technique. The studies on the beam dynamics closed to the 3vs RF phase modulation would be presented here. Based on the basic longitudinal synchrotron equations of motion; we obtained analytically the longitudinal modulated Hamiltonian and various parameters in longitudinal phase space; such as the fixed points; island tune; island width.

It is a common practice for modern designs to use a sextupole scheme that allows simultaneous correction of natural chromaticity and energy independent; or geometrical; sextupolar resonances. However; the remaining higher order terms arising from the cross talks of the sextupole families set a strong limitation on the achievable dynamic aperture. This paper presents a simulation-based recipe to use octupoles together with this sextupole scheme to provide simultaneous self-compensation of linear amplitude dependent tune shift together with phase-dependent octupolar and higher order geometrical resonant driving terms. The correction method was built based on observations made on a simple FODO model; then applied to a realistic low emittance lattice; designed in the framework of the upgrade of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab227_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab227.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab227_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB227,

However; any imperfections in field strength or misalignment of components can introduce chaotic and unstable particle motion. All accelerators are prone to such non-linearities but the effects are even more significant in high intensity particle beams with the presence of space charge effects. This work aims to explore the non-linearities which arise in high intensity particle beams using the scaled experiment; IBEX. The IBEX experiment is a linear Paul trap that allows the transverse dynamics of a collection of trapped particles to be studied by mimicking the propagation through multiple quadrupole lattice periods whilst remaining stationary in the laboratory frame. IBEX is currently undergoing a non-linear upgrade with the goal of investigating Non-linear Integrable Optics (NIO) in order to improve our understanding and utilisation of high intensity particle beams.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab234_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab234.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab234_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB234,

The baseline design includes only one interaction point (IP); and optics have been found with a suitable dynamic aperture in each dimension. However; the EIC project asks for the option of a second IP. The strong focusing required at the IPs creates a very large natural chromaticity (about -125 in the vertical plane for the ring). Compensating this linear chromaticity while simultaneously controlling the nonlinear chromaticity to high order to achieve a sufficient momentum acceptance of 1% (10 σ) at 18 GeV is a considerable challenge. A scheme to compensate higher-order chromatic effects from 2 IPs by setting the phase advance between them does not; by itself; provide the required momentum acceptance for the EIC Electron Storage Ring.

To pre-validate these magnet structures via simulations; the extraction procedure needs to output standard multipoles as well as fringe effects. The approach presented in this manuscript uses a volumetric grid map of the magnetic flux density as input. After computation of the reference trajectory (leapfrog integration); a large linear system is solved to compute transverse polynomial coefficients of the magnetic scalar potential in a series of interconnected thin cylinders (linear basis functions) along with that reference. The import of these coefficients into a lattice simulation is discussed using a modification of the tracking code Tracy.

It is assumed that wavelengths under consideration are much more than the period of the corrugation. In this case; the corrugated structure can be replaced with a smooth surface on which so-called equivalent boundary conditions (EBC) are fulfilled*. In fact; we deal with anisotropic surface characterized by certain matrix impedance. Here; we consider the case of deep corrugation; i.e. we assume that the depth of the structure is much more than its period (the case of shallow corrugation was studied earlier**). Using the EBC we obtain electromagnetic field components which are presented in form of spectral integrals. It is shown that the bunch generates surface waves propagating in the plane of the structure; whereas volume radiation is absent at the frequencies under consideration. We also consider the energy losses of the bunch. Typical dependences of a spectral density of the energy losses on corrugation parameters are obtained and analyzed. It is demonstrated that the features of the surface waves can be used for the bunch diagnostics.; * E.I. Nefedov; A.N. Sivov. Electrodynamics of periodic structures. Moscow; Nauka; 1977; 208 p.

Initially; the Ferninfrarot Linac- Und Test-Experiment (FLUTE); a source of ultra-short bunches; will serve as an injector for cSTART to benchmark and emulate laser-wakefield accelerator-like beams. In a second stage a laser-plasma accelerator will be used as an injector; which is being developed as part of the ATHENA project in collaboration with DESY and Helmholtz Institute Jena (HIJ). With an energy of 50 MeV and damping times of several seconds; the electron beam does not reach equilibrium emittance. Furthermore; the critical frequency of synchrotron radiation is 53 THz and in the same order as the bunch spectrum; which implies that the entire bunch radiates coherently. We perform longitudinal particle tracking simulations to investigate the evolution of the bunch length and spectrum as well as the emitted coherent synchrotron radiation.

A natural mitigation mechanism is provided by the beam-beam interaction at the interaction point (IP); which gives a strong Landau damping for the TCBI in the eSR.

In the ultra-relativistic limit; v=c; the exit CSR wake decays inversely proportional to the distance from the magnet end. To calculate the total energy loss of the beam one needs to integrate this wake to infinity; but the integral diverges. This means that one has to either drop the assumption of the infinite value of the Lorentz factor or take into account the shielding effect of the metal walls in the vacuum chamber. In practice; the latter effect is often dominant. In this work; we derive formulas for the CSR wake in the drift after an exit from the magnet that incorporates the shielding by two parallel metal plates.

Our previous analytic approximation for Iperp was for beam divergences; sy << 1/g; where g is the Lorentz factor and sy is the rms y-component of the beam divergence.

In absence of more sophisticated bunch length diagnostics; we have adopted an inversion algorithm applied to beam energy spectra. In practice; the method applies a transformation matrix which maps the particle energy into the particle longitudinal coordinate along the bunch. The construction of this matrix is made analytically; based on the solution of the Liouville equation for the study of the longitudinal beam dynamics. The analytic approach has been benchmarked with experimental measurements of the beam properties along the machine and cross-checked with other tools; as particle tracking and/or beam optics codes.

Its aim is to continuously measure bunch-by-bunch beam profiles; independent of beam intensity; throughout the LHC cycle. The primary components of the BGV monitor are a gas target and a forward tracking detector. Secondary particles emerging from inelastic beam-gas interactions are detected by the tracker. The beam profile is then inferred from the spatial distribution of reconstructed vertices of said interactions. Based on insights and conclusions acquired by a demonstrator device that was operated in the LHC during Run 2; a new design is being developed to fulfill the HL-LHC specifications. This contribution describes the status of the simulation studies being performed to evaluate the impact of design parameters on the instrument’s performance and identify gas target and tracker requirements.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab278_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab278.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab278_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB278,

The system digitizes signals of ~2 GHz bandwidth using a choice of sampling frequency that realizes equivalent time sampling. The data is subsequently processed in the Fourier domain to unfold the aliased spectral lines and apply an impulse response correction per channel.

It promises superior position resolution and high signal intensity resulting from a strongly focused quantum gas jet. In order to achieve the gas jet with a diameter of less than 100 µm; a novel focusing method exploiting the quantum wave function of the neutral gas atoms; generate an interference pattern with a single maximum acting as an ultra-thin gas jet. An ‘atom sieve’ has been designed for generating the interference pattern; applying the principle of a photon sieve. It will be analogous to a mechanical wire scanner though with a minimal interception. The idea of moving a quantum gas jet through the beam is proposed for transverse profiling.

In this scheme; a primary beam crosses a 45-degree tilted thin gas curtain which causes ionization of gas molecules in the jet. The generated ions are then collected using an electrostatic extraction system to determine the 2D transverse profile of the primary beam. The most commonly used gases for the jet are neon and nitrogen. The signal from the gas jet is always super-imposed with the signal resulting from residual gases in the interaction chamber. CST simulations indicate that the gas jet speed is a key factor for the separation of the jet and the residual gas signals. To obtain a good signal separation; one can increase the velocity of the gas jet. This can be accomplished by generating a gas jet that mixes heavier and lighter gases. This contribution gives a general overview of the monitor design; discusses the effects of gas mixing and CST simulation results.

The technique can be applied to many radiation sources; in this study the focus is coherent transition radiation (CTR) at the MAX IV Short Pulse Facility. Bunch lengths of interest at this facility are <100 fs FWHM; therefore the CTR is in the THz to Far-IR range.

As the scale of complexity and sophistication of modern accelerators grows; the difficulties in modeling the machine increase greatly in order to include all the interacting subsystems and to consider the limitation of various diagnostics to benchmark against measurements. Tools based on ML can help substantially in revealing correlations of machine condition and beam parameters that are not easily discovered using traditional physics model-based simulations; reducing machine tuning up time etc among the many possible applications. While at APS we have many excellent tools for the optimization; diagnostics; and controls of the accelerators; we do not yet have ML-based tools established.

ipac2021,,TUPAB289,Towards Hysteresis Aware Bayesian Regression and Optimization,University of Chicago; Chicago; Illinois; USA; SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Algorithms used today for accelerator optimization assume a simple proportional relationship between an intermediate tuning parameter and the resultant field or mechanism which influences the beam. This neglects the effects of hysteresis; where the magnetic or mechanical response depends not only on the current parameter value; but also on the historical parameter values. This prevents the use of one to one surrogate models; such as Gaussian processes; to assist in optimization when hysteresis effects are not negligible; since identical points in input space no longer correspond to a same point in output space. In this work; we demonstrate how Bayesian inference can be used in conjunction with Gaussian processes to jointly model both the hysteresis cycle of magnetic elements and the beam response. Using this technique we demonstrate how to model the hysteresis cycle of a magnet during accelerator operation in situ by only measuring the beam response; without direct magnetic field measurements. This allows us to quickly build accurate statistical models of the beam response that can be used for rapid tuning of accelerators where hysteresis effects are dominant.,"Funding: This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Award No. PHY-1549132, the Center for Bright Beams.",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab289_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab289.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab289_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB289,

To stabilize the arrival times a fast longitudinal intra bunch-train feedback (L-IBFB) using bunch arrival time monitors is applied. The electron bunch energy prior to a bunch compression chicane is modulated by superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities to compensate fast arrival time fluctuations of the subsequent bunches. A broadband normal conducting RF cavity was installed in front of the first bunch compression chicane at FLASH. The L-IBFB uses the normal conducting cavity for small but fast energy corrections together with the SRF cavities for larger and slower corrections. Current measurements show arrival time stabilities of the electron bunches towards 5 fs (rms) at the end of the linac; if the normal conducting cavity acts together with the SRF cavities in the L-IBFB system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab302_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab302.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab302_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB302,

Optical interferometry; being a precise; optical distance measurement technique; is often a method of choice in such applications. However; classical fringe-counting interferometers present several drawbacks in terms of system complexity.

It was then decided to freeze any further realignment of the LHC triplet magnet for the remainder of the run. Subsequently; a project team was set up at CERN to understand better the conditions leading to such unexpected behavior and to study and propose a technical consolidation for the realignment system of the LHC triplet magnet.

This type of network is composed of a dense distribution of points materialized in the form of embedded target holders on the special slab and radiation shielding. Phenomena such as ground movements; temperature gradients and vibrations could lead to misalignment of the components; possibly causing a degradation in machine performance.

The measurement of the orbital period T by the time-of-flight sensors makes it possible to precisely determine the mass to the charge ratio of the ion under study. For this; the change of the circulation period dT should not exceed 1·10-6 for dT/T in the entire momentum acceptance of the 0.62%. Modeling in the Strategic Accelerator Design code showed that without nonlinear effects compensation; the orbital period variation is 1·10-5.

Risk levels can then be used for different purposes; e.g. defining subsystem reliability or personnel safety requirements. Over the history of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC); several risk matrices have been defined to guide system design. Initially; these were focused on machine protection systems; more recently these have also been used to prioritize consolidation activities. A new data-driven development of risk matrices for CERN’s accelerators is presented in this paper; based on data collected in the CERN Accelerator Fault Tracker (AFT). The data-driven approach improves the granularity of the assessment; and limits uncertainty in the risk estimation; as it is based on operational experience.

With the planned upgrades to double the beam power we expect increased rates of degradation and the importance of minimizing these beam loss events will become ever more important. To further limit degradation; we are developing machine learning approaches to monitor the beam and to detect; predict and prevent beam loss events. Initial research has shown that precursors to beam loss events are detectable. The initial steps are to use ML-based classification to recognize anomalies and to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders to predict beam loss.

The SNS linac includes two sections of beam acceleration. Acceleration in the first section up to 185.5 MeV is done with a room temperature copper linac which consists of both Drift Tube Linac (DTL) and Coupled Cavity Linac (CCL) Radio Frequency (RF) cavities. The second section consists of 81 Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities which accelerate the beam to the final beam energy of 1 GeV. The linac is currently capable of delivering an average beam power output of 1.44 MW with typical yearly operating hours of around 4500 hours. Due to the high power output and high availability of the linac; activation of accelerator equipment is a significant concern. The linac tuning process consists of three stages: model based setup of amplitudes and phases of the RF cavities; empirical beam loss reduction; and then documentation of the final amplitudes and phases of RF cavities after the empirical tuning. The final step is needed to ensure fast recovery from an SRF cavity failure. This paper discusses models; algorithms; diagnostic tools; software; and practices that are used for these stages.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab329_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab329.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab329_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB329,

Nb3Sn is one of the most competitive candidates, since it increases the superheating field, allows the operation temperature up to 4K, and improves cavity efficiency. Surface roughness and grain boundaries, however, significantly affect the RF performance of current Nb3Sn cavities. Here, we explore a post laser annealing technique to reduce the surface roughness. In doing so, we deposited a TiN laser-absorber on Nb3Sn and Nb surfaces, and then annealed the samples by laser scanning via different laser systems. The Nb3Sn surface roughness was minimized to 101 nm (Ra) by laser annealing via 308 nm, 35 ns pulses.

A high perveance bunched electron beam can be generated by a standard electron gun combined with a deflecting beam chopper*; an off-the-shelf IOT or klystron; respectively. The pulse rate is determined by the resonance frequency of the cavity. The resonator hereby acts like the output cavity of a klystron: Within its propagation through the cavity the beam is decelerated increasing the stored energy of the accelerator.

A stainless-steel beam screen with co-laminated copper and a thin amorphous carbon (aC) film on the inner surface will be installed in the beam pipe of the SC magnets. The copper will reduce the beam-induced resistive-wall (RW) heating from operation with the higher intensity EIC beams; that if not addressed would make the magnets quench. Limiting the RW heating is also important to achieve an adequately low vacuum level. The aC coating will reduce secondary electron yield which could also cause heating and limit intensity. Among all the RHIC SC magnets; the arc dipoles present the biggest challenge to the design and installation of beam screens. The arc dipoles; which make up for 78% (2.5 km) length of all SC magnets in RHIC; expect the largest RW heating due to their smallest aperture. These magnets are also the longest (9.45 m each); thus experiencing the largest temperature rise over their length; and have a large sagitta (48.5 mm) that increases the difficulty to install the beam screen in place.

These 35V; 525A power supplies are bulky; inefficient and require both air and water cooling. The reliability of the SNS facility is impacted due to water leaks internal to power supplies and current readback issues associated with their unique control system interface; resulting in multiple downtime events. Hence; an alternate solution is necessary for the continued reliable operation of the SNS. To mitigate the above-mentioned problems; this paper proposes the use of off-the-shelf Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) rated for 20V; 500A with serial control interface. These SMPS are air-cooled; more efficient and more compact owing to their switching speeds of approximately 160 kHz.

To achieve this goal; medium charge states have to be used. However; the probability for charge exchange in collisions with residual gas particles of such ions is much higher than for higher charge states. In order to lower the residual gas density to extreme high vacuum conditions; 65% of the circumference of SIS18 are already coated with NEG; which provides high and distributed pumping speed. Nevertheless; nobel and nobel-like components; which have very high ionization cross sections; do not get pumped by this coating. A cryogenic environment at moderate temperatures; i.e. at 50-80K; provides high pumping speed for all heavy residual gas particles. The only typical residual gas species; that cannot be pumped at this temperature is hydrogen. With an additional NEG coating the pumping will be optimized for all residual gas particles.

We have studied the use of high-temperature superconducting coated conductors as possible coating materials for the beam screen of the FCC-hh. In addition; amorphous carbon coating and laser-based surface treatment techniques are effective surface treatments to lower the secondary electron yield and minimise the electron cloud build-up. We have developed and adapted different experimental setups based on resonating structures at frequencies below 10 GHz to study the response of these coatings and their modified surfaces under the influence of RF fields and DC magnetic fields up to 9 T. Taking the FCC-hh as a reference; we will show that the surface resistance for REBCO-CCs is much lower than that of Cu.

Design studies for an alternative; cleaner approach for radioisotope generation using a high energy electron linac were initiated at SAMEER to generate 99Mo. The electron beam from a 30 MeV linac with an average current of 350 µA will be bombarded on a convertor target to produce X-rays which will be bombarded on enriched 100Mo target to produce 99Mo via (g; n) reaction. 99mTc will be eluted from 99Mo. The photons and neutrons produced in the process should be shielded appropriately to ensure radiation safety. This paper brings out the use of Monte Carlo techniques for photon and neutron shielding for our application. We used FLUKA to calculate the fluence; angular distribution and dose for photons and neutrons. Then; we introduced various layers of lead followed by HDPE; 5% borated HDPE and 40% boron rubber to ensure that the proposed shielding is sufficient to completely shield the photon as well as neutron radiation and hence is safe for operation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab404_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab404.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab404_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB404,

This means that a small beam size at the gantry entrance is required to achieve the required small beam size at the patient. Due to the typically used beam emittance; this in turn results in large beam divergence at the gantry entrance; increasing the possibility of beam losses along the gantry as the beam envelope gets close to the apertures. To maximize transmission through the gantry; we propose a novel beam optics concept using 3:1 imaging. It reduces the beam divergence at the gantry entrance by factor 3 while still achieving a small beam size at the patient. The beam envelope is better controlled and keeps clear of the apertures compared to the 1:1 or 1:2 imaging beam envelope. For PSI Gantry 2; the novel 3:1 imaging beam optics increase the proton beam transmission for lower energies by 40% compare to 1:1 imaging beam optics. The usage of small imaging factors can help to maximize transmission for different gantry lattices; thus reducing treatment times.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab407_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab407.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab407_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB407,

The XCET is a detector used to count the number of selected charged particles in the beam by adjusting the pressure that leads to the emission of Cherenkov photons only above certain pressure threshold. Simultaneously; the charged particles pass from a vacuum environment to the pressurized refractive gas vessel through a solid interface. Minimal material in this solid interface is therefore crucial to avoid interactions of the low-energy particles which may lead to beam intensity loss or background production. Hence; thin and low-density materials are required to mitigate multiple scattering and energy loss of the incoming particles while still allowing the needed pressures inside the counter vessel. A XCET validation methodology was conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA); followed by experimental validations performing burst pressure tests and using Digital Image Correlation (DIC).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/tupab410_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/tupab410.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/tupab410_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-TUPAB410,

ipac2021,,WEIX02,Effective Software Collaboration Between Industry and National Labs,RadiaSoft LLC; Boulder; Colorado; USA; The development and implementation of algorithms is a core competency of universities and research labs; however; the resulting codes can be difficult to use and expensive to maintain. Professional software developers could help to resolve the problem; but they are expensive to hire and difficult to retain. Retention difficulties and associated career pipeline problems are due in part to misaligned incentives. For example; making software sustainable and easy-to-use is orthogonal to publishing in academic journals and; perhaps more problematic; the scientific mission of national laboratories and university departments often does not motivate software developers and data scientists sufficiently to retain them. In contrast; software sustainability and ease-of-use are core competencies of software developers in industry. Hence; it is advantageous for national laboratories and universities to actively and routinely collaborate with industry. This more varied range of employment opportunities and internal institutional incentives will also offer possibilities for more varied career paths and; perhaps; better retention of talented individuals within the community.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/weix02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/weix02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/weix02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEIX02,

A first demonstration experiment of crabbing with hadron beams was successfully carried out with high energy protons. This breakthrough result is fundamental to achieve the physics goals of the high luminosity LHC upgrade project (HL-LHC) and the future circular collider (FCC). The expected peak luminosity gain (related to collision rate) is 65% for HL-LHC; and even greater for the FCC.

In the conventional positron-generation system; a possible scheme to increase the positron intensity is to increase the incident electron beam power (intensity and/or energy). However; the allowable heat load as well as the thermo-mechanical stresses in the target severely limit the allowable beam power of the incident electrons. The positron source community should consolidate the effort and explore different methods of positron production; both classical techniques and especially novel ones; primarily for future high-energy physics applications requiring orders of magnitude higher intensity than what was demonstrated up to now; and for considering future hadronic applications (including the EIC) requiring both polarization and intensity.

At the same time; accelerators have advanced data-acquisition systems that acquire synchronous data at high-rate from a large variety of diagnostics. Here we discuss the application of ghost-imaging (GI) to measure beam parameters; switching the emphasis from beam control to data collection: rather than intentionally manipulating the accelerator; we instead passively monitor jitter gathered over thousands to millions of events to reconstruct the target of interest. Passive monitoring during routine operation builds large data sets that can even deliver higher resolution than brief periodic scans; and can provide experiments with event-by-event information. In this presentation we briefly present applications of GI to light-sources; and then discuss a potential new application for colliders: measuring the transverse beam shapes at a collider’s interaction point to determine both the integrated luminosity and the spatial distribution of collision vertices.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wexa05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wexa05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wexa05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEXA05,

We pursue higher luminosity by squeezing beam sizes and increasing beam currents. Beam backgrounds induced by stray particles will also increase and might cause severe radiation damage to Belle II detector components and worsen the quality of collected physics data. To mitigate these backgrounds; we have carefully designed our interaction region and installed movable collimators in the machine. We present recent measurements of beam background at SuperKEKB. We have performed dedicated machine studies to measure each background component separately and found that beam-gas scattering and Touschek scattering in the positron ring are the dominant sources of background rates in Belle II. We also present the latest observations of injection background; which determines the timing of a required Belle II data acquisition trigger veto and therefore affects the integrated luminosity.

We describe the electron beam characterization and the FEL performance improvement; including the extension of the range of harmonics of the seed which can be amplified; up to the twenty-fifth harmonic; i.e.; 10 nm.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS",,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wexc02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wexc02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wexc02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEXC02,
ipac2021,,WEXC03,Review of Superconducting Radio Frequency Gun,HZDR; Dresden; Germany; The success of proposed high power free-electron lasers (FELs) and energy recovery linac (ERL) largely depends on the development of the electron source; which requires the best beam quality and CW operation. An elegant way to realize this average brilliance is to combine the high beam quality of mature normal conducting radio frequency photoinjector with the quick developing superconducting radio frequency technology; to build superconducting rf photoinjectors (SRF guns). In last decade; several SRF gun programs based on different approaches have achieved promising progress; even succeeded in routine operation at BNL and HZDR [*; **]. In the near future SRF guns are expected to play an important role for hard X-ray FEL facilities. In this contribution; we will review the design concepts; parameters; and the status of the major SRF gun projects.; *I. Petrushina et al.; Phys. Rev. Lett. 124; 244801  **J. Teichert at al.; Phys.

Code results are compared with experimental data from two separate beam dump studies conducted in the present APS SR. Whole beam dumps of the 6-GeV; 200 mA; ultra-low emittance beam will deposit acute doses of 30 MGy within 10 to 20 microseconds; leading to hydrodynamic behavior in the collimator material. Goals for coupling the codes include accurate modeling of the hydrodynamic behavior; methods to mitigate damage; and understanding the effects of the resulting shower downstream of the collimator. Relevant experiments; though valuable; are difficult and expensive to conduct. The coupled codes will provide a method to model differing geometries; materials; and loss scenarios. Efforts thus far have been directed toward using FLASH to reproduce observed damage seen in aluminum test pieces subjected to varying beam strike currents.

This energy range is accomplished on the 2.9 GeV CLS storage ring using an elliptically polarizing undulator (EPU) with a 180 mm period; which we call EPU180. In order to realize circular polarized photons at the end station with this low energy; we must overcome two technical issues. First; the beamline optics distort the polarization of the light; so we compensate by providing light with a flattened; tilted polarization ellipse at the source point - a mode of operation known as universal mode. Second; the device has a strong effect on the electron beam due to dynamic focusing and is capable of reducing the injection efficiency to zero. We overcome this non-linear dynamic focusing using current strips adhered to the vacuum chamber. In this report; we present the first results with operating EPU180 in universal mode and we recover the dynamic aperture using the current strips.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wexc05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wexc05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wexc05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEXC05,

One of the important issues to be solved in this injection is the effect of eddy currents on the stored beam generated in the PMM and its inner coating of the ceramic duct. The magnetic field of the PMM is designed so that it does not affect the stored beam; however; the eddy currents that occurred on the coating give an unwanted kick to the stored beam at the injection.

The application of cesium telluride photocathode has been reported by accelerators all over the world. Alkali based semiconductor photocathode material has always been vapor deposited thin films; with amorphous or very limited crystalline phases. The fragility of alkali-based photocathode partially comes from its disordered and unstable structure. The limited crystallinity also limits the quantum efficiency to improve. Therefore; growing large crystal or even single crystal of the alkali-based photocathode material is the goal of many scientific projects these days. Nucleation of cesium telluride crystalline phase was observed via co-deposition method on atomically thin graphene substrate; which is is a recognized sign of the first step of the formation of single crystal.

For this purpose; the existing LHC storage ring will be combined with an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL); to accelerate electrons up to kinetic energy of 50 GeV. This concept - also applicable to the FCC-eh collider and studied at the PERLE project as prototype version - allows a peak luminosity of 1034 cm-2 s-1. A sophisticated design of the RF structures; linacs; arcs; and interaction region is required. The electrons are accelerated and; after the interaction point; their energy is recovered through the same RF structures. While this energy recovery concept is a very promising approach; severe challenges are set by the layout of the interaction region; the beam separation concept and the design of the linac and arc lattice for the highest possible momentum acceptance. Emittance control and beam-beam effect of both; electron and proton beams; have been studied in front-to-end simulations and will be presented.

The IR design features a ±4.5 m free space for the detector; a forward spectrometer magnet is used for the detection of hadrons scattered under small angles. The hadrons are separated from the neutrons allowing detection of neutrons up to ±4 mrad. On the rear side; the electrons are separated from photons using a weak dipole magnet for the luminosity monitor and to detect scattered electrons (e-tagger). To avoid synchrotron radiation backgrounds in the detector no strong electron bending magnet is placed within 40 m upstream of the IP. The magnet apertures on the rear side are large enough to allow synchrotron radiation to pass through the magnets.

Beam losses are measured by a wide range of detectors with excellent results; most of these devices are used to measure local beam losses. However; in some accelerators there is the need to measure beam losses continuously localized over longer distances i.e.; several tens of meters. For this reason; a beam loss detector based on long optical fibres is now under study. As part of the design; several simulations; comparing different possible detection scenarios; have been performed in FLUKA and bench-marked with experimental data. An experimental campaign was performed with an electron beam in the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) in November 2020.

This paper describes the procedure and outcomes of these tests; the most important of which being the demonstration of the capability of crystal collimation to improve the cleaning efficiency of the machine.

Previously; the 1D model for PCA assumes that the transverse distribution of the density perturbation in the electrons is uniform and consequently; the plasma frequency does not depend on the wavelength of the perturbation. This assumption is valid if the longitudinal wavelength of the beam frame is much shorter than the transverse width of perturbation. In this work; we explore the PCI gain at a long wavelength by assuming the perturbation in the electron density has a non-uniform transverse profile. Specifically; we solve the 3D Poisson equation for given charge distribution (longitudinal sinusoidal; transversely Gaussian; or Beer-can); average the electric field over the transverse plane; and then apply it to 1D Vlasov equation. Similar to the previous calculation; the Vlasov equation can be reduced to a Hill’s equation but the plasma frequency now depends on the longitudinal wavelength of the density perturbation in the electrons. By numerically solving Hill’s equation; we obtain the gain of a PCA and compare it with the results from 3D SPACE simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab031_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab031.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab031_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB031,

Both; the acquisition and software systems at X-band test stand 1 (Xbox1) were upgraded to exhibit low phase noise which is relevant to klystron based CLIC and to the use of crab cavities in the beam delivery system. The new LLRF uses down-conversion which necessitates a local oscillator which can be produced by two different methods. The first is a PLL; a commonly used technique which has been previously employed at the other X-band facilities at CERN. The second is a novel application of a single sideband up-convertor. The up-convertor system has demonstrated reduced phase noise when compared with the PLL. The commissioning of the new system began in late 2020 with the conditioning of a 50 MW Klystron.

The total length of the injector linac needs to be less than 70 m to fit into the existing tunnel. To this end; an RF electron gun with a gridded thermionic cathode directly attached to a 238 MHz RF cavity was developed and adopted. The 500 keV; 0.6 ns; 1 nC beam emitted from the cavity is compressed to 3 ps by velocity bunching driven by a 476 MHz RF cavity and a S-band RF structure. The short-pulsed beams are accelerated up to 1 GeV with 16 C-band RF structures.

One important figure of merit for these injectors is the transverse emittance of the generated electron beam; which can be minimized by shaping the photocathode laser pulses. Best performance can be achieved with ellipsoidal laser pulses; but 3D shaping is technically challenging. Typically; a quasi-uniform transverse laser profile is truncated from the Gaussian profile generated by the laser with an aperture to reduce the transverse nonlinear space charge forces. This is investigated in detail by optimizing the laser transverse profile at the Photoinjector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ); where photoinjector R&D is conducted for the E-XFEL and FLASH free electron lasers at DESY in Hamburg. In this contribution we present experimental results at high acceleration gradients (up to 60 MV/m) for both 250 pC and 500 pC. For a bunch charge of 500 pC an emittance reduction of about 30% compared to the commonly used transverse flat-top laser distribution was achieved.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB040,

This device is an integrated structure consisting of an initial standing-wave 2.5-cell gun connected to a traveling-wave section at the input coupler. Such a scheme nearly avoids power reflection back to the klystron; removing the need for a high-power circulator. It also introduces strong velocity bunching due to a 90° phase shift in the accelerating field. A relatively high cathode electric field of 120 MV/m produces a ~4 MeV beam with ~20 MW input RF power in a small foot-print. The beam transverse dynamics are controlled with a ~0.27 T focusing solenoid. We show the simulation results of the RF/magnetic design and the optimized beam dynamics that shows 6D phase space compensation at 250 pC. Proper beam shaping at the cathode yields a ~0.5 mm-mrad transverse emittance. A beam waist occurs simultaneously with a longitudinal focus of <400 fs rms and peak current >600 A.

Recently; the novel schemes of the sub-terahertz free electron laser (FEL) from a metallic waveguide with corrugated walls and a normal dielectric loaded waveguide driven by a near-relativistic (beam energy of a few MeV) picosecond electron beam were studied respectively. Such a beam is used for driving resonant modes in the waveguide; and if the pipe is long enough; the interaction of these modes with the co-propagating electron beam will result in micro-bunching and the coherent enhancement of the wakefield radiation. It offers a promising candidate for compact accelerator-based high power terahertz source which can be realized with relatively low energy and low peak-current electron beams. However the choices of the waveguide above is less effective in order to obtain high power with frequency around 1THz.

Liquid cryogen-based systems are costly to implement and maintain. As a result; developing cryogenic test facilities at a smaller more cost effective scale using cryo-coolers is attractive. Before real implementations of a cryo-cooler based beamline; a significant amount of information is necessary regarding the behavior and properties of various components and materials at cryogenic temperatures. Finding this information lacking for our particular beamline case and by extension similar electron beamlines; we endeavor to generate a thorough beamline-relevant material and component properties down to the range of a liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K) and the nominal operating temperature of a modest Gifford-McMahon cryocooler (45 K).,"Funding: This work was supported by the Center for Bright Beams, National Science Foundation Grant No. PHY-1549132 and DOE Contract DE-SC0020409",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab098_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab098.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab098_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB098,

For FELs; low MTE cathodes result in a lower requirement for electron energy when lasing at a defined energy; and for a defined electron energy result in lasing at higher energy. For UED experiments; low MTE cathodes give a longer coherence length; allowing measurements on larger unit cell materials. A record low MTE of 5 meV has been recently demonstrated from a Cu (100) surface when measured near the photoemission threshold and cooled down to 30 K with liquid Helium [*]. For UED and XFEL applications that require a high charge density; the low quantum efficiency of Cu (100) near threshold necessitates the use of a high laser fluence to achieve the desired charge density [**]. At high laser fluences the MTE is limited by nonlinear effects; and therefore it is necessary to investigate near photoemission threshold at these high laser fluences.

However; cryo-EMs remain expensive; limiting MicroED’s accessibility. Current cryo-EMs accelerate electrons to 200-300 keV using DC electron guns with a nA of current and low emittance. However at higher voltages these DC guns rapidly grow in size. Replacing these electron guns with a compact linac powered by solid-state sources could lower cost while maintaining beam quality; thereby increasing accessibility. Utilizing compact high shunt impedance X-band structures ensures that each RF cycle contains at most a few electrons; preserving beam coherence. CW operation of the RF linac is possible with distributed solid-state architectures** that use 100W solid-state amplifiers at X-band frequencies. We present an initial design for a prototype low-cost CW RF linac for high-throughput MicroED producing 200 keV electrons with a standing-wave architecture where each cell is individually powered by a solid-state amplifier.

The injection occurs over several turns of the stored beam; which is also perturbed by the injection kickers. The resultant oscillations of the stored beam can negatively affect beamline experiments; so it is desirable to implement an injection scheme which does not disturb the stored beam. Injection schemes of this type allow for transparent injection and are beneficial for planned top-up operations of the CLS storage ring. Many alternative injection techniques were examined as they apply to the CLS storage ring. Pulsed multipole magnets and a non-linear kicker (NLK) are the most viable options for integration with the current ring. Non-linear kicker designs are also being considered for the proposed CLS2 and studying the NLK in the limitations of the current machine provides insight to guide the work on the new machine. Simulation with the accelerator code ELEGANT shows the viability of the non-linear kicker design as developed at BESSY; MAX IV and SOLEIL for transparent injection at the CLS.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab121_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab121.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab121_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB121,

As part of this project; the injection system has to be upgraded as well in order to ensure reliable and efficient injection in the reduced beam aperture. A 4 kicker bump and a new thin septum will ensure the conventional injection in the SR. To further minimize the perturbation of the stored beam during injection two new schemes are in development: ""Fast"" and ""Super-fast"" one. The ""Fast"" injection scheme should be able to ensure single-bunch off-axis top-up injection affecting only 10 to 20 SR bunches that are 2 ns apart. The ""Super-fast"" one should bring the perturbed bunches down to only one. In on-axis mode it should be able to inject a top-up bunch between two SR bunches with minimum disturbance of the adjacent ones. To do this a combination of special beam injection schemes and an extremely fast (ns) kicker system is required.

This transient requires that multibunch feedback be masked for those buckets into which charge is injected. The masking significantly diminishes the damping capability of the multibunch feedback system. This problem is exacerbated by the large injection transient. The higher order resistive wall wake fields in the accumulator ring exceed the radiation damping time. To study whether the beam will remain multibunch stable during an injection cycle; a multibunch tracking simulation is used that simulates the multibunch feedback system and also pseudomode representation of resistive wall wake fields.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab123_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab123.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab123_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB123,

One of the promising techniques is the Coulomb explosion acceleration (CEA)**. Using CEA in clusters could result in symmetric acceleration if there are not any other significant mechanisms. We proposed a THz-driven accelerator scheme that is based on CEA in proton; deuterium and heavy water gas plasmas. Two counter-propagating THz pulses are focused to the ionized region of the gas jet. Following the ripping of the electrons from the gas plasmas by ultrafast standing waves; the Coulomb explosion accelerates the positive ions. According to our calculation; using 2 x 34 mJ THz pulses electrons and protons with 1.1 nC charge are accelerated up to 0.4 MeV and 0.1 MeV; respectively. The total energy of the particles is 0.7 % of the energy of the THz pulses. We examined the effect of the initial bunch charge; bunch size and shape on the final energy spectra and the directional distribution of the particles. Our presented technique is scalable from a few µm to a few thousand µm driving wavelengths and can be used for electron and heavy-ion acceleration.; *J. Badziak; IOP Conf. Series: J Phys: Conf.

To realize higher positron yield; higher magnetic field is desired. However; higher field by higher current generate stronger force on the coil. Since the gap between each turn of the coil is as narrow as 0.2 mm and the voltage across them is about as high as 1 kV at the design current; slight deformation of the coil cause discharge between the gap. To avoid such problem; a new FC made of Cu alloy which has 40 times higher yield strength than that of pure Cu was designed and tested. Finally; during summer shutdown in 2020; the old FC made of pure Cu was replaced by the new one made of Cu alloy in the KEK electron positron injector linac. The new one has been working stably at the design current; 12 kA; since Oct. 2020; and positron yield of 0.5 was realized.

The nanoblade; akin to a nanotip extruded in one lateral dimension; may reach upwards of 40 GV/m due to its robust thermomechanical properties. This increased surface field promises brighter electron emissions. We perform simulations of strong-field emissions from metallic nanoblades via the 1-D time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation with effective Jellium and nonlinear collective image charge potentials; including the strong field gradients induced by the nanostructure.

It is capable of generating a high charge beam and handling moderate vacuum conditions. Integrating it with an efficient RF cavity could therefore provide a compact electron source for RF injectors. Understanding the performance metrics of the emitter in RF fields is essential toward developing such a device. We investigated a test setup of the field emitter at the X-band frequency. The setup included an X-band cavity operating at the TM02 mode. The field emitter material will be plated on the tip of a insertion rod on the cavity back plate. Part of the back plate and the emitter rod are demountable; allowing for exchange of the field emitters. The TM02 mode was chosen such that the design of the demountable back plate does not induce field enhancement at the installation gap. The cavity were optimized to achieve a high surface field at the emitter tip and a maximum energy gain of the emitted electrons at a given input power.

To cool the antiproton beam at this low energy; the electron gun must emit electrons with as monoenergetic a distribution as possible. The currently used thermionic gun limits the cooling performance due to the relatively high transverse energy spread of the emitted electrons. Optimization is therefore being studied; aiming at developing a cold-cathode electron gun. This has led to the investigation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as cold electron field emitters. CNTs are considered the most promising field emitter material due to their high aspect ratio; chemical stability; and capability to deliver high current densities. To assess the feasibility of using such material operationally a full characterization is required; focussing on key parameters such as emitted current; emission stability; and lifetime.

The original LLRF control system was replaced with the new system in 2019; which can control the amplitudes of the higher harmonics as well as the fundamental and second harmonics. Therefore we consider to use additionally the third harmonic voltage for further improvement of the bunching factor during acceleration. By the triple-harmonic operation; the flat RF bucket can be realized with a higher synchronous phase and improvement of the bunching factor is expected.

Eight bunches of high peak current are extracted by the extraction kickers; therefore the neutrino beam has a similar time structure. The new Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be constructed for the future neutrino experiment and a low peak time structure is desired by the IWCD. Thus; we consider bunch manipulation at flattop of the MR for reducing the peak current. The manipulation requires a longer repetition period to extend the flattop. This reduces the output beam power. The manipulation should be quickly done to minimize the loss of the beam power. Also; the beam gap must be kept for the rise time of the extraction kicker. We propose a non-adiabatic bunch manipulation using the multiharmonic rf voltage. By using the neighbor harmonic of the accelerating harmonic; the first and eighth bunches can be decelerated and accelerated; respectively. After a certain period; the rf phase is flipped to pi for debunching. Thanks to the initial deceleration and acceleration; the beam gap for the kickers is kept.

Among those; there is the KLEVER experiment that would require an intensity of 2x1013 protons per 4.8 s long spill. The main goal of the experiment is to measure BR(KL->pi0 nu nu) to test the Standard Model structure by itself; and in combination with results from NA62 for BR(K±>pi+ nu nu). NA62 could also profit from higher intensities; and could be run in a new configuration called NA62HI(gher intensity). In the current configuration the beam is transported from the SPS to the TT24 beamline. This beamline leads to the T4 target that attenuates the beam for P42. After T4 the beam is directed into the P42 beamline before impinging on the T10 target and creating the particles necessary for the experiment. Those are finally transported to the detector via K12. This paper presents the idea of partially bypassing T4 and changing the P42 beamline configuration in order to have a sufficiently small beam size at the T10 target for both KLEVER and NA62-HI.

The ENUBET project is proposing a novel facility; capable of constraining the neutrino flux normalization through the precise monitoring of the Ke3 (K±>e+pi0nu) decay products in an instrumented decay tunnel.

ipac2021,,WEPAB188,New Method to Search for Axion-Like Particles Demonstrated with Polarized Beam at the COSY Storage Ring,Jagiellonian University; Kraków; Poland; The axion was originally proposed to explain the small size of CP violation in quantum chromodynamics. It might be a candidate for dark matter in the universe. Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) when coupled to gluons induce an oscillating Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) along the nucleon’s spin direction. At the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) in Jülich; this principle was used to perform a first test experiment to search for ALPs using an in-plane polarized deuteron beam. If the spin precession frequency equals the EDM oscillation frequency; a resonance occurs that accumulates the rotation of the polarization out of the ring plane. Since the axion frequency is unknown; the beam momentum was ramped to search for a vertical polarization jump that would occur when the resonance is crossed. At COSY; four beam bunches with different polarization directions were used to make sure that no resonance was missed because of the unknown relative phase between the polarization precession and the EDM oscillations. We scanned a frequency window of about a 1-kHz width around the spin precession frequency of 121 kHz.

The EIC operating specification requires shorter bunches and 3x higher intensity beams which are not appropriate for the present RHIC stainless steel cold-bore beam tube. The intensity and emittance of the hadron beams will degrade due to interactions with residual gas or vacuum instabilities arising from the expected resistive-wall (RW) heating; electron clouds; and beam-induced desorption mechanisms. Without strategies to limit RW heating; major cryogenic system modifications are needed to prevent SC magnet quenches. The SC magnet cold-bore beam tubes will be equipped with a high RRR copper clad stainless steel sleeve to significantly reduce RW heating and so the effect on the SC magnet cryogenic heat load and temperature. A thin amorphous carbon film applied to the beam facing copper surface will suppress electron cloud formation.

The EIC design calls for up to 10-times shorter ion bunches compared to the present RHIC operation. Higher single bunch peak currents will result in higher voltages to the output ports of the BPMs consequently producing more heating of the cryogenic signal cables connected to these output ports. Therefore; the existing stripline BPMs should be either upgraded or replaced with new ones. In this paper; we explore the potentially cost-effective approach by incorporating an RF-shielding piece into the existing BPMs as opposed to replacing them completely. Starting with the power delivered to the output ports; we present the proposed BPM modification with the RF-shielding piece. Then we discuss in detail the RF-shielding piece geometry including the dimension of RF slot and RF-fingers configuration. Finally; we present the optimization of the shielding piece and the mechanical tolerances required for its fabrication.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab194_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab194.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab194_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB194,

IsoDAR uses an especially designed low-frequency spilt-coaxial radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) to accelerate H2+ ions directly from the ion source into the main cyclotron accelerator. This paper mainly focuses on the design and optimization of a low frequency (32.8 MHz) RF-input coupler for the IsoDAR RFQ.

For energy sweep extraction; a C+5 beam is injected; captured and trapped in the barrier bucket. A fraction of the beam is continuously released from the barrier bucket by controlling the timing of barrier pulse generation. Released C+5 ions merge into the coasting beam and moves inwards with ramping of the guiding main magnets. Ions in the coasting beam eventually hit the carbon foil placed inside the beam chamber wall. As a result; C+5 is converted to C+6 and beam orbit is largely changed as it traverses through the downstream bending magnet. This notably facilitates C+6 beam extraction; resulting in a relatively small kick angle of the septum magnet. When the septum is excited in the same way as that of the main magnets; the extracted C+6 beam always places on the center of the irradiation beam line. LISE++ simulations demonstrated the charge exchange efficiency of almost 100 % for expected beam energy. The feasibility of the switching power supply for the septum magnet has been studied.; * PRAB 24; 011601 (2021),,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab208_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab208.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab208_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB208,

As a result; the injected beam power will quadruple to 17 kW. Safe operation at the increased beam power implies careful attention to the origin; magnitude; and distribution of both controlled and uncontrolled losses. Uncontrolled losses are due to neutral ions in excited states stripped in downstream magnets and large angle scattered protons from parasitic foil hits. The relative magnitudes of these loss mechanisms is used to determine the optimal foil thickness. A transverse painting scheme involving closed orbit motion will be used to mitigate space charge effects and minimize parasitic foil hits.

In the present work; the Oide-Yokoya eigenvalue method of solving the linearised Vlasov equation was used to shed light on the mechanism of longitudinal single-bunch instability in the CERN SPS. In particular; semi-analytical calculations were done for the full longitudinal impedance model; taking into account the RF nonlinearity. The obtained results agree well with macro-particle simulations and are consistent with available beam measurements. For the first time; the instability has been interpreted as a coupling of radial modes within a single azimuthal mode; due to a strong potential-well distortion of the synchrotron-frequency distribution. To avoid this instability; a higher RF voltage is required at a given emittance. Thus; the instability mechanism is very different from the loss of Landau damping; which; in contrast; is mitigated by a lower RF voltage. This understanding also allowed us to optimise the RF voltage programmes during the acceleration cycle for high-intensity bunches used in the AWAKE experiment at CERN.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab227_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab227.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab227_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB227,

Due to the high spatial compression under these conditions; the self-interaction of the bunch with its own emitted CSR induces a wake-field; which significantly influences the longitudinal charge distribution. Above a given threshold current; this leads to the formation of dynamically evolving micro-structures within the bunch and is thus called micro-bunching instability. As CSR is emitted at wavelengths corresponding to the spatial dimension of the emitter; these small structures lead to an increased emission of CSR at higher frequencies. The instability is therefore deliberately induced at KARA to provide intense THz radiation to dedicated experiments. To further increase the emitted power in the desired frequency range; we consider the potential of RF amplitude modulations to intentionally excite this form of micro-bunching in short electron bunches.

With the new 75 ns variant; three instead of four bunches are generated each cycle in the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) and the Proton Synchrotron (PS) with up to 30% larger intensity per bunch. The beam was produced with satisfactory quality but at the limit of stability in the injectors.

A beam slice analysis has been performed in order to understand the evolution of the relevant physical parameters of the beam in the longitudinal and transverse phase spaces along the structure. A simple model for the envelope equation has been developed to describe the beam behavior in this particular dynamics regime that we term ""triple waist""; since all three dimensions reach a minimum condition almost simultaneously.

Ionization cooling; whereby beam emittance is reduced by passing a beam through an energy-absorbing material; requires tight focusing in the transverse plane which is achieved in many designs using solenoid focusing. In solenoid focusing; the beam acquires kinetic angular momentum due to the radial field in the solenoid fringe. Cooling in ‘flip’ mode; where the beam-focusing solenoid field changes polarity at the absorber; has already been demonstrated in the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). In this mode the absorber is near to the field flip; so the kinetic angular momentum is zero at the absorber. ‘Solenoid mode’ cooling; where the field polarity does not change across the absorber leading to a beam crossing the absorber with significant kinetic angular momentum; has been considered for the final section of the muon collider design due to potentially stronger focussing that it enables.

The current BIS has been in service since 2006; as such; it is approaching the end of its operational lifetime; with most components being obsolete. A second version of the Beam Interlock System; ""BIS2""; is currently under development and will replace the current system. BIS2 aims to be more flexible by supplying additional on-board diagnostic tools; while also improving the overall safety by adding more redundancy. Crucially; BIS2 increases the number of critical paths that can be interlocked by almost 50%; providing an important flexibility for future additional interlocking requests. BIS2 will come into operation for the LHC in run 4 (2027) and will remain in operation until the end of the planned lifetime of HL-LHC. In this paper; we will focus on the Beam Interlock Controller Manager board (CIBM); which is at the heart of BIS2.

The electrons are generated at the RF photoinjector; where the electron gun is driven by a commercial titanium sapphire laser. In this kind of setup the electron beam properties are determined by the photoinjector; but more importantly by the characteristics of the laser pulses. Spatial light modulators can be used to transversely and longitudinally shape the laser pulse; offering a flexible way to shape the laser beam and subsequently the electron beam; influencing the produced THz pulses. However; nonlinear effects inherent to the laser manipulation (transportation; compression; third harmonic generation) can distort the original pulse.

The model helps in understanding the machine and predicts the impact of a change in the settings (e.g. current of magnetic elements). For the COoler SYnchrotron (COSY) at Research Center Jülich the accelerator simulation software MAD-X is used to model the machine. The model parameters are steadily being improved based on various manual adjustments and analytical studies; however are hardly optimized all at once. This can be improved with machine learning methods. The model is used to predict measurable quantities; like Orbit Response Matrix (ORM) or betatron tunes. Several observables for different particle energies have been measured recently and the corresponding machine settings are available. We describe the effort to improve the agreement between measured and calculated ORMs and hence improve the agreement between model and (real) machine and report on the optimization using a multivariate algorithm (e.g. genetic algorithm). This facilitates the setup of COSY and will allow to perform high precision experiments e.g. a measurement of an electric dipole moment of deuterons at COSY.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab302_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab302.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab302_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB302,

With both data sources comparable tune correction accuracies were achieved; both; in real machine operation and for the simulated storage ring model.

In each generation; a surrogate model is constructed for each objective function with the sample data. The models are used to evaluate solutions and to select the ones with a high potential before they are evaluated on the actual system. Since the trial solutions selected by the GP models tend to have better performance than other methods that only rely on random operations; the new algorithm has much higher efficiency in exploring the parameter space.

Optimization of cooling with LEReC requires fine-tuning of numerous LEReC parameters. In this work; initial optimization results of using Machine Learning (ML) methods - Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Q-learning are presented. Specially; we focus on exploring the influence of the electron trajectory on the cooling rate. In the first part; simulations are conducted by utilizing a LEReC simulator. The results show that both methods have the capability of deriving electron positions that can optimize the cooling rate. Moreover; BO takes fewer samples to converge than the Q-learning method. In the second part; Bayesian optimization is further trained on the historical cooling data.

To prototype such a model, we demonstrate how a machine learning based surrogate model of the SLAC LCLS-II photocathode injector was developed. To create machine-based data, laser measurements were taken at the LCLS using the virtual cathode camera. These measurements were used to sample particles, resulting in realistic electron bunches, which were then propagated through the injector via the Astra space charge simulation. By doing this, the model is not only able to predict many bulk electron beam parameters and distributions which are often hard to measure or not usually available to measure, but the predictions are more realistic relative to traditionally simulated training data.

The APS-U DAQ system collects high-quality fast data from underneath embedded controllers; especially the FPGAs; with the manner of time-correlation and synchronously sampling; which could be used for commissioning; performance monitoring; troubleshooting; and early fault detection; etc. This paper presents the design and latest progress of APS-U high-performance DAQ infrastructure; as well as its preparation to enable the use of machine learning technology for APS-U; and its use cases at APS.,"Funding: Argonne National Laboratory’s work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab323_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab323.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab323_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB323,

However; the apparatus used for this diagnostic had a large size and complex design which limit the broad use of this diagnostic for tomography of accelerated bunches. We propose a new approach to electron beam tomography: we will generate a continuous sheet of electrons. As the ion beam bunches pass through the sheet; they cause distortions in the distribution of sheet electrons arriving at CCD device on the other side of the beam that is interpreted to give a continuous measurement of the beam profile. The apparatus to generate the sheet beam is a strip cathode; which; compared to the scanning electron beam probe; is smaller; has a simpler design and less expensive manufacturing; has better magnetic shielding; has higher sensitivity; higher resolution; has better accuracy of measurement and better time resolution. With this device; it is possible to develop almost ideal tomography diagnostics of bunches in linear accelerators and in circular accelerators and storage rings.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab327_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab327.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab327_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB327,

One technique that is commonly used to analyze the composition of solid surfaces and thin films is secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). SIMS devices are very complex and expensive. We propose to develop simpler; less expensive surface analysis devices; based on glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GOES) that can provide excellent spatial resolution. Ions from a plasma discharge sputtered atoms from the surface and the discharge electrons effectively excite and ionize the sputtered atoms. GOES uses the light emitted by the excited particles for quantitative analysis. In the GOES device; the ion flux is extracted from the gas-discharge plasma and focused to a micron size on the sample; providing very local sputtering and local elemental analysis. The radiation from the sputtered atoms is passed through an optical fiber to an optical spectrometer and recorded.

These free charges can be measured as electric current to diagnose the photon beam intensity; profile; position; or stability. Sirius; the new 3GeV fourth-generation Brazilian light source; may accommodate up to 38 beamlines; which combined will make use of hundreds of instruments to measure such low-intensity signals. This work reports on the design and test results of a transimpedance amplifier developed for low current measurements at Sirius’ beamlines. The device presents low noise; high accuracy; and good temperature stability providing 5 selectable ranges (from 500pA to 7.3mA) to measure bipolar currents achieving femtoampere resolution under certain conditions. Considering low bandwidth applications; the results suggest noise performance comparable to commercial bench instruments.

The NEG coating materials used in the LHC are alloys of titanium; zirconium; and vanadium. In high-power beam accelerators; titanium has been used as the beam pipe chamber material due to its low radio activation characteristics. The ordinal titanium surface has no getter function because it is covered with a titanium oxide film. The new technique; which removes the titanium-oxide surface by some methods; such as baking or sputtering; has been investigated. The dependence of the surface oxide film and the getter characteristics on the baking temperature have been measured. Also; by sputtering the inner surface of the titanium chamber; clear evidence that shows the chamber acts as a vacuum pump has been obtained.

Studies ascribed the heat source to electron cloud build-up; indicating an unexpectedly high Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) of the beam screen surface in some LHC regions. During the Long Shutdown 2; the beam screens of a low and a high heat load dipole were extracted. Their inner copper surface was analysed in the laboratory to compare their SEY and surface composition. While findings on the low heat load beam screens are compatible with expectations from laboratory studies of copper conditioning and deconditioning mechanisms; an extremely low carbon amount and the presence of CuO (non-native surface oxide) are observed on the high heat-load beam screens. The azimuthal distribution of CuO correlates with the density and energy of electron impingement. Such chemical modifications increase the SEY and inhibit the full conditioning of affected surfaces. This work shows a direct correlation between the abnormal LHC heat load and the surface properties of its beam screens; opening the door to the development of curative solutions to overcome this critical limitation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab339_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab339.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab339_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB339,

Dilution kicker magnets (MKBs) sweep the extracted beam over the cross-sectional area of a dump block as the energy density would otherwise be too high and damage the block. In 2018; a high voltage flashover occurred in a vertical MKB (MKBV) vacuum tank; during a beam dump; which resulted in non-ideal sweep of the beam over the block. The location of the flashover could not be identified during a subsequent inspection of the magnet. Hence; electrical field simulations have been carried out to identify potentially critical regions; to determine the most probable region of the flashover. One potentially critical region is a rectangular beam pipe (RBP) between the end of the tank and the MKBV magnet; whose purpose is to reduce plasma propagation to the adjacent tank in the event of a flashover.

The frequency content of pulses associated with a ferrite loaded transmission line kicker magnet generally extend up to a few tens of MHz: hence; it is feasible to accurately model such a kicker magnet using lumped elements. This modelling technique is powerful since it in general has a run time several orders of magnitude shorter than a full wave electromagnetic simulation. In this paper; we determine values; including those of parasitic components; using modern simulation tools; for use in the lumped equivalent circuit models. In addition; the paper describes a method to simulate coupling between beam and the electrical circuit of a kicker magnet at relatively low frequencies: this allows one to use circuit analysis tools to study means of mitigating beam induced resonances.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab346_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab346.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab346_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB346,

For fast extraction of the particle beam from the SIS100; an extraction kicker is used. This extraction kicker will be a bipolar system; this way it works as an emergency kicker at the same time. The fast kicker systems have to produce a current pulse >6 kA. To achieve this; energy storages are charged up to voltages >70 kV and are quickly discharged. The pulse durations vary from 0.5 us to 7 us; depending on the kicker type and the operation mode.

Circular waveguide TM01 mode is one of the symmetric modes; that is suitable to use for RF coupling. TM01 mode launcher is used as an RF coupler in Accelerator technology*. Design of a compact circular waveguide TM01 mode-launcher is presented in this paper. The design is based on the principle of magnetic field coupling between a wire loop and TM01 mode of circular waveguide. The mode launcher exhibits high efficiency and 3.1% bandwidth at 3.2 GHz frequency with both circular and elliptical loop. Performance of the mode launcher is experimentally verified and simulated S-parameters agree with the measured results. The mode launcher is of compact size and is suitable for efficient excitation of TM01 mode in circular waveguide and travelling wave structures.

Preliminary investigations show the inductive voltage adder is suitable as a pulse generator for this application. To increase the magnetic field without raising the system voltage; a short-circuit termination is often applied to a kicker magnet. Because of the electrical length of a transmission line magnet; wave propagation needs to be considered. To allow for the wavefront reflected from the short-circuit termination back to the generator; a novel approach for an inductive adder architecture has been investigated. It is based on a modified generator interface; circulating the current back into the load; until the stored energy is absorbed at the end of the pulse. This approach allows for a smaller magnetic core size compared to a conventional design with a matched load. Moreover; it enables more energy-efficient operation involving smaller storage capacitors. This paper summarizes the conceptual design features and furthermore gives an overview of the parameter space for possible applications at CERN.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab351_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab351.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab351_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB351,

To reach the position stability requirement of the stored beam; a single pulsed magnet with no field on the stored beam path can replace the 4 kickers. Such a device; called MIK (Multipole Injection Kicker); was developed by SOLEIL and successfully commissioned in the MAX-IV 3-GeV ring as the key device used in the standard injection scheme for user operation; reducing the beam orbit distortion below 1 micron in peak value in both planes.

A bent crystal has the potential in a few millimeters to deflect 100-1000 GeV particle beams as much as an hundreds-tesla magnetic dipole. Indeed; within the lattice of a crystal; large electric fields up to several GeV/cm are present. Positive charged particles can be efficiently channeled between two adjacent lattice planes; thus following their curvature. These features and the possibility to selectively affect only the portion of the beam intercepting the crystal led to the proposal of exploiting bent crystals for several purposes; such as the collimation of ions at LHC. In this scheme; the particles on the beam halo instead of being scattered by tens-centimeters long collimators are directly separated from the beam using a 4 mm long silicon crystal. The production of a bent crystal suitable for installation in the LHC beamline requires strict control over lattice features and bending apparatus.

The raster system paints the beam on the target with frequencies up to 40 kHz within the 2.86 ms beam pulse; to form a uniformly expanded beam footprint. While the beam raster reduces the time-averaged beam current density to a level that the 5 years of design lifetime of the target system can be achieved with a high operational reliability; it could potentially induce deleterious dynamic excitations in the spallation volume made of tungsten. The stress wavelets created by raster sweeps can be amplified if the sweep frequency is in tune with a resonance mode of the tungsten volume. This coherent interference of the wavelets could lead to a high dynamic stress in tungsten; posing a risk of premature failure of the target. In this paper; the dynamic response of the spallation volume of the ESS target to different beam raster frequencies has been analysed; using multi-physics simulations based on measured material data.

About 2 MW will go to the first target station; while the rest will go to the future second target station. The first target station uses a mercury target. When the short proton beam pulse hits it; strong pressure waves are developed inside the mercury and the vessel itself; causing weld failures and cavitation erosion. The pressure wave can be significantly mitigated by injecting small helium bubbles into the mercury. SNS has been injecting helium since 2017 using small orifices but has met challenges in fabrication and operations with them. Thus; for the 2 MW target; swirl bubblers will be used to increase gas injection and improve reliability. A 2 MW prototypical target was built and tested in a mercury process loop available at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

It absorbs particles extracted from the accelerator whenever required. The original design of the TDE dates from the mid 2000 and it is constituted of an eight-meter-long cylindrical stainless-steel tube; filled with low-Z carbon-based materials from different grades and densities. The Sigraflex®; an expanded low-density graphite; is employed in the middle section of the TDE core. Due to unexpected behaviour observed in the past LHC runs; several major upgrades were recently implemented in order for the TDE to be ready for LHC Run3 (2021-2024); where up to 555 MJ beam energy is expected to be dumped every few hours. According simulations; temperatures in the Sigraflex core will reach locally up to 1500°C in the regular dump cases; and above 2300°C for failure scenarios. The objective of this contribution is to summarize the LS2 hardware upgrades and the plan for the evaluation of the Sigraflex performance during LHC Run3. This work will also detail the last experimental and numerical findings applied to the Sigraflex®; and possible alternative materials for the future.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab368_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab368.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab368_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB368,

To improve old switches; schemes of upgrading and developing new and efficient transfer switches have been conducted cautiously. A new device named an Uninterruptible Paralleling Transfer Switch (UPTS) is designed and implemented to replace an existing ATS to enhance the performance to meet the requirements of uninterrupted power transfer. The UPTS can uninterruptedly switch the grid power to emergency power of a backup generator during a planned utility power outage; and also exactly switch emergency power to the grid power uninterruptedly when the utility power is restored. If grid power is unexpectedly lost; UPTS acts like a typical ATS; automatically transferring power from a primary source to a backup source with switching duration a few seconds. A practical UPTS has been assembled and installed in Utility Building II and has performed well effectively to eliminate power-switching transients.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/wepab372_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/wepab372.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/wepab372_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-WEPAB372,

Beam instability has been a significant problem with storage rings’ performance for many decades. The proton storage ring (PSR) at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANCE) is no exception. To mitigate the instability; it was found that ferrite inductive inserts can be used to bunch the protons that are diverging due to the electron background. The PSR was the first storage ring to successfully use inductive inserts to mitigate the longitudinal instability with normal production beams. However; years later new machine upgrades facilitate shorter; more intense beams to meet the needs of researchers. The ferrite inserts used to reduce the transverse instabilities induce a microwave instability with the shorter more intense proton beam.

For the booster ring; a total of 600-kW continuous-wave (CW) RF power is generated by six 500-MHz solid-state power amplifiers (SSA) and fed into six normal-conducting copper cavities. Concerning the storage ring; five CW 260-kW SSAs at 166 MHz and two CW 260-kW SSAs at 500-MHz are used to drive five fundamental and two third-harmonic superconducting cavities respectively. The RF power distributions are realized by 9-3/16"" rigid coaxial line for the 166-MHz system and EIA standard WR1800 waveguide for the 500-MHz one.

Analytical light is transmitted simultaneously with the timing of electron beam irradiation; and its absorption by reactive species is detected. Since the target reactions arise in pico second time scale or even shorter; analytical light is required to have such duration. Besides; so as not to be buried in noise of the radiation source; the optical power of the analytical light must be high enough. Furthermore; it is desirable that the analytical light covers visible region because important absorptions caused by irradiation products such as hydrated electron; hydroxyl radical; or so exist in the region. We considered that the supercontinuum light generated from an ultrashort pulse laser is suitable as an analytical light because it has all these characteristics. In this study; we generate the second harmonic (775 nm) of an erbium fiber laser (1550 nm) as a seed laser for supercontinuum generation.

As a low-Z metal; it allows high-energy photons to penetrate the mirror body; so that majority of the SR power is dissipated; resulting in a significantly reduced thermal stress and distortion on the mirror surface. In this paper; we describe a Finite Element Analysis method of accurately simulating the SR-induced thermal stress on the beryllium mirrors at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring at various particle beam conditions. The simulations consider the energy dependence of X-ray attenuation in beryllium. The depth-dependent distribution of the power absorbed by the mirror is represented by separate heating zones within the mirror model. The results help set the operational safety limit for the mirrors-ensuring that the SR-induced thermal stress is below the elastic deformation limit and estimate the mirror surface distortion at high beam currents.

While the community holds a broad understanding of the mechanisms leading to emittance growth and halo formation; there is outstanding discrepancy between measurements and beam evolution models that precludes prediction of halo losses. This may be due in part to insufficient information of the initial beam distribution. This talk will describe work at the SNS Beam Test Facility to directly measure the 6D beam distribution. Full-and-direct 6D measurement has revealed hidden but physically significant dependence between the longitudinal distribution and transverse coordinates. This nonlinear correlation is driven by space charge and reproduced by self-consistent simulation of the RFQ. Omission of this interplane correlation; common when bunches are reconstructed from lower-dimensional measurements; degrades downstream predictions. This talk will also describe the novel diagnostics supporting this work.

Recent experimental measurements indicate that in some parameter regimes; IBS can have a significant influence on microbunched beam dynamics. Here we develop a theoretical formulation* of microbunching instability (MBI) in the presence of IBS for single-pass accelerators. We start from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation; combining both collective longitudinal space charge and incoherent IBS effects. The linearized VFP equation with the corresponding coefficients is derived. The evolutions of the phase space density and energy modulations are formulated as a set of coupled integral equations. The formulation** is then applied to a simplified single-pass transport line.

Typical numerical approximations on electron cooling processes assume that the density distribution of electrons in analytical form and the velocity distribution space to be Maxwellian. However; it is useful to have an accurate description of the cooling process based on a realistic electron distribution. In this contribution; BETACOOL simulations of the ELENA antiproton beam phase space evolution were performed using uniform; Gaussian; and ""hollow beam"" electron velocity distributions.

Traditionally; to measure chromatic properties; the relative momentum is changed step-wise; which is time-consuming and almost impractical during the energy ramp. We present an optics measurement method based on adiabatic simultaneous 3-dimensional beam excitation; which is more time-efficient and well fitted for the energy ramp. This method was successfully demonstrated in the LHC utilising AC-dipoles in combination either with a slow RF-frequency modulation or a driven RF-phase modulation close to the synchrotron frequency. Faster longitudinal oscillations improve the accuracy of optics parameters inferred from the synchro-betatron sidebands.

The iORM consists in the orbit correctors magnets (OCM) strength changes needed to produce a local orbit variation in each beam position monitor (BPM). This measurement can be implemented by introducing sequentially small changes in the BPM offsets and logging the OCM setting variations when the orbit correction is running. Very high precision and accuracy in the OCM set-points is required which poses a considerable challenge. Since the orbit feedback (FOFB) is kept running; the iORM could potentially be acquired in parallel to users storage ring operation. Since the iORM is very linear and local; optics perturbations could be easily diagnosed online. This paper introduces the iORM measurement concept and presents the progress of these studies at ALBA; where the implementation of this technique is limited by hysteresis effects in the OCM and the FOFB performance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thxb05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thxb05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thxb05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THXB05,

For the latest generation light sources; whose magnetic lattice is optimized for achieving very low emittance; the tolerable misalignments are in the order of a few dozen micrometers. Due to the perimeter of these machines; the requirements push the limits of large-volume dimensional metrology and associated instruments and techniques. Recently a fine alignment campaign of the Sirius accelerators was conducted following the pre-alignment performed during the installation phase. To conform with the strict relative positioning demands; measurement good practices were followed; and several 3D metrology procedures were developed. Also; to improve positioning resolution; high rigidity translation devices were produced. Finally; the special target holders designed as removable fiducials for the magnets were revisited to assure maximum reliability.

Nonetheless; these sources suffer from a few shortcomings such as incoherent radiation and low-efficiency in radiation generation. This contribution presents a novel scheme based on the scattering of an optical beam from a trapped electron beam inside an optical cavity. Inverse-Compton scattering off both free and trapped electrons are simulated using a full-wave solution of first-principle equations based on FDTD/PIC in the co-moving frame of electron beams. It is shown that the strong space-charge effect in low-energies is the main obstacle in acquiring coherent gain through the ICS mechanism. Subsequently; it is shown that by trapping the electron beam to the high-intensity spots; the space-charge effect is compensated; and additionally; the ultrahigh charge density enables high FEL-gain at trapping spots; thereby augmenting the coherence of the output radiation and concurrently increasing the source efficiency by three orders of magnitude.,Funding: This work is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under the Spark grant CRSK-2-190840.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thxb07_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thxb07.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thxb07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THXB07,

Recently; a different paradigm for increasing the therapeutic index of radiation therapy has emerged; supported by preclinical research based on the FLASH radiation effect. FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) refers to novel radiation techniques delivering therapeutic radiation doses with ultra-high dose rates. Experimental studies have shown that normal tissues seem to be universally spared by FLASH-RT; whereas tumors are not. The dose delivery conditions are not fully characterized; but it is estimated that doses (>10 Gy) delivered in >100 ms produce optimal sparing effects. There are many technical challenges for the accelerator communities to create and monitor the required dose rates with novel and compact accelerators and fast large-area monitors for FLASH-RT; to ensure safe and reproducible beam delivery.

ipac2021,,THXC02,Enhancing Particle Beam Therapy Through the Use of Mixed Ion Beams,UCL; London; United Kingdom; Particle beam therapy treatment with protons and light ions provides significant improvements over conventional X-ray radiotherapy due to the Bragg peak. However; the improved dose conformity of particle therapy requires a corresponding improvement in the accuracy of dose delivery to prevent underdosing of the tumour and overdosing of the surrounding healthy tissue. In vivo measurements of dose delivery have proved challenging: real-time systems for measuring delivered dose have yet to be realised. One possibility for ion therapy systems is through Helium-Carbon mixing. By diluting the Carbon treatment beam with a small quantity of Helium ions and accelerating to the same energy per nucleon; a diagnostic signal can be obtained: with a negligible increase to the delivered dose; the Helium beam exits the patient; providing diagnostic information on the tissue being treated and thereby providing real-time information on the position and range accuracy of the delivered dose. This talk describes the background to ion beam therapy and gives insight into experiments carried out to realise clinical Helium-Carbon mixing.

However; to reach the needed luminosity; beam intensities of the order of 109–1012 muons per bunch are needed. In this context; the Beam-Induced Background must be taken into account for its effects on magnets and detector. Several mitigation strategies can however be conceived. In this view; it is of crucial importance to develop a flexible tool that allows to easily reconstruct the machine geometry in a Monte Carlo code; allowing to simulate in detail the interaction of muon decay products in the machine; while being able to change the machine optics itself to find the best configuration. In this contribution; a possible approach to such a purpose is presented; based on FLUKA for the Monte Carlo simulation and on LineBuilder for the geometry reconstruction.

Indeed; the emittance blow-up of the few meters around the interaction point (IP) at lower energies is comparable to the emittance introduced by the rest of the 100 km ring. Vertical emittance is the single most important factor in achieving high performance (luminosity; in this case) in a modern e+ e− storage ring such as the FCC-ee. The design adopted is the simplest possible arrangement that can nevertheless deliver high performance: two additional coils per IP side. The performance achieved is such that vertical emittance blow-up will not be a limiting performance factor even in the case of a ring with four experiments; and even in the most demanding energy regime; that of the Z running (about 45 GeV beam energy).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB012,

Likewise; for the production of low emittance positron beams for future lepton colliders; like CLIC or FCC-ee; high-field damping wigglers are required. Applying high-temperature superconductors in form of coated REBCO tape conductors allows reaching higher magnetic fields and larger operating margins as compared to low-temperature superconductors like Nb-Ti or Nb3Sn. However; short undulator periods like 13 mm may require bending radii of the conductor smaller than 5 mm inducing significant bending strain on the superconducting layer and may harm its conducting properties. In this paper; we present our designed bending rig and experimental results for REBCO tape conductors from various manufacturers and with different properties. Investigated bending radii reach from 20 mm down to 1 mm and optionally include half of a helical twist.

Lower electron energies give higher energy efficiency and a smaller environmental footprint. The extremely short bunch lengths (few fs) and narrow undulator gaps (4 mm) drastically increase the impact of resistive wall wakefields on the lasing process. The longitudinal resistive wall wakefield impedance is calculated in the framework of the surface impedance approach; in accordance with anomalous skin effect (ASE) theory. The dependence of the electron energy loss factor and the correlated energy spread of the bunch on the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) for both copper and aluminum is much higher for long (100 fs) than for ultra-short (6 fs) bunches. This is due to a known property of the longitudinal wakefield impedance - the field acting on a single particle traversing a resistive vessel does not depend on the conductivity of the vessel. The wakefields generated by the ultra-short bunch are already close to that of a single-particle regime and this leads to interesting consequences which are discussed in the present work.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB043,

Instead of winding coils; a meander structure can be laser-scribed directly into the superconductor layer; guiding the current path on a quasi-sinusoidal trajectory. Stacking pairs of such scribed tapes allows the generation of the desired sinusoidal magnetic fields above the tape plane; along the tape axis.

Interest of such insertion devices has been studied for application to FEL systems in the end of the previous century. However; the concept has never been used in synchrotron radiation sources due to the undesirable magnetic effect of the solenoid on electron beam parameters in storage rings. Advent of fourth-generation low emittance light sources is foreseen to change this situation. Indeed; consequent electron beam transverse size and divergence reduction for such new storage rings give promise for a beam less sensitive to the presence of a longitudinal solenoidal field. Relating to this; a staggered concept can be an adequate design choice for short-period undulators producing high-energy photon flux. Such undulators would have a low K value a priori limiting their photon energy tunability. Considering integration of separate magnetic arrays of distinct periods in a solenoid to compose a global assembly can help suppress this possible drawback.

ipac2021,,THPAB065,Experimental Verification of the Source of Excessive Helical SCU Heat Load at APS,V. Sajaev; J.C. Dooling; K.C. Harkay; ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; Immediately after the installation of the Helical superconducting undulator (HSCU) in the APS storage ring; higher than expected heating was observed in the cryogenic cooling system. Steering the electron beam orbit in the upstream dipole reduced the amount of synchrotron radiation reaching into the HSCU and allowed the device to properly cool and operate. The simplest explanation of the excessive heat load was higher than expected heat transfer from the vacuum chamber to the magnet coils. However; modeling of the synchrotron radiation interaction with the HSCU vacuum chamber showed that Compton scattering could also result in synchrotron radiation penetrating the vacuum chamber and depositing energy directly into the HSCU coils**. In this paper; we present experimental evidence that the excessive heat load of the HSCU coils is not caused by the heat transfer from the vacuum chamber but resulted from the synchrotron radiation penetrating the vacuum chamber.; * M.

This rf system has amplitude and phase noise dominated by the lines at 60; 180; and 360 Hz. APS presently operates with synchrotron frequency close to 2 kHz; which is far away from the rf noise frequencies; and still the rf system noise contributes over 2 micrometers rms into the horizontal orbit noise due to beam energy variation. APS-U will operate with a bunch-lengthening cavity; which will lower the synchrotron frequency down to about 200 Hz. This could potentially lead to large orbit noise and other negative consequences due to energy variation caused by the rf system noise. In this paper; we will present simulations of the rf noise-induced orbit motion at APS and APS-U and define the rf amplitude and phase noise requirements that need to be achieved for APS-U operation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab067_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab067.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab067_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB067,

One caveat is that these instruments can require a large amount of real estate. For example; the XFEL driver is typically an electron beam linear accelerator (LINAC) and the need for higher electron beam energies capable of generating higher energy X-rays can require longer linacs; costs quickly become prohibitive; requiring state of art methods. One cost-saving measure is to produce a high accelerating gradient while reducing cavity size. Compact accelerating structures are also high-frequency. Here; we describe design concepts for a high-gradient; cryo-cooled LINAC for XFEL facilities in the C-band regime (~4-8 GHz). We are also exploring C-band for different applications including drivers for security applications.

The theory is expressed in terms of the usual coupled-bunch eigenvalues at zero chromaticity; and when the longitudinal motion is simple harmonic our solution only requires numerical root-finding that is easy to implement and fast to solve; the more general case requires some additional calculations but is still relatively fast. The theory predicts that the coupled-bunch growth rates can be significantly reduced when the chromatic betatron tune spread is larger than the coupled-bunch growth rate at zero chromaticity.

A crucial condition for the lasing process is the spatial overlap of the electrons with the electromagnetic field. Well-established electron beam-based procedures allow finding a straight trajectory for the electrons defined by the beam position monitors (BPM) between the undulators. A bending of the trajectory in between the BPMs cannot be seen by these methods. A general field offset inside the undulators has the effect that the synchrotron radiation is emitted at a different angle at the beginning and the end of the undulator which can result in a degradation of the FEL-gain especially for very short wavelengths.

Firstly; anti-bend magnets have been utilized to provide additional control over the dispersion function; and an improved symmetrization in the phase advance between the sextupoles was found to be beneficial for the dynamic aperture. Furthermore; the longitudinal variable bends have been tailored to reduce the emittance and have had transverse gradient added to improve the optics control in the mid-straights. In the absence of IDs; the current design provides 161 pm electron beam emittance; reducing to 139 pm once all effects are taken into account. The dynamic aperture is large enough to support an off-axis injection scheme using a nonlinear kicker and has a lifetime greater than 4 h. In this paper; the main parameters and magnet specifications for the Diamond-II lattice are provided.

At a dedicated beamline; experiments with (sub-)THz radiation are carried out. Here; an interaction of short laser pulses with electron bunches is used to modulate the electron energy which causes the formation of a dip in the longitudinal electron density; giving rise to the coherent emission of radiation between 75 GHz and 6 THz. The standard mode of operation is the generation of broadband radiation. However; more sophisticated energy modulation schemes were implemented using a liquid-crystal phase modulator. Here; a modulation of the spectral phase of the laser is used to control the spectral shape of the THz pulses. The resulting THz spectra have a relative bandwidth of about 2 %.

In this work we consider the design of the merger for PERLE; an ERL test facility to be based at IJCLab in France. Previous simulations have shown that the baseline DC gun based injector can achieve the required emittance at the booster linac exit. The quality of the 500 pC bunches must then be preserved with space charge through the merger at total beam energy of 7 MeV keeping the emittance below 6 mm mrad. The beam dynamics in the merger were simulated using the code OPAL and optimised using a genetic algorithm. Three possible merger schemes were investigated.

The wide-ranging requirements for the photon properties from multiple beamlines are extremely challenging to satisfy by the same electron beam from a single superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) accelerator.

The concept is based on advanced beam dynamics and radio-frequency (RF) techniques to provide beam properties tailored to each undulator line at the desired repetition rate. The beam properties that will be pursued in this proposal include; but are not limited to; beam energy; bunch charge; bunch length; beam current; and its profile.

In particular; under the right circumstances; it can both improve the rate of cooling and reduce the equilibrium emittance of the beam.

It is written in Python and based on the same fundamentals as other particle tracking codes but for atomic beams instead of charged beams. In this case; the manipulation and control of neutral atomic beams is via a force due to the spin interacting with a magnetic field gradient. An object-oriented tool was developed to aid in the design of a beamline through the manipulation of modular elements. The Python language allowed for a smooth implementation and kept the code clear and simple. The primary purpose of developing this code was to have a tool to design; simulate; and optimize a Breit-Rabi Polarimeter to measure the polarization of an atomic beam. Therefore; different set-ups with different magnets need to be simulated and optimized for direct comparison. In addition to simulation and tracking modules; a new data analysis module was developed to be able to quickly analyze simulation results; gaining insight from each iteration of the simulation; leading to an efficient and rapid design process.

The cooling rate of the hadron beam can be maximized if the electron beam from the strong hadron cooler fully overlaps with the hadron beam. Therefore; generating a flat electron beam is essential. The most efficient way to generate a flat electron beam is to produce a magnetized beam first; and then convert it to flat to the desired transverse size ratio. Using a Magnetized electron beam is a promising way to cool high-energy hadrons. One of the major challenges in producing magnetized beams is fine-tuning the longitudinal magnetic field on the cathode surface and maintaining the desired field uniformity over the emission area. In this paper; we discuss the design of a novel high voltage DC gun capable of fine-tuning the B field on the cathode. This is achieved by installing a permanent magnet inside the cathode puck; with a solenoid field at the front of the cathode. We show magnetostatic simulation to prove the feasibility of this idea.

The AMBER/NA66 collaboration proposes to build a QCD facility requiring conventional muon and hadron beams for runs up to 2024 in the first phase of the experiment. MUonE aims to measure the hadronic contribution to the vacuum polarization in the context of the (gµ-2) anomaly with a setup longer than 40 m and a 160 GeV/c high intensity; low divergence muon beam. NA64µ is a muon beam program for dark sector physics requiring a 100 - 160 GeV/c muon beam with a 15-25 m long setup. All three experiments request similar beam times up to 2024 with compelling physics programs; which required launching extensive studies for integration; installation; beam optics; and background estimations.

The asymmetric multi-pole field contributes to the transverse emittance growth and degrades the beam quality. In order to overcome the problem; we propose a novel rotationally symmetric 1.6 cell RF gun to construct the symmetric field in this paper. The concrete proposal is that a coaxial cell cavity with a symmetrical distribution of four grooves is concatenated to the photocathode end of the traditional 0.6 cell cavity to form the novel 0.6 cell cavity. Through the detailed design study; the profile of the RF gun is optimized to improve the shunt impedance and mode separation and make the surface peak electric field at the photocathode end. Considering the filling time; a coupling slot is designed to couple input power into the RF gun. The RF cavity is machined by numerical control machine tool; and the tuning and low power RF measurement are carried out. The experimental results are consistent with the simulation results.,Funding: Work supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China(Grant No. 11805199 and U1832135) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. WK2310000072),reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab145_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab145.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab145_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB145,

For some time; there has been an unexplained discrepancy of the slow extraction with a lower extraction efficiency than expected at the highest beam energies. Recent machine studies have indicated that the deflection by the electrostatic septum might be less than the nominal 2.5 mrad; leading to increased losses at the magnetic septum. In this paper; we pursue an idea to directly measure the voltage of the electrode gap by utilizing the fact that dark current electrons accelerated in the gap of the electrostatic extraction septum generate Bremsstrahlung X-rays when hitting the anode. The high-energy cut-off of the X-ray spectra then corresponds to the voltage of the electrode gap. Measurements of the X-ray spectra at the extraction septum of SIS18 have been performed using a solid-state CdTe detector. This technique provides an in-situ measurement of the voltage applied to the electrostatic extraction channel and has proven to be a useful diagnostics tool.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab157_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab157.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab157_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB157,

To limit the power load on the internal waste beam absorber from the transverse tails of the H− distribution missing the foil; the beam will be collimated in both planes in the linac to Booster transfer line using compact collimators of a novel design. Both the number of parasitic hits and the fraction of the beam missing the foil are sensitive functions of the H− beam centroid position with respect to the edge of the foil. The positioning of the collimation is constrained by the availability of suitable space in the transfer line lattice; by specifics of the collimator design; by the phase space orientation at the collimator; and by the betatron phase advance to the foil needed to achieve proper orientation of the spatial distribution at the injection point.

The tilted foil allows moving the injection point together with the painting bumps along the foil edge; distributing the deposited beam power over a larger foil area.

An accumulator ring is employed to compress the 2.86 ms long pulse from the linac to around 1.5 µs in order to satisfy the target requirements and improve the physics performance. In the operation of a high-intensity proton accumulator; the most important issue is to minimize the uncontrolled beam loss to reduce component activation to make hands-on maintenance possible. For this purpose; a two-stage collimation system is designed; which consists of a thin scraper to scatter halo particles and secondary collimators to absorb those scattered particles. Phase advances between scraper and secondary collimators; together with the material; the thickness of collimators; have been detailed studied and numerical simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the collimation system. This paper presents the design of the collimation system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab176_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab176.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab176_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB176,

In a stepwise approach; a first direct deuteron EDM measurement was performed at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY and design studies for a dedicated proton EDM storage ring are underway. In an experiment with a polarized beam in a storage ring; an EDM leads to a vertical polarization buildup. However; the vertical polarization component is also induced by systematic effects such as magnet misalignments. To investigate systematic effects individually and to support data analysis; a realistic simulation model of the storage ring is needed. In this paper; the development of such a model based on the Bmad software library is presented. Furthermore; various systematic effects and their impact on the spin motion in COSY are investigated and quantified by means of beam and spin tracking simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab177_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab177.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab177_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB177,

For that; both magnet ends are connected to a PFN each which are being charged simultaneously up to 80kV continuously. Due to the static HV operation; different to usually in other pulsed kicker systems; not only displacement current is flowing in the ferrite material. After less than 1s; the ferrite material is nearly field-free and the E-field is concentrated in the surrounding ceramic magnet clamp mechanism. As the field is further concentrated in gaps between ceramic and metallic parts; the HV layout of the magnet is a critical design task. As a magnetic field homogeneity of ±1% is required; special shaping of the coil is required as found during iterative 3D field simulations. The kicker chamber is designed to operate at a pressure level of 3·10-11 mBar. As one 3 meter-chamber contains 3.5 m² ferrite surface; careful vacuum heat treatment of the ferrite is required to reach this pressure level.

Efforts are underway at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) to paint a Danilov distribution in the accumulator ring. After the beam has been painted; the level to which it approximates an ideal Danilov distribution must be quantified. One way to do this is to measure the four-dimensional emittance; which is ideally zero due to linear relationships between the phase space variables. To measure this emittance; we will utilize a standard method of reconstructing the covariance matrix using various optics settings in conjunction with beam profile measurements.

The facility uses 3 ion sources and services 6 target areas at energies from ~1-15 MeV/u. To accommodate the large number and variety of approved experiments; ATLAS reconfigures once or twice per week over 40 weeks of operation per year. The startup time varies from ~12-48 hours depending on the complexity of the tuning; which will increase with the upcoming Multi-User Upgrade to deliver beam to two experimental stations simultaneously. DOE/NP has recently approved a project to use AI/ML to support ATLAS operations. The project aim is to significantly reduce the accelerator tuning time and improve machine performance by developing and deploying artificial intelligence methods.

To meet the requirements of the diverse experimental program; the PSB provides beams with intensities spanning three orders of magnitude and a large range of longitudinal emittances. To maximize the brightness; in particular for the LHC beams; the voltages at low energy are designed to reduce the impact of transverse space charge using a second RF harmonic in bunch lengthening mode. At high energies; the risk of longitudinal microwave instability is avoided by optimizing the longitudinal distribution to raise the instability threshold.

However; even these successful algorithms can become ineffective as the dimension and range of the search space increase due to exponential growth in the amount of exploration required to find global optima. This difficulty is even more exacerbated by the resource-intensive and time-consuming tendency for the evaluations of nonlinear beam dynamics. Lately the use of surrogate models based on neural network has been drawing attention to alleviate this problem. Following this trend; to further enhance the efficiency of nonlinear lattice optimization for storage rings; we propose to replace typically used objectives with those that are less time-consuming and to focus on a single objective constructed from multiple objectives; which can maximize utilization of the trained models through local optimization and objective gradient extraction.

When the ORBIT’s 1D longitudinal tracking was employed for the acceleration process in CSNS/RCS; the longitudinal emittance in eV-s was found decreasing substantially during acceleration; though the adiabatic condition is still met during this process. This is against the Liouville theorem that predicts the preservation of the emittance during acceleration. The recent machine study in the accelerator and the simulations with a self-made code demonstrate that the longitudinal emittance is almost invariant; which further indicates that the ORBIT longitudinal tracking might be incorrect. A detailed check-over in the ORBIT code source finds that the longitudinal finite difference equation used in the code is erroneous when applied to an acceleration process. The new code format PyORBIT has the same problem. After the small secondary factor is included in the code; ORBIT can produce results keeping the longitudinal emittance invariant.

In current injector optimization; components (e.g. RF cavities) are individually shape-optimized for performance subject to requirements such as peak surface field; shunt impedance; and resonant frequency. Once these component shapes are determined; beam dynamics simulations optimize the injector lattice by adjusting parameters such as the amplitude and phase of the driving fields. However; this form of beam dynamics optimization is restricted by the fixed geometry and field profile of the components. To optimize accelerator design more generally; a coupled optimization of the cavity shape and beam parameters is required. For this coupled optimization problem; we have created an integrated ACE3P-IMPACT workflow. Within this workflow; component geometries are adjusted; field modes are computed with Omega3P (a module in the ACE3P suite); and beam dynamics are simulated with IMPACT-T.

Furthermore; a large relative energy spread during the beam generation modifies the space charge interaction between different regions of the particle bunch. Therefore; modeling the phase space evolution in an electron injector requires a numerically efficient particle tracking code that can handle space charge interactions of spatially and energetically strongly inhomogeneous particle distributions. We implemented an energy-binning scheme for a meshless fast multipole method (FMM). The energy-binning approximates the momentum distribution of the beam by assigning particles to adaptive tree structures defined at different Lorentz frames. Based on the tree structures; the FMM computes a hierarchical approximation for the space charge interaction of the particle bunch. We use the energy-binning FMM to simulate the beam generation in the photoinjector of the European XFEL developed at DESY-PITZ.

The IBS effect results in an increase in the bunch length and the microwave instability thresholds. It was observed experimentally by varying the vertical emittance.

By training an autoencoder neural network on the ObsBox amplitude data and using the model’s reconstruction error; instabilities and other phenomena are separated from nominal beam behaviour.

Model predictive control (MPC) uses an optimization algorithm offline to minimize a cost function with constraints on the states and control input. The surrogate model optimally controls the cavities online. Time series deep ML structures including recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) can model the control input of MPC and dynamics of LLRF as a surrogate model. When the predicted states diverge from the measured states more than a threshold at each time step; the states’ measurements from the cavity fine-tune the surrogate model with transfer learning. MPC does the optimization offline again with the updated surrogate model; and; next; transfer learning fine-tunes the surrogate model with the new data from the optimal control inputs. The surrogate model provides us with a computationally faster and accurate modeling of MPC and LLRF; which in turn results in a more stable control system.; Machine learning; Surrogate model; control; LLRF; MPC; Transfer learning,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab268_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab268.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab268_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB268,

Incoming gammas are converted to high-energy positron-electron pairs; which are then subsequently analyzed in a dipole magnet. These charged particles are then recorded in arrays of acrylic Cherenkov counters; which are significantly less sensitive to background x-rays than scintillator counters in this case. To reconstruct energies of single high-energy photons; the spectrometer has a sensitivity to single positron-electron pairs. Even in this single-photon limit; there is always some low-energy continuum present; so spectral deconvolution is not trivial; for which we demonstrate a maximum likelihood reconstruction.

The RF line; cooling circuits; and instrumentation were also mounted. The cavities were operated with an FPGA-based LLRF system. A re-conditioning of the cavities was performed in the first place; followed by tests with a pulsed beam with increasing currents. A maximum pulsed beam current of 100 mA was reached while operating the buncher cavities; under which they reached voltages up to 340 kV and 260 kV respectively.

In a hadron collider such as the LHC; the beam induces dynamic effects due to ion; electron; and photon-stimulated gas desorption. The well-known VASCO* code developed at CERN in 2004 is already used to estimate vacuum stability and density profiles in steady-state conditions. Nevertheless; some phenomena are not taken into account such as the ionization of residual gas by the electron clouds and the evolution of the electronic density related to the electron cloud build-up. Therefore; we propose an upgrade of this code by introducing electron cloud maps** to estimate the electron density and the ionization of gas by electrons leading to an increase of induced desorption. The pressure evolution computed with DYVACS reproduces with good accuracy the experimental pressure recorded in the VPS beam pipes sector*** of the LHC from the proton beam injection to the stable beam period. Additionally; DYVACS can also be used as a predictive tool to compute the pressure evolution in the beam pipes for Future Circular Colliders (FCC-hh or -ee).; * A. Rossi; Tech.

Consequently; the understanding of the dynamic pressure evolution during accelerator operation is fundamental to provide solutions to mitigate pressure rises induced by multiple effects leading to beam instabilities. For the LHC; the appearance of instabilities may be due to the succession of several phenomena: (i) the induced desorption of gases adsorbed on the surfaces leading to pressure rises; (ii) the creation of secondary particles (ions; electrons); (iii) the production of the so-called Electron Cloud build-up by multipacting effect. This work aims to investigate some fundamental phenomena which drive the dynamic pressure in the LHC; namely the effects induced by electrons and ions interacting with the copper surface of the beam screens. Electron and ion currents; as well as pressure; were recorded in situ in the Vacuum Pilot Sector (VPS*) located on the LHC ring during the RUN II.

The ironless inductive position sensor is used to measure the position of collimator jaws with respect to the beam and is designed to be immune to external DC or slowly changing magnetic fields. In this paper we investigate whether frequency separation is required when multiple ironless inductive position sensors are used and whether two or more sensors at the same frequency results in cross-talk. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to study the magnetic field behaviour of the sensors; their interference with each other and the impact of this interference on the position reading.

Therefore; it is necessary to adjust the beam distribution with a nonlinear magnet and other elements on the transport line from synchrotron ring to beam target station. Nonlinear magnet has high requirements on beam quality. Before passing through the nonlinear magnet field; the beam center can be adjusted by taking advantage of the gradient change distribution of the nonlinear magnet’s transverse field map to achieve uniform distribution at the target station.

The RF frequencies of these two accelerator systems are not harmonically related. Synchronization is accomplished by controlling two MEBT Beam Choppers; which select 162.5MHz beam bunches from the LEBT and RFQ to produce an appropriate reduced beam bunch pattern that enables bucket-to-bucket transfer to the Booster RF at 46.46MHz (84th harmonic). This chopping pattern also reduces the beam current to an average of 2mA over the Booster injection; matching the Linac nominal beam current. The BPG also generates the RF frequency/phase reference which the Booster will phase lock to during injection. The BPG is fully programmable; allowing for arbitrary beam patterns with adjustable timing parameters; having a fine adjustment resolution of 38ps. The latter is accomplished using digital signal processing techniques. This paper discusses the design of the BPG; its construction; test results; and operational experience after being integrated into the PIP2 IT test accelerator and concludes with a discussion of the system’s performance and future plans.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab324_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab324.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab324_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB324,

This is also a promising way to increase tube reliability and longevity. A magnetron operating with the anode voltage lower than the self-excitation threshold; in so-called stimulated coherent generation mode has special advantage for pulse operation with a gated injection-locking signal.

Traditionally these generators are using thyratrons - until recently the only switches capable of switching such pulses within tens of ns. There is a strong demand to replace thyratrons with semiconductor switches to avoid their future obsolescence. Very promising candidates are components from the family of fast ionization dynistors triggered by impact ionization. Their sub-nanosecond switching time and extreme current densities can provide performances superior to that of thyratrons. Recent investigations showed that impact ionization triggering is feasible also in cheap industrial thyristors. The main issue is the generation of triggering pulses with slew rates in the multi kV/ns region and with the required output current for charging the parasitic capacitance of the thyristor.

The region surrounding the triple junction (ceramic+metal+vacuum) is the primary source of free electrons and in microwave windows and high-voltage ceramics. This region is located at the metalizing and braze joint of the ceramic support structure making the vacuum seal. On very large microwave windows typically at low frequencies; this critical region is difficult to coat by the traditional techniques of sputter coating anti-multipactoring titanium nitride or other materials. The novel processes proposed here include a means for applying and controlling the thickness of titanium nitride both in the metallizing (controlling the source) and on the surface of the window; eliminating SEE and the multipactoring discharge.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab341_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab341.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab341_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB341,

Such MOT cathodes; however; have two drawbacks: the need for multiple trapping lasers and the limit to ~MV/m fields. Designs exist for MOTs which only require one trapping laser. Our RF simulations in High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) indicate that the cone MOT is the only one compatible with high gradient RF cavities. We present the combination of the two; an RF cavity with a cone-MOT as part of its geometry. It only requires one trapping laser and can use much higher fields. The geometry of the chamber is compatible with a wide range of MOT species; which allows the search for one which is compatible with copper cavities.,Funding: This work was performed with support of the US Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-SC0020409 and the National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY-1549132,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab344_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab344.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab344_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB344,

LhARA will be a two-stage facility with the first stage employing laser-target acceleration to produce intense proton bunches of energies up to 15 MeV. The second stage will accelerate the beam in an FFA ring up to 127 MeV. Optimal performance of stage 2; however; will require an emittance reduction of the stage 1 beam due to the FFA’s nominal dynamical acceptance. Here; we demonstrate a new optical configuration of LhARA’s stage 1 lattice that will provide this reduced emittance. The profile of the laser-target generated beam is far from an ideal Gaussian; therefore two start-to-end Monte Carlo particle tracking codes have been used to model beam transport performance from the laser-target source through to the end of the stage 2 FFA injection line. The Geant4-based Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM) was used to model beam losses and the collimation that is crucial to LhARA’s energy selection system; and General Particle Tracer (GPT) was used to model the space-charge effects that may impact performance given the emittance reduction.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/thpab359_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/thpab359.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/thpab359_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-THPAB359,

A cavity-based FEL is not a new concept - the first FEL was an oscillator operating at 3.4 um - but single-pass amplification of spontaneous radiation was the fastest path to gigawatt x-ray powers. One unproven component of a CBXFEL is a stable; high reflectivity cavity. To address this deficit we present ring-down measurements in a 20 m round-trip cold cavity operating at 9.8 keV. The cavity is composed of four strain-relief-cut diamond 400 Bragg mirrors and a transmission grating for in/out-coupling. It is a testbed for alignment protocols and component performance under realistic experimental conditions like source instability; optics imperfections; and thermal drift.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/frxa07_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/frxa07.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/frxa07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-FRXA07,
ipac2021,,FRXB01,The Progress of the In-Vacuum Superconducting Undulator Prototype for SHINE Project,SSRF; Shanghai; People’s Republic of China; The superconducting undulator can generate the highest peak field with the short period length and give the desirable K value; thus producing the high-intensity high-energy radiation photons. The Shanghai High Repetition rate XFEL and Extreme Light (SHINE) facility will use 40 superconducting undulators with 4m long for each to produce the vertically polarized photons with energy of 10keV-25keV. The period length of undulators is 16mm; the magnetic gap is 5mm and the peak field is 1.58T. Each undulator contains 504 vertical racetrace coils made of NbTi wires which are wound on 504 active poles. A 65K shielding is designed to reduce the thermal radiation from the vacuum chamber. The cooling of the magnet is forced by the liquid helium pipes which are installed in the middle of the magnet yoke surface and the sides of the gap in the direction of the electron beam. There is no beam vacuum chamber due to the small magnetic gap. A prototype of 4m long is being manufactured before the mass production and will be finished this year. The paper will describe the design parameters; the configuration of the prototype and the test plan of this year.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/frxb01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/frxb01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/frxb01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-FRXB01,

Which constitutes a particular complication for the harmonic system in charge of linearising the beam’s phase space; since it means its operation frequency could be higher than the standard X-band RF technologies. In the present work; we investigated a 36 GHz (Ka-band) as the ideal frequency for the harmonic system. A set of structure designs are presented as candidates for the lineariser; based on different powering schemes and pulse compressor technologies. The comparison is made both in terms of beam dynamics and RF performance. Given the phase stability requirements for the MW class RF sources needed for this system; we performed careful studies of a Gyro-Klystron and a multi-beam klystron as potential RF sources; with both showing up to 3 MW available power using moderate modulator voltages.

Superconducting power transmission lines based on MgB2 superconductor; called Superconducting Links; ensure the electrical transmission from the current leads; near the power converters; to the magnets in the LHC main tunnel. They span a physical distance of up to about 120 metres; snaking through a complex underground environment that includes a vertical path of about 10 metres; and transfer DC currents totalling up to 120 kA at temperatures of up to 25 K. This paper summarizes the development done in order to conceive; construct and industrialize cold powering systems including 100 kA Superconducting Links. The systems; which are cooled by the forced flow of helium gas; incorporate HTS REBCO based current leads and Nb-Ti terminations for the connection to the magnets’ busbars. Demonstrator cold powering systems were recently constructed and tested at CERN in nominal and transient conditions representative of the final operation modes.

The first CCiPM was developed for an internal diameter of 60 mm as a magnet bore to establish the basic production techniques. The technique has been enhanced to realize narrower bore over 3 years; and finally; the achieved internal diameters were 40 and 30 mm in newly developed CCiPM.

ipac2021,,FRXB05,Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment: Results & Prospects,STFC/RAL/ISIS; Chilton; Didcot; Oxon; United Kingdom; A high-energy muon collider could be the most powerful and cost-effective collider approach in the multi-TeV regime; and a neutrino source based on decay of an intense muon beam would be ideal for measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters. Muon beams may be created through the decay of pions produced in the interaction of a proton beam with a target. The muons are subsequently accelerated and injected into a storage ring where they decay producing a beam of neutrinos; or collide with counter-rotating antimuons. Cooling of the muon beam would enable more muons to be accelerated resulting in a more intense neutrino source and higher collider luminosity. Ionization cooling is the novel technique by which it is proposed to cool the beam. The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment collaboration constructed a section of an ionization cooling channel and used it to provide the first demonstration of ionization cooling. Here the observation of ionization cooling is described. The cooling performance is studied for a variety of beam and magnetic field configurations. The outlook for muon ionization cooling demonstrations is discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/talks/frxb05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/papers/frxb05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2021/posters/frxb05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-FRXB05,

Besides QE; work function and vacuum stability; bunch lengthening is a key figure of merit for these sources; resulting from UV photon penetration into the semiconductor and scattering of excited electrons before emission. These processes and their statistical variation lead to a delay; as well as to lengthening of the extracted electron bunch w.r.t. the incident laser pulse; often referred to as ""response time"". Thus far; no direct measurement of the response time of Cs2Te; one of the most widely used cathode materials; has been reported. As such a measurement is crucial for photocathode laser based bunch shaping; short bunch applications; emission modeling and for evaluating new cathode materials like CsKSb; a measurement procedure has been established at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) to measure longitudinal bunch shape variation due to cathode emission effects.

Therefore; the injector should be optimized to meet the following requirements at the exit of the main linac. The rms bunch length should be 2 ps; the rms longitudinal emittance should be kept the least; and simultaneously the rms transverse emittance should be kept less than 3 c mm mrad.

Of the 418 SRF cavities in CEBAF; 96 are designed with a digital low-level RF system configured such that a cavity fault triggers recordings of RF signals for each of eight cavities in the cryomodule. Subject matter experts analyze the collected time-series data and identify which of the eight cavities faulted first and classify the type of fault. This information is used to find trends and strategically deploy mitigations to problematic cryomodules. However; manually labeling the data is laborious and time-consuming. By leveraging machine learning; near real-time - rather than postmortem - identification of the offending cavity and classification of the fault type has been implemented. We discuss the performance of the machine learning models during a recent physics run.
