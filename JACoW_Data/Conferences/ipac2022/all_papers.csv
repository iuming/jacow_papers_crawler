Substantial progress has been made in this area in recent years; fueled by a growing international collaboration of universities; national laboratories; and companies. Performance of these micro-accelerator devices is ultimately limited by laser-induced material breakdown limits; which can be substantially higher for optically driven dielectrics than for radio-frequency metallic cavities traditionally used in modern particle accelerators; allowing for 1 to 2 order of magnitude increase in achievable accelerating fields. The lasers required for this approach are commercially available with moderate (microJoule class) pulse energies and repetition rates in the MHz regime.

Huge steps have been taken in the last decades towards achieving high acceleration gradients with simultaneous beam-quality preservation. However; in order to match both the luminosity demands of high-energy physics and the brilliance requirements of photon science; PWFA must be capable of accelerating thousands of bunches per second ’ orders of magnitude beyond the current state of the art. Historically; investigation of the rate limitation in plasmas was limited by the number of bunches available from the accelerator front-end. The FLASHForward facility; which is driven by the superconducting linac of the FLASH free-electron laser; is the first experiment capable of addressing this issue. We report here on first experimental results from the facility; aimed at determining the repetition rate limit of plasma accelerators arising from fundamental plasma processes* and finally advancing the repetition rate of PWFA from proof-of-principle experiments at a few bunches per second to a competitive plasma accelerator.; * R.

For example; by learning from a sparse sampling of physics simulations one can develop fast-executing ""surrogate models"" that approximately predict accelerator performance for entirely new design parameters. Using these models can reduce compute times for multi-objective optimization studies by several orders of magnitude.

As the emittance decreases; the bunch volume decreases and the Touschek beam lifetime also decreases. However; this downward trend in beam lifetime is expected to turn to increase in the emittance region below a certain threshold. Since this threshold is determined by the emittance at equilibrium including the IBS effect; a self-consistent treatment is necessary for a correct and unified understanding of the beam characteristics. In currently operating facilities; such as MAX-IV; or in next-generation light sources under construction or in the planning stages; it is expected that such effects may be observed depending on the operating conditions.

This effect has the potential to generate significant distortion of the tune footprint and thus is of interest in regard to Landau damping. Conventionally ADECTA has been studied through saturation of tune separation with action during amplitude-detuning type measurements. In this paper; an alternative measurement technique is proposed and results of initial tests with beam are presented. The novel technique attempts to measure ADECTA by performing a classical closest approach tune scan; using proton beams in the LHC; which have been kicked and allowed to decohere; effectively giving a large action doughnut beam. It is shown that the tune and closest approach of the doughnut beams can be measured using the existing LHC Base-Band tune (BBQ) measurement system; and an amplitude dependence can be observed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopost003_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopost003.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopost003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOST003,42

In this contribution; we provide an overview of the project status and plans for deployment and performance ramp-up. Progress on the validation of key technologies; status of prototypes and series production as well as the final integration studies for the HL equipment are summarized. These are accompanied by the imminent completion of major civil engineering work and the start of infrastructure installations. Initial operational experience will be gained at the Inner Triplet (IT) String; presently in assembly at CERN’s Superconducting Magnet Test Facility; which will enable a fully integrated test of the main magnets; powering; and protection systems in the actual HL-LHC insertion configuration.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopost005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopost005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopost005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOST005,50

To this effect; an AC dipole has been installed in the AGS Booster to maximize polarization transmission of helions through several intrinsic resonances. This installation also allows polarized protons to be extracted at higher energy without polarization loss. By increasing the proton extraction energy from $Gγ$ = 4.5 to $Gγ$ = 7.5; protons will cross the $Gγ$ = 0 + νy$ and $Gγ = 12 - νy$ depolarizing vertical intrinsic resonances; the $Gγ$ = 5; 6; and 7 imperfection resonances in addition to the $Gγ$ = 3; 4 that are crossed in the present configuration; and be injected into the AGS at a higher rigidity. By simulation; it is determined that there is sufficient strength of the AC dipole to fully flip the spin spin through each of the intrinsic resonances; and there is sufficient corrector current to preserve polarization through the three additional imperfection resonances. The higher injection rigidity facilitates the horizontal and vertical tunes being placed inside the AGS spin-tune gap at injection due to a substantial improvement on the AGS admittance at injection.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopost008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopost008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopost008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOST008,62

Due to the asymmetric design of the proton beam crab cavity; the fundamental mode consists of contributions from higher order multipoles. These multipole modes may change during fabrication and installation of the cavities; and therefore affect the local dynamic aperture. Thresholds for each order of the multipoles are applied to ensure dynamic aperture requirements at these crab cavities. In this paper; we analyzed the strength of the multipoles due to fabrication and installation accuracies; and set limitations to each procedure to maintain the dynamic aperture requirement.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopost009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopost009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopost009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOST009,66

To re-establish uranium beam operation and to improve high current beam operation; different subjects have been explored in dedicated machine investigation campaigns. After a beam line modification in 2017 the RFQ-performance had deteriorated significantly; new rods have been installed and the RF-working point has been redefined. Also the Superlens-performance had become unsatisfactory; improved with a modified RF-coupler. With a pulsed hydrogen gas stripper target the uranium beam stripping efficiency could be increased by 65%.

The Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis as well as low dipole modes. The unmodulated prototype accepted 3 times the operating power of which is needed in operation** corresponding to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 µs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project***. This particular high frequency for a 4-ROD-RFQ creates difficulties, which triggered the development of a Ladder-RFQ with its high symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is very well suited for that frequency. For the applied cooling concept, the Ladder-RFQ can be driven up to a duty factor of 10%. Manufacturing has been completed in September 2018. The final flatness & frequency tuning as well as the final assembly have been completed. We present the final RF measurements and assembly steps getting the Ladder-RFQ ready for shipment and high power RF test prior to assembly. *Journal of Physics: Conf.

High-Current Accelerator-driven Neutron Sources (HiCANS) could fill this gap. The High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) currently under development at Forschungszentrum Jülich is scalable in terms of beam energy and power due to its modular design. The driver linac will accelerate a 100 mA proton beam to 70 MeV. The linac is operated with a beam duty cycle of up to 13.6 % (15.3 % RF duty cycle) and can simultaneously deliver three pulse lengths (208 µs; 833 µs and 2 ms) for three neutron target stations. In order to minimize the development effort and the technological risk; state-of-the-art technology of the MYRRHA injector is used. The HBS linac consists of a front end (ECR source; LEBT; 2.5 MeV double RFQ) and a CH-DTL section with 44 room temperature CH-cavities. All RF structures are operated at 176.1 MHz and are designed for high duty cycle. Solid-state amplifiers up to 500 kW are used as RF drivers. Due to the beam current and the high average beam power of up to 952 kW; particular attention is paid to beam dynamics. In order to minimize beam losses; a quasi-periodic lattice with constant negative phase is used.

ALICE is one of the detector experiments optimised for heavy-ion collisions. A fixed-target experiment in ALICE is considered to collide a portion of the beam halo; split using a bent crystal; with an internal target placed a few meters upstream of the detector. Fixed-target collisions offer many physics opportunities related to hadronic matter and the quark-gluon plasma to extend the research potential of the CERN accelerator complex. Production of physics events depends on the particle flux on target. The machine layout for the fixed-target experiment is being developed to provide a flux of particles on a target high enough to exploit the full capabilities of the ALICE detector acquisition system.

These beams are exposed to several collective effects in the SPS; such as beam coupling impedance; space charge and electron cloud; leading to relatively large bunch-by-bunch coherent and incoherent tune shifts. Tune correction to the nominal values at injection is crucial to ensure beam stability and good beam transmission. During the beam commissioning of the SPS; measurements of the bunch-by-bunch coherent tune shifts have been conducted under different beam conditions; together with appropriate corrections of the average tunes at each injection.

A possibility to reduce the computational resources required is to provide indicators that can efficiently detect chaotic motion; which are considered precursors to unbounded motion. These indicators could allow skilful selection of a set of initial conditions that could then be considered for long-term tracking. The chaotic nature of each orbit can be assessed by using fast-converging dynamic indicators; such as the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI); the Reversibility Error Method (REM); and the Smallest and Global Alignment Index (SALI and GALI). These indicators are widely used in the field of Celestial Mechanics; but not so widespread in Accelerator Physics.

In this paper; a new method is presented; in which the border of the phase-space stable region is identified using a machine learning (ML) model.

Operation restarted in early 2021; demonstrating the expected performance improvement. The high-brightness beams; nevertheless; appear to have overpopulated tails in the vertical beam profiles; both at injection and at extraction energies. In an attempt to understand the origin and evolution of the observed tails; systematic profile measurements were performed for different machine and beam configurations using Wire Scanners (WS). The results are presented in this report and compared to simulations.

To routinely determine the filling pattern in the storage ring; a new measuring system has been developed. For hadron physics experiments the filling pattern; which is influenced by the injection from the pre-accelerating synchrotron; should be as homogeneous as possible. The new measurement system should provide a real-time measurement of the filling pattern; so that the injection can be continuously optimized. Moreover; a position measurement for each individual bunch is provided; from which the two transverse and the longitudinal tunes can be deduced. To measure the bunch-by-bunch intensity and position; the signals of the existing button-type BPMs will be digitized by fast 12-bit ADCs synchronized to the 500MHz ELSA radio frequency. The fast pre-processing and intermediate storage of the data is realized with a 500MHz clocked FPGA and transfers the data to a PC for further processing.

The new MicroTCA-based receiveris based on a dedicated FMC card developed at DESY that is installed on an FMC25 carrier board. The arrival time is calculated on a FPGA with low latency and can be used for machine diagnostic.

Photonic time-stretch is a measurement method that is able to overcome speed limitations of con- ventional digitizers and enable continuous ultra-fast single- shot terahertz spectroscopy with refresh rates of trillions of consecutive frames. In this contribution; a novel ultra- fast data sampling system based on photonic time-stretch is presented and the performance is discussed. THERESA (TeraHErtz REadout SAmpling) is a data acquisition system based on the recent ZYNQ-RFSoC family. THERESA has been developed with an analog bandwidth up to 20 GHz and a sampling rate up to 90 GS/s. When combined with the photonic time-stretch setup; the system will be able to sample a THz signal with an unprecedented frame rate of 8 TS/s.

The current BAMs were benchmarked with a resolution of 3.5 fs for nominal 250 pC bunches at the EuXFEL; including jitter of the optical reference system. The arrival-time jitter could be reduced to about 10 fs with a beam-based feedback system. For future experiments at the EuXFEL the bunch charge will be decreased to a level where the existing system’s accuracy will no longer be sufficient. In simulations a concept based on rod-shaped pickups mounted on a printed circuit board indicated its potential for such low charge applications.

Though the injected beam current from the microtron to the booster seems good; the injection efficiency into the booster is currently low due to various effects. Consequently; an upgrade of the whole beam diagnostics system is taking place in the booster; in order to improve the injection efficiency through understanding the loss mechanisms and the behavior of bunches. Among these diagnostics tools are beam loss monitors; a transverse profile monitor and a longitudinal profile monitor.

Such a THz source is proposed as a prototype for an accelerator-based THz source for pump-probe experiments at the European XFEL. A start-to-end simulation has suggested the settings of the phase of booster linear accelerator manipulating longitudinal beam characteristics to optimize the performance of the THz FEL. Although beam diagnostics after compression at PITZ are limited; the longitudinal beam characteristics as a function of the booster phase have been measured and compared with the corresponding simulations. The benchmark involves measurements of longitudinal phase space distribution for bunch charges up to 2 nC.

However; the physical understanding of ChDR is not well satisfied yet because of precise experimental observation is not much easier than one expects. Although we do not deny the Cherenkov radiation and ChDR are fully explained by the classical electromagnetics; we encounter a couple of difficulties in actual applications. For instance; the theory is usually established for the far-field observation; in spite of that the radiation is often observed near-field in the realistic beam diagnostic tools employing photon measurements. In addition; the theory; as a matter of course; includes some assumptions which is sometimes not valid for the specific experiments. We have carried out experiments for observation of coherent ChDR in THz frequency region by a using 100 femtosecond electron beam supplied by the t-ACTS accelerator at Tohoku University.

Although surrogate model-based inference is useful for inferring the unmeasurable; the system states can be incorrectly inferred due to manufacturing errors and neglected higher-order effects when creating the surrogate model. In this paper; we propose to adaptively assimilate the surrogate model for reconstructing the transverse beam distribution with uncertainty and underspecification using a sequential Monte Carlo from the measurements of quadrant beam loss monitors.

Originally; the reconstructions were performed by a highly optimised Fortran implementation. To facilitate increased flexibility; and leveraging the significant increase in computing power since the original development; a new version of the reconstruction code has been developed. This implements an object-oriented Python API; with the computationally heavy calculations in C++ for improved performance. The Python/C++ implementation is designed to be highly modular; enabling new and diverse use cases.

It utilises a supersonic gas curtain which transverses the beam at an angle of 45 degrees and measures beam-induced ionisation interactions of the gas to produce a 2D transverse beam profile image. This paper builds upon previously used single-slit skimmers and improves their ability to form the gas jet into a desired distribution for imaging beam halo. A skimmer device removes off-momentum gas particles and forms the jet into a dense thin curtain; suitable for transverse imaging of the beam. The use of a novel double-slit skimmer is shown to provide a mask-like void of gas over the beam core; increasing the relative intensity of the halo interactions for measurement. Such a non-invasive monitor would be beneficial to storage rings by providing real time beam characteristic measurements without affecting the beam.

Hard boundary conditions for the design are a reasonably short circumference of ~350m due to the accessible construction properties in vicinity to Bessy II and 16 super-periods to not step behind the number of existing experimental stations. Additionally; the Pysikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt; the long-term partner of HZB; requests homogeneous dipoles as a calculable and traceable source of radiation for metrology applications. The configuration of the two building blocks of MBA lattices - unit cell and dispersion suppression cell - has been thoroughly studied from basic principles. It was found that gradient free bending dipoles are the better choice for the BESSY III lattice; opposite to the concepts of comparable projects. This work summarizes and explains the findings of our investigations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopotk009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopotk009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopotk009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOTK009,449

It provides the opportunity for precision physics experiments with a 1 mA c.w. electron beam in its initial phase. In this phase experiments with unpolarised; high-density 1019 atoms per cm2 gas jet targets are foreseen at the Mainz Gas Internal Target Experiment (MAGIX). To allow experiments with thin polarised gas targets with sufficiently high interaction rates in a later phase; the beam current must be increased to up to 100 mA; which would pose significant challenges to the existing ERL machine. Thus; it is proposed here to use MESA in pulsed operation with a repetition rate of several kHz to fill a recirculating beamline; providing a quasi c.w. beam current to a thin gas target.

The optimization concept is based on the effective use of extra-radiation damping from damping wigglers installed in the four long straight sections each 30 m long in length. For this purpose; we have been re-optimizing the linear and nonlinear optics so as to reduce the radiation loss from the bending magnets. In parallel; since the emittance variation due to the gap change of the IDs can be an obstacle for conducting precise experiments; we are investigating a new passive method to suppress the emittance variation without any feedback system.

Since a straightforward implementation of the frozen spin regime at NICA is not possible; we suggest an alternative quasi-frozen spin approach concept. In this new regime; the spin oscillates about particle orbit with the spin phase advance pi*gamma*G/2; locally recovering the longitudinal orientation at the location of the electric-magnetic Wien filters in the straight sections. In the case of deuterons; thanks to the small magnetic anomaly G; the spin continuously oscillates relative to the direction of the momentum with a small amplitude of a few degrees and the expected EDM effect is reduced only by a few percent. In this paper; we study the spin-orbital motion with the aim of using the NICA collider to measure the EDM.

In this proceeding; we report the correction of normal quadrupole; skew quadrupole; and sextupole aberrations in the MEDUSA ultrafast electron micro-diffraction beamline and measurements of the subsequent emittance. This low emittance is enabled by alkali-antimonide photocathodes driven at the photoemission threshold.

In this contribution; we present a new optics configuration; which allows to reach zero horizontal dispersion at the locations of different beam size measurement locations.

The calculation of the linear transverse coupling resonance driving terms (RDTs) ’1001 and ’1010 relies on the complex spectrum of the turn-by-turn motion. To obtain the complex signal; a reconstruction of the particle motion is needed. For this purpose; the signal of a second BPM with a suitable phase shift is usually used. In this work; we explore the possibility of including more BPMs in the reconstruction of the transverse momentum; which could reduce the effects of statistical errors and systematic uncertainties. This; in turn; could improve the precision and accuracy of the RDTs; which could be of great benefit for locations where an exact knowledge of the transverse coupling or other RDTs is important. We present the development of a new method to reconstruct the particle’s momentum that uses a statistical analysis of several nearby BPMs. The improved precision is demonstrated via simulations of LHC and HL-LHC lattices.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopotk032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopotk032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopotk032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOTK032,519

Significant information about beam dynamics can often be extracted from BPM measurements and used to actively tune the accelerator. However; common measurement tools; such as measurements of kicked beams; may become more difficult when very strong nonlinearities are present or when data is very noisy. In this work; we examine the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) as a technique to extract measurements of the beam from simulated turn-by-turn BPM data. In particular; we show that VAEs may have the possibility to outperform other dimensionality reduction techniques that have historically been used to analyze such data. When the data collection period is limited; or the data is noisy; VAEs may offer significant advantages.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopotk038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopotk038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopotk038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOTK038,543

A conventional method of obtaining round beam in an electron storage ring is to shift its tune close to a linear difference resonance. The linearly coupled beam dynamics is analyzed with perturbation theories; which have certain limitations. In this paper; we adopt the Solution by LInear Matrices (SLIM) analysis to calculate exact beam sizes to design round beam lattices. The SLIM analysis can deal with a generally linearly coupled accelerator lattice. The effects of various coupling sources on beam emittances and sizes can be studied within a self-consistent frame. Both the on- and off-resonance schemes to obtain round beams are explained with examples.

The indicator is represented by the prediction accuracy of surrogate models established purely from data. It provides a metric for the predictability of nonlinear motions in a given system. When using the indicator to implement a tune-scan for a quadratic Henon map; the main resonances and their asymmetric stop-band widths can be identified. When applied to particle transportation in a storage ring; as particle motion becomes more chaotic; its surrogate model prediction accuracy decreases correspondingly. Therefore; the prediction accuracy; acting as a chaos indicator; can be used directly as the objective for nonlinear beam dynamics optimization. This method provides a different perspective on nonlinear beam dynamics and an efficient method for nonlinear lattice optimization.

The frequency of a resonant cavity is perturbed by inserting a metallic or dielectric bead. For a given electromagnetic field; the amplitude of the perturbation depends only on the geometry of the perturbing object. Therefore; the calibration of the bead can be done in different resonant structures without loss of generality. In this paper; a method to perform an accurate calibration of the bead with electromagnetic simulations is proposed. Compared to the common practice of measuring a reference cavity; the flexibility given by the simulation method to study different bead shapes and sizes could be advantageous to optimize the measurement setup.

The output beam of the gun is injected into a dielectric-loaded waveguide where phase velocity of the traveling wave is adjusted in such a way that electrons see an accelerating field all the way along the tube resulting to an 18.5-MeV output beam which is then transported to an inverse Compton scattering (ICS) stage. The injection phase of the electrons can be tuned to introduce a negative energy chirp to the electron bunch leading to a ballistic bunch compression after the linac.

This very high surface electric field leads to the generation of undesirable electrons due to the field emission effect. The emitted electrons can be captured and propagate along the Linac forming a dark current beam; leading to background radiation that can damage the instrumentation and radioactivate components. Consequently; it is important that the emission of these electrons; and their subsequent transportation; is carefully evaluated. Recently; in the framework of the I-FAST project; a high gradient; standing wave; C-band (5712 MHz) RF photogun has been designed and will be realized soon.

To achieve a cold beam at this low energy; the electron gun must emit a monoenergetic and relatively intense electron beam. An optimization of the electron gun involving a cold cathode is studied to investigate the feasibility of using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as cold electron field emitters. CNTs are considered among the most promising field emitting materials. However; stability data for emission over hundreds of hours; as well as lifetime and conditioning process studies to ensure optimal performance; are still incomplete or missing; especially if the aim is to use them in operation. This contribution reports experiments that characterize these properties and assess whether CNTs are suitable to be used as cold electron field emitters for many hundreds of hours.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopoms028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopoms028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopoms028_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOMS028,699

Great potential exists for new scientific discovery at higher energies (42+ keV) such as envisioned at MaRIE (Matter-Radiation Interactions in Extremes) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. These instruments can require a large amount of real estate; which quickly escalates costs: The driver of the FEL is typically an electron beam linear accelerator (LINAC) and the need for higher beam energies capable of generating these X-rays can dictate that the linac becomes longer. State of art accelerating technology is required to reduce the linac length by reducing the size of the cavities; providing for compact; high-frequency; high acceleration gradients. Here; we describe using the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) to facilitate our investigations into design concepts for future XFEL high-gradient LINAC’s in the C-band (~4-8 GHz). We investigate two different traveling wave (TW) geometries optimized for high-gradient operation as modeled at the ALCF using VSim software.*,,* https://www.txcorp.com reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopoms029_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopoms029.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopoms029_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOMS029,703

Moreover; they may initially have a rather large emittance. To analyze the energy range of a single shot and/or to deflect the beam to safely dump the electrons away from an end-station requires an electron kicker covering a large energy range. Here; we present a magnetic dipole structure based on a 2D Halbach array. For the current experimental test accelerator in AXSIS; an electron beam in the energy range from 4 to 20 MeV is deflected by 90 degree and energetically dispersed. In direct contrast to a simple magnetic dipole; an array of cubic magnet blocks with tailored magnetization directions allows a focusing of the beam for both longitudinal and transverse directions at 90 degree bend. A generic algorithm optimizes the magnetic field array to the predefined deflection angle and divergence. The modular array structure; in combination with the algorithm enables a simple exchange of magnets to adapt for different beam parameters.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopoms032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopoms032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopoms032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOMS032,706

There is further an increasing interest in fabrication and control of cathode surface to better control the emission characteristics and improve beam brightness. One method which we can consider is based on well-known silicon nanofabrication techniques which we use to create patterned cathode surfaces. The sharp edges produced lead to field emission increases and high brightness emission. We have demonstrated that a beam can be successfully extracted with a low emittance and we have reconstructed a portion of the energy spectrum. Due to the simplicity of extended geometries in nanofabrication our beam uniquely possesses a high aspect ratio in its transverse cross section. We can begin to consider modifications for emittance exchange beamlines and having shown the patterning principle is sound we can consider additional patterns such as hollow beams. Future work will continue to characterize the produced beam and the addition of fabrication steps to remove one of the blades in the double blade geometry in order to more accurately characterize the emission. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopoms033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopoms033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopoms033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOMS033,709

Summarizing the ability for a crystal to emit in a particular direction would be of great use when searching for good field emitters.

We utilize these results as well as similar previous results to further understand the physics underlying electron rescattering-type emissions.

Electron beams with energies above 20 MeV are usually built within concrete bunkers and therefore the design of any beam dump would just be a lead block (very cost effective) as close to the electron source as possible; after a vacuum flange of some sort. In a study of a hypothetical 100 MeV electron beam inside a concrete bunker with an extremely low dose rate constraint outside the bunker; the thickness of lead required would have been too restrictive for a compact design. In this study we investigate the potential benefits of designs that incorpo-rate low Z materials like graphite as the primary target material in vacuum followed by progressively higher Z materials up to lead. The results show the more diffuse elastic scattering from the primary target reduces the back scattered photons and reduces the overall neutron genera-tion. The effect was a more compact design for the beam dump to meet the same dose rate constraint.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mopoms039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mopoms039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mopoms039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOPOMS039,721

The previous abort system was not fast enough for sudden beam loss that caused QCS quench; and it gave a damage to the collimator and the Belle-II detector. A fast abort system is required to pre-venting such damage. The abort system consists of sev-eral sensors that generate interlock signal (the loss moni-tor; dose in the Bell-II detector; and the magnet failure etc.); optical cable system to transfer the interlock signal to central control room (CCR); the abort trigger signal generation system and the abort kicker. To reduce total time; we reduce transmission time from local control room to CCR by changing signal cable route. Since the interlock signal produced by magnet power supply was slow; we modified the magnet power supply. For more quick generation of abort trigger signal; we increased number of the abort gap. By these improvements; an average abort time is reduced from 31µsec to 25µsec. This improvement looks small; but it brought preventing the serious radiation damage to many hardware compo-nents.

Indication of CP violations in neutrinos was reported and the order of the neutrino mass hierarchy was almost determined. A possibility of a sterile neutrino was also suggested. For muons; the anomalous magnetic moment; g-2; has been precisely measured and the result shows a significant deviation from the prediction calculated by the standard model (SM). These results have attracted many discussions about new physics beyond the SM; such as a suggestion of a new massive particle; a candidate of the dark matter; and a solution to the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter.

To consolidate the new physics; many new experimental projects using high-energy and high-intensity accelerators are proposed and conducted. This talk presents the recent results from neutrino oscillation experiments and muon g-2 measurements; possible new physical models beyond the SM; and future prospects of new experiments including the synergy with energy frontier.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/mooplgd1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/mooplgd1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/mooplgd1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-MOOPLGD1,

The coronagraph has three stages of optical systems; objective system; re-diffraction system and relay system. Since the SR monitor of SuperKEKB has a long optical path (60 m); we need an objective system with long focal length. The Aperture limit is determined by the diamond mirror which is set in 23.6 m from the source point. Therefore; we must assign this aperture for the entrance pupil of the objective system. For satisfying these conditions; we design a reflective telephoto system based on the Gregorian telescope for the objective system. The focal length is designed to 7028 mm. and front principal point position is designed to the position of diamond mirror. The result of construction; the performance of the objective system has a diffraction limited quality. The re-diffraction system and relay system are also designed based on Kepler type telescope. The result of optical testing using the beam in the HER; we achieved a contrast of 6 order magnitude.

The CNN is trained by supervised learning over a wide range of input beam distributions; accelerator parameters; and the associated 6D beam phase spaces at multiple accelerator locations. The CNN is applied in an un-supervised adaptive manner without knowledge of the input beam distribution or accelerator parameters and is robust to their unknown time variation. Adaptive feedback automatically tunes the low-dimensional latent space of the encoder-decoder CNN to predict the 6D phase space based only on 2D (z; E) longitudinal phase space measurements from a device such as a transverse deflecting RF cavity (TCAV). This method has the potential to provide diagnostics beyond the existing state of the art at many accelerator facilities.

Studies ascribed the heat source to electron cloud build-up; indicating an unexpected high Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) of the beam screen surface in some LHC regions. The inner copper surface of high and low heat load beam screens; extracted during the Long Shutdown 2; was analysed. On the low heat load ones; the surface was covered with the native Cu2O oxide; while on the high heat load ones CuO dominated at surface; and it exhibited a very low carbon coverage. Such chemical modifications increase the SEY and inhibit a proper conditioning of the affected surfaces. Following this characterisation; the mechanisms for CuO build-up in the LHC beam pipe were investigated on a newly commissioned cryogenic system allowing electron irradiation; surface chemical characterisation by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and SEY measurements on samples held below 15 K. In parallel; curative solutions against the presence of CuO in the LHC beam screens were explored; which could be implemented in-situ to recover a proper conditioning and lower the beam-induced heat load.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tuoxsp1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tuoxsp1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tuoxsp1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUOXSP1,780

The first prototype of an AM pure-copper radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) has been produced; corresponding to 1/4 of a 4-vane RFQ*. It was optimised for production with state-of-the-art laser powder bed fusion technology. Geometrical precision and roughness of the critical surfaces were measured. Alt-hough the obtained values were beyond standard RFQ specifications; these first results are promising and con-firmed the feasibility of AM manufactured complex cop-per accelerator cavities. Therefore; further post-processing trials have been conducted with the sample RFQ to im-prove surface roughness. Algorithms for the AM techno-logical processes have also been improved; allowing for higher geometrical precision. This resulted in the design of a full 4-vane RFQ prototype.

A new acceleration scheme with charge stripper rings (CSRs) as a cost-effective way to enhance the charge stripping efficiency has been proposed. The CSR recycles beams other than the selected charge state that was previously dumped. These beams are orbited in the CSR while suppressing emittance growth; and then re-enter the stripper.

Twenty four sextupole magnets are mounted on a tilting table and their tilt angles can be varied form - 30 degree to + 30 degree remotely to control the ratio of the skew to normal sextupole magnetic field components. In the 2021c run; one of the chromatic coupling parameters was varied using different setups of the tilting angles of the 24 sextupole magnets for the first time in a collider. It was found that the emittance growth at the primary (nux-nuy-nus=n) and secondary (nux-nuy-2nus=n) synchro-beta resonance lines can be controlled by tilting the sextupole magnets.

The steering of the electron beam through the transfer line from linear accelerator to the Booster Synchrotron is currently adjusted by hand; which limits a systematic improvement of the transfer efficiency. An automated optimization using the ‘‘simulated annealing’’ technique has been developed and integrated into the control system to improve the situation. It allows for a continuous optimization without interfering with usual beamtime for experiments by utilizing the 6s off-time in between injections into the stretcher ring.

It was applied in the SPS; separately to each of its six accelerating travelling wave structures. A low spread in voltage errors was obtained by carefully optimizing the number of acquired bunch profiles. The technique moreover provided the relative phases of the cavities; which allowed their alignment to be checked. Pairs of cavities were measured as well to validate the consistency of the single-cavity voltages. The beam measurements were repeated after several months to confirm the reproducibility of the results. Longitudinal beam dynamics simulations; including the full SPS impedance model; were performed as a benchmark. The aim was to verify that the effect of the cable transfer-function on the bunch profiles can be neglected; as well as collective effects and small errors in the accelerator parameters.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupost005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupost005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupost005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOST005,841

The quality of the reconstruction depends on the accuracy to which these parameters are known. Therefore; it can be used for beam-based RF voltage calibration by analysing oscillations of a mismatched bunch. The actual RF voltage may be different from the programmed one due to uncertainties of the electrical gap voltage measurements and intensity effects. Tomography-based RF voltage calibration was systematically performed with low-intensity bunches in all four rings of the PS Booster (PSB) at injection and extraction energy. For each of the three RF cavities present in a given ring; the calibration was performed separately to extract the voltage errors while avoiding any influence of phase misalignments. The number of synchrotron oscillation periods available for the voltage calibration was constrained by the short duration of the PSB flat-bottom and top. Longitudinal beam dynamics simulations using the full PSB impedance model were performed to benchmark the results provided by the calibrations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupost006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupost006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupost006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOST006,845

In such a configuration switching from short-pulse operation into long-pulse with the existing limitations from the allowed cryo heat load level; average input power per coupler (and others) can be extremely challenging. For this setup the support from the dynamic resonance control system is essential. This paper summarizes efforts towards the successful vector-sum operation of the X-FEL type cryomodule in the LP operation mode. Modifications to the original LLRF setup together with challenges of narrow bandwidth operation in moderate and high gradients are discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupost018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupost018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupost018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOST018,888

The short- and long-term beam energy stabilization requirements necessitate using a high-quality Master Oscillator (MO). The consecutive sections of the Linac will operate at 162.5; 325; and 650 MHz. The phase relations between reference signals of harmonic frequencies should be kept constant; and the phase noise should be correlated in a wide bandwidth. The possibility of simultaneously meeting both requirements using popular frequency synthesis schemes is discussed. The ultra-low noise floor of the fundamental source is challenging for other devices in the phase reference distribution system. Therefore; the sensitivity to operating conditions; including impedance matching; input power level; and power supply voltage; must be considered. This paper presents a preliminary performance test of critical components selected for the PIP-II Master Oscillator system performed using a state-of-the-art phase noise analyzer.; The paper was prepared by WUT and PIP-II; using the resources of Fermilab; a U.S. Department of Energy; Office of Science; HEP User Facility.

The architecture has also been reviewed; with synchronization between RF stations now resting on the White Rabbit (WR) deterministic link. This paper is the first of a series of three on the SPS LLRF upgrade.

Its focus is the upgrade concerned with the acceleration of Lead ions for injection into the LHC. Lead ions are far from relativistic at injection into the SPS. Therefore; the classic acceleration scheme at constant harmonic number (h=4620) does not work as the RF frequency swing does not fit within the cavity bandwidth. Fixed Frequency Acceleration (FFA) is therefore used. The upgraded LLRF uses a completely new implementation of the FFA; based on a Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) implemented as an FPGA IP in the Controller of each cavity. In addition; the 2022 scheme for LHC ions filling calls for slip stacking of two families of bunches; 100 ns spacing; to generate a 50 ns spacing after interleaving.

It covers the 200MHz Cavity-Controller part; that is responsible for the regulation of the accelerating field in a single SPS cavity. When the SPS is used as Large Hadron Collider (LHC) proton injector; the issue is the high beam loading that must be compensated to guarantee longitudinal stability and constant parameters over the bunch train. That calls for strong One-Turn Delay Feedback (OTFB) and Feed-Forward (FFWD). The SPS is also accelerating Lead ions (Pb). There the issue is Frequency-Modulation (FM) and Amplitude-Modulation (AM) over the turn (so called Fixed Frequency Acceleration - FFA) plus RF gymnastics for the new ions slip-stacking.

These are then used to IQ demodulate the voltage gap and modulate the 16 RF drive signals each controlled through a Cartesian feedback loop (with individual voltage and phase control). The sum of these digital drive signals is then sent to the cavities. In addition; a configurable blow-up system providing a sinusoidal or custom noise pattern can be used to excite the beam. An embedded network analyzer allows studying the stability of the feedback loops of the individual harmonics.

Two inclined septa combined with a collapsing horizontal orbit bump allow a 6-D phase space painting via a linearly ramped mean momentum along the Linac3 pulse and injection at high dispersion. The beam is cooled and dragged longitudinally via electron cooling (e-cooling) into a stacking momentum. For optimal accumulation; the electron energy and trajectory need to match the ion energy and orbit at the e-cooler section. In this paper; a reinforcement learning (RL) agent is trained to adjust various e-cooler and Linac3 parameters to maximise the intensity at the end of the injection plateau. Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) are used to compress longitudinal Schottky spectra into a compact representation as input for the RL agent. The RL agent is pre-trained on a surrogate model of the LEIR e-cooling dynamics; which in turn is learned from the data collected for the training of the VAE.

The process consists of injecting bandwidth-limited noise into the main RF phase loop to diffuse particles in the core of the bunch. The setting up of the noise parameters; such as frequency band and amplitude; is a non-trivial and time-consuming procedure that has been performed manually so far. In this preliminary study; several optimization methods are investigated to set up the noise parameters automatically. We apply the CERN Common Optimization Interfaces as a generic framework for the optimization algorithm.

However; these cannot always be obtained without disrupting user runs. Physics-based simulations; such as particle tracking codes; can be leveraged to provide estimates of these beam descriptors. However; such simulation-based methods are computationally intensive requiring access to high performance computing facilities; and hence; they are often non-realistic for real-time purposes. The proposed work explores the feasibility of using machine learning to replace these simulations with fast-executing inference models based on surrogate modelling. The approach is intended to provide the operators with estimates of key beam properties in real time. Bayesian optimisation is used to generate a synthetic dataset to ensure the input space is efficiently sampled and representative of operating conditions. This is used to train a surrogate model to predict beam envelope; emittance and loss.

Its measurements guide the initial tuning of an accelerator and are typically done using quadrupole or wire scans. Quadrupole scans are time-intensive; and it can be difficult to determine scan values that provide a good emittance measurement. To address this issue; we describe an adaptive quadrupole scan method that automates the determination of the scan range. With a given initial set of scanning values; our method adapts the range to capture the waist of the beam; and returns the Twiss parameters and a measure of the beam matching at the measurement screen. With the added capability to repeat beam size measurements when needed; this method provides a reliable measurement of the emittance even with sub-optimal initial conditions. To efficiently integrate these measurements into Python-based machine learning optimizations; the method was developed into a Python package; PyEmittance; at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

As the LUXE experiment has specific beam size requirements at its IP; these effects and the limits on the focus must be characterised.

Such X-rays allow for larger penetration depths and enable the investigation of materials in highly absorbing environments. Delivering the requested X-rays to user experiments is of crucial importance for the XFEL development. Unique capabilities of the European XFEL are formed by combining a high energy linac and the long variable-gap undulator systems for generating intense X-rays at 25 keV and pushing the limit even further to 30 keV. However; the FEL performance relies on achievable electron bunch qualities. Low-emittance electron bunch production; and the associated start-to-end modelling of beam physics thus becomes a prerequisite to dig into the XFEL potentials. Here; we present the obtained results from a virtual commissioning of the XFEL for the user experiments at 25 keV and beyond; including the optimized electron bunch qualities at variable accelerating cathode gradients and lasing studies under different conditions.; *Appl.

Earlier studies have shown that a resonator-like modulator combined with an amplifier in high gain harmonic generation (HGHG) configuration can be used to generate radiation whose wavelength can reach the water window region.

For example; the deviation between beam orbit and the magnetic center of undulator can affect the interaction between the electron beam and the FEL pulse. Usually; FEL commissioning requires a lot of effort for multi-dimensional parameters optimization in a time-varying system. Therefore; advanced algorithms are needed to facilitate the commissioning procedure.

The ultimate goal of the development plan consists in doubling the photon energy range and reducing the pulse duration below the characteristic lifetime of the atomic core levels located in the energy range of the source. One of the most promising approaches is the echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) scheme; relying on two external lasers to precisely control the spectro-temporal properties of the FEL pulse. The implementation of EEHG in the double-stage harmonic cascade presently in use on FEL-2; would allow harmonics as high as 120 enabling to generate coherent pulses down to 2 nm starting from UV lasers. An upgrade of FERMI aimed at reaching the oxygen K-edge requires a profound modification of the FEL configurations and of the main components of the machine; including the linac and the undulator lines. The main aspects of the upgrade strategy will be discussed in this presentation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupopt018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupopt018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupopt018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOPT018,

Using the High Gain Harmonic Generation (HGHG) setup; nearly transform-limited pulses with gigawatt peak power are made available. Furthermore; several multicolor and coherent control schemes are possible and highly required from the user community. To meet the request of extending the spectral range over the whole water window; an upgrade strategy of the FERMI facility has recently initiated. During the first phase of the upgrade; the single cascade FEL-1 will be adapted to operate either in Echo Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) or in HGHG. Required modifications can be achieved with limited impact on FERMI operations and will improve FEL-1’s spectral range; spectral quality and flexibility. The second phase includes modification of the FEL-2 setup and will benefit from the experience gained with phase 1. The two phases will proceed in parallel to the linac upgrade aiming at extending the beam energy to 1.8 GeV. We report here details on the upgrade of the FEL-1 foreseen to provide light to users in the new configuration by spring 2023.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupopt019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupopt019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupopt019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOPT019,

These schemes lase an electron beam in an undulator within an optical cavity to produce X-rays. X-rays circulate in the cavity and interact with fresh electron bunches to seed the FEL process over multiple passes; producing progressively brighter and more spectrally pure X-rays. Typically; the optical cavities used are composed of Bragg-reflecting mirrors to provide high reflectivity and spectral filtering. This high reflectivity necessitates special techniques to out-couple X-rays from the cavity to deliver them to users. One method involves ""Q-switching"" the cavity by actively modifying the reflectivity of one Bragg-reflecting crystal.

Here we report the experimental generation of sub-femtosecond duration soft x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses with hundreds of microjoules of energy using fresh-slice amplification in two cascaded stages at the Linac Coherent Light Source. In the first stage; an enhanced self-amplified spontaneous emission (ESASE) pulse is generated using laser-shaping of the electron beam at the photocathode*. The electron bunch is then delayed relative to the pulse by a magnetic chicane; allowing the radiation to slip onto a fresh slice of the bunch; which amplifies the ESASE pulse in the second cascade stage. Angular streaking** characterizes the experimental pulse durations as sub-femtosecond at ~465 eV in the experiment.; * Zhang; Z. et al. New J. Phys. 22 (2020)  ** Li; S. et al.

In the next step; high-power FEL operation in CW mode should be carried out with energy recovery by increasing electron bunches drastically. However; momentum spread of the electron beam increases due to the FEL-light emission and the space charge effects and may cause serious beam loss by exceeding the momentum acceptance of the cERL downstream of the FEL. Therefore; we reconstructed the dump line in Autumn 2020 in order to greatly increase the momentum acceptance with improvement of the beam-tuning flexibility. Then we performed the beam-transport study of the reconstructed dump line in March 2021 by injecting the beam directly from the injector without passing the recirculation loop.

Laser-Compton backscattering can provide a quasi-monochromatic highly polarized X-ray to γ-ray beam without strongly affecting the electron beam due to the small recoil and the small Compton cross-section. Highest energies of the scattered photons are obtained for photon-scattering angles of \ang{180}; i. e.; backscattering. A project at TU Darmstadt foresees to synchronize a highly repetitive high-power laser with the Superconducting DArmstadt electron LINear ACcelerator S\hbox{-}DALINAC; capable of running in energy recovery mode * to realize a laser-Compton backscattering source with photon beam energy up to §I{180}{\kilo\electronvolt}.

Operator efforts to tune the machine during live operation are often restricted to local parameter space searches; while existing physics-based simulations are generally too computationally expensive to aid tuning in real-time. To this end; Machine Learning-based surrogate models can be trained on data produced by physics-based simulations; and serve to produce fast; accurate predictions of key beam properties; such as beam phase and bunch shape over time. These models can be used as a virtual diagnostic tool to explore the parameter space of the accelerator in real-time; without making changes on the live machine. At the ISIS Neutron and Muon source; major beam losses in the synchrotron are caused by injection and longitudinal trapping processes; as well as high intensity effects.

This module has 16 LVDS inputs and 16 LVDS outputs each on the front panel and the Zone 3 connector, and 8 M-LVDS I/O’s for MTCA.4 backplane. The trigger timing of each output can be precisely adjusted with the interval of 238 MHz or 509 MHz clocks by a 24-bit counter. The timing can also be fine-tuned by ~80 ps tap delay. This module has additional 5 optical transceivers, one for receiving trigger signals from upstream and four for fanouts to downstream. A master module distributes trigger signals, trigger counts, and event data through optical links. Slave modules generate trigger output signals with appropriate delays based on the event data and the local setting for each output channel. The timing jitter was measured to be 40 ps std, which is significantly smaller than the clock period of 238 MHz or 509 MHz. This system can also distribute an alarm signal received by a slave module to take data at a faulty situation. Trigger systems with this module have been utilized in SPring-8, SACLA, and NewSUBARU and stably synchronize various accelerator components with sufficient timing accuracy. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupopt067_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupopt067.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupopt067_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOPT067,

Its main purpose are high resolution measurements of the surface resistance with direct access to the residual resistance thanks to the low frequency of the first operating quadrupole mode. Besides the well-known high resolution of the QPR; a bias of measurement data towards higher values has been observed; especially at higher harmonic quadrupole modes. Numerical studies show that this can be explained by parasitic RF losses on the adapter flange used to mount samples into the QPR. Coating several micrometer of niobium on those surfaces of the stainless steel flange that are exposed to the RF fields significantly reduced this bias; enabling a direct measurement of a residual resistance smaller than 5 nano-Ohm at 2 K and 413 MHz.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupotk005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupotk005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupotk005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOTK005,

A possible way to meet the requirements is the so-called nitrogen-infusion procedure on Niobium cavities. However; a fundamental understanding and a theoretical model of this method are still missing. One important parameter is the residual resistance ratio (RRR) which is related to the impurity content of the material. We report the investigated RRR on samples in a wide temperature range in a vacuum and under a nitrogen atmosphere. This comparison made it possible to make statements about the differences in the concentration of nitrogen by varying the temperature. The samples are pure cavity-grade niobium and treated in the same manner as cavities. For this purpose; a small furnace dedicated to sample treatment was set up to change and explore the parameter space of the infusion recipe. Care was taken to achieve the highest level of purity possible in the furnace and in a pressure range of 1.0·10-8 mbar in order to meet the high requirements of nitrogen infusion.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupotk012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupotk012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupotk012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOTK012,

However; coating and testing thin films on full-sized cavities is both challenging and timeconsuming. As a result; films are typically deposited on small; flat samples and characterised using a test cavity. At Daresbury Laboratory; a facility for testing 10 cm diameter samples has recently been commissioned. The cavity uses RF chokes to allow physical and thermal separation between itself and the sample under test. The facility allows for surface resistance measurements at a resonant frequency of 7.8 GHz; at temperatures down to 4 K; maximum RF power of 1 W and peak magnetic fields of a few mT. The main advantage of this system is the simple sample mounting procedure due to no physical welding between the sample and test cavity. This allows for a fast turnaround time of two to three days between samples. As such; this system can be used to quickly identify which samples are performing well under RF and should require further testing at higher gradient.

High Q0 decreases the capital required to keep the accelerators cold by reducing power loss. The performance of SRF cavities is largely governed by the surface composition of the first §I{100}{nm} of the cavity surface. Impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen have been observed to yield high Q0; but their precise roles are still being studied. Here; we compare the performance of cavities doped with nitrogen and oxygen in terms of surface composition and heating behavior with field. A simulation of the diffusion of oxygen into the bulk of the cavity was built using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Simulated results were compared to the actual surface composition of the cavities as determined from secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis. Understanding how these impurities affects performance allows us to have further insight into the underlying mechanisms that enable these surface treatments to yield high Q0.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupotk034_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupotk034.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupotk034_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOTK034,

In the next step; the waveguide slots are optimized to first have a smooth transition from the cavity to the slots to avoid large peak surface fields and second to achieve high transmission at dipole mode frequencies and low transmission at fundamental mode frequency while keeping the design compact.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupotk048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupotk048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupotk048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOTK048,

The setup was modified to serve the ELSA stretcher ring as booster synchrotron in 1987; but the RF infrastructure was barely altered. As repairs of the reliable; but antiquated RF source became foreseeingly impossible due to the lack of spare part availability; the replacement of the klystron amplifier chain in favour of a state-of-the-art solid state amplifier was carried out.

Crystal collimation is studied to further improve the collimation efficiency at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In order to reproduce the main experimental results of crystal collimation tests and to predict the performance of such a system; a simulation routine capable of modeling interactions of beam particles with crystal collimators was developed and recently integrated into the latest release of the single-particle tracking code SixTrack. A new treatment of the miscut angle; i.e. the angle between crystalline planes and crystal edges; was implemented to study the effects of this manufacturing imperfection on the efficiency of a crystal collimation system.

This scheme is planned to be used at the LHC to improve the betatron cleaning efficiency with high-intensity ion beams. Only particles with impinging angles below 2.5 urad relative to the crystalline planes can be efficiently channeled at the LHC nominal top energy of 7 Z TeV. For this reason; crystals must be kept in optimal alignment with respect to the circulating beam envelope to maximize the efficiency of the channeling process. Given the small angular acceptance; achieving optimal channeling conditions is particularly challenging. Furthermore; the different phases of the LHC operational cycle involve important dynamic changes of the local orbit and optics; requiring an optimized control of position and angle of the crystals relative to the beam. To this end; the possibility to apply machine learning to the alignment of the crystals; in a dedicated setup and in standard operation; is considered.

The highest losses are concentrated in the downstream dispersion suppressor (DS). Given the increased beam intensity in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC); there is concern that these losses could risk quenching the superconducting DS magnets. Consequently; a dedicated upgrade of the DS has been studied. However; at this stage; the deployment for the startup of the HL-LHC is uncertain due to delays in the availability of high-field magnets needed to integrate new collimators into the DS. In this paper; we describe the expected collimation setup for the first run of the HL-LHC and explore various techniques to improve the collimation cleaning.

This lattice adapts to the current tunnel geometry as well as to preserve as much as possible the present beamline positions. The TDR lattice is an evolution of the CDR one including longer short straight sections; better relative magnet positioning; and the replacement quadrupole triplets by quadruplets for improving flexibility of optics matching in straight section. The SOLEIL upgrade TDR lattice is then composed of 20 HOA cells with a two-fold symmetry; and provides 20 straight sections having four different lengths of 3.0; 4.2; 8.0; and 8.2 m. This paper reports the linear and the non-linear beam dynamic optimization based on intense MOGA investigations; mainly to improve the energy acceptance required to keep a large enough Touschek beam lifetime.

High-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) based on the interaction of electrons with a single laser pulse is routinely applied at a few FELs; and echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) with a twofold laser-electron interaction has been demonstrated. Both schemes can be adopted in storage rings for the coherent emission of ultrashort radiation pulses. Coherent harmonic generation (CHG) is the counterpart to HGHG without FEL gain. It has been employed at several storage rings and presently provides ultrashort pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet regime at the 1.5-GeV electron storage ring DELTA operated by the TU Dortmund University. EEHG; which allows to reach higher harmonics of the seed wavelength; has not yet been implemented at any storage ring but is pursued at DELTA as an upgrade plan.

The MIR-THz sources would cover the frequency range from 0.1 to 30 THz with the pulse energies of a few 100 µJ. The use of the CW SRF linac and the radiation source architecture will allow for high flexibility in the pulse repetition rate. Conventional superradiant THz sources; driven by electron bunches shorter than the radiation wavelength; would cover the wavelength range from 0.1 THz to about 2.5 THz. A different approach is developed to extend the operation of the superradiant undulators well beyond the few THz. For this; a longitudinally modulated electron bunch would be used to achieve significant bunching factors at higher frequencies. The proposed VUV FEL would use the HGHG FEL scheme. It will allow the construction of a unique; fully coherent; high repetition rate source operated with about 30 µJ pulse energy at the first harmonic in the design wavelength range. An FEL oscillator; operating at a wavelength 3-5 times longer than the HGHG system; can generate the seed required for the high repetition rate HGHG scheme.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupoms013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupoms013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupoms013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOMS013,

In the domain of intelligent control of accelerator facilities; the research has mostly been focused on feasibility demonstration of ML-based agents; or application of ML-based agents to a well-defined problem such as parameter tuning. The main challenge on the way to a more holistic AI-based operation; in our opinion; is of engineering nature and is related to the need of significant reduction of the amount of human intervention. The areas where such intervention is still significant are: training and tuning of ML models; scheduling and orchestrating of multiple intelligent agents; data stream handling; configuration management; and software testing and verification requiring advanced simulation environment.

The beam lifetime will only be in the range of 5 h in the timing mode (80 high-intensity bunches) leading to a maximum power loss of ~170 mW along the storage ring (excluding injection losses). To avoid the demagnetization of the permanent-magnet undulators and combined-function magnets; this radiation-sensitive hardware has to be shielded against losses as well as possible. Such shielding elongates the lifetime of the hardware and consequently reduces the time and the resources that are spent on maintenance once PETRA IV is operational. This contribution presents options for collimator locations; e.g.; at the dispersion bump in the achromat cell; to reduce the exposure to losses from the Touschek effect and the injection process. This contribution also quantifies the risk of damaging the installed collimation system in case of hardware failure; e.g.; RF cavity or quadrupole failure; since the beam with an emittance of 20 pm could damage collimators if there is no emittance blow-up.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupoms019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupoms019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupoms019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOMS019,

With the Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) seeding method; we aim for the generation of fully coherent XUV and soft X-ray pulses at wavelengths down to 4 nm. The generated FEL radiation is sensitive to various electron beam properties; e.g.; its energy profile imprinted either deliberately or by collective effects such as Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR).

The new storage ring will require a harmonic cavity that lengthens the bunches to increase the Touschek lifetime as well as mitigate instabilities and suppress the emittance blow up from intrabeam scattering. It is expected that the ring will have to operate with gaps in the fill pattern for ion-clearing; but that will lead to transient beam loading resulting in reduced bunch lengthening. The length and occurrence of the gaps therefore have to be determined as a trade-off between the requirements for transient beam loading and ion-trapping. This paper presents simulations of both effects for the Diamond-II storage ring to find an optimal fill pattern.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupoms031_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupoms031.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupoms031_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOMS031,

This is achieved by a feedback which modifies the skew quadrupole strengths; but has disadvantages such as the introduction of betatron coupling and vertical dispersion. For the proposed Diamond-II upgrade; the storage ring will have a much smaller horizontal emittance; meaning a significantly larger coupling would be required to reach the target vertical emittance; negatively affecting the off-axis injection process. To solve this problem; a feedback using the transverse multibunch feedback striplines to drive the beam at a synchrotron sideband is planned. By driving the beam resonantly in this way; the emittance can be increased without modification of the optics. This paper describes simulations of the effects of linear and non-linear optics on the excitation as well as the impact of the machine impedance for the Diamond-II storage ring.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupoms035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupoms035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupoms035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOMS035,

The low operating energy of 50-100 MeV makes the impedances of the cavity higher order modes (HOMs) particularly critical for the beam stability. Their parasitic effects on the beam can be cured by HOM frequency shifting techniques; based on a fine temperature tuning and a dedicated adjustable plunger. A cavity temperature stability of ± 0.1 °C within a range from 30 up to 70 °C is achieved by a precise control of its water-cooling temperature. On the other hand; the tuning of the cavity fundamental mode is achieved by changing its axial length by means of a mechanical tuner. In order to insure a fine control of the HOM frequencies; a good knowledge of their characteristics is mandatory. The main parameters of the fundamental and of the HOMs up to 2.2 GHz versus temperature have been measured at low power using a vector network analyzer (VNA).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/tupoms040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/tupoms040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/tupoms040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-TUPOMS040,

One undulator line; composed of 21 horizontally polarizing undulator segments; is dedicated to producing Soft X-Rays (SXR). The other line; composed of 32 vertically polarizing undulator segments; is dedicated to producing Hard X-Rays (HXR). The devices were installed; and the control system was deployed in 2019. Commissioning culminated with the achievement of first light from the HXR undulator in the Summer of 2020 and from the SXR undulator in the Fall of 2020. Since then; both undulator lines have been successfully providing x-Rays to user experiments with very limited downtime.

At LANL we commissioned a test stand (CERF-NM) powered by a 50 MW; 5.712 GHz Canon klystron. The test stand is capable of conditioning accelerating cavities for operation at surface electric fields in excess of 300 MV/m. CERF-NM is the first high gradient C-band test facility in the United States. An important milestone for this test stand is to demonstrate conditioning and high gradient testing of the most basic high gradient RF cavity with a geometry that has been extensively studied at other frequencies; such as X-band.

The beam loss at 1 MW has already been well controlled; but for further minimizing both uncontrolled and controlled beam losses caused by the foil scattering of the circulating beam; recently we have implemented a lower vertical injection beam size and installed a corresponding smaller size stripper foil. A smaller foil gives a significant reduction of the foil scattering uncontrolled beam loss at the injection area; while an optimization of the vertical transverse painting area matching with a smaller beam size further gives an extremely reduction of the beam loss at the collimator section. The corresponding residual radiation at the recent operation with 700 kW beam power was also measured to extremely reduced.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/weoygd1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/weoygd1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/weoygd1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEOYGD1,

The focus of this research is on single-photon and two-photon undulator emissions. We begin by using one Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) detector to detect the undulator radiation photons and search for possible deviations from the expected Poissonian photon statistics. Then; we go on to use a two-photon interferometer consisting of two SPAD detectors separated by a beam splitter. This allows to test if there is any correlation in the detected photon pairs. In addition; the photocount arrival times can be used to track the longitudinal motion of a single electron and to compare it with simulations.

Despite the promising potential of a multi-TeV muon collider; the short lifetime of muons poses a severe technological challenge for the collider design. In particular; the copious production of decay electrons and positrons along the collider ring requires the integration of continuous radiation absorbers inside superconducting magnets. The absorbers are needed to avoid quenches; reduce the heat dissipation in the cold mass and prevent magnet failures due to long-term radiation damage. In this paper; we present FLUKA shower simulations assessing the shielding requirements for high-field magnets of a 10 TeV muon collider. We quantify in particular the role of synchrotron photon emission by decay electrons and positrons; which helps in dispersing the energy carried by the decay products.

Moreover; the proposed second upgrade of the LHCb experiment (Upgrade II) aims at increasing it by an extra factor 7.5 and collecting an integrated luminosity of 400/fb by the end of Run6. Such an ambitious goal poses challenges not only for the detector but also for the accelerator components. Monte Carlo simulations represent a valuable tool to predict the implications of the radiation impact on the machine; especially for future operational scenarios.

This demands a precise knowledge of the beam energies; obtained by resonant depolarization; and from which the center-of-mass energy and possible boosts at all interaction points are then determined. At the highest beam energy mode of 182.5 GeV; the energy loss due to synchrotron radiation is about 10 GeV per revolution. Hence; not only the location of the RF cavities; but also a precise control of the optics and understanding of beam dynamics; are crucial. In the studies presented here; different possible locations of the RF-cavities are considered; when calculating the beam energies over the machine circumference; including energy losses from crossing angles; a non-homogeneous dipole distribution; and an estimate of the beamstrahlung effect at the collision point.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepost007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepost007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepost007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOST007,

Due to the small cross section; an extremely high rate of positrons is required; which could be achieved by a ’Gamma factory’ based on the LHC. Other challenges with the LEMMA-type muon production scheme include the emittance preservation of muons and muon-generating positrons upon multiple traversals through a target; and the merging of many separate muon bunchlets. These two challenges may potentially be overcome by (1) operating the FCC-ee booster with a barrier bucket and induction acceleration; so that all positrons of a production cycle are merged into one single superbunch instead of storing ~10; 000 separate bunches; and (2) sending the positron superbunch into a plasma target. During the passage of the positron superbunch; the electron density is enhanced 100–1000 fold without any increase in the density of nuclei; so that beamstrahlung and Coulomb scattering are essentially absent. We investigate prospects and difficulties of this approach; including emittance growth due to filamentation in the nonlinear plasma channel and due to positron self-modulation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepost009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepost009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepost009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOST009,

Mainly due to orbit drifts in the SPS; the steering of the SPS-to-LHC transfer lines (TL) had to be regularly performed in view of minimising injection oscillations and losses; which otherwise would trigger beam dumps. Moreover; for machine protection purposes; a maximum of twelve bunches had to be injected after any TL steering to validate the actual applied corrections. This implied at several occasions the need to interrupt a fill to steer the lines and introduced a further delay between fills.

The LHC is equipped with a betatron collimation system; which intercepts the transverse beam halo and protects sensitive equipment such as superconducting magnets against beam losses. However; hadronic fragmentation and electromagnetic dissociation of heavy ions in collimators generate off-rigidity particles; which can be lost in the downstream dispersion suppressor; putting the magnets at risk to quench. An accurate modelling of the beam-induced energy deposition in the collimation system and superconducting magnets is important for quantifying possible performance limitations arising from magnet quenches. In this paper; we compare FLUKA shower simulations against beam loss monitor measurements recorded during the 2018 208Pb82+ run.

However; laser-plasma acceleration is typically modeled with full particle-in-cell (PIC) codes; which can be computationally expensive. Various reduced models can approximate beam behavior at a much lower computational cost. Although such models do not capture the full physics; they could still suggest promising sets of parameters to be simulated with a full PIC code and thereby speed up the overall design optimization. In this work we automate such a workflow with a Bayesian multitask algorithm; where each task has a different fidelity. This algorithm learns from past simulation results from both full PIC codes and reduced PIC codes and dynamically chooses the next parameters to be simulated.

During initial startup of the collider; power out- ages damaged two of the coils in one of the RHIC helical dipole snake magnets used for polarization preservation in the Blue ring. That snake was reconfigured for use as a partial snake. We will outline some of the remediating mea- sures taken to maximize polarization transmission in this configuration. These measures included changing the col- liding beam energy from 255 GeV to 254.2 GeV to adjust the spin closed orbit at store and adjustment of the field in the other helical dipole in the Blue ring to improve injection spin matching. Later in the run; the primary motor gener- ator for the AGS (the injector to RHIC) failed and a lower voltage backup had to be used; resulting in a period of lower polarization. Other efforts include detailed measurement of the stable spin direction at store and the commissioning of a machine protection relay system to prevent spurious firing of the RHIC abort kickers.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepost031_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepost031.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepost031_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOST031,

The witness electron bunches were produced using an RF-gun equipped with a Cs2Te photocathode illuminated by a tailorable ultrafast ultraviolet (UV) laser pulse. The construction of the UV beam optical system enabled appropriate transverse beam shaping and control of its pulse duration; size; and position on the photocathode; as well as time delay with respect to the ionizing laser pulse that seeds the plasma wakefields in the proton bunches.

That is ultimately the motivation: building a plasma based LC. In this case; the blowout region is no longer symmetric around an axis is not equal in the two transverse planes. Focusing is required to keep the particles within the tight apertures and characterizing these accelerators shows the benefits of employing ultra low beam emittances. Beams with high charge and high emittance ratios in excess of 100:1 are available at AWA. If the focusing will not be equal; then we will have different radiation signatures for the flat and symmetric beams in plasma. We use OSIRIS particle-in-cell codes to compare various scenarios including a weak blowout and a strong blowout.

One of the experiments relevant to PWFA research at FACET-II is the ion collapse experiment E-314; which aims to study how ion motion in a PWFA can produce dual-focused equilibrium. As nonlinear focusing effects due to nonuniform ion distributions have not been extensively studied; we explore the difficulties of inducing ion motion in an adiabatic plasma and examines the effect an ion column has on beam focusing. A case study is performed on a system containing a plasma lens and adiabatic PWFA. Ions in the lens section are assumed to be static; while simulations of an adiabatic matching section are modified to include the effects of ion column collapse and their nonlinear focusing fields. Using the parameters of the FACET-II beam; we find that a collapsed ion column amplifies the focusing power of a plasma without compromising emittance preservation.

Producing high-charge states of Boron; Arsenic; and Phosphorous is of interest to the ion implantation community. Higher-charge states allow these doping agents to be accelerated to higher energies within the same accelerating electric fields. When used for doping silicon semiconductors; this allows for deeper implantation of the ions. We use Argon and Helium gas as a proxy to determine whether the Penning ion source could be used for this application as it is less toxic to work with. The ability to reach charge states of greater than 4+ with Argon and 1+ with Helium leads to the possibility of producing highe-charge states of ions used in the ion implantation industry.

EDM experiments in general; being measurement-of-polarization experiments; require long spin-coherence times at around 1; 000 seconds. The FD method involves a further complication (well paid off in orders of precision) of switching the polarity of the guiding field as part of its CW-CCW injection procedure. This latter procedure necessitates a calibration process; during which the beam polarization axis changes its orientation from the radial (used for the measurement) to the vertical (used for the calibration) direction. If this change occurs adiabatically; the beam particles’ spin-vectors follow the direction of the polarization axis; which undermines the calibration technique; however; concerns were raised as to whether violation of adiabaticity could damage spin-coherence.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepopt006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepopt006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepopt006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOPT006,

During the LHC Run 2; local linear coupling in the interaction regions (IR) was shown to have a significant impact on the beam size; making its proper handling a necessity for Run 3 and the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A new approach to accurately minimise the local IR linear coupling based on correlated external variables such as the |C-| had been proposed; which relies on the application of a rigid waist shift in order to create an asymmetry in the IR optics.

The new large-aperture final focusing Nb3Sn quadrupole magnets in IR1 and IR5; which are essential to achieve the luminosity target; will be protected using the novel Coupling Loss Induced Quench (CLIQ) system. A spurious discharge of a CLIQ unit will impact the circulating beam through higher order multipolar field components that develop rapidly over a few turns. This paper reports on dedicated beam tracking studies performed to evaluate the criticality of this failure on the HL-LHC beam. Simulations for different machine and optics configurations show that the beam losses reach a critical level after only five machine turns following the spurious CLIQ trigger; which is much faster than assumed in previous simulations that did not consider the higher order multipolar fields.

The stored energy in each of the two beams will increase to §I{674}{MJ}. The HL-LHC will feature beams whose transverse halos are partially depleted by means of a hollow electron lens. The reduced stored energy in the beam tails will significantly change the development of losses caused by failures. This paper reports on beam tracking simulations evaluating the effect of a partially depleted halo on the criticality and detection of failures originating from the superconducting magnet protection systems. In addition; the effect of the transverse damper operating as a coherent excitation system leading to orbit excursions on a beam with a partially depleted halo is discussed.

In case of a direct impact of a large number of high-energy particle bunches in one location; the damage range in the material is significantly increased due to an effect known as hydrodynamic tunnelling. The effect is caused by the beam-induced reduction of the material density along the beam trajectory; which allows subsequent bunches to penetrate deeper into the target. The assessment of the damage range requires the sequential coupling of an energy-deposition code; like FLUKA; and a hydrodynamic code; like Autodyn. The paper presents the simulations performed for the impact of the nominal LHC beam at 7 TeV on a graphite target.

Magnetic fields generated during the discharge into the quench heaters were identified as the cause. Since the resulting; shielded field inside the beam screen cannot be measured in-situ; the time evolution of the field has to be reconstructed from the measured beam excursions. In this paper; the field-reconstruction method using rotation in normalized phase space and the optimized fitting algorithm are described. The resulting rise times and magnetic field levels are presented for quench events that occurred during regular operation as well as for dedicated beam experiments.

In addition; we incorporated the impedance tuning capability by introducing the kicker aperture adjustment mechanism. Finally; we incorporated high voltage FID feedthroughs (FC26) to this kicker. This paper reports the design and optimization updates of the HSR injection kicker including the impedance tuning capability; optimization of both the characteristic and the beam coupling impedances; and finally the incorporation of a high voltage feedthrough design.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepopt028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepopt028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepopt028_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOPT028,

At energies up to 10 GeV the arcs will be tuned to provide 60 degree phase advance per cell in both planes; whereas at top energy of 18 GeV a 90 degree phase advance per cell will be used; which largely compensates for the horizontal emittance increase with energy. The optics must be matched at three separate energies; and the different phase-advance requirements in both the arc cells and the straight sections make this challenging.

ipac2022,,WEPOPT053,Characterisation of Cooling in the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment,STFC/RAL/ISIS; Chilton; Didcot; Oxon; United Kingdom; Muons; Inc; Illinois; USA; A high-energy muon collider could be the most powerful and cost-effective collider approach in the multi-TeV regime; and a neutrino source based on decay of an intense muon beam would be ideal for measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters. Muon beams may be created through the decay of pions produced in the interaction of a proton beam with a target. The muons are subsequently accelerated and injected into a storage ring where they decay producing a beam of neutrinos; or collide with counter-rotating antimuons. Cooling of the muon beam would enable more muons to be accelerated resulting in a more intense neutrino source and higher collider luminosity. Ionization cooling is the novel technique by which it is proposed to cool the beam. The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment collaboration has constructed a section of an ionization cooling cell and used it to provide the first demonstration of ionization cooling. Here the observation of ionization cooling is described. The results of the further analysis of the data is presented; including studies in different magnet configurations and with more detailed understanding of the detector systematic uncertainty.,,M.A. Cummingspresenter reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepopt053_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepopt053.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepopt053_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOPT053,

Regarding the possible options of positron production; we retain both of the conventional amorphous target and the hybrid target options. The hybrid scheme uses an intense photon production by 6 GeV electrons impinging on a crystal oriented along a lattice axis. In such a way; it involves two targets: a crystal as a photon radiator and an amorphous target-converter. Therefore; to avoid early failure or damage of the target; the candidate materials for the crystal and conversion targets have started to be tested by using the intense electron beam at Mainzer Mikrotron in Germany by the end of 2021. By manipulating the beam intensity; focusing; and chopping; a Peak Energy Deposition Density in the tested targets could be achieved close to that generated by the electron/photon beam in the FCC-ee positron target.

Recently this topic has gained interest however; following the investigation for the emittance growth generation during the LHC energy ramp; due to third order islands. The LHC is equipped with skew-sextupole correctors in the experimental insertions (MCSSX); intended for local compensation at top energy; and with several families of skew sextupole magnets in the arcs (MSS); which are intended for chromatic coupling compensation at top energy but are not optimally placed for resonance compensation. Simulation studies were performed in MAD-X and PTC to assess whether the MSS and MCSSX correctors could be used to compensate skew-sextupole RDTs in the LHC at injection via a response matrix approach; based on measured values at the LHC BPMs. It was found that compensation was viable; but at the cost of significantly increased corrector strength compared to chromatic coupling compensation.,,E.H. Macleanpresenter reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepopt058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepopt058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepopt058_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOPT058,

Based on previous studies; it was predicted that the current corrections would not be able to compensate this; thereby leading to a degradation of the dynamic aperture by about 0.5 - 1 ’. On the other hand; the separation dipole D1 is expected to have a systematic b5 component of 6-7 units and its contribution to the resonance driving terms will partly compensate the effect of D2; due to the opposite field strength of the main component. Simulations were performed with the HL-LHC V1.4 lattice to test these concerns and to verify the compensation assumption. In addition; various normal decapole resonance driving terms were examined for correction; the results of which are presented in this contribution.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepopt059_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepopt059.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepopt059_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOPT059,

In collision optics; the non-zero closed orbit in the same region leads to a ""feed-down"" of high-order errors to lower orders; causing additional effects detrimental to beam lifetime. An extension to the well-established method for correcting these errors by locally suppressing resonance driving terms has been undertaken; not only taking this feed-down into account; but also adding the possibility of utilizing it such that the powering of higher-order correctors will compensate for lower order errors. Existing correction schemes have also operated on the assumption of (anti-)symmetric beta-functions of the optics in the two rings. This assumption can fail for a multitude of reasons; such as inherently asymmetric optics and unevenly distributed errors. In this respect; an extension of this correction scheme has been developed; removing the need for symmetry by operating on the two separate optics of the beams simultaneously.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepopt061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepopt061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepopt061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOPT061,

Confinement of sufficient electron densities (ne~1E15m3) were reached without any external source of electrons. Focusing of ion beams by low energy was demonstrated; long term stability and reproducibility were approved. Main differences compared to experiments and investigations of the pure non-neutral in Penning-Malmberg traps are higher residual gas pressure and therefore higher collision rates; higher bulk temperatures; self-sustaining electron production process; much higher evaporation cooling rate. GL2000 is a new 2m long device and was mainly designed for focusing of ion beams in energy ranges up to GeV but also for investigation of non-neutral plasma parameters. The confined electron column is much longer compared to previous constructed Lenses.

The goal of this project is the (partial) compensation of SC forces within the ion beam by an overlapping electron beam. This may help to increase the intensity of primary beams; especially in the FAIR facility and potentially all large synchrotrons operated at the SC limit. For an effective SC compensation; the generated electron beam needs to follow the transverse and longitudinal beam profile of the ion bunch structure. The requirements are maximum currents of 10 A and grid modulation to cover a broad frequency range from 400 kHz to 1 MHz. The RF-modulated electron gun was designed and manufactured in the scope of the ARIES collaboration and is currently being tested at the E-Lens Lab of Goethe University Frankfurt. A dedicated test bench was built for commissioning of the major e-lens components and diagnostics. In this contribution the overall set-up will be presented putting special emphasis on the beam dynamics and collector design as well as as well as simulation results of the electron gun.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk003_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk003.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK003,

At present; the beam intensity supplied to the neutrino experiment reached 520 kW with a cycle time of 2.48 s. Toward the design beam power of 750 kW and future goal of 1.3 MW; we chose shortening the MR operation cycle. Accelerating time is shortened in order to shorten the cycle; so a high accelerating voltage is required. Therefore; it is necessary to upgrade the RF systems. This RF upgrade expands the current nine RF systems to a total of thirteen. We are planning to fabricate four RF power sources and add four additional cavities that are recombined with existing cavities.

The beams produced for the LHC and various fixed target experiments cover a very large parameter space. Over the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2); the PSB was heavily upgraded as part of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project. The low-level RF systems now drive the new Finemet-loaded cavities; control RF synchronisation for the new injection mechanism; and cope with the increased injection and extraction energies. The Finemet cavities provide exceptional flexibility; allowing an arbitrary distribution of voltage at different revolution frequency harmonics; but at the cost of significant broadband impedance. The new injection mechanism allows bunch-to-bucket multi-turn injection; which significantly reduces the amount of beam loss at the start of the cycle. The longitudinal beam production schema for each beam-type was developed based on simulations during LS2; and then adapted during the setting-up phase to suit the final operational configuration.

The Finemet cavities bring many operational advantages; but also represent a significant broadband impedance source. The impedance is mitigated by servo loops; which suppress the induced voltage; reducing the impedance as seen by the beam. Accurately including the impedance of the cavity and the effect of the servoloops in longitudinal tracking simulations is essential to predict the performance with beam. This paper discusses the results of a measurement campaign; which is intended to give a direct measurement of the cavity impedance.

A main residual problem seems to be the great amount of co-extracted electrons in the top part of the source. The introduction of a magnetic filter to remove the electrons from the extraction zone of the source causes ExB particle drifts (or shifts) which move both ions and electrons towards the top (or bottom depending on the B direction); in the top part the electron concentration and extracted current increase and that limits the extracted ion amount. In this contribution; as a possible solution; the application of a Planar Ion Funnel (PIF) extraction electric field configuration** on the source exit is proposed. The electric field line shape of PIF configuration; not only should break the perpendicularity between the magnetic filter B and the extraction electric field E in such a way to prevents the ExB particle drifts; but also should give a more efficient field shape for the H-/D- extraction. Preliminary simulations of D- and e- trajectories are presented to confirm the efficiency of the PIF system.; * B. Heinemann et al.; Fusion Engineering and design (2021).  ** A.

The ionization is achieved during the pulsed laser irradiation period. Then the plasma expands vertically from the target surface as it moves forward. Usually; this drift distance is chosen from tens of centimeters to several meters. Once the required pulse width and plasma density are met; an extraction electric field is applied. In most cases; this electric field is set in the same direction as the direction of the plasma. In this study; we experimentally verify how performance is achieved when the direction of the extraction field is at an angle to the direction of motion of the plasma. If the extraction field can be slanted without degradation of the ion source performance; it is considered to be able to shield neutral vapors and debris generated simultaneously with the plasma; which will be advantageous for the long-term operation of the laser ion source.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK020,

Results from previous investigations suggest that the transit time spread can be increased by reducing the beam emittance in the plane of extraction. Increased transit time spread is known to cut-off high frequency noise introduced by magnet power supplies. A pilot experiment was performed at SIS18 at GSI to introduce transverse emittance exchange; resulting in the circulating beam’s smaller horizontal beam size.

From July 2021; upgrade works of the FX septum magnets commenced with an aim of increasing the beam power of MR to 1.3 MW from 500 kW. We simulated the beam extraction without one of the septum magnets under the conditions of the new geometry of septum magnets and the new aperture. We found that the beam can be extracted by increasing the current of the surrounding septum magnets and compensating for the output.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK023,

The six sep-tum magnets for fast extraction (FX) need to be replaced to reduce the heat that is generated as a result of shorten-ing the repetition cycle. The replacement of the septum magnets began in July 2021 and was completed at the end of May 2022. The beam commissioning starts in June 2022. We report the details of the replacement work and operation test of the new septum magnets. We found a defect in the magnetic coil of the septum (SM32) in August 2021. We decided to postpone its installation to around August 2022 and produce new magnet coils for the SM32. The beam extraction in June 2022 will be per-formed using a temporary vacuum duct instead of the SM32 magnet; and the extraction beam orbit will be maintained by increasing the magnetic field of the other five septum magnets.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK024,

At the highest energies the beam lifetime would be less than one hour; meaning that top-up injection will be crucial to maximise the integrated luminosity. Two top-up injection strategies are considered here: conventional injection; employing a closed orbit bump and septum; and multipole-kicker injection; with a pulsed multipole magnet and septum. On-axis and off-axis injections are considered for both. We present a comparison of these injection strategies taking into account aspects such as spatial constraints; machine protection; disturbance to the stored beam and injection efficiency.

However; the extracted intensity is undesirably modulated by noise on the machine’s power converters with a frequency range of between 50 Hz and a few kHz. The impact of power converter noise can be suppressed by exploiting a Radio Frequency (RF) technique known as empty bucket channelling; which increases the speed at which particles cross the tune resonance boundary. In this contribution the implementation of empty bucket channelling in the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) is described via simulation and measurement. The technique was tested with both a resonant RF cavity and an inductive Finemet cavity; which can produce non-sinusoidal waveforms; to significantly reduce the low frequency noise observed on the extracted spill.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk028_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK028,

The stability of the produced microbunch trains over tens or hundreds of meters is crucial for extrapolating this scheme as proposed for use in several high energy plasma-based linear colliders. However; aside from the competing hosing instability; which has been shown to be suppressible by SSM when that process saturates; few works have examined other effects of transverse asymmetry in this process. Here; we use analytical modelling and 3D particle-in-cell simulations with QuickPIC to characterise the impact on the SSM growth process due to transverse asymmetry in the beam. A metric is constructed for asymmetry in simulation results; showing that the initial azimuthal complexity changes only slightly during SSM growth. Further; we show quantitative agreement between simulations and analytical predictions for the scaling of the reduction SSM growth rate with unequal aspect ratio of the initial beam profile. These results serve to inform planning and tolerances for both AWAKE and other SSM-based novel acceleration methods in the future.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk030.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk030_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK030,

The expelled electrons produce X-rays and with the recoil particles after annihilation; thus; a sufficient amount of information can be obtained about this interaction. However; all previous experiments were done via formation of antiprotonic atoms in solid or gaseous targets. Therefore; annihilation occurs prior reaching the S or P orbital levels and precise measurements are missing. Recently; AEgIS collaboration proposed a conceptually new experimental scheme. The creation of cold antiprotonic atoms in a vacuum guarantees the absence of the Stark effect. And with the sub-ns timing and synchronization; the previous experimental obstacles would be resolved.

During this levelling; both beam optics and orbit change in various areas of the ring; in particular around the high-luminosity experiments; where several collimators are installed. This requires adapting the collimation system settings adequately; in particular for the tertiary collimators (TCTs) that protect the inner-triplet magnets. To this end; two strategies are considered: keeping collimators at fixed physical openings while shifting their centres following the beam orbit; or varying also the collimator openings. The latter strategy is planned when the larger optics range will be deployed. In this paper; we investigate several loss scenarios at the TCTs in different steps of the levelling; and present the proposed collimator settings during Run 3.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk034_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk034.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk034_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK034,

The threshold of longitudinal quadrupolar coupled-bunch instabilities is increased during acceleration; but they are again observed at the flat-top.

If a beam size blow-up occurs; the design luminosity cannot be achieved. Therefore; beam size blow-ups must be pre-vented. According to calculations; the bunch current threshold of the Transverse Mode Coupling instability (TMCI) is 2 mA or more; and the observed value is 50% or smaller. This vertical beam size blow-up cannot be explained by ordinary TMCI. This paper shows that by analyzing factors such as beam oscillation; the cause of the vertical beam size blow-up was determined.

Two insertion magnet devices have been installed in the SPS storage ring during June to August 2013. There are several vacuum components added to the storage ring; these affect the ring impedance. Quantitative understanding of instabilities requires detailed knowledge of the impedance of the ring. For this purpose; the development of an impedance database is a necessity; where the wake potentials of each vacuum component are kept and maintained in a standard format. The self-describing data sets (SDDS) file format will be utilized to record components wake potentials. The wake potentials of each vacuum component can be obtained from a particle tracking simulation; a CST particle studio program will be used in the simulation process. The wake potentials can also be included in a beam dynamic tracking program such as ELEGANT to observe beam behaviors with these instabilities and find a curing means.

In this work; the particle in cell code Chicago is used to simulate the injector region of the dual-axis radiographic hydrodynamic test facility (DARHT) first axis. These simulations are validated against experiment using measured anode-cathode voltage; beam current at three positions; optical transition radiation and previously calculated emittance. Since all of these measurements contain some variation; the respective simulation parameters are varied to understand their effect. The resulting simulated beam current distributions can then be compared to the measured 2RMS radius. This resulted in a reasonably well validated simulation model.

Coherent beam-beam dipole modes can couple with higher order head-tail modes and lead to the transverse mode coupling instability of colliding beams. This mechanism has been analysed in detail in the past through the eigenvalues; which describe the evolution of the beam oscillation mode-frequency shifts. In this contribution; the transverse mode coupling instability of colliding beams is studied using the eigenvectors; which describe the evolution of the intrabunch motion. As this instability exhibits several mode couplings and mode decouplings; the evolution of the intrabunch motion reveals quite some interesting features (such as a propagation of the traveling-wave not only from the head to the tail but also from the tail to the head and similar intrabunch signals for some mode coupling and mode decoupling); which are compared to past predictions in the presence of impedance only.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk062_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk062.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk062_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK062,

In the baseline approach*; a beam is generated using the density downramp injection scheme with a percent-per-micron chirp and 1e-4 scale slice energy spread. Subsequent compression yields a current spike of just 100 as duration which can emit 10 nm light nearly coherently due to its strong pre-bunching. In this work; we report simulation studies of a scheme to generate similarly short beams without relying on plasma injection. Instead; we utilize a high-charge beam generated at an RF photocathode; with its tail acting as the witness bunch for the wake. The witness develops a percent-per-micron chirp in the plasma which is then compressible downstream. The final bunch length demonstrated here is as short as 100 nm; and is limited primarily by emittance effects.

The existing theory describing the energy spread growth rate due to IBS was derived in the context of circular machines where the beam particles are frequently and randomly colliding; and therefore should only be applied to non-laminar; emittance dominated flow. This is not the case in the injector portion of a linear accelerator; where the beam is space-charge dominated and the flow is laminar. The different nature of the microscopic motion in the two cases demands a reevaluation of the applicability of IBS theory to the photoinjector. In this work; we present a simple analytic model for energy spread growth during perfectly laminar flow and show that it matches well to point-to-point multiparticle simulations. In this way we demonstrate that stochastic energy spread growth in laminar beams is more attributable to the initial random placement of the particles in the bunch rather than the traditional temperature rearrangement mechanism of IBS.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepotk065_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepotk065.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepotk065_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOTK065,

The former is driven by the narrowband impedance of resonant structures; while the latter is mainly determined by the broadband impedance of the entire accelerator and is a single-bunch effect. Therefore; the CBI and LLD thresholds are usually evaluated separately in order to define the corresponding critical impedance budget for given beam parameters. In this paper; we show that the CBI threshold in the presence of broadband impedance can be significantly lower than the one defined by only the narrowband impedance; especially if the LLD threshold is below the CBI threshold. In some cases; the beam becomes unstable even below the LLD threshold. This explains the low CBI threshold observed for the LHC-type beams in the CERN SPS. For HL-LHC; the broadband impedance may also significantly reduce the CBI threshold driven by higher-order modes of the crab cavities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepoms008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepoms008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepoms008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOMS008,

To meet the needs of these applications; accelerator physicists rely heavily on detailed simulations of the complicated particle beam dynamics through the accelerator. One of the most computationally expensive and difficult-to-model effects is the impact of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR). CSR is one of the major drivers of growth in the beam emittance; which is a key metric of beam quality that is critical in many applications. The CSR wakefield is very computationally intensive to compute with traditional electromagnetic solvers; and this is a major limitation in accurately simulating accelerators. Here; we demonstrate a new approach for the CSR wakefield computation using a neural network solver structured in a way that is readily generalizable to new setups. We validate its performance by adding it to a standard beam tracking test problem and show a ten-fold speedup along with high accuracy.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepoms013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepoms013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepoms013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOMS013,

Over the two main interaction regions of the LHC; a particle experiences two head-on and over a hundred long-range beam-beam interactions which drive betatron resonances in the system. Each resonance line in the space of horizontal and vertical tunes has a finite (non-zero) lock-on width. If the particles tunes fall within this width; they will eventually lock on to the resonance and be driven to large amplitude. We show that it is possible to reduce the resonances widths of a given order by using specific values of the phase advance between interaction points. This paper presents the derivation of resonance width for the weak-strong beam-beam effect; as an extension of A.Chaos width formulae for magnetic sextupoles. (A Lie-algebraic approach is used to combine the effect of the individual beam-beam impulses.) The paper then studies the lock-on width arising from two interaction regions containing 140 beam-beam impulses; and shows the cancellation of specific resonances by relative phasing of interaction points in the HL-LHC lattice.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepoms019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepoms019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepoms019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOMS019,

The first target of injector operation to demonstrate IR-FEL was to generate high bunch charge electron beams with low longitudinal emittance and short bunch length. In 2020; the injector was operated with the bunch charge of 60 pC; the DC gun voltage of 480 kV; the injector energy of 5 MeV and the bunch length of 2 ps rms; and the required beam quality for the IR-FEL has been achieved for a single-pass operation mode. The next target is to demonstrate IR-FEL generation for recirculation mode. The injector energy is decreased to 3.5 MeV due to a limitation of the energy ratio between injection and recirculation beams. Moreover; the DC gun voltage decreases to 390 kV due to the troubles of the DC gun. Therefore; control of the space charge effect is more important to design and optimize the beam transport condition of the injector.

To relieve the problem a new code (UFO) tailored toward performance was developed to assist the design of the ALBA-II optics. Two main strategies contribute to the performance of UFO: the execution flow follows a data parallel paradigm; well suited for GPU execution; the use of a just-in-time compiler allows to simplify the computation whenever the lattice allows for it. At the core of UFO lies a parallel tracking routine structured for parallel simulation of optics which differs in some parameters; such as magnet strength or alignment; but retains the same element order; reflecting the scenario found in optimization processes; or when dealing with magnetic or alignment errors. Such an approach allows to take advantage of GPUs which yield the best performance when running thousands of parallel threads. Moreover UFO is not limited to tracking. A few modules that rely on the same tracking routine allow for the fast computation of dynamic and momentum aperture; closed orbit and linear optics.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepoms043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepoms043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepoms043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOMS043,

Current strategies use a four sextupole family per arc correction scheme to increase the energy aperture and to keep the transverse aperture sufficiently large as well. A scheme called Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing (ATS); first introduced for the Large Hadron Collider; introduces a beta-beat into select arcs; allowing dynamic aperture optimizations with different sextupole strengths. The ATS scheme’s mix of some higher beta-function and some lower sextupole strengths in the arcs has the potential to increase the energy aperture. Basic chromatic corrections and numeric optimizations were used to compare the ATS optics to a non-ATS scheme. In all cases; the ATS scheme performed similarly or better than the more common schemes. However; this increase in energy aperture from the ATS optics also has negative effects; such as an increase in emittance which poses complications for the current ESR design.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/wepoms052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/wepoms052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/wepoms052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOMS052,

The extension implements the effects on s-o motion of stochastic photon emission using a Monte-Carlo tracking algorithm. Spins are tracked in 3-D along particle trajectories with the aid of Taylor expansions of quaternions provided by PTC*. The efficiency of long-term tracking is guarantied by the use of a sectioning technique that was exploited in previous-generation software**. Sectioning is the construction of the deterministic s-o maps for sections between the dipoles during the initialization phase. Maps can be reused during the tracking. In a simulation for a realistic storage ring; the computational cost of initial map construction is amortized by the multi-turn tracking computational cost.

At the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) high-brightness electron sources are optimized for the use at FLASH and European XFEL. A low transverse emittance of the electron beam’s central part; which is assumed to be the lasing slices; is of particular interest for the efficient FEL operation. Over the past years a slice emittance measurement scheme has been developed at PITZ which employs an rf deflector and additional quadrupole magnets along the beamline to the standard measurement procedure for the projected emittance (single-slit scan). It allows measuring the slice emittance in a high-brightness photo injector. Transversely flat-top shaped laser pulses of different temporal distributions (Gaussian and flat-top) have been used to emit electrons; as well as transversely-truncated Gaussian laser pulses with temporal Gaussian shape.

The pending technical issues are disagreement in two current monitor systems and the long switching time of the Main-charger to Sub-charger at low charging voltage. We measured a gap field during measurement of current; and found no drift in time variation of gap field. Our conclusion was that the cause of the disagreement is electric and radiative noise which make the drift in the time variation. The long-term stability of the output pulsed current depends on the switching time and charging voltage. We investigated the correlation between the keeping time of flat-top charging voltage and long-time stability with various charging voltages. In June 2021; we have first conducted the 1 Hz operation and high-voltage test of the Eddy-Septum which is mounted in a vacuum chamber; and we found no problem.

It improved the injection stabilities while the SuperKEKB broke the world record of the collision luminosity of the previous project KEKB. As the collision performance improves; the beam-beam effect makes the dynamic aperture shrink; and the beam lifetime reduces further. Thus; it became inevitable for the injector to be upgraded in order to resolve the contradictory improvements of higher charge and lower emittance of injection beams regarding beam wakefield till 2025.

We are extremely proud of the achievement following continuous efforts by our seniors. The construction of the injector linac started in 1978; and it was commissioned for PF with 2.5 GeV electron in 1982. In parallel; the positron generator linac was constructed for the TRISTAN collider project. The slow positron facility was also commissioned in 1992. After the KEKB asymmetric-energy collider project was commissioned in 1998 with direct energy injections; the techniques such as two-bunch acceleration and simultaneous injection were developed. As the soft structure design of the linac was too weak against the great east Japan earthquake; it took three years to recover.

The cavity is comprised of 7 cells for a total length of a 9.45 cm; and is installed in the drift section between the gun and the linac. It can be used to remove higher order correlations and minimize the beam energy spread of 13 ps long beams to 10-4.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpost040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpost040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpost040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOST040,

Breakdown rates have been shown empirically to be significantly reduced at low temperatures allowing for higher gradient. The surface physics associated with this observation is complicated and there many remain questions as to the exact phenomena responsible. One major figure of merit that can better inform the theory of breakdown is the RF surface resistivity which can be used to compute for example the RF pulse heating during operation. We then use techniques developed for previous Xband and Sband low power surface resistivity measurement by way of temperature dependent quality factor measurements to study Cband cavities. We first present a review of low temperature effects that may be responsible for the change in surface resistivity at low temperature. We then explain some of the initial measurements of these low power RF quality factor tests and compare them to a review some of the physical phenomena that could determine the low temperature surface effects. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpost045_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpost045.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpost045_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOST045,

Acceleration is achieved by passing the electron beam through a dielectric-loaded waveguide powered by multi-cycle THz radiation. The final electron energy strongly depends on THz-power injected into the LINAC and timing. Thus in first experiments we expect large energy fluctuations and a large range of energies to cover. We designed an electron energy spectrometer for a wide range of final energies covering 5 to 20 MeV in a single-shot. Here; we present the design of an energy spectrometer which uses a compact dipole magnet based on the Halbach array concept to deflect the electron beam through a 180° path intercepted by a Fiber Optic Scintillator (FOS) mounted inside the vacuum perpendicular to the beam. The 180-degree bending geometry provides the possibility of having the focus point of all energies at the same distance from the magnet edge which makes the design simpler and more compact. It also removes the necessity of installing a safety dipole at the end of the accelerator.

Multi-alkali antimonides are the choice photocathode material due to high quantum efficiency (QE) and low intrinsic emittance in the visible range. In this work a more robust alternative to the tried and tested Cs-K-Sb is considered. Na-K-Sb offers similar advantages to Cs-K-Sb including; high QE at green wavelengths but moreover; it offers excellent stability at elevated temperatures. This property could lengthen the cathode lifetime by enhancing the robustness of the photocathode inside the SRF gun. In this work; a status report showcasing first results towards the development of a growth procedure for Na-K-Sb is presented by means of spectral response and XPS measurements conducted in the HZB photocathode lab.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpopt019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpopt019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpopt019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOPT019,

In particular; the CsK2Sb photocathode is of interest because it has features such as low emittance; excitability with visible light; and high quantum efficiency. Generally; the CsK2Sb photocathode is produced by depositing a cathode element on a substrate; so that the cathode performance strongly depends on the surface condition of the substrate. We have found graphene as reusable substrate; which has the property of being chemically inactive. In this study; graphene film quality dependence of CsK2Sb photo-cathode performance was evaluated. Specifically; CsK2Sb cathode was deposited using different quality graphene film substrates and their QE values and uniformity were compared. The quality of graphene films was analyzed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). We found that the graphene film can be cleaned by heating at 500 deg.

Due to the reduced lifetime; top-up injection is required for all operation modes. Perturbations on the stored beam introduced by the pulsed injection elements represent a significant disturbance to the beam lines that need to run experiments across injection. In order to reduce these perturbation; new kicker power supplies with slower ramping times and better shot-to-shot reproducibility were developed at ESRF to improve the efficiency of the feed-forward compensation scheme. This paper reports on the design; commissioning and first experimental validation of these new power supplies.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpopt041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpopt041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpopt041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOPT041,

We study the feasibility of replacing the current 26 MeV LINAC injector with a laser wakefield accelerator (LWA). For this; contemporary parameters from current LWA setups at other laboratories are assumed and matched to the acceptance of the booster synchrotron. Moreover; a conceptional draft of a potential LWA setup is created. This takes into consideration the influence of building conditions such as available floor space and building vibrations to estimate a setup and laser beam stability of a plasma generating high power laser system and beamline to the plasma cell. The methods and intermediate results of this study will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpopt042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpopt042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpopt042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOPT042,

Such a lattice design leads to the difficulty of injecting the incoming beam into an acceptance that is as small as 2.6 um. In contrast to earlier lattice iterations based on a seven-bend achromat lattice; the latest version allows accumulation; i.e.; the off-axis injection of the incoming beam. In this contribution; the effects of deploying different septum types; namely a pulsed or a Lambertson septum; on the injection process as well as the injection efficiency are presented. This analysis includes the effects of common manipulations to the injected beam; e.g.; beam rotation and aperture sharing; on the injection efficiency. Furthermore; the option of a nonlinear kicker and its optimization (wire positions; wire current; optics functions) are presented since a nonlinear kicker could provide an alternative to the rather large number of strip-line kickers that are necessary to generate the orbit bump at the septum.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpopt043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpopt043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpopt043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOPT043,

To achieve this a photocathode with a high quantum efficiency and low intrinsic emittance is required; which is also robust with a long operational lifetime and low dark current. Alkali-metal photocathodes have the potential to fulfil these requirements; so are an important research area for the accelerator physics community. STFC Daresbury Laboratory are currently commissioning the Alkali-metal Photocathode Preparation Facility (APPF) which will be used to grow alkali photocathodes. Photocathodes produced by the APPF will be analysed using Daresbury Laboratory’s existing Multiprobe system* and the Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS)**. Multiprobe can perform a variety of surface analysis techniques while the TESS can measure the Mean Transverse Energy of a photocathode from its Transverse Energy Distribution Curve over a large range of illumination wavelengths.

The photoemission electron source (STEAM) will deliver 150 uA of spin-polarized electrons from GaAs-based photocathodes for the P2 experiment. Afterwards the low-energy beam transportation system (MELBA) can rotate the spin using two Wien filters and a solenoid for polarization measurements and to compensate for the spin precession in MESA. A chopper and buncher system prepares the phase space for the first acceleration in the normal-conducting pre-booster MAMBO. First OPAL simulation results of MELBA were presented at IPAC’21. Meanwhile these simulations have been extended by a 270-degree-bending alpha magnet as well as the electrostatic and magnetostatic fieldmaps of the Wien filters.

We present a novel topology for the coils of the injection kicker; named double dipole kicker (DDK). The resulting magnetic field is the superposition of two opposite dipoles; generated by four inner and four outer conductor rods. When the eight rods are powered; the dipole term cancels and the remaining multipole field is used for off-axis injection. Alternatively; when the four inner rods are switched off; an almost pure dipole is produced; that is useful for on-axis injection during the commissioning. A prototype of DDK is presently under design to be installed and tested in the existing ALBA storage ring. The positioning of the rods is calculated in order to maximise the kick efficiency in mrad/kA and minimise the disturbance to the orbit and the emittance of the stored beam. A metallic coating with optimised thickness along the inner ceramic vacuum chamber should provide compensation for the eddy currents induced field in order to minimize the disturbance to the stored beam while ensuring sufficiently low heat dissipation by the beam image currents.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpopt047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpopt047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpopt047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOPT047,

This was the selected approach at ALBA since the start of its operation for users in 2012. However; over the years the insulation provided by the ceramic pieces separating the blades from the support structure has degraded progressively; giving rise to an ever-increasing leakage current not related with the photon beam to be monitored. On 2020 the level of these leak currents had already become comparable to the photocurrents generated by the photon beam itself; making the readings from many of the XBPMs unreliable. Following the example from other facilities; we decided to remove the bias voltage from the blades and to test the performance of the XBPMs under these conditions; with such good results that we apply this method also for the new; non degraded; XBPMs. In this paper we present the approach used at ALBA to analyse XBPM data; and our experience operating them with zero bias voltage.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpopt065_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpopt065.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpopt065_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOPT065,

Bending and focusing magnets in the MBA cells should consist of permanent magnets (PM); to allow for a competitive and compact lattice; to increase the magnetic stability and to decrease the electric power consumption of the machine. However; using pure permanent magnet systems would result in a completely fixed lattice.

The leakage field was reduced; however the magnetic field of a quadrupole magnet at beam upstream of the InjSep was also reduced slightly. The decrease of the magnetic field of the one of main magnet was not permitted from the requirement of beam optics. In consequently; the first version was failed.

To provide double the number of linac passes using the existing five stacked arc beamlines; some beamlines are replaced by fixed-field accelerator (FFA) arcs; allowing multiple energies to pass through the same magnets. A solution is presented in which two of the existing electromagnetic beamlines are replaced with permanent magnet non-scaling FFA arcs; as demonstrated at CBETA. The two-stage design reduces peak magnetic field and synchrotron radiation loss compared to using a single stage. FFAs do not pulse their magnets; making permanent magnets a promising and power-efficient technology option. However; the magnetic field requirements are still at the high end of accelerator permanent magnets produced thus far (1.6T peak on beam); while the magnets must also be combined-function; having a gradient with a dipole offset.

Notably; a cavity’s RF quality factor Q; the ratio of the outgoing RF signal power to the input power; is theoretically multiplied by over 4 when subjected to cryogenic temperatures. Precise measurements of this Q factor require defining a cryostat unit; which consists of a high vacuum chamber; a coldhead; and MLI shielding. We optimized the cryostat by running several cool down tests at high vacuum; incorporating different geometries of MLI shielding to achieve the lowest possible temperatures. We then performed a low power C-band test after installing a cylindrical copper RF cavity to measure the Q factor. Finally; we improved stability and amplification within the chamber by installing edge welded bellows to the coldhead to reduce vibrations.

The vacuum system of the accelerator is fully coated with non-evaporable getter (NEG) thin film to ensure low gas density. The storage ring started commissioning in August 2015 and currently delivers photon beams from insertion devices (IDs) to 9 beamlines that are in user operation or commissioning. After over 6 years of operation; the NEG coated vacuum system continues to be reliable; is conditioning well and do not pose any limitation to the accelerator operation. The average dynamic pressure is lower than the design value (below 3·10-10 mbar) and is reducing with the accumulated beam dose. The vacuum beam lifetime is greater than 39 Ah; and the total beam lifetime is above the design value of 5 Ah - thus is not limited by the residual gas density. Several successful interventions to install new vacuum components were performed on few achromats in the storage ring during shutdowns. Some of them were done utilizing purified neon gas to vent the vacuum system; thus avoiding the need of re-activation of the NEG coating and saving intervention time without compromising the storage ring performance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpotk034_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpotk034.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpotk034_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOTK034,

Along with the challenges related to magnet design; the beam optic configuration exposes this new equipment to stringent conditions for vacuum and cryogenic performance. Both cold-warm transitions and magnet interconnections appear to be delicate components that are crucial for the thermal heat transfer between diverse subsystems. The proposed study aims at assessing the heat loads to the cryogenic system and the temperature fields in the vacuum system. A nonlinear static thermal analysis is first performed. A thermo-mechanical approach is developed to capture additional thermal resistance arising from contact between components and their behaviour during cool-down. The system is then studied under dynamic operations when beams are circulating and colliding. A thorough analysis of beam-induced heat loads under ultimate conditions highlights the different relevant contributions.

These magnets are very lossy from a beam impedance perspective: this is expected to be an issue during SPS operation with the higher intensity beams needed for HL-LHC. A design; with serigraphy applied to an alumina carrier; has been developed to significantly reduce the broadband beam coupling impedance and hence mitigate the heating issues. During high voltage pulse testing there were electrical discharges associated with the serigraphy. Detailed mathematical models have been developed to aid in understanding the transiently induced voltages and to reduce the magnitude and duration of electric field. In this paper; we discuss the solutions implemented to mitigate the electrical discharges while maintaining an adequately low beam-coupling impedance. In addition; the results of high voltage tests are reported.

This groundbreaking triggering requires applying significant overvoltage on the anode-cathode of thyristor with a slew rate > 1kV/ns. Compact pulse generators based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components would allow the spread of this technology into numerous applications; including fast kicker generators for particle accelerators. In our approach; the beginning of the triggering chain is a HV SiC MOS with an ultra-fast super-boosting gate driver. The super boosting of a 1.7kV rated SiC MOS allows to reduce the MOS rise time by a factor of > 25 (datasheet tr = §I{20}{ns} vs. measured tr < 800ps; resulting in an output voltage slew rate > 1kV/ns and an amplitude > 1kV. Additional boosting is obtained by a Marx generator with GaAs diodes; reaching an output voltage slew rate > 11kV/ns. The final stage will be a Marx generator with medium size thyristors triggered in impact ionization mode with sufficient voltage and current rating necessary for the triggering of a big thyristor.

The module has been designed for a maximum charging voltage of 1.2 kV and an output current of 200 A considering the current doubling due to the short circuit termination. It features three consecutive modes of operation: energy injection; freewheeling; and energy extraction. Therefore; the topology of the branch module consists of two independently controlled SiC MOSFET switches and one diode switch. In order not to extend the field rise time of the kicker magnet significantly beyond the magnet fill time; the pulse must have a fast rise time. Hence; the switch for energy injection is driven by a gate boosting driver featuring a half bridge of GaN HEMTs and a driving voltage of 80 V. Measurements of the drain source voltage of this switch showed a fall time of 2.7 ns at a voltage of 600 V resulting in a voltage rise time of 5.4 ns at the output terminated with a resistive load.

The proton beam is produced by the Ion Source (ISRC) and transported through the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) to the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) that will then focus; bunch and accelerate it to 3.6 MeV. The RFQ beam commissioning started in October 2021; following the RF conditioning phase in summer 2021. This current work presents an experimental modal analysis performed on RFQ including the comparative analysis with the modal finite element simulation using the ANSYS software suite. Measurements were performed using accelerometer sensors connected to a data acquisition system excited with an impact hammer. Geophones were used in parallel to the modal measurements in order to monitor the seismic background of the accelerator tunnel. Acquired data were post-processed and analysed with dedicated software; juxtaposed with simulated results in order to determine the resonance frequencies; structural deformation patterns (mode shapes) and error margin between experimental and simulated results.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpotk057_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpotk057.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpotk057_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOTK057,

Over the past 4 years; the experimental area - CERN’s second largest - has undergone a complete makeover. New instrumentation and beamline configuration have improved the precision of data collection; and new magnets and power convertors have drastically reduced the area’s energy consumption. This article will summarize the major challenges encountered for the design of the renovated beamlines and for the preparation and test of the components. The infrastructure was carefully fitted resulting in a very smooth beam commissioning; the details of which will also be presented along with the restart of physics in the second half of 2021.

In FELs; it strongly influences factors including efficiency and the profile of the photon pulse generated for user experiments; while in novel acceleration techniques it contributes to enhanced interaction of the witness beam with the driving electric field. Work is in progress at the CLARA facility at Daresbury Laboratory on temporal shaping of the ultraviolet photoinjector laser; using a fused-silica acousto-optic modulator. Generating a user-defined (programmable) time-domain target profile requires finding the corresponding spectral phase configuration of the shaper; this is a non-trivial problem for complex pulse shapes. Physically informed machine learning models have shown great promise in learning complex relationships in physical systems; and so we apply machine learning techniques here to learn the relationships between the spectral phase and the target temporal intensity profiles. Our machine learning model extends the range of available photoinjector laser pulse shapes by allowing users to achieve physically realisable configurations for arbitrary temporal pulse shapes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpotk061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpotk061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpotk061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOTK061,

The beam delivery system (BDS) determines the overall timing and beam shaping capabilities; but is restricted by the energy variation speed: energy layer switching time (ELST). Existing treatment beamlines have a ±1% momentum acceptance range; needing time to change the magnetic fields as the beam is delivered in layers at various depths across the tumour volume. Minimising the ELST can enable the delivery of faster; more effective and advanced treatments but requires an improved BDS. A possibility for this could be achieved with a design using Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFA) optics; enabling a large energy acceptance to rapidly transport beams of varying energies. A scaled-down; novel system - Technology for Ultra Rapid Beam Operation (TURBO) - is being developed at the University of Melbourne; to explore the potential of rapid depth scanning.

Contrary to proton minibeams; helium or carbon minibeams experience less deflection; which potentially reduces side effects. To verify this potential; an irradiation facility for preclinical and clinical studies is needed. This manuscript presents a concept for a carbon minibeam irradiation facility based on a LINAC design for conventional carbon therapy. A quadrupole triplet focuses the LINAC beam to submillimeter minibeams. A scanning and a dosimetry unit are provided to move the minibeam over the target and monitor the applied dose. The beamline was optimized by TRAVEL simulations. The interaction between beam and these components and the resulting beam parameters at the focal plane is evaluated by TOPAS simulations. A transverse beamwidth of < 100 µm (σ) and a peak-to-valley (energy) dose ratio of > 1000 results for carbon energies of 100 MeV/u and 430 MeV/u (about 3 cm and 30 cm range in water) whereby the average beam current is about 30 nA.

Recent studies indicate that this so-called FLASH effect occurs when applying high doses of several Grays in a fraction of a second only; and thus significantly faster than with conventionally available radiation therapy systems today. Varian’s ProBeam system has been enabled to deliver ultra-high beam currents for FLASH treatments at 250 MeV beam energy. The first clinical trial is currently conducted at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and all involved human patients have been successfully irradiated at FLASH dose rates; operating the system at cw cyclotron beam currents of up to 400 nA. With these modifications; treatment times could be reduced down to less than a second. First automated switching between conventional and FLASH operation modes has been demonstrated in non-clinical environment; including switching of the dose monitor system characteristics and all involved beam diagnostics.

Designing the complex GaToroid coils requires careful consideration of the local beam optical effects. We present a Python-based tool for charged particle transport in complex electromagnetic fields. The code implements fast tracking in arbitrary three-dimensional field maps; and it is not limited to specific or regular reference trajectories; as is generally the case in accelerator physics. The tool was used to characterise the beam behaviour inside the GaToroid system. It automatically determines the reference trajectories in the symmetry plane and analyses three-dimensional beam dynamics around these trajectories. Beam optical parameters in the field region were compared for various magnetic configurations of GaToroid. This paper introduces the new tracker and shows the benchmarking results. Furthermore; first- order beam optics studies for different arrangements demonstrate the main code features and serve for the design optimisation.,Funding: Project co-funded by the CERN Budget for Knowledge Transfer to Medical Applications.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpoms018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpoms018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpoms018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOMS018,

Developments in high gradient RF technology have allowed electrons to be accelerated to VHEE energies in a compact space; meaning that treatment could be possible with a shorter linac. A crucial component of VHEE treatment is the transfer of the beam from accelerator to patient. This is required to magnify the beam to cover the transverse extent of the tumour; whilst ensuring a uniform beam distribution. Two principle methodologies for the design of a compact transfer line are presented. The first of these is based upon a quadrupole lattice and optical magnification of beam size. A minimisation algorithm is used to enforce certain criteria on the beam distribution at the patient; defining the lattice through an automated routine. Separately; a dual scattering-foil based system is also presented; which uses similar algorithms for the optimisation of the foil geometry in order to achieve the desired beam shape at the patient location.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpoms020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpoms020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpoms020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOMS020,

Clinical trials are well advanced for several radioisotope-based treatments that might open the way to a strong request of specific accelerator systems dedicated to radioisotope production. While cyclotrons are the standard tool in this domain; we explore here alternative options using linear accelerators. Compared to cyclotrons; linacs have the advantage of modularity; compactness; and reduced beam loss with lower shielding requirements. Although in general more expensive than cyclotrons; linacs are competitive in cost for production of low-energy proton beams; or of intense beams of heavier particles. After a review of radioisotopes of potential interest; in particular those produced with low-energy protons or helium; this paper presents two linac-based isotope production systems. The first is a compact RFQ-based system for PET isotopes; and the second is an alpha-particle linac for production of alpha-emitters.

Such a system has drawback of introducing an energy-dependent beam current at the patient location; resulting in energy-dependent beam intensity ratios of about 103 between high and low energies. This complicates treatment delivery and challenges patient safety systems. As such; we propose the use of a dual-energy degrader method that can reduce beam intensity for high-energy beams. The first degrader is made of high Z material and the second is made of low Z material and are placed next to each other. For high energies (230-180MeV); we use only first degrader to increase beam emittance after degrader and thus lose intensity in emittance selection collimators. For intermediate energy beams (180-100MeV) we use the combination of both degraders; whereas for low energy beams (100-70MeV); only the second degrader limits the increase in emittance. With this approach; energy-independent beam intensities can be achieved; whilst localizing beam losses around the degrader.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpoms024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpoms024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpoms024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOMS024,

Before VHEE-FLASH RT can be considered for clinical use; a reliable dosimetric and beam monitoring system needs to be developed; able to measure the dose delivered to the patient in real-time and cut off the beam in the event of a machine fault to prevent overdosing the patient. Ionisation chambers are the standard monitors in conventional RT; however; their response saturates at the high dose rates required for FLASH. Therefore; a new dosimetry method is needed that can provide reliable measurements of the delivered dose in these conditions. Experiments using 200 MeV electrons were done at the CLEAR facility at CERN to investigate the properties of detectors such as diamond beam loss detectors; GEM foil detectors; and Timepix3 ASIC chips.

Moreover; cold-cathode field emission technology allows the integration of 10s of X-ray sources into source arrays that are smaller and lighter than conventional X-ray tubes. The distributed source positions avoid the need for source movements and Adaptix Ltd has demonstrated stationary 3D imaging with this technology in dentistry; orthopaedics; veterinary medicine and non-destructive testing. In this work we present Monte Carlo simulations of an upgrade to the Adaptix technology to specifications suited for chest DT and we show computer aided designs for a system with various populations of these source arrays.

Spectroscopic measurement using accelerator-based terahertz transition radiation (THz TR) is one of potential techniques to investigate their intermolecular interactions by observing the vibra-tional bands in the terahertz region due to TR’s excep-tional properties: coherent; broadband; and high intensi-ty. This work aims to study intermolecular interactions of ILs using the THz TR produced from an electron beam at the PBP-CMU Electron Linac Laboratory. The THz TR with the frequency range of 0.3-2.5 THz can be produced from electron beam of energy 10-25 MeV. This radiation is produced and transported to the experimental area; where it is used as the coherent and polarization selective light source for the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The absorption spectrum in the THz region of the ILs is then measured.

The cyclotron accelerates up to 30 MeV proton with a maximum beam current of 200 µA. Proton beam is transported to three target halls; including the R&D vault. Particularly; the R&D beamline consists of a five-port switching magnet allowing further extension for multidisciplinary research and experiments. The first station of the research vault is dedicated to non-destructive and multi-elemental analysis using proton-induced x-ray (PIXE) and proton-induced gamma (PIGE) techniques. For this purpose; the beam is extracted through an exit foil to the air. The beam size is then shaped by a set of collimators before reaching a sample. However; the range of the protons in air and the attenuation of x-rays may deteriorate. Therefore; the external irradiation system; including exit foil; collimator and detector arrangement; is evaluated in Geant4 to optimise the proton beam quality and improve detection efficiency.

We have successfully demonstrated a three-dimensional (3D) isotope-selective CT image by using a conventional LCS gamma-ray beam[1]. However; the conventional LCS beam with a small beam size whose energy spread is narrow can’t excite a few isotopes at the same time. Therefore; we proposed the F-LCS gamma-ray beam by using the Apple-II undulator installed in BL1U in UVSOR to excite a circular motion of the electron beam. An EGS5 simulation shows that a weak magnetic field (K=0.2) can generate an F-LCS beam. The demonstration experiments have been carried out in UVSOR and the spectra of generated LCS beam with different K-values of the undulator were measured. As a result; the measured spectra agreed with the EGS5 simulation.

Special reference is made to the layouts considered for the proposed SEEIIST facility. Benchmarking with the NC CNAO HT centre in Pavia (Italy) was carried out. The energy comparison is centred on the different synchrotron solutions; assuming the same injector and lines in the designs. The beam current is more than a factor 10 higher with respect to present generation facilities. This allows efficient ’multi-energy extraction’ (MEE); which shortens the therapy treatment and is needed especially in the SC option; because of the slow magnet ramping time. Hence; power values of the facility in the traditional mode were converted into MEE ones; for the sake of a fair stepwise comparison between NC and SC magnets. The use of cryocoolers and a liquefier are also compared; for synchrotron refrigeration. This study shows that a NC facility operated in MEE mode requires the least average energy; followed by the SC synchrotron solution with a liquefier; while the most energy intensive solution is the SC one with cryocoolers.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/thpoms049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/thpoms049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/thpoms049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-THPOMS049,

One of the methods to elucidate this initial process is pulse radiolysis. In pulse radiolysis; a substance is irradiated with ionizing radiation and at the same time irradiated with analytical light; and the absorption spectrum of the light can be traced back in time to the active species. However; the radiation chemical reaction starts in a very short time; and the pulse radiolysis system needs to have the same time resolution. Therefore; the analytical light should be ultra-short pulses. In addition; the absorption wavelength of the substance is not always known. Hence; the wavelength range of the analytical light should be broad. Since the absorption wavelengths of important active species are in the visible light region; it is desirable to cover the visible light region as well. We believe that supercontinuum light generated from the second harmonic of the Er fiber laser is the best analytical light to meet these requirements.

We use optical transition radiation (OTR) and a streak camera to obtain time-resolved images of the bunch transverse charge density distribution in a given plane. In this paper we present a method to obtain 3D images of the bunch by scanning the OTR across the entrance slit of the streak camera. Reconstruction of the 3D distribution is possible because with seeding self-modulation is reproducible*.

However; such methods often suffer from inherently low sensitivity. Here we present the study of a new type of electron beam diagnostic device for direct optical imaging of electron beams at various energy levels. The concept relies on high sensitivity of atoms; prepared in a specific spin quantum superposition; to the perturbations induced by the passing charged particle. Specifically; the magnetic field of the electrons induces polarization change of the probe light as well as changes in light absorption and fluorescence; enabling direct 3D imaging of the charged particles with high resolution.

ipac2022,,FROXGD3,Injection Beam Measurement Using Synchrotron Radiation Monitor at the SuperKEKB Electron Ring,H. Ikeda; T.M. Mitsuhashi; G. Mitsuka; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; We upgraded the diamond mirror of the SuperKEKB electron ring to extract the good quality synchrotron light in 2020 summer. As a result; the accuracy of profile measurement for each bunch using a gate camera has improved dramatically; and it has become possible to measure the incident beam for each turn. The electron beam was injected with single turn injection mode to measure the properties of the beam and measured turn by turn after injection. In order to convert the measurement results into beam size; convolution by diffraction effect and absolute value calibration using real images were performed. We report the behavior of the injection beam during normal operation of SuperKEKB.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/froxgd3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/froxgd3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/froxgd3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-FROXGD3,
ipac2022,,FRIXSP1,Low-Emittance Compact RF Electron Gun with a Gridded Thermionic Cathode,"JASRI/SPring-8; Hyogo-ken; Japan; A new type of rf electron gun has been developed to generate a stable electron beam with a low-emittance of ~1 um.rad; that can be injected into SX-FEL and DLSR; without using a large UV laser system nor an ultra-high voltage pulsers. This electron gun consists of a 50 kV pulsed gun equipped with a commercially available thermionic cathode with grid and a 238-MHz acceleration cavity driven by a 42 kW solid-state amplifier. The system is simple; stable; robust; and of easy-maintenance. To obtain a ""grid-transparent"" condition; the cathode voltage and the control grid voltage are optimized not to distort the electric field near the grid. To avoid the emittance growth due to the space charge effect; the gun and a special magnetic lens are embedded in the 238-MHz cavity at the shortest distance; and the beam energy is immediately accelerated to 500 kV. The first model of this electron gun has been operated as the 1 GeV injector of the NewSUBARU storage ring. The same electron gun will also be used in the injector linac of the 3 GeV light source under construction in Japan. The talk is expected to include the concept; overall design and the achieved performance.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/talks/frixsp1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/papers/frixsp1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2022/posters/frixsp1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2022-FRIXSP1,

Among decade long effort to break state-of-the-art gradient limitation of ~100 MV/m in normal conducting structures; using RF pulses shorter than 20 ns is a promising approach based on theoretic analysis and experimental observation. In this study; we demonstrated high gradient above 300 MV/m using an X-band 11.7 GHz single-cell travelling-wave structure with 6 ns FWHM RF pulses generated by a power extractor. In comparison; a scaled 11.424 GHz structure only reached below 150 MV/m driven by 30-100 ns RF pulses from a klystron with pulse compression.

However; a large fraction of the wall-plug power required to operate these klystrons is used in the focusing magnetic elements around the klystron in the form of normal conducting solenoids. In 2019; a prototype solenoid made of MgB2 was manufactured as a joint venture from CERN; Hitachi and KEK with the aim of reducing the power consumption by a factor ten using higher temperature superconductors. The characteristics of the magnet were measured upon manufacture and checked after the transport across the world. In 2020; the MgB2 magnet was integrated around one of the klystrons in the X-band facility at CERN and put into operation in the beginning of 2021.

ipac2022,,FRPLYGD2,Access to Effective Cancer Care in Low- Middle Income Countries Requires Sophisticated Linear Accelerator Based Radiotherapy,CERN; Meyrin; Switzerland; There are substantial and growing gaps in cancer care for millions of people in Low- Middle- Income countries (LMICs) and for geographically remote settings in High-income countries (HICs); often indigenous populations. Assessing the cancer care shortfall led to understanding the essential gap; that of a radiation therapy machine that can reliably and effectively provide the appropriate first-rate cancer treatments within the challenging environments. More than 10; 000 electron linear accelerators (linacs) are currently used worldwide to treat patients. However only 10% of patients in low-income and 40% in middle-income countries who need radiotherapy have access to it. The idea to address the need for a novel medical linac for challenging environments has led to the creation of the STELLA project (Smart Technology to Extend Lives with Linear Accelerators) project. STELLA is multidisciplinary international collaborative effort to design and develop an affordable and robust yet technically sophisticated linear accelerator-based radiation therapy treatment (RTT) in LMICs.

After a long solitary voyage; Hayabusa2; the successor to Hayabusa; has brought us a capsule carrying scientifically precious samples. Hayabusa achieved the world’s first sample return of materials from an asteroid. Asteroid 162173 Ryugu was the new target of Hayabusa2. It is considered rich in water and organic matter from the birth of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. How was our solar system born; and where did the organic matter that constitutes life form? To get the clues; Hayabusa2 landed on Ryugu and successfully collected soil samples. SPring-8 and other SR facilities are now preparing to analyze Hayabusa2’s samples. The state-of-the-art analysis technologies with high sensitivity; resolution; and precision using the brilliant SR will reveal the materials on the asteroid Ryugu opening the door to unveil the origin of the solar system.
