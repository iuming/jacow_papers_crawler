        "Ion Beam Accelerators (IBA) centres have provided researchers with powerful techniques to analyse objects of cultural significance in a non-destructive and non-invasive manner. However",
        "in some cases it is not feasible to remove an object from the field or museum and transport it to the laboratory. In this contributed talk",
        "we present as a manner of a short review",
        "examples of the benefits provided from these techniques in the study of material culture and discuss the initial steps to consider when investigating the feasibility of a compact accelerator that can be taken to sites of cultural significance for PIXE analysis. In particular",
        "we consider the application of a compact",
        "robust 2 MeV proton accelerator that can be taken into the field to perform PIXE measurements on rock art. We detail the main challenges and considerations for such a device."

        "We report on the development of a 2.856 GHz accelerator system to provide energy modulation and RF-based steering for rapid 3-D beam scanning for proton therapy. Designs for the accelerator and deflector cavities have been modeled in ANSYS-HFSS and used to produce prototype structures. We present high power test results for a single cell energy modulator prototype and a three cell deflector prototype. Using General Particle Tracer",
        "we simulate proton beam transport through the fully rendered accelerator and deflector beamline. System performance is optimized for the case of sub-relativistic protons with 230 MeV kinetic energy and covers an energy modulation range of ±30 MeV. We present simulated beam profile data after energy modulation and lateral steering",
        "achieved using a combination of dynamic RF deflector cavities and static permanent magnet quadrupoles."
