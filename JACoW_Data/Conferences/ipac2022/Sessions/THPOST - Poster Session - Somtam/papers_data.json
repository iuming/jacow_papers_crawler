        "which leads to an expansion of the concrete walls and floor introducing movements between the tunnels segments. Especially during warm-up periods after shutdowns",
        "this results in a drift of the accelerator elements that is transferred on the circulating beam over a duration of days",
        "weeks or months according to the length of the cool-down period. This paper shows that not only inside temperature effects but also seasonal temperature changes are relevant."

A promising concept to provide the THz pulses with a pulse repetition rate identical to that of the X-ray pulses is to generate them using an accelerator-based THz source. The THz source requires a bunch compressor in order to manipulate the longitudinal phase space of the electron bunch to match with various options of THz radiation generation.

The electron beam enters linac and is accelerated by RF filed inside the linac.

Breakdown rates have been shown empirically to be significantly reduced at low temperatures allowing for higher gradient. The surface physics associated with this observation is complicated and there many remain questions as to the exact phenomena responsible. One major figure of merit that can better inform the theory of breakdown is the RF surface resistivity which can be used to compute for example the RF pulse heating during operation. We then use techniques developed for previous Xband and Sband low power surface resistivity measurement by way of temperature dependent quality factor measurements to study Cband cavities. We first present a review of low temperature effects that may be responsible for the change in surface resistivity at low temperature. We then explain some of the initial measurements of these low power RF quality factor tests and compare them to a review some of the physical phenomena that could determine the low temperature surface effects. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
