A big challenge is to combine the advantages of seeding schemes with high repetition rates. Recently",

This scheme overcomes the limitation of requiring high repetition rate seed laser systems. In this contribution",

The two phases will proceed in parallel to the linac upgrade aiming at extending the beam energy to 1.8 GeV. We report here details on the upgrade of the FEL-1 foreseen to provide light to users in the new configuration by spring 2023."

We used our existing anomaly detection infrastructure to get a subset of the stored data labeled as faulty. We experimented with different training losses to maximally profit from the available data and trained a recurrent neural network that can predict a failure from a series of pulses. The proposed model is using a tailored architecture with recurrent neural units and takes into account the sequential nature of the problem which can generalize and predict a variety of failures that we have been experiencing in operation."

      "abstract": "We developed a MicroTCA.4 (MTCA.4) module to generate and distribute trigger timing signals. This module has 16 LVDS inputs and 16 LVDS outputs each on the front panel and the Zone 3 connector, and 8 M-LVDS I/O’s for MTCA.4 backplane. The trigger timing of each output can be precisely adjusted with the interval of 238 MHz or 509 MHz clocks by a 24-bit counter. The timing can also be fine-tuned by ~80 ps tap delay. This module has additional 5 optical transceivers, one for receiving trigger signals from upstream and four for fanouts to downstream. A master module distributes trigger signals, trigger counts, and event data through optical links. Slave modules generate trigger output signals with appropriate delays based on the event data and the local setting for each output channel. The timing jitter was measured to be 40 ps std, which is significantly smaller than the clock period of 238 MHz or 509 MHz. This system can also distribute an alarm signal received by a slave module to take data at a faulty situation. Trigger systems with this module have been utilized in SPring-8, SACLA, and NewSUBARU and stably synchronize various accelerator components with sufficient timing accuracy. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
