        "namely FCC-ee and CEPC. Record luminosities are expected in the center of mass energy range from 90 to about 365 GeV. In this talk the statuses of both projects are reviewed: Following the publication of the first CDR FCC-ee and CEPC entering the phase of consolidation and feasibility study. Special focus will be put on R&D plans",
        "prototyping and key technologies."
