        "This talk will specify the x-ray characteristics that can be achieved by Compton scattering off a high-brightness electron beam that ERLs make available. These are important parameters for x-ray users as well as for nuclear physics applications. The use of the Cornell BNL ERL Test Accelerator (CBETA) as an example layout for such a Compton source will be presented",
        "including some accelerator physics details of CBETAâ€™s design",
        "construction",
        "and commissioning. The talk will also highlight other applications that are enabled by unique features of ERLs."

One is to establish a new compact low energy neutron non-destructive evaluation system on-site of floor-standing type for industrial use. Another goal is to invent a novel transportable compact neutron system for the preventive maintenance of large scale construction such as a bridge. The low energy transmission imaging",
