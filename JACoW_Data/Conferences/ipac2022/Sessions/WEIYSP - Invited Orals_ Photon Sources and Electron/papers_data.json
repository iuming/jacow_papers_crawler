        "We review modern state-of-the-art and new concepts of undulators planned for new generation light sources. Both superconducting and permanent-magnet-based insertion devices feature unique solutions to reach high precisely tunable fields in the period range of 10-18 mm",
        "2-4 meters in length and with the ID gaps of less than 5 mm. The same quest for small gaps and shortest possible period length exists also for elliptically polarizing undulators. A review of new designs in Europe",
        "Asia and Americas will be in the focus of this presentation."
