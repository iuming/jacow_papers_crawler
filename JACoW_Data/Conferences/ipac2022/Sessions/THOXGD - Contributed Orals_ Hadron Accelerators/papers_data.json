        "In 2021 the Extra Low ENergy Antiproton ring (ELENA) moved from commissioning into the physics production phase providing 100 keV antiprotons to the newly connected experiments paving the way to an improved trapping efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the AD era. After recalling the major work undertaken during the CERN Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2020) in the antiproton deceleration complex",
        "details will be given on the ELENA ring and the new electrostatic transfer line beam commissioning using an ion source. Sub-sequentially",
        "the progress from commissioning with ions to operation with antiprotons will be described with emphasis on the achieved beam performance. Finally",
        "the impact on the performance of the main hardware systems will be reviewed."

        "Electron cooling as a method of creating intense ion beams has a practical upper limit when it comes to the peak phase space density of ion beams which can be achieved in practice. We describe a new experiment to study electron cooling of 2.5 MeV protons at the intensity limit using the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA)",
        "which is a storage ring dedicated to beam physics research at Fermilab. This system will enable the study of magnetized electron cooling of a proton beam with transverse incoherent tune shifts approaching -0.5 due to the presence of intense space-charge forces. We present an overview of the hardware design",
        "simulations and specific experiments planned for this project."

        "The Rare isotope Accelerator Complex for ON-line experiments (RAON) has been proposed as a multi-purpose accelerator facility for providing beams of exotic rare isotopes of various energies. It can deliver ions from hydrogen (proton) to uranium. Protons and uranium ions are accelerated up to 600 MeV and 200 MeV/u respectively. It can provide various rare isotope beams which are produced by isotope separator on-line system. The RAON injector was successfully commissioned in 2021 to study the initial beam parameters from the main technical systems",
        "such as the ECR ion source and RFQ",
        "and to find the optimized LEBT and MEBT setpoints and matching conditions. In this paper",
        "we present the current commissioning status of the RAON injector in preparation for the upcoming SCL3 beam commissioning."
