        "The 352.21 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) for the European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS) has been delivered by the end of 2019 by CEA/IRFU. The RFQ is designed to accelerate a 70 mA proton beam from 75 keV up to 3.62 MeV. It consists of a 4-vane resonant cavity with a total length of 4.6 m. Two coaxial power loop couplers feed the RFQ with the 1.4 MW of RF power required for beam operation. This paper first presents the main systems required for the RFQ conditioning. Then it summarizes the main steps and results of this high power RF conditioning completed at ESS from June 9 to July 29",

        "Many accelerator projects such as the ILC would benefit from cavities with reduced surface resistance (high Q-values) while maintaining a high accelerating gradient. A possible way to meet the requirements is the so-called nitrogen-infusion procedure on Niobium cavities. However",
        "a fundamental understanding and a theoretical model of this method are still missing. One important parameter is the residual resistance ratio (RRR) which is related to the impurity content of the material. We report the investigated RRR on samples in a wide temperature range in a vacuum and under a nitrogen atmosphere. This comparison made it possible to make statements about the differences in the concentration of nitrogen by varying the temperature. The samples are pure cavity-grade niobium and treated in the same manner as cavities. For this purpose",
        "a small furnace dedicated to sample treatment was set up to change and explore the parameter space of the infusion recipe. Care was taken to achieve the highest level of purity possible in the furnace and in a pressure range of 1.0·10-8 mbar in order to meet the high requirements of nitrogen infusion."

High Q0 decreases the capital required to keep the accelerators cold by reducing power loss. The performance of SRF cavities is largely governed by the surface composition of the first §I{100}{nm} of the cavity surface. Impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen have been observed to yield high Q0",
        "but their precise roles are still being studied. Here",

A simulation of the diffusion of oxygen into the bulk of the cavity was built using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Simulated results were compared to the actual surface composition of the cavities as determined from secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis. Understanding how these impurities affects performance allows us to have further insight into the underlying mechanisms that enable these surface treatments to yield high Q0."

        "The concept of crystal collimation relies on the use of bent crystals which can coherently deflect high-energy halo particles at angles orders of magnitude larger than what is obtained from scattering with conventional materials. Crystal collimation is studied to further improve the collimation efficiency at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In order to reproduce the main experimental results of crystal collimation tests and to predict the performance of such a system",
        "a simulation routine capable of modeling interactions of beam particles with crystal collimators was developed and recently integrated into the latest release of the single-particle tracking code SixTrack. A new treatment of the miscut angle",
        "i.e. the angle between crystalline planes and crystal edges",
        "was implemented to study the effects of this manufacturing imperfection on the efficiency of a crystal collimation system. In this paper",
        "the updated miscut angle model is described and simulation results on the cleaning efficiency are presented",
        "using configurations tested during Run 2 of the LHC as a case study."

This scheme is planned to be used at the LHC to improve the betatron cleaning efficiency with high-intensity ion beams. Only particles with impinging angles below 2.5 urad relative to the crystalline planes can be efficiently channeled at the LHC nominal top energy of 7 Z TeV. For this reason",

These include exploiting the asymmetric response of the two jaws of each primary collimator and adjusting the locally generated dispersion in the collimation insertion."
