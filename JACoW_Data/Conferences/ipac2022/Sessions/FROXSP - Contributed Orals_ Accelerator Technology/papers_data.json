It was an exchange of our expertise on the wideband cavities and high-power solid-state amplifiers.

        "we demonstrated high gradient above 300 MV/m using an X-band 11.7 GHz single-cell travelling-wave structure with 6 ns FWHM RF pulses generated by a power extractor. In comparison",
        "a scaled 11.424 GHz structure only reached below 150 MV/m driven by 30-100 ns RF pulses from a klystron with pulse compression. The experimental results and the suggested new mechanism of beam acceleration in the Breakdown Insensitive Acceleration Regime (BIAR) are presented in this manuscript."

        "high efficiency klystrons are being developed by CERN. However",

        "a prototype solenoid made of MgB2 was manufactured as a joint venture from CERN",
        "Hitachi and KEK with the aim of reducing the power consumption by a factor ten using higher temperature superconductors. The characteristics of the magnet were measured upon manufacture and checked after the transport across the world. In 2020",
        "the MgB2 magnet was integrated around one of the klystrons in the X-band facility at CERN and put into operation in the beginning of 2021. We present in this paper the final performance of the klystron when fitted with the new SC solenoid and compare it with the standard normal conducting solenoid system."
