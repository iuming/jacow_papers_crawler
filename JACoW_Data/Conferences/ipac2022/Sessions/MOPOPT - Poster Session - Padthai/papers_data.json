The aim of the experiment is the exploration of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram of matter at high net-baryon densities and for moderate temperatures. In this contribution a beam monitoring (BMON) system will be presented which will include a high-speed time-zero (T0) detector. The detector system must meet the requirements of the CBM time-of-flight (ToF) measurement system for proton and heavy-ion beams and should also allow for beam monitoring. The detector technology is planned to be based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond basis but also new Low Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD) developments are evaluated. In this contribution the beam detector concept will be presented and the results of first prototype tests in the mini-CBM setup will be shown."

The arrival time is calculated on a FPGA with low latency and can be used for machine diagnostic. The code has been adapted to enable the processing of a data stream of the continuous train of electron bunches",

In this contribution",

THERESA (TeraHErtz REadout SAmpling) is a data acquisition system based on the recent ZYNQ-RFSoC family. THERESA has been developed with an analog bandwidth up to 20 GHz and a sampling rate up to 90 GS/s. When combined with the photonic time-stretch setup",

        "The European XFEL (EuXFEL) and other notable X-ray Free-Electron Laser facilities rely on an all-optical synchronization system with electro-optical bunch arrival-time monitors (BAM). The current BAMs were benchmarked with a resolution of 3.5 fs for nominal 250 pC bunches at the EuXFEL",
        "including jitter of the optical reference system. The arrival-time jitter could be reduced to about 10 fs with a beam-based feedback system. For future experiments at the EuXFEL the bunch charge will be decreased to a level where the existing system’s accuracy will no longer be sufficient. In simulations a concept based on rod-shaped pickups mounted on a printed circuit board indicated its potential for such low charge applications. For the feasibility of the proposed design",

All resistors and their support structure have been replaced in March 2022. Temperature-rise of resistors during continuous pulse excitation was measured by commercial thermo camera and compared with numerical calculations. In addition",

We characterized different materials using MUED",

Diffraction patterns were acquired in single shot mode and convolutional neural network autoenconder models were evaluated for noise reduction and the reconstruction error was studied to identify anomalous diffraction patterns. Electron beam energy jitter was analyzed from single shot diffraction patterns to be used as a novel diagnostic tool. The MUED beamline was also simulated using VSim to construct a surrogate model for control of beam shape and energy. Progress towards ML-based controls leveraging off Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources will also be presented."
