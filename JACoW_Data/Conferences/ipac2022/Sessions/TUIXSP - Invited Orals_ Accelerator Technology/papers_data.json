        "ALS/ALS-U has invested great deal of effort into development of NEG technology to reduce the dependency of the next generation light sources on conventional vacuum pumps. In this presentation",
        "we will focus on summarizing advances in design of vacuum systems with the use of NEG",
        "including coating of chambers with small (6mm D) cross-section. In our recent experiments at ALS-U we succeeded to extend our coating techniques up to 4 m long undulator chambers. We will review experience in NEG technology acquired by several accelerator facilities."
