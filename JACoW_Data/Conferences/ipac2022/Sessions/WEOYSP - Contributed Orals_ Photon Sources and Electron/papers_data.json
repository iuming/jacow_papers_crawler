        "circulating in the Fermilab IOTA storage ring and interacting with an undulator through single and multi-photon emissions. The focus of this research is on single-photon and two-photon undulator emissions. We begin by using one Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) detector to detect the undulator radiation photons and search for possible deviations from the expected Poissonian photon statistics. Then",
        "we go on to use a two-photon interferometer consisting of two SPAD detectors separated by a beam splitter. This allows to test if there is any correlation in the detected photon pairs. In addition",
        "the photocount arrival times can be used to track the longitudinal motion of a single electron and to compare it with simulations. This allowed us to determine several dynamical parameters of the storage ring such as the rf cavity phase jitter and the dependence of the synchrotron motion period on amplitude."

        "The ThomX accelerator beam commissioning phase is now ongoing. The 50 MeV electron accelerator complex consists of a 50 MeV linear accelerator and a pulsed mode ring. It is dedicated to the production of X-rays by Compton backscattering. The performance of the beam at the interaction point is demanding in terms of emittance",

        "energy spread and transverse size. The choice of an undamped ring in pulsed mode also stresses the performance of the beam from the linear accelerator. Thus",
        "commissioning includes a beam based alignment and a simulation/experimental matching procedure to reach the X-ray beam requirements. We will present the first 50 MeV electron beam obtained with ThomX and its characteristics.",

        "SESAME RF system has been in operation since 2017 where the operational electron beam current has been increased from 100mA to 300mA since then. The higher operational beam current together with the need to have longer beam lifetime to reduce number of injections per day required higher forward RF power",
        "On the other hand; more attention needed to be paid to monitor and tackle the current driven High Order Modes and to respect the limitation on the forward RF power coming from the solid state amplifiers. In this paper we describe the RF system and report on the challenges we faced in addition to the operational experience we had with the RF system and solid state amplifiers."
