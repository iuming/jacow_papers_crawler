        "In order to achieve a high luminosity in the future electron-positron circular collider (FCC-ee)",
        "very intense multi-bunch colliding beams should have nanometer scale transverse beam sizes at the collision points. For this purpose the emittances of the colliding beams are chosen to be very small",
        "comparable to those of the modern synchrotron light sources",
        "while the stored beam currents should be close to the best values achieved in the last generation of particle factories. In order to preserve beam quality and to avoid collider performance degradation",
        "a careful study of the collective effects and techniques for their mitigation is required. The current status of these studies is discussed in the paper."

        "We present a new ’green energy’ approach to the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) the future Electron Ion Collider at LHeC using single beam line made of very strong focusing combined function permanent magnets and the Fixed Field Alternating Linear Gradient (FFA-LG) principle. We are basing our design on recent very successful commissioning results of the Cornell University and Brookhaven National Laboratory ERL Test Accelerator-CBETA."

        "more important physics is expected in higher energy region (>2.1 GeV). As the upper limit of BEPCII design energy is 2.1 GeV",
        "an urgent upgrade is required for BEPCII. To achieve a higher luminosity at higher energy",
        "the number of RF cavities is expected to be doubled. The baseline design which kept the survey of the North Collision Region (NCR) unchanged for the upgrade of BEPCII has been studied in previous work. In this paper",
        "we show an alternative design that modifies the survey of NCR",
        "but enables the online maintenance of both RF cavities in each ring of BEPCII. The dynamic aperture tracking result shows that the lattice could meet the injection requirement of BEPCII beam with reasonable margin."
