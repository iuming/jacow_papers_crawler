        "Beam-based observations and theoretical studies have demonstrated the existence of a significant amplitude dependence of the closest tune approach (ADECTA) in the LHC. This effect has the potential to generate significant distortion of the tune footprint and thus is of interest in regard to Landau damping. Conventionally ADECTA has been studied through saturation of tune separation with action during amplitude-detuning type measurements. In this paper",
        "an alternative measurement technique is proposed and results of initial tests with beam are presented. The novel technique attempts to measure ADECTA by performing a classical closest approach tune scan",
        "using proton beams in the LHC",
        "which have been kicked and allowed to decohere",
        "effectively giving a large action doughnut beam. It is shown that the tune and closest approach of the doughnut beams can be measured using the existing LHC Base-Band tune (BBQ) measurement system",
        "and an amplitude dependence can be observed."

With a pulsed hydrogen gas stripper target the uranium beam stripping efficiency could be increased by 65%.

      "abstract": "Based on the positive results of the unmodulated 325 MHz Ladder-RFQ prototype from 2013 to 2016, we developed and designed a modulated 3.4 m Ladder-RFQ*. The Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis as well as low dipole modes. The unmodulated prototype accepted 3 times the operating power of which is needed in operation** corresponding to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 µs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project***. This particular high frequency for a 4-ROD-RFQ creates difficulties, which triggered the development of a Ladder-RFQ with its high symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is very well suited for that frequency. For the applied cooling concept, the Ladder-RFQ can be driven up to a duty factor of 10%. Manufacturing has been completed in September 2018. The final flatness & frequency tuning as well as the final assembly have been completed. We present the final RF measurements and assembly steps getting the Ladder-RFQ ready for shipment and high power RF test prior to assembly. *Journal of Physics: Conf.

        "Due to the decommissioning of several reactors",
        "only about half of the neutrons will be available for research in Europe in the next decade despite the commissioning of the ESS. High-Current Accelerator-driven Neutron Sources (HiCANS) could fill this gap. The High Brilliance Neutron Source (HBS) currently under development at Forschungszentrum Jülich is scalable in terms of beam energy and power due to its modular design. The driver linac will accelerate a 100 mA proton beam to 70 MeV. The linac is operated with a beam duty cycle of up to 13.6 % (15.3 % RF duty cycle) and can simultaneously deliver three pulse lengths (208 µs",
        "833 µs and 2 ms) for three neutron target stations. In order to minimize the development effort and the technological risk",
        "state-of-the-art technology of the MYRRHA injector is used. The HBS linac consists of a front end (ECR source",
        "LEBT",
        "2.5 MeV double RFQ) and a CH-DTL section with 44 room temperature CH-cavities. All RF structures are operated at 176.1 MHz and are designed for high duty cycle. Solid-state amplifiers up to 500 kW are used as RF drivers. Due to the beam current and the high average beam power of up to 952 kW",
        "particular attention is paid to beam dynamics. In order to minimize beam losses",
        "a quasi-periodic lattice with constant negative phase is used. This paper describes the conceptual design and the challenges of a modern high-power and high-current proton accelerator with high reliability and availability."

Since the commissioning of the original ReA RFQ in 2010 the design voltage has never been reached",
