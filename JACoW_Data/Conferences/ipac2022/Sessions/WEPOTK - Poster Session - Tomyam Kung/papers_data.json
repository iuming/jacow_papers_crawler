        "long term stability and reproducibility were approved. Main differences compared to experiments and investigations of the pure non-neutral in Penning-Malmberg traps are higher residual gas pressure and therefore higher collision rates",
        "higher bulk temperatures",
        "self-sustaining electron production process",
        "much higher evaporation cooling rate. GL2000 is a new 2m long device and was mainly designed for focusing of ion beams in energy ranges up to GeV but also for investigation of non-neutral plasma parameters. The confined electron column is much longer compared to previous constructed Lenses. This makes ion and hadron beam focussing much more efficient",
        "in addition new physical phenomena can be expected and investigated. Simulation results of steady- and thermal equilibrium states with various external parameters and first measurements will be presented. The first operational tests show that it is possible to confine a two-meter long electron column."

The goal of this project is the (partial) compensation of SC forces within the ion beam by an overlapping electron beam. This may help to increase the intensity of primary beams",
        "especially in the FAIR facility and potentially all large synchrotrons operated at the SC limit. For an effective SC compensation",
        "the generated electron beam needs to follow the transverse and longitudinal beam profile of the ion bunch structure. The requirements are maximum currents of 10 A and grid modulation to cover a broad frequency range from 400 kHz to 1 MHz. The RF-modulated electron gun was designed and manufactured in the scope of the ARIES collaboration and is currently being tested at the E-Lens Lab of Goethe University Frankfurt. A dedicated test bench was built for commissioning of the major e-lens components and diagnostics. In this contribution the overall set-up will be presented putting special emphasis on the beam dynamics and collector design as well as as well as simulation results of the electron gun."

The introduction of a magnetic filter to remove the electrons from the extraction zone of the source causes ExB particle drifts (or shifts) which move both ions and electrons towards the top (or bottom depending on the B direction); in the top part the electron concentration and extracted current increase and that limits the extracted ion amount.

Results from previous investigations suggest that the transit time spread can be increased by reducing the beam emittance in the plane of extraction. Increased transit time spread is known to cut-off high frequency noise introduced by magnet power supplies. A pilot experiment was performed at SIS18 at GSI to introduce transverse emittance exchange",

The six sep-tum magnets for fast extraction (FX) need to be replaced to reduce the heat that is generated as a result of shorten-ing the repetition cycle. The replacement of the septum magnets began in July 2021 and was completed at the end of May 2022. The beam commissioning starts in June 2022. We report the details of the replacement work and operation test of the new septum magnets. We found a defect in the magnetic coil of the septum (SM32) in August 2021. We decided to postpone its installation to around August 2022 and produce new magnet coils for the SM32. The beam extraction in June 2022 will be per-formed using a temporary vacuum duct instead of the SM32 magnet",

Transfer line optics are traditionally designed from a lattice based approach and are unaffected by external effects. Presented is a method of rapidly proto- typing MAD-X simulations into G4Beamline models which propagate particles via electromagnetic fields rather than idealised optical lattice parameters. The transfer line to the ALPHA experiment is simulated in this approach. Due to the presence of fringe fields disagreement is found between the two models. Using an error minimisation technique",

        "the storage ring impedance measurements were done once in 2007. Two insertion magnet devices have been installed in the SPS storage ring during June to August 2013. There are several vacuum components added to the storage ring; these affect the ring impedance. Quantitative understanding of instabilities requires detailed knowledge of the impedance of the ring. For this purpose",
        "the development of an impedance database is a necessity",
        "where the wake potentials of each vacuum component are kept and maintained in a standard format. The self-describing data sets (SDDS) file format will be utilized to record components wake potentials. The wake potentials of each vacuum component can be obtained from a particle tracking simulation; a CST particle studio program will be used in the simulation process. The wake potentials can also be included in a beam dynamic tracking program such as ELEGANT to observe beam behaviors with these instabilities and find a curing means. The study results will be presented."

        "Intrabeam scattering (IBS) is becoming an increasingly important effect in the design of high-brightness linear electron accelerators due to the ever-increasing transverse brightness of beams produced from radiofrequency photoinjectors. The existing theory describing the energy spread growth rate due to IBS was derived in the context of circular machines where the beam particles are frequently and randomly colliding",
        "and therefore should only be applied to non-laminar",
        "emittance dominated flow. This is not the case in the injector portion of a linear accelerator",
        "where the beam is space-charge dominated and the flow is laminar. The different nature of the microscopic motion in the two cases demands a reevaluation of the applicability of IBS theory to the photoinjector. In this work",
        "we present a simple analytic model for energy spread growth during perfectly laminar flow and show that it matches well to point-to-point multiparticle simulations. In this way we demonstrate that stochastic energy spread growth in laminar beams is more attributable to the initial random placement of the particles in the bunch rather than the traditional temperature rearrangement mechanism of IBS."
