        "will be the world’s most powerful linear accelerator driving a neutron spallation source",
        "with an ultimate beam average power of 5 MW at 2.0 GeV. The LINAC accelerates a proton beam of 62.5 mA peak current at 4 % duty cycle (2.86 ms at 14 Hz). The accelerator uses a normal conducting front-end bring-ing the beam energy to 90 MeV",
        "beyond that the accelera-tion up to 2 GeV is performed using superconducting structures. The accelerator is built by a European collabo-ration consisting of 23 European institutes delivering in-kind contributions of most hardware but also of services for installation and testing. More than half of the original 510 Mâ¬ for the accelerator budget being in form of in-kind contributions. This talk will give an overview of the status of the ESS accelerator and comment on the chal-lenges the accelerator collaboration has encountered and how we together are addressing these challenges."

        "the beam intensity of uranium beams",
        "which is important to produce in-flight fission RI beams",
        "was drastically increased by a factor of 240 compared to 2008. For further intensity upgrade of the uranium beams",
        "the total charge stripping efficiency less than 5% of two strippers",
        "He gas and rotating graphite sheet disk strippers",
        "is a serious bottleneck. A new acceleration scheme with charge stripper rings (CSRs) as a cost-effective way to enhance the charge stripping efficiency has been proposed. The CSR recycles beams other than the selected charge state that was previously dumped. These beams are orbited in the CSR while suppressing emittance growth",
        "and then re-enter the stripper. The CSR is being studied as a future plan",
        "aiming at a 10-fold increase in the intensity of the uranium beams. The present status and the future plan with the CSR at RIBF will be presented."
