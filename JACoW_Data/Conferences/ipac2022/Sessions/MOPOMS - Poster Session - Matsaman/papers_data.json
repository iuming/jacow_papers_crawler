Customized laser technologies have been developed allowing for the generation of these pulses up to 1 kHz repetition rate. The generated electron bunches are then focused into a counter propagating optical pulse ’optical undulator’ to generate X-rays in the 6-7 keV range. We will discuss the overall layout of the machine",

A dielectric-loaded metallic cavity operating at its Higher Order Mode accelerates 1 PC photo emitted electron bunch up to 430 keV kinetic energy. The output beam of the gun is injected into a dielectric-loaded waveguide where phase velocity of the traveling wave is adjusted in such a way that electrons see an accelerating field all the way along the tube resulting to an 18.5-MeV output beam which is then transported to an inverse Compton scattering (ICS) stage. The injection phase of the electrons can be tuned to introduce a negative energy chirp to the electron bunch leading to a ballistic bunch compression after the linac. In addition",

Sustainable extraction of energy from the drive beam relies on precise understanding of its long term dynamics and the possible onset or mitigation of the beam instability. The advance of computational power and tools makes it possible to model the full physics of beam-driven wakefield acceleration.

With this knowledge theoretical implementations of GLs in final focus and transfer lines have started. The focusing with GLs is a weak but smooth focusing in radial direction. The GL is a suitable and inexpensive choice in addition to the existing focusing elements eg. magnetic quadrupoles. The device helps to improve beam quality and minimize losses over long distances. The investigation of relativistic hadron beams in GeV range using the example of the proposed NA61/SHINE VLE-beamline at CERN is carried out and will be presented. Thin-matrix simulations with a generated distribution as well as field map simulations with generated and realistic distributions (Geant4) at 1 - 6 GeV/c have been analysed and compared.

        "a novel concept of heating metallic cathodes is currently under investigation. In the scope of the ARIES collaboration WP16",
        "an RF-modulated electron gun was developed and manufactured for application in electron lenses for space charge compensation. The goal of this project is to increase the intensity of primary beams",
        "especially in low energy booster synchrotrons like the SIS18 and SIS100 at GSI/FAIR or the SPS at CERN. The gun was designed to produce electron currents of 10 A at extraction voltages of 30 kV. The tungsten electron emitter (TE²) and the grid electrode were designed and manufactured to be integrated in the extractor of the original volume type ion source. Significant effort was put into a robust and flexible design with highly reliable key components. The cathode is heated by a plasma stream generated in the plasma chamber of the source. Different heating options of the cathode are currently being studied. This contribution presents the working principles of the electron gun and first measurements results of cathode heating."

        "Frascati",
        "Rome). It is based on a 1.6 cell RF gun fabricated with the new brazing free technology recently developed at the National Laboratories of Frascati. The electromagnetic design has been optimized to have a full compensation of the dipole and quadrupole field components introduced by the coupling hole with an improvement of the effective pumping speed with two added pumping ports. The gun is overcoupled (\\beta=2) to reduce the filling time and to allow the operation with short RF pulses. The overall injector integrates a new solenoid with a remote control of the transverse position and a variable skew quadrupole for the compensation of residual quadrupole field components. It also allows an on axis laser injection system with the last mirror in air",
        "and the possibility of a future integration of an X/C band cavity linearizer. In the paper we report the main characteristics of the electromagnetic and mechanical design and the low and high power test results that shows the extremely good perfomances of the new device."

      "abstract": "High brightness cathodes are increasingly a focus for accelerator applications ranging from free electron lasers to ultrafast electron diffraction. There is further an increasing interest in fabrication and control of cathode surface to better control the emission characteristics and improve beam brightness. One method which we can consider is based on well-known silicon nanofabrication techniques which we use to create patterned cathode surfaces. The sharp edges produced lead to field emission increases and high brightness emission. We have demonstrated that a beam can be successfully extracted with a low emittance and we have reconstructed a portion of the energy spectrum. Due to the simplicity of extended geometries in nanofabrication our beam uniquely possesses a high aspect ratio in its transverse cross section. We can begin to consider modifications for emittance exchange beamlines and having shown the patterning principle is sound we can consider additional patterns such as hollow beams. Future work will continue to characterize the produced beam and the addition of fabrication steps to remove one of the blades in the double blade geometry in order to more accurately characterize the emission. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Summarizing the ability for a crystal to emit in a particular direction would be of great use when searching for good field emitters. In this paper we propose a material normal energy distribution which describes the ability of the bound electrons to tunnel under an intense electric field.

This RF source will operate as resource for test and research programs such as the RF breakdown on RF waveguide components as well as high power testing of accelerating structures for future high gradient linear accelerator such as EuPRAXIA and CLIC.
