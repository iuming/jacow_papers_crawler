        "in particular the photon spectrum and quantum fluctuation associated with such magnets",
        "and we study whether the resulting equilibrium emittance may deviate from the value expected in the long-magnet limit."

        "the small radius of the vacuum chamber gives rise to strong beam coupling impedances which significantly alter the stored beam dynamics. In this work",
        "we present the single-bunch measurements made so far to characterize such effects and compare the results with those simulated using the impedance budget built during the storage ring design."
