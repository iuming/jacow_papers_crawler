        "A wide range of experiments are being held at AREAL accelerator in the fields of materials science and life sci-ence by generating ultra-short 5 MeV electron beams. Beam parameter formation and stability preservation during the experiments are one of the key tasks of stable operation of the accelerator. Laser spot displacement on the photocathode could be one of the beam parameter distortion sources",
        "which causes off-axis bunch travel also through the solenoid. The influences of laser spot horizontal displacement and the solenoid horizontal misalignment on the beam position at the experiment location are investigated separately via computer simulations. Using a laser spot mover and solenoid movers",
        "an experiment has been carried out to compare simulation results with experiment."

        "ACTIS (Arc Compressor Test In a Synchrotron) is an experiment aimed to demonstrate the reliability of arc compressors as lattices capable to increase peak current and brightness of an electron beam as it is bent at large angles. This kind of devices has been proposed at theoretical level in several works over the past decades and could be the key to achieve compact and sustainable Free Electron Lasers in the near future. The experiment has been developed since 2019 in the joint effort between INFN",
        "Solaris National Synchrotron Radiation Center and Elettra - S.T. S.C.p.A. The experiment will take place at Solaris (Kraków). Solaris is a synchrotron whose ring is injected by a 550 MeV linac that will be used to prepare the beam with a proper chirp. ACTIS involves also the commissioning of two beam length detectors to be installed downstream of the linac and of the first ring lap. In addition",
        "the low energy model of the machine was built to identify the optimal working point for the experiment and to foresee the longitudinal profile of the beam that will be measured. In this work we present the experiment and report first results obtained in the study phase."

        "The measurement and control of linear transverse coupling is important for the operation of an accelerator. The calculation of the linear transverse coupling resonance driving terms (RDTs) ’1001 and ’1010 relies on the complex spectrum of the turn-by-turn motion. To obtain the complex signal",
        "a reconstruction of the particle motion is needed. For this purpose",
        "the signal of a second BPM with a suitable phase shift is usually used. In this work",
        "we explore the possibility of including more BPMs in the reconstruction of the transverse momentum",
        "which could reduce the effects of statistical errors and systematic uncertainties. This",
        "in turn",
        "could improve the precision and accuracy of the RDTs",
        "which could be of great benefit for locations where an exact knowledge of the transverse coupling or other RDTs is important. We present the development of a new method to reconstruct the particle’s momentum that uses a statistical analysis of several nearby BPMs. The improved precision is demonstrated via simulations of LHC and HL-LHC lattices."

        "The current designs of future electron-positron linear colliders incorporate large and complex damping rings to produce asymmetric beams for beamstrahlung mitigation at the interaction point. This paper presents the design of an damping-ring-free electron injector capable of delivering flat electron beams with phase-space partition comparable to the electron-beam parameters produced downstream of the damping ring in the proposed international linear collider (ILC) design. The performance of the proposed configuration",
        "its sensitivity to jitter along with its impact on spin-polarization is discussed."
