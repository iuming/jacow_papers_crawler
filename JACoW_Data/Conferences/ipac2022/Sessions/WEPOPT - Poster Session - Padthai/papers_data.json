The two RHIC rings will be reconfigured as a single Hadron Storage Ring (HSR) for accelerating and storing ion beams. The proton beam energy will be raised from 255 to 275 GeV to achieve the desired center-of-mass energy range: 20’140 GeV. It is also mandatory to operate the HSR with a constant revolution frequency over a large energy range (41’275 GeV for protons) to synchronize with the Electron Storage Ring (ESR). These and other requirements/challenges dictate modifications to RHIC accelerators.

The EIC aims at providing high luminosity and high polarization collisions for a large range of beam energies. Dynamic aperture (DA) of the EIC Electron Storage Ring (ESR) must be sufficiently large in both transverse and momentum dimensions. The latter is a challenge due to low-beta optics in up to two interaction regions (IR). We have developed an advanced technique for efficient non-linear chromaticity compensation compatible with the different ESR lattice configurations at different energies. The solution for the most challenging lattice with two IRs at 18 GeV is presented. The lattice is then evaluated with magnet errors",

The \"conventional\" target scheme is used which simply consists of amorphous tungsten. The target is placed inside the bore of the HTS solenoid to improve the accepted positron yield at the entrance of the damping ring and the location of the target is optimised. The latest recommended baseline beam parameters are used and presented. An optimisation of the ideal positron yield using the analytic SC solenoid on-axis field is also performed and shows that the design of the HTS solenoid is optimal as far as the accepted positron yield is concerned. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
