        "they are inserted between the Multi-Wire Profile Monitor (MWPM) on the injection line at the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) in J-PARC to completely prevent the wall currents accompanying beams from affecting the MWPM. On the other hand",
        "from the viewpoint of suppressing beam impedances and the radiation fields from the ceramic breaks",
        "it would be preferable that the inner surface of the ceramic break is coated with Titanium Nitride (TiN)",
        "or covered over capacitors. In this report",
        "we measure the radiation fields from the ceramic break with and without capacitors as well as the beam profile and investigate the effect of the ceramic breaks on the measurements."

In such configuration the horizontal emittance is further reduced while the lifetime is increased at the price of working close to equal fractional tunes. This mode of operation has not been adopted by any existing light source to date",
        "and it presents a few disadvantages",
        "like the optics degradation",
        "injection efficiency reduction and beam size stability. In this paper the above mentioned difficulties are studied for the present ALBA storage ring in full coupling conditions."
