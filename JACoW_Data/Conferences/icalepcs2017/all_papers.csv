In this paper; we report on the recent evolution in MADOCA II for data collection; which was missing in the past reports at ICALEPCS *; **. In MADOCA; the biggest challenge in data collection was to manage signals into Parameter Database smoothly. Users request Signal Registration Table (SRT) for new data collection. However; this costed time and manpower due to typo in SRT and iteration in DB registration. In MADOCA II; we facilitated signal registration scheme with prior test of data collection and validity check in SRT with web-based user interface. Data collection framework itself was also extended to manage various data collection types in SPring-8 with a unified method. All of data collection methods (polling; event type); data format (such as point and waveform data) and platform (Unix; Embedded; Windows including LabVIEW) can be flexibly managed. We started to implement MADOCA II data collection into SPring-8 with 241 hosts and confirmed stable operation since April 2016.; * T.

After reviewing several communication libraries [1]; ZeroMQ [2] was chosen as the transport layer for the new communication framework. The main design principles were: scalability; flexibility; easy to use and maintain. Several core ZeroMQ patterns were employed in order to provide reliable; asynchronous communication and dispatching of messages. The new product was implemented in Java and C++ for client and server side. It is the core middleware framework to control all CERN accelerators and the future GSI FAIR [3] complex. This paper presents the overall framework architecture; choices and lessons learnt while designing a scalable solution; challenges faced when designing a common API for two languages (Java and C++) and operational experience from using the new solution at CERN for 3 years. The lessons learnt and observations made can be applied to any modern software library responsible for fast; reliable; scalable communication and processing of many concurrent requests.; [1] A.

icalepcs2017,,MOBPL06,"Reactive Programming, and How It Fits Within Control Systems",MAX IV Laboratory; Lund University; Lund; Sweden; The MAX-IV synchrotron decided to adopt events as the main communication channel in order to increase both the responsiveness and reliability of its TANGO* control system. That means the tango (software) devices do not perform read hardware operation on client request but instead maintain a reliable communication with the hardware while publishing the data through event channels. Reactive programming** is an asynchronous programming paradigm oriented around data streams and the propagation of change. Instead of using the traditional imperative approach of maintaining the integrity of variables; a reactive program expresses the relationship between data streams. High-level tango devices (software devices aggregating data from other tango devices) make very good candidates for reactive programming. More precisely; it is possible to describe the attributes of those devices as relationships; where the input data comes from the event channels of lower-level devices. The facadedevice*** python library is an attempt to implement the reactive machinery within a tango device base class; and provides a descriptive API for defining the relationships in a clear and concise way.,,* TANGO controls: http://www.tango-controls.org/  ** Reactive programming: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactiveprogramming *** facadedevice: http://github.com/MaxIV-KitsControls/tango-facadedevice Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/E7kUZBa8MHA,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/mobpl06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/mobpl06.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/mobpl06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-MOBPL06,
icalepcs2017,,MOCPL01,Orchestrating a System,Sandia National Laboratories; Albuquerque; New Mexico; USA; Pulsed power facilities require a wide variety of control systems to operate efficiently. Relatively slow distributed control systems that process water are okay taking hundreds of milliseconds to respond to a physical change while small pulsed power lasers may need to reliably respond to a change within hundreds of nanoseconds. Building these control systems requires more than just the ability to write lines of code and wire up embedded controllers. Knowledge of hardware capability and planning appropriately will end up saving lots of time. Tailoring your hardware/software choices to the environment in which the system is expected to function and correctly choosing a solution that will fit your needs will contribute to the overall success and longevity of your control system. In this presentation; we will cover some of the design decisions that go into 'making things work fast enough' while providing a real-world example of a system that is 'good enough'.,Funding: US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04AL85000,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/xg1sJ3tdIyU,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/mocpl01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/mocpl01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/mocpl01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-MOCPL01,

Sophisticated diagnostics are placed close to the targets to record the results of each shot. The placement of these diagnostics relative to the target is critical to the mission; with alignment tolerances on the order of 500 microns. The integration of commercial laser-based survey instruments into the NIF control system has improved diagnostic alignment in many ways. The Advanced Tracking Laser Alignment System (ATLAS) project incorporates commercial Faro laser tracker instruments into the diagnostic factory and the target chamber; improving alignment accuracy over prior systems. The system uses multiple retroreflectors mounted on each of the diagnostic positioners to translate to a 6D position in the NIF target chamber volume. This enables a closed loop alignment process to align each diagnostic. This paper provides an overview of how the laser tracker is used in diagnostic alignment; and discusses challenges met by the control system to achieve this integration.,Funding: This work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/AIK4GBUOmCw,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/mocpl02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/mocpl02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/mocpl02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-MOCPL02,52

The main advantage of PROFINET is a simplified integration within the CERN controls infrastructure that is based on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). CERN prepared the requirements and subcontracted the design of a communication card prototype to the Technical University of Bern. The designed PROFINET card prototype uses the NetX Integrated Circuit (IC) for PROFINET communication and a FPGA to collect the electrical signals from the back-panel (electrical signals interface for instrumentation conditioning cards). CERN is implementing new functionalities involving programming; automation engineering and electronics circuit design. The communication between the card and higher layers of control is based on the OPC UA protocol. The configuration files supporting new types of instrumentation cards are being developed and are compatible with the SIEMENS SIMATIC automation environment.

In this contribution we present the motion control software package ECMC developed at the ESS using the open source Etherlab*** master to control the EtherCAT bus. The motion control interfaces with a model 3 driver to the EPICS motor record supporting it's functionalities like positioning; jogging; homing and soft/hard limits. Advanced functionalities supported by ECMC are full servo-loop feedback; a scripting language for custom synchronisation of different axes; virtual axes; externally triggered position capture and interlocking.

icalepcs2017,,MOCPL06,MARWIN: A Mobile Autonomous Robot for Maintenance and Inspection,A. Dehne; T. Hermes; N. Moeller; hs21; Buxtehude; Germany; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; MARWIN is a mobile autonomous robot platform designed for performing maintenance and inspection tasks alongside the European XFEL accelerator installation in operation in Hamburg; Germany. It consists of a 4-wheel drive chassis and a manipulator arm. Due to the unique Mecanum drive technology in combination with the manipulator arm the whole robot provides three degrees of freedom. MARWIN can be operated in a pre-configured autonomous as well as a remotely controlled mode. Its operation can be supervised through various cameras. The primary use case of MARWIN is measuring radiation fields.

Operators in the control room; follow the operational state of the observatory by looking at a set of non-homogeneous panels. In case of problems; they have to find the reason by looking at the right panel; interpret the information and implement the counter-action that is time consuming so after an investigation; we started the development of an integrated alarm system that takes monitor point values and alarms from the monitored systems and presents alarms to operators in a coherent; efficient way. A monitored system has a hierarchical structure modeled with an acyclic graph whose nodes represent the components of the system. Each node digests monitor point values and alarms against a provided transfer function and sets its output as working or non nominal; taking into account the operational phase. The model can be mapped in a set of panels to increase operators' situation awareness and improve the efficiency of the facility.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/HC-eOY97EME,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/mocpl07_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/mocpl07.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/mocpl07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-MOCPL07,81

The control system is going to be upgraded during the CERN Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2020) and will be based on the CERN industrial control standard: UNICOS employing WinCC OA as SCADA and Schneider PLCs. Due to the critical nature of the CMS ventilation installation and the short allowed downtime; the approach was to design an environment based on the virtual commissioning of the new control. This solution uses a first principles model of the ventilation system to simulate the real process. The model was developed with the modelling and simulation software EcosimPro. In addition; the current control application of the cavern ventilation will also be re-engineered as it is not completely satisfactory in some transients where many sequences are performed manually and some pressure fluctuations observed could potentially cause issues to the CMS detector. The plant model will also be used to validate new regulation schemes and transient sequences offline in order to ensure a smooth operation in production.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/NVzClA1dSxc,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/modpl02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/modpl02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/modpl02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-MODPL02,92

As the next generation low-end platform instead of the outdated VMEbus; a Linux PLC such as Yokogawa e-RT3 has been considered. We have developed an e-RT3-based master module OPT-PLC to fully utilize a large number of existing remote boards. In the original system; low-level communication is performed by FPGA and high-level communication procedures are handled in the Solaris device driver on a VME CPU board. This driver becomes a barrier to port the system to e-RT3 platform. OPT-PLC should be handled by the e-RT3 standard driver in the same manner as other e-RT3 I/O modules. To solve the difficulty; OPT-PLC was equipped with Xilinx SoC and the high-level communication procedures were implemented as application software on ARM Linux in the SoC. As the result; OPT-PLC can be controlled through the standard e-RT3 driver. Furthermore; the system will be ported to other platform like PCI Express by replacing bus interface block in the PL part.

Slave cards in a VME crate are controlled from a VME master; typically part of a Single Board Computer (SBC). The SBC typically runs an operating system and communicates with the VME bus through a PCI or PCIe-to-VME bridge chip. The de-facto standard bridge; TSI148; has recently been discontinued; and therefore the question arises about what bridging solution to use in new commercial SBC designs. This paper describes our effort to solve the VME bridge availability problem. Together with a commercial company; MEN; we have open-sourced their VHDL implementation of the PCIe-VME64x interface. We have created a new commodity which is free to be used in any SBC having an FPGA; thus avoiding vendor lock-in and providing a fertile ground for collaboration among institutes and companies around the VME platform.

In such a network based CS; graphs of possible machine command sequences are specified in advance by physics frameworks. The actual traffic pattern; however; is determined at runtime; depending on interlocks and beam requests from experiments and accelerators. In 'unlucky' combinations; large packet bursts can delay commands beyond their deadline; potentially causing emergency shutdowns. Thus; prior verification if any possible combination of given command sequences can be delivered on time is vital to guarantee deterministic behavior of the CS. Deterministic network calculus (DNC) can derive upper bounds on message delivery latencies. This paper presents an approach for calculating worst-case descriptors of runtime traffic patterns. These so-called arrival curves are deduced from specified partial traffic sequences and are used to calculate end-to-end traffic properties. With the arrival curves and a DNC model of the FAIR CS network; a worst-case latency for specific packet flows or the whole CS can be obtained.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/t1AXzTi8kJA,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tucpl06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tucpl06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tucpl06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUCPL06,238

This paper describes three different mathematical approaches that have been designed and developed to detect anomalies in CERN control systems. Specifically; one of these algorithms is purely based on expert knowledge while the other two mine historical data to create a simple model of the system; which is then used to detect anomalies. The methods presented can be categorized as dynamic unsupervised anomaly detection; ""dynamic"" since the behaviour of the system is changing in time; ""unsupervised"" because they predict faults without reference to prior events. Consistent deviations from the historical evolution can be seen as warning signs of a possible future anomaly that system experts or operators need to check. The paper also presents some results; obtained from the analysis of the LHC Cryogenic system. Finally the paper briefly describes the deployment of Spark and Hadoop into the CERN environment to deal with huge datasets and to spread the computational load of the analysis across multiple nodes.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tucpa04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tucpa04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tucpa04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUCPA04,265

Laser-induced defects or flaws on the surfaces of optics are presented in images acquired by specific charge coupled devices (CCDs); hence the identification of defects from laser damage images is essential. Despite a great effort we have made to improve the imaging results; the defect identification is a challenging task. The proposed research focuses on the pre-processing of laser damage images; which assists identifying optic defects. We formulate the image pre-processing as a total variation (TV) based image reconstruction problem; and further develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve it. The use of TV regularization makes the pre-processed image sharper by preserving the edges or boundaries more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tucpa05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tucpa05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tucpa05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUCPA05,272

Data channels from various sources can be efficiently aggregated and combined into new data streams for immediate online monitoring; data analysis and processing. The system is dynamically configurable; various acquisition frequencies can be enabled; and data can be kept for a defined time window. All data is available and accessible enabling advanced pattern detection and correlation during acquisition time. Accessing the data in a code-agnostic way is also possible through the same REST API that is used by the web-frontend.

The Altera SoC FPGA integrates a dual ARM Cortex-A9 hard processor system (HPS) consisting of processor; peripherals and memory interfaces tied seamlessly with the FPGA fabric using a high-bandwidth interconnect backbone. The embedded Altera SoC IOC has features of remote network boot via u-boot from SD card or QSPI Flash; 1Gig Ethernet; 1GB DDRs SDRAM on HPS; UART serial ports; and ISA bus interface. RTEMS for the ARM processor BSP were built with CEXP shell; which will dynamically load the EPICS applications at runtime. U-boot is the primary bootloader to remotely load the kernel image into local memory from a DHCP/TFTP server over Ethernet; and automatically run the RTEMS and EPICS. The standard SoC IOC board would be mounted in a chassis and connected to a daughter card via a standard HSMC connector.

The challenge in delivering timing to a superconducting LINAC is dictated by the stability requirements for the beam power and the 1MHz rate. A timing generator will produce patterns instead of events because of the large number of event codes required. The poster explains how the stability requirements are addressed by the design of two Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). The Allow Table GUI filters the timing pattern requests respecting the Machine Protection System (MPS) defined Power Class and the electron beam dump capacities. The Timing Pattern Generator (TPG) programs Sequence Engines to deliver the beam rate configuration requested by the user. The low level program; The TPG generates the patterns; which contains the timing information propagated to the Timing Pattern Receiver (TPR).

The cryo modules are operated at 2 Kelvin. Cold compressors (CCs) pump down the liquid Helium to 30 mbar which corresponds to 2 Kelvin. Stable conditions in the cryogenic system are mandatory for successful accelerator operations. Pressure fluctuations at 2 K may cause detuning of cavities and could result in unstable CC operations. The RF losses in the cavities may be compensated by reducing the heater power in the liquid Helium baths of the nine cryogenic strings. This requires a stable readout of the current RF settings. The detailed signals are read out from several severs in the accelerator control system and then computed in the cryogenic control system for heater compensation. This paper will describe the commissioning of the cryogenic control system; the communication between the control systems involved and first results of machine operations with the heat loss compensation in place.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tumpa06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tumpa06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tumpa06_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUMPA06,348

In order to guarantee the best machine performance; a novel software application which minimizes the shot to shot correlation between these critical parameters and the FEL radiation has been implemented. This application; which keeps spatially and temporally aligned the seed laser and the electron beam; contrary to many algorithms that inject noise in the system to be optimized; run transparently during the experiment beam times. In this paper we will also present a newly developed method to calculate a beam 'quality factor' starting from the images provided by a photon spectrometer; which tries to mimic the evaluation of machine physicists; as well as the results obtained using two model-less algorithms to optimize the FEL performance through maximization of the quality factor.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tumpa07_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tumpa07.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tumpa07_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUMPA07,352

Therefore; it is very necessary to diagnose and locate the device fault accurately and rapidly; that will induce the high cost of the accelerator operation. Faults diagnosis can not only improve the safety and reliability of the equipment; but also effectively reduce the equipment's cycle costing. The multi-signal flow model proposed by Pattipati K.R is considered as the preferred method of industrial equipment faults detection. However; there are still some problems about fault probability conflict in the processing of correlation matrix diagnosis due to the hierarchical nature of multi-signal flow modeling. Thus we develop the fault diagnosis strategy based on the important prior knowledge of the fault. This method is applied to the front-end electronic devices of BEPCII magnet power supply control system and improves the fault diagnosis and analysis ability of magnet power supply control system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha001_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA001,361

Nowadays the performance gain of single core processors have nearly stagnated and multicore processors dominate the market. This evolution forces software projects to make use of the parallel hardware to increase their performance. In this thesis LSA is analyzed and parallelized using different parallelization patterns like task and loop parallelization. The most common case of user interaction is to change specific settings so that the accelerator performs at its best. For each changed setting; LSA needs to calculate all child settings of the parameter hierarchy. To maximize the speedup of the calculations; they are also optimized sequentially.

The overall orchestration is performed by the Telescope Manager (TM); a suite of software applications. In order to ensure the proper and uninterrupted operation of TM; a local monitoring and control system is developed; called TM Services. Fault Management (FM) is one of these services; and is composed by processes and infrastructure associated with detecting; diagnosing and fixing faults; and finally returning to normal operations. The aim of the study; introducing artificial intelligence algorithms during the detection phase; is to build a predictive model; based on the history and statistics of the system; in order to perform trend analysis and failure prediction. Based on monitoring data and health status detected by the software system monitor and on log files gathered by the ELK (Elasticsearch; Logstash; and Kibana) server; the predictive model ensures that the system is operating within its normal operating parameters and takes corrective actions in case of failure.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha030.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha030_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA030,435

During the 2017 LHC run; the intensi'ed analog cameras used by this system to image the beam have been replaced by GigE digital cameras coupled to image intensi'ers. Preliminary tests revealed that the typically used sub-image rectangles of 128×128 pixels can be acquired at rates of up to 400 frames per second; more than 10 times faster than the previous acquisition rate. To address the increase in CPU workload for the image processing; new VME CPU cards (Intel 4 core/2.5GHz/8GB RAM) are envisaged to be installed (replacing the previous Intel Core 2 Duo/1.5GHz/1GB RAM). This paper focuses on the software changes proposed in order to take advantage of the multi-core capabilities of the new CPU for parallel computations. It will describe how beam profile calculations can be pipe-lined through a thread pool while ensuring that the CPU keeps up with the increased data rate.

It is not much different in control and monitoring systems; where a functionally distinct sub-system can be identified and independently designed; implemented; deployed and maintained. One functionality that renders itself perfectly to becoming a service is archiving the history of the system state. The design of such a service and our experience of using it are the topic of this article. The service is built with responsibility segregation in mind; therefore; it provides for reducing data processing on the data viewer side and separation of data access and modification operations. The service architecture and the details concerning its data store design are discussed. An implementation of a service client capable of archiving EPICS process variables and LabVIEW shared variables is presented.

Power quality is a critical aspect for correct operation. External and internal disturbances can have significant repercussions causing beam losses or severe perturbations. Mastering the load and understanding how network disturbances propagate across the network is a crucial step for developing the grid model and realizing the limits of the existing installations. Despite the fact that several off-the-shelf solutions for real time data acquisition are available; an in-house FPGA based solution was developed to create a distributed measurement system. The system can measure power and power quality on demand as well as acquire raw current and voltage data on a defined trigger; similar to a distributed oscilloscope. In addition; the system allows recording many digital signals from the high voltage switchgear enabling electrical perturbations to be easily correlated with the state of the network. The result is a scalable system with fully customizable software; written specifically for this purpose.

This innovative system; using state-of-the-art FPGA processors; selects events by applying kinematic and topological requirements on candidate objects (energy clusters; jets; and muons) measured by calorimeters and muon sub-detectors. Since the first-level trigger is a synchronous pipelined system; such requirements are applied within a latency of 200ns. We will present the first results from data recorded using the L1Topo trigger; these demonstrate a significantly improved background event rejection; thus allowing for a rate reduction without efficiency loss. This improvement has been shown for several physics processes leading to low-pT leptons; including H->tau tau and J/Psi->mu mu. In addition; we will discuss the use of an accurate L1Topo simulation as a powerful tool to validate and optimize the performance of this new trigger system.

One of the available technologies is the scintillator; which is generally coupled with a photomultiplier and pulse amplifier. The detector acquisition chain is not stationary; mainly; it changes its gain as a function of the temperature and the nuclear irradiation on the photomultiplier; therefore it needs to be periodically calibrated during its operation. A calibration method reported in the literature is based on the use of a pulsed LED that flashes on the photomultiplier by generating a train of reference pulses. A new technique may be the use of an LED with continuous sinusoidal intensity emission. This provides as an output of the detector chain a small sinusoidal signal which can be digitally processed in real time; by measuring the gain and the delay time of the detector chain. Moreover; this sinusoidal background signal can be removed in real-time; before any processing or storage of data.

Prior to replacing the system; we planed to examine the performance of the new system at an RF test stand. An AMC digitizer and a RTM vector modulator were introduced. A feedback control function was reproduced in the FPGA of the digitizer. We also adopted EtherCAT for relatively slow control; such as a motor control for cavity tuner and monitoring of a vacuum pressure. In addition to developing the new hardware of MTCA.4; we were developing a new data acquisition system and a new MQTT based messaging system for an integrated control framework of SPring-8 and SACLA; the X-ray free electron laser facility. To prove feasibility of new control system; it was implemented at the RF test stand. As the result of high power RF operation; we achieved demanding stability of RF in the cavity. We also confirmed that new software framework was enough to control LLRF system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA081,597

The changes do not happen overnight; but when they happen they may require profound changes across the handling systems. Central timings (CT); responsible for sequencing and synchronization of accelerators; are good examples of such systems. This paper shows how over the past twenty years the changes and new requirements influenced the evolution of the CTs. It describes experience gained from using the CBCM CT model; for strongly coupled accelerators; and how it led to a design of a new Dynamic Beam Negotiation (DBN) model for the AD and ELENA accelerators; which reduces the coupling; increasing accelerator independence.

To increase signal to noise ratio between the two beam polarisations and increase temporal resolution the beamline is fed by two separate IDs that are typically configured with opposite handed polarisations. A chicane of steering magnets with programmable power supplies is used to provide 10 Hz switching between the two photon beams by producing a dynamic closed bump that alternates the on-axis trajectory of the electron beam between the two IDs. In order to maintain the closed bump and make the switching transparent to the rest of the photon beamlines the phase and amplitude of the sine functions applied to the chicane magnets must be exactly correct. In this paper the linear scheme that was used to correct the residual 10 Hz orbit distortion is presented. Future work that uses the fully programmable nature of the magnet power supply controllers to correct high order distortions is also discussed.,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha118_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha118.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha118_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA118,682

We have developed a new control system of a magnet power supply to work with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The control PLC handles the status of the interlock signals between a power supply and a magnet; and monitors the output voltage and the current. The PLC also controls a programmable reference voltage to regulate the output current. In addition; we have been developing an automatic orbit-correction program with the control system of the magnet power supply. The previous data of the beam profile monitors located on the upstream side of the beam dump and the temperature distribution on the beam dump show a possibility of the automatic correction of the beam orbit to the beam dump. The optimized current for the horizontal steering magnet was calculated from the horizontal displacement of the proton beam measured with the beam profile monitors.

Tele-manipulation tasks are often required on dated radioactive devices which were not conceived to be maintained and handled using standard one arm robotic solutions. Robotic platforms with a level of dexterity that often requires using two robotic arms with a minimum of six degrees of freedom are instead needed for these purposes. In this paper; the control of a novel robust robotic platform able to host and to carry safely a dual-arms robotic system is presented. The arms and the vehicle controls are fully integrated in order to guarantee simplicity to the operators during the realization of the robotic tasks.

The motion control system of the Target Wheel presents engineering challenges; such as: velocity and phase stability requirements to precisely align individual tungsten sectors with proton bunches from the accelerator; a high moment of inertia due to the composition and distribution of mass on the wheel; limitations on the physical space to integrate control components; and components for associated safety systems; and; some components being exposed to a high radiation environment. The motion control system being prototyped employs components that satisfy the constraints on the physical space and radiation environment.

The gateway consists of EM functions that interact with IOCs using Channel Access (CA) protocol corresponding to EPICS commands such as caget; caput and camonitor. We can build the gateway for the target EPICS device by editing the EM configuration file; without any programming. We have applied the gateway to the Libera Brilliance+ installed in the SPring-8 storage ring for the evaluation towards the SPring-8 upgrade project. In addition; it has been applied to the Libera Brilliance Single Pass and Spark installed in beam transport line; and the Libera Spark and Cavity installed in SACLA. The gateway brings us the benefits to minimize the installation time and effort even for the different platform (CPU and OS) devices. We will report on the development and advantage as well as the performance improvement of the MADOCA-to-EPICS gateway.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha149_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha149.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha149_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA149,755

However; today's mass systems are of a very static nature. Fully changing the control process requires a high amount of expensive manual efforts and is quite error prone. Hence; flexibility will become a key factor in the future control systems. The adoption of web services and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) can provide the requested capability of flexibility. Since the adaptation of SOAs to automation systems has to face time-constrained requirements; particular attention should be paid to real-time web services for deterministic behaviour. This paper proposes a novel framework for the integration of a Time-Constrained SOA (TcSOA) into mass automation systems. Our design enables service encapsulation in filed level and evaluates how real time technologies can be synthesized with web services to enable deterministic performance.,Funding: This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China(61333003) and Science and Technology Development Foundation of China Academy of Engineering Physics (14-FZJJ-0422).,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha152_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha152.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha152_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA152,760

This is possible; and made relatively easy; with the development of HTTP service interfaces to the controls*.

It was created as part of the Mapping project at Diamond Light Source to improve the performance of continuous scanning and make it easier to share code between beamlines. It takes the form of a Python framework which wraps up groups of EPICS PVs into modular ""Blocks"". A hierarchy of these can be created; with the Blocks at the top of the tree providing a higher level scanning interface to GDA; Diamond's Generic Data Acquisition software. The framework can be used as a library in continuous scanning scripts; or can act as a server via pluggable communications modules. It currently has server and client support for both pvData over pvAccess; and JSON over websockets. When running as a webserver this allows a web GUI to be used to visualize the connections between these blocks (like the wiring of EPICS areaDetector plugins).

Less concern about locking techniques and synchronization; and well defined design patterns stand for more focus on the work to be performed inside Cumbia Activities and reliable and reusable software as a result. The user writes Activities and decides when their instances are started and to which thread they belong.

Experience at DESY has shown that it is beneficial for the software quality to use a high level of abstraction from the beginning of a project. Some hardware registers for instance can immediately be treated as process variables if an appropriate library is taking care of most of the error handling. Other parts of the hardware need an additional layer to match the abstraction level of the application.

The Graphical User Interface; the data exchange protocol; the software functionality and the hardware will be illustrated. Compared to traditional platforms for the accelerators console; at INFN-LNS we have developed a new concept of control system and data acquisition framework; based on a data structures server which so far has never been used for supervisory control. We have chosen Redis as a highly scalable data store; shared by multiple and different processes. With such system it is possible to communicate cross-platform; cross-server or cross-application in a very simple way; using very lightweight libraries. A complex and highly ergonomic Graphic User Interface allows to control all the parameters with a user-friendly interactive approach; ensuring high functionality so that the beam operator can visually work in a realistic environment. All the information related to the beamline elements involved in the beam transport; can be stored in a centralized database; with suitable criteria to have a historical database.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha179_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha179.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha179_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA179,846

Native browser technologies are leveraged to avoid installing and managing software on remote clients such as browser plugins; tunnel applications; or an EDM environment. Since standard network ports are used firewall exceptions are minimized. To avoid security concerns from remote users modifying a control system; WEDM exposes read-only access and basic web authentication can be used to further restrict access. Updates of monitored EPICS channels are delivered via a Web Socket using a web gateway. The software translates EDM description files (denoted with the edl suffix) to HTML with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) following the EDM's edl file vector drawing rules to create faithful screen renderings. The WEDM server parses edl files and creates the HTML equivalent in real-time allowing existing screens to work without modification.

When the machine is deemed unavailable for operations; 'blame' is typically assigned to one or more machine sub-systems. With a 'perfect' representation of all possible machine states and all possible fatal alarms it is possible to calculate machine availability and assign blame automatically and thereby remove any bias and uncertainty that might creep in when a human is involved. Any system which attempts to do this must nevertheless recognize the de-facto impossibility of achieving perfection and allow for 'corrections' by a machine coordinator. Such a system for automated availability statistics was recently presented* and we now report on results and improvements following a half year in operation at PETRA-3 and its accelerator chain.; * Duval; Lomperski; Ehrlichmann; and Bobar; ""Automated Availability Statistics""; Proceedings PCaPAC 2016.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha189_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha189.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha189_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA189,876

Collimators are positioned close to the beam using an alignment procedure. Until now they have always been aligned assuming no tilt between the collimator and the beam; however; tank misalignments or beam envelope angles at large-divergence locations could introduce a tilt limiting the collimation performance. This paper describes three different algorithms to automatically align a chosen collimator at various angles. The implementation was tested with and without beam at the SPS and the LHC. No human intervention was required and the three algorithms converged to the same optimal tilt angle.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/tupha204_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/tupha204.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/tupha204_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-TUPHA204,928

This work was undertaken by the team responsible for instrument control; who are in the process of a phased upgrade of instrument control software from a locally developed system (SECI) to an EPICS [2] based one (IBEX [3; 4]). To increase the complexity of the task; parts of the front end needed to be controlled only by an individual instrument beamline; whilst some values needed to be tuned to the best compromise available for all three beamlines. Furthermore; the muon instruments were not ready for an upgrade to a full IBEX system at that time. By combining SECI; IBEX and the Mantid [5] data reduction package the required control and tuning has been achieved.

During motor scans; Incremental encoder signals corresponding to motion as well as analog detector signals are stored using EPICS IOCs. As each input creates a file with different timestamps; the data is first interpolated onto a common time grid. The energy scans are performed by a direct-drive monochromator; controlled with a Power PMAC controller. The motion is programmed to follow the trajectory with speed profiles corresponding to desired data density. The ""pizza-boxes"" that read analog signals are typically set to oversample the data stream; digitally improving the ADC resolution. Then the data is binned onto a energy grid with data spacing driven by desired point spacing.

The Excalibur 1M and 3M are modular detectors comprised of rows of identical stripes. The Odin framework emulates this architecture by operating multiple file writers on different server nodes; managed by a central controller. The low-level control and communication is implemented in a vendor supplied C library with a set of C-Python bindings; providing a fast and robust API to control the detector nodes; alongside a simple interface to interact with the file writer instances over ZeroMQ. The file writer is a C++ module that uses plugins to interpret the raw data and provide the format to write to file; allowing it to be used with other detectors such as Percival and Eiger. At DLS we implement an areaDetector driver to integrate Odin with the beamline EPICS control system. However; because Odin provides a simple HTTP Rest API; it can be used by any site control system.

One of the main difficulties in these solutions is how to make compatible a full custom digital design with a generic interface and the high-level control software. ALBA simplified the development process of electronic instrumentation with the use of Harmony Bus (HB)*. Based on the Self-Describing Bus; developed at CERN/GSI; it creates a bus framework where different modules share timestamped data and generate events. This solution enables the high-level control software in a Single Board Computer or PC; to easily configure the expected functionally in the FPGA and manage the real-time data acquired. This framework has been already used in the new Em# electrometer**; produced within a collaboration between ALBA and MAXIV; that is currently working in both synchrotrons. Future plans include extending the FPGA cores library; high-level functions and the development of a new auto-generation tool able to dynamically create the FPGA configuration file simplifying the development process of new functionalities.; * 'A Generic Fpga Based Solution for Flexible Feedback Systems'; PCaPAC16; paper,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/weapl01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/weapl01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/weapl01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-WEAPL01,

Tuning all these regulation loops is a complex task and the systematic monitoring of them should be done in an automated way to be sure that the overall plant performance is improved by identifying the poorest performing PID controllers. It is nearly impossible to check the performance of a regulation loop with a classical threshold technique as the controlled variables could evolve in large operation ranges and the amount of data cannot be manually checked daily. This paper presents the adaptation and the application of an existing regulation indicator performance algorithm on the LHC cryogenic system and the different results obtained in the past year of operation. This technique is generic for any PID feedback control loop; it does not use any process model and needs only a few tuning parameters. The publication also describes the data analytics architecture and the different tools deployed on the CERN control infrastructure to implement the indicator performance algorithm.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/7dCglp2Pn_c,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/weapl02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/weapl02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/weapl02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-WEAPL02,

However; realisation of multi-dimensional techniques such as tomography and XANES imaging is presently stymied by overheads that occur on a line-by-line basis. At the Australian Synchrotron's XFM beamline; inevitable ""overheads"" can add up to a significant wasted beam time. Therefore; there is a clear need for further optimisation of scan motion to formulate and minimise higher dimensional overheads. Here we outline our approach to realise trajectory scans that are optimised for trajectory tracking accuracy with minimised overhead times. The scan motion is seen as fly-scan lines; and overhead moves between the lines which form a two dimensional raster scan in a transformed geometry. This separation of 'required' and 'overhead' motions has provided an efficient platform for formulating an optimisation problem which is solved to obtain the optimised scan trajectory. The solution known as Rascan; is in operation at the XFM beamline of the Australian Synchrotron since May 2016; resulting in significant gains in throughput; performance and efficiency.",,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/tOAJHUr44i8,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/webpl07_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/webpl07.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/webpl07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-WEBPL07,

We applied these techniques to the development of the UI for the control room of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescopes.

What was learned includes several usability issues dealing with fragmentation and low cohesiveness of the UIs; some gaps; and an excessive number of user actions needed to achieve certain goals.

Based on experiences at LNLS UVX light source along with researches and implementations; we present our new approach to develop user interfaces for beamlines control. On this process; the main tools explored are Python; Qt and some Python libraries: PyQt; PyDM and Py4syn. Powerful resources of these modules and Python straightforward coding guarantee flexible user interfaces: it is possible to combine graphical applications with intelligent control procedures. At UVX; EPICS and Python are software tools already used respectively for distributed control system and control routines. These routines often use Py4Syn; a library which provides high-level abstraction for devices manipulation. All these features will continue at Sirius. More recently PyQt turned out to be a compatible and intuitive tool to build GUI applications; binding Qt to Python. Also PyDM offers a practical framework to expose EPICS variables to PyQt. The result is a set of graphical and control libraries to support new user interfaces for Sirius beamlines.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/wZjOwdMuYyM,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thapl04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thapl04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thapl04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THAPL04,

During the design of the instrument; a precise but static 3D model of the different components is developed. Then comes the exploitation of the instrument of which the control by the Nomad software allows scientific experiments to be performed. Almost all instruments at the ILL have moveable parts often hidden behind radiological protection elements such as heavy concrete walls or casemate. Massive elements of the sample environment like magnets and cryostats must be aligned in the beam. All those devices are able to collide with the surrounding environment. To avoid those types of accident; the instrument moves must be checked by a pre-experiment simulation that will reveal possible interferences. Nomad 3D is the application that links the design and the experiment aspects providing an animated 3D physical representation of the instrument while it moves. Collision detection algorithms will protect the moveable parts from crashes. During an experiment; it will augment the reality by enabling to ""see"" behind the walls.

C2MON's high-availability; redundant capabilities make it particularly suited for a large; geographically scattered context such as CERN. The C2MON platform relies on the Java technology stack at all levels of its architecture. Since end of 2016; CERN offers a platform as a service (PaaS) solution based on RedHat Openshift. Initially envisioned at CERN for web application hosting; Openshift can be leveraged to host any software stack due to its adoption of the Docker container technology. In order to make C2MON more scalable and compatible with Cloud Computing; it was necessary to containerize C2MON components for the Docker container platform. Containerization is a logical process that forces one to rethink a distributed architecture in terms of decoupled micro-services suitable for a cloud environment. This paper explains the challenges met and the principles behind containerizing a server-centric Java application; demonstrating how simple it has now become to deploy C2MON in any cloud-centric environment.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/4NbM1yDO_TM,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thbpl01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thbpl01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thbpl01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THBPL01,

During this process; we have used the experience in HW control gained from the first and second generation of VLT instruments that have been in operation for almost 20 years. The preliminary outcome of this analysis is a library of Statecharts models illustrating the behaviour of some of the most commonly used devices in telescope and instrument control systems. This paper describes the architectural aspects taken into consideration when designing the models such as HW/SW state representation; common/specialized behaviour; and failure management. An extension to Harel's formalism to facilitate reusability by dynamic creation of orthogonal regions is also proposed. The paper details the behaviour of some devices like shutters; lamps and motors together with the rationale behind the modelling choices. A mapping of the models to a concrete implementation using real HW components is suggested.

The service uses the push-pull pattern for data transfer; the publisher-subscriber pattern for data control; and Protocol Buffers for data serialization; having also the option to integrate other serialization options easily. Besides complying with ACS interface definition to be used by ACS components and clients; the service provide an independent API to be used outside the ACS framework.

The controls system of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) consists of more than 500 FECs; each acting as a server providing services to a potentially unlimited number of clients. This can lead to a bottleneck in the system. Heavy traffic can slow down or even crash a system; making it momentarily unresponsive. One mechanism to circumvent this is to transfer the heavy communications traffic to more robust higher performance servers; keeping the load on the FEC low. In this work; we study this client-server problem from a different perspective. We introduce a novel game theory model for the problem; and formulate it into an integer programming problem. We point out its difficulty and propose a heuristic algorithms to solve it.

Officially commissioned as an operational facility on March 21; 2009; NIF is expected to conduct research experiments thru 2039. The 30-year lifespan of the control system presents several challenges in meeting reliability; availability; and maintainability (RAM) expectations. As NIF continues to expand on its experimental capabilities; the control system's software base of 3.5 million lines of code grows with most of the legacy software still in operational use. Supporting this software is further complicated by technology life cycles and turnover of senior experienced staff. This talk will present lessons learned and new initiatives related to technology refreshes; risk mitigation; and changes to our software development and test methodology to ensure high control system availability for supporting experiments throughout NIF's lifetime.,Funding: U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/lSrpMzlHKpM,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thcpl06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thcpl06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thcpl06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THCPL06,

Some of the reasons for this misperception are unclear requirements; lack of functional safety engineering knowledge or incorrect protection functionalities attributed to the BPCS (Basic Process Control System). Occasionally the control engineers are not aware of the hazards inherent to an industrial process and this causes the lack of the right design of the overall controls. This paper illustrates the engineering of the SIS (Safety Instrumented System) and the BPCS of the plasma vapour controls of the AWAKE R&D project; the first proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment in the world. The controls design and implementation refers to the IEC61511/ISA84 standard; including technological choices; design; operation and maintenance. Finally; the publication reveals usual difficulties appearing in such kind of industrial installations and the actions to be done to ensure the proper functional safety system design.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thcpa01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thcpa01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thcpa01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THCPA01,

The main purpose of the Personnel Safety Systems (PSS) at ESS is to protect workers from the facility's ionising prompt radiation hazards; but also identify as well as mitigate against other hazards such as high voltage or oxygen depletion. PSS consist of three systems: the Safety interlock system; the Access control system and the Oxygen deficiency hazard (ODH) detection system. The Safety interlock system ensures the safety functions of the PSS by controlling all hazardous equipment for starting the beam operation and powering the RF-powered units and allowing its operation when personnel is safe.

The complexity comes from the wide geographical distribution and the entangled control/protection functions that are shared across multiple control systems. To ensure safety performance and avoid unnecessary overdesign; a systematic approach should be followed when setting the functional requirements and the associated safety integrity. Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is a method in IEC61511 for assigning the SIL to a safety function. This method is well suited for complex applications and is widely adopted in the process industry. The outputs of the LOPA study provide not only the basis for setting safety functions design objective; but also a reference document for managing system change and determining test scope. In this paper; SLAC credited safety systems are used to demonstrate the application of this semi-quantitative method.

In tuning phase; or when not used by the experimental areas; the beam will be stopped in a dedicated beam dump. To avoid excessive activation of this beam dump; in order to allow human intervention; a safety classified system had been designed to integrate the number of particles dropped in it within each 24 hours time frame. For each kind of beam; a threshold will be defined and as soon as the threshold is reached a beam cut-off will be sent to the machine protection system.

We developed the treatment control system in consideration of a plurality of IEC standards. The system is comprised of the irradiation control sub-system (ICS) and the treatment interlock sub-system (TIS). The irradiation flow was implemented and monitored by firmware in ICS; with the benefit of low latency. Hardware based TIS conducts the calculation of interlock logics. The protection of patients and the machine from hazards could be guaranteed by TIS with high reliability. ICS is integrated into the main timing system; and ICS controls treatment-related sequence of the accelerator complex via the timing system.

On the one hand; such dead times prolong the overall treatment time; but on the other hand they grant possibilities to (retrospectively) validate that the correct amount of protons has been delivered to the correct position. Efforts in faster beam delivery aim to minimize such dead times; which calls for different means of monitoring irradiation parameters. To address this issue; we report on a real-time beam monitoring system that supervises the proton beam position and current during beam-on; hence while the patient is under irradiation. For this purpose; we sample 1-axis Hall probes placed in beam-scanning magnets and plane-parallel ionization chambers every 10 μs. FPGAs compare sampled signals against verification tables - time vs. position/current charts containing upper and lower tolerances for each signal - and issue interlocks whenever samples fall outside. Furthermore; we show that by implementing real-time beam monitoring in our facility; we are able to respect patient safety margins given by international norms and guidelines.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thcpa06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thcpa06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thcpa06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THCPA06,

To generate the high intensity neutrino beam; a high intensity proton beam is extracted from the 30 GeV Main Ring synchrotron to the neutrino primary beamline. In the beamline; one mistaken shot can potentially do serious damage to beamline equipment. To avoid such a consequence; many beamline equipment interlocks which automatically stop the beam operation are implemented. If an interlock is activated; the beam operator references the operation manual; confirms the safety of the beamline equipment and resumes the beam operation. In order to improve the present system; we are developing an expert system for prompt and efficient understanding of the status of the beamline to quickly resume the beam operation. When an interlock is activated; the expert system references previous interlock patterns and infers what happened in the beamline. And the expert system will suggest how to resume the beam operation to the beam operator. We have developed and evaluated this expert system.

To tackle this problem; we applied ontological approach to storing configuration data. Ontology is a formal representation of concepts and relations of the domain of discourse; enriched by rules for inferring assumed knowledge. We designed the ontology that describes the controlling electronics for the double-direction bipolar transfer line K-500; which transports beam from the Injection Complex to colliders VEPP-4 and VEPP-2000 at BINP; Novosibirsk; Russia. We populated the ontology by importing data from existing configuration files of the control system and developed the interface for querying configuration data.

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is the most widely used technique in global closed orbit correction for eigenmode decomposition; mode selection and pseudo-inversion of Orbit Response Matrix (ORM) for robust calculation of corrector magnet strengths. A new faster inversion technique based upon Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) has been proposed for SIS18 ORM exploiting the Circulant symmetry; a class of matrices which can be diagonalized by the DFT using only one row or column of the matrix. The existence of a clear relationship between SVD modes and singular values to DFT modes and coefficients for such matrices has been described. The DFT based decomposition of Circulant ORM gives hints on physical interpretation of SVD and DFT modes of perturbed closed orbit in a synchrotron. As a first practical application; DFT modes were used to provide robustness against sensor failures such as one or two malfunctioning BPMs.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thmpa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thmpa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thmpa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THMPA02,

Instead of binding application services (access to live; database; and archived data; etc.) into monolithic applications using libraries written in C++ or Java; this new method moves those services onto networked processes that communicate with the core applications using the HTTP protocol and a RESTful interface. This allows applications to be built for a variety of different environments; including web browsers and mobile devices; without the need to rewrite existing library code that has been built and tested over many years.

CSS archiver engine retrieves the temperature and humidity data measured by the data loggers via Ethernet. These data are finally stored into the PostgreSQL based database. A new server computer has been recently utilized for the archiver of CSS version 4 instead of version 3. It can drastically improve the speed performance for retrieving the archived data. The long-term beam stability of linac is getting a quite important figure of merit since the simultaneous top up injection is required for the independent four storage rings toward the SuperKEKB Phase II operation. For this reason; we developed a new archiver data management application with a good operability.

These power supplies; sourced from external companies; are integrated into control systems via industry standard OPC servers. The servers are now being modernized. A key lesson learnt from running the previous generation of OPC servers is that vendor specific; black-box implementations can be costly in terms of support effort; particularly in diagnosing problems in large production-site deployments. This paper presents the projects producing the next generation of OPC servers; following an open; collaborative approach and a high degree of homogenization across the independent partners. The goal is to streamline development and support costs via code re-use and a template architecture.

In order to enable a high-performance fault analysis; large amounts of data must be processed effectively. For this purpose a fundamental redesign of the present SQL database was necessary. The VME/VxWorks-driven CAN bus has been used for many years as the main field bus of the DELTA control system. Unfortunately; the corresponding CAN bus I/O modules were discontinued by the manufacturer. Thus; the CAN field bus is currently being replaced by a more up to date Modbus/TCP-IP communication (WAGO); which largely supersedes the VME/VxWorks layer. After hard- and software integration into the EPICS environment; several projects have been realized using this powerful field bus communication. The server migration to a 64-bit architecture was already carried out in the past. By now; all client programs and software tools have also been converted to 64-bit versions.

DISCOS development is based on the adoption of the ALMA Common Software (ACS) framework. During the last two years; besides assisting the astronomical commissioning of the newly-built SRT and enabling its early science program; the control system has undergone some major upgrades. The long-awaited transition to a recent ACS version was performed; migrating the whole code base to 64 bit operative system and compilers; addressing the obsolescence problem that was causing a major technical debt to the project. This opportunity allowed us to perform some refactoring; in order to implement improved logging and resource management. During this transition the code management platform was migrated to a git-based versioning system and the continuous integration platform was modified to accommodate these changes. Further upgrades included the system completion at Noto and the expansion to handle new digital backends.; *Orlati A. et al.

Specifically the addition of a third ion source to the LEBT beamline dictated an expansion of the Virtual Accelerator structure both in the database and the DCU software. The decision to go to a virtual server infrastructure to meet the demands for better redundancy and performance prompted an overhaul of the ACS software and hardware base. Two new redundant virtualization servers and doubled storage systems helped to increase safety and system performance. To take advantage of the newer hardware and 64-bit operating systems; all software was converted to a 64 bit base. Additionally; as a quality of life and security improvement; the download and flash functionality of the ACS were updated to enhance performance and security checks for quality assurance measures. The new virtualization host server and infrastructure hardware in conjunction with the 64 bit update and ensuing efficiency increases have resulted in a safer and significantly faster ACS with higher redundancy in case of hardware failure.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha028_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA028,

After more than 10 years of operation; the beamlines at the Australian Synchrotron are well established and the demand for automation of research tasks is growing. Such tasks routinely involve the reduction of TB-scale data; online (realtime) analysis of the recorded data to guide experiments; and fully automated data management workflows. In order to meet these demands; a generic; distributed workflow system was developed. It is based on well-established Python libraries and tools. The individual tasks of a workflow are arranged in a directed acyclic graph and one or more directed acyclic graphs form a workflow. Workers consume the tasks; allowing the processing of a workflow to scale horizontally. Data can flow between tasks and a variety of specialised tasks is available.

The data are saved continuously during the acquisition in a HDF5 file. The pyDART (Python Data Analysis Real Time) program is the post-processing tool that enables a fast analysis of the data acquired with REALTA.

Due to a shallow and rigid dependency management; the strong modularity principle of the framework cannot be exploited for packaging; installation and deployment. Moreover; life-cycle control of its components does not comply with standardized system-based mechanisms. These problems are shared by other instrument-based distributed systems. The new high-availability requirements of modern projects; such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array; tend to be implemented as new software features due to these problems; rather than using off-the-shelf and well-tested platform-based technologies. We present a general solution for high availability strongly-based on system services and proper packaging. We use RPM Packaging; oVirt and Docker as the infrastructure managers; Pacemaker as the software resource orchestrator and life-cycle process control through Systemd. A prototype for ACS was developed to handle its services and containers.,Funding: Centro Científico Tecnológico de Valparaíso (CONICYT FB-0821) Advanced Center for Electrical and Electronic Engineering (CONICYT FB-0008),reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha045_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha045.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha045_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA045,

This option requires many ~100m long HV cables but removes the requirement of radiation hard boards. That solution simplifies the control system of the HV regulation cards (called HVRemote). It consists of a Detector Control System (DCS) node linked to 256 HVRemote boards through a tree of Ethernet connections. Each HVRemote includes a smart Ethernet transceiver for converting data and commands from the DCS into serial peripheral interface (SPI) signals routed to SPI-capable devices in the HVRemote. The DCS connection to the transceiver and the control of some SPI-capable devices via Ethernet has been tested successfully. It was fabricated a test board (HVRemote-ctrl) with the interfacing sub-system of the HVRemote. It is being tested through SPI-interfaces and several devices were already validated.

To meet this demand; MAX IV have joined a collaboration with ALBA to develop an electrometer that will ensure low current measurement capabilities and seamless integration into our Tango control system.   The electrometers 4 independent channels can measure accurately in the fA range. Many devices produce larger currents and only need low sample rate. To make the electrometer more flexible; MAX IV have therefore developed a multiplexer with 8 independent channels. The multiplexer is both powered and controlled by the electrometer through its multipurpose IO interface. At most; an electrometer can control 4 multiplexers simultaneously giving a system with 32 channels; but the number of multiplexers can be chosen freely. The offset current introduced by the multiplexer is 45 pA and the noise is 3 pA. The offset is eliminated by settings in the electrometer. Current sweeps shows that currents steps as small as 10 pA can easily be measured and that switching time between channels before a steady signal is achieved is limited by the filter needed by the electrometer and not the multiplexer.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha070_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha070.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha070_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA070,

In previous systems; based on signal model architecture; the master frequency was distributed using a direct analog signal and delayed at each target where the triggers were required. However; such strategy has proven to be extremely expensive and non-scalable. In the event-based model; the data stream is generated at a continuous rate; synchronously with the master clock oscillator of the accelerator. This strategy improves the flexibility for tuning the trigger parameters remotely and reduces the costs related to maintenance tasks. On the other hand; the absence of the pure RF signal distributed in the experimental stations implies much more complexity in the performance of time-resolved experiments.

Since even very short interruption or glitch in the reference signal might break the precise synchronisation between subsystems; it is desirable to minimize probability of such events. While master oscillators often have a hot-spare to speed-up recovery after a failure; whether switched manually or electronically; it does not save from time-consuming resynchronisation. Our experience from testing and commissioning E-XFEL 1.3 GHz Master Oscillator (MO) shows that a struggle to achieve demanding phase-noise requirements might negatively impact reliability of the system. In this paper we present an approach which allows for quick switching between independent reference generation channels while maintaining continuity of the output signal.

In order to prevent non-optimal beam delivery; an interlock patient safety system (PaSS) was implemented that interrupts the treatment if any sub-system reports an error. To ensure correct treatment; the PaSS needs to be thoroughly tested as part of the regular quality assurance as well as after each change. This typically required weeks of work; extensive beam-time and may not comprehensively detect all possible failure modes. With the opportunity of the installation of a new gantry; an automated PaSS test stand was developed that can emulate the rest of the facility. It consists of a NI PXI chassis with virtually unlimited IOs synchronously stimulated or sampled at 1MHz; a set of adapters to connect each type of interfaced signal and a runtime environment. We have also developed a VHDL based formal language to describe stimuli; assertions and specific measurements. We present the use of our test stand in the verification and validation of the PaSS; showing how its full quality assurance; including report generation was reduced to minutes.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha098_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha098.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha098_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA098,

Entrance into the interlocked zones from the outside is allowed only via a small number of access points. These are no longer made of doors which have left their place to turnstiles and then to mantraps or Personnel Access Devices (PAD). Originally meant for high security zones; the commercially available PADs have a number of CERN-specific additions. This paper presents in detail the purpose and characteristics of each piece of equipment constituting the access devices and its integration within the personnel protection system. Key concepts related to personnel safety (e.g. interlocked safety tokens; patrols) and to access control (e.g. access authorisation; biometric identity verification; equipment checks) are introduced and solutions discussed. Three generations of access devices are presented; starting from the LHC model put in service in 2008; continuing with the PS devices operational since 2014 and finally introducing the latest model under development for the refurbishment of the SPS Personnel Protection System.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha099_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha099.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha099_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA099,

This equipment is complemented by specialised personal protective devices in case of specific hazards related to the remnant radiation or the presence of cryogenic fluids. These complex devices monitor the environment in the vicinity of the user and warn the user of the presence of hazards such as radiation or oxygen deficiency. The use of the devices is obligatory; but currently only enforced by procedures. In order to improve the safety of the personnel it has been proposed to verify that users are carrying their devices switched on when entering. This paper describes the development of a specialised multi-protocol terminal; based on Texas Instruments digital signal processor and integrated in the personnel protection system.

In order to fulfill the necessary safety functions; the TSS continually monitors critical parameters within target station systems. If any parameter exceeds an acceptable level; the TSS actuates contactors to cut power to components at the front end of the accelerator and prevent the beam from reaching the target. The TSS is classified as a safety structure; system and component; relevant for the safety of the public and the environment. As such; it requires the highest level of rigor in design and quality for interlock systems at the ESS. Standards are applied to provide a guideline for building the TSS architecture and designing in resistance to single failures and common cause failures. This paper describes the system architecture and design of the TSS; including interfaces with target station and accelerator systems; and explains how the design complies with authority conditions and requirements imposed by development standards.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha105_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha105.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha105_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA105,

As an extension of the new interlock; a new dose rate monitoring system has been developed using PIN diodes and self-made ion chambers. These detectors will be used to perfom online dose rate measurements in order to switch automtically the status of illuminated radiation protection panels; which show the current level of protection area.

The risk assessments have shown a large palette of potential hazards (radiological; electrical; chemical; laser; etc.) that need to be properly mitigated in order to ensure the safety of personnel working inside these areas. A Personnel Protection System; typically; accomplishes this goal by implementing a certain number of heterogeneous functionalities as interlocks of critical elements; management of a local HMI; data monitoring and interfacing with RFID badge readers. Given those requirements; reducing system complexity and costs are key parameters to be optimized in the solution.

In order to maintain phase stability the CLARA gun requires a precision water temperature control system to maintain a gun cavity temperature within 0.028°C. This is achieved by mixing two water circuits with temperatures close to the desired set point. Two temperature measurement systems were evaluated for precision and reliability; the resultant system uses a single Omron PLC which provides all the precision read back and control loops. High resolution input modules and averaging achieve precision temperature monitoring while two PID loops control the coarse and fine temperature control.

When modelling the sensor system with a net-work of linear time-invariant passive components; and a state-based representation based on first-order differential equations; we identify two internal dynamical states isolated from each other by the parasitic resistance in the transformer windings. They are the parasitic capacitance voltage across the transformer's windings; and the transformer inductor current. These states are typically imperfectly observed due to noise; component value variance; and sensor component network topology. We will discuss how feedback-based Kalman State Estimation implemented within digital signal-processing might be employed to reduce negative impacts of noise along with component variance; and how Kalman Estimation might also optimize the conflicting goals of beam-pulse facsimile waveform fidelity together with preservation of fre-quency domain information.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha128_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha128.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha128_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA128,

This is an important improvement; since the oscillating signal within the bandwidth 500-700 MHz; is related to losses of a beam bunch. The losses can be reduced by measuring the frequency and classifying the cause of the oscillations. The PXI-5661 is used to carry out spectral analysis of this signal.

It opens multiple TCP/IP connections to the PLC hardware; manages asynchronous communication to read/write PLC Datablocks and acts as a server for other clients. The upgrade of PLCServer is based on Snap7**** open source Ethernet communication suite for interfacing with Siemens PLCs using the S7 native protocol.

Due to its high knowledge and resource demand; the use of model checking is restricted mainly to core parts of highly critical systems. However; we and many other authors have argued that automated model checking of PLC programs is feasible and beneficial in practice. In this paper we aim to explain why model checking is applicable to PLC programs even though its use for software in general is too difficult. We present an overview of the particularities of PLC programs which influence the feasibility and complexity of their model checking. Furthermore; we list the main challenges in this domain and the solutions proposed in previous works.,,E. Blanco Vinuelapresenter,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha159_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha159.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha159_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA159,

The software quality assurance becomes a key point to ensure the reliability of the control systems. Static code analysis is a relatively easy-to-use; simple way to find potential faults or error-prone parts in the source code. While static code analysis is widely used for general purpose programming languages (e.g. Java; C); this is not the case for PLC programs. We have analyzed the possibilities and the gains to be expected from applying static analysis to the PLC code used at CERN; based on the UNICOS framework. This paper reports on our experience with the method and the available tools and sketches an outline for future work to make this analysis method practically applicable.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha160_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha160.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha160_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA160,

Standards like IEC 61508 provide guidelines and recommend the use of formal methods for that purpose. The ITER Interlock Control System has been designed to protect the tokamak and its auxiliary systems from failures of the components or incorrect machine operation. ITER has developed a method to assure that some critical operator commands have been correctly received and executed in the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The implementation of the method in a PLC program is a critical part of the interlock system. A methodology designed at CERN has been applied to verify this PLC program. The methodology is the result of 5 years of research in the applicability of model checking to PLC programs. A proof-of-concept tool called PLCverif implements this methodology.

DIP is a rudimentary data exchange protocol with a very flat and short learning curve and a stable specification. It also lacks support for access control; smoothing or data archiving. This paper presents a mechanism which has been implemented to keep track of every single publisher or subscriber node active in the DIP infrastructure; along with the DIP name servers supporting it. Since DIP supports more than 55; 000 publications; regrouping hundreds of industrial control processes; keeping track of the system activity requires advanced visualization mechanisms (e.g. connectivity maps; live historical charts) and a scalable web-based interface** to render this information is essential.; * W.

A new technology which got standardized during recent years in software industry are so-called reactive streams. Libraries implementing this standard provide a rich set of operators to manipulate; combine and subscribe to streams of data. However; the usual focus of such streaming libraries are applications in which those streams complete within a limited amount of time or collapse due to errors. On the other hand; in the case of a control systems we want to have those streams live for a very long time (ideally infinitely) and handle errors gracefully. In this paper we describe an approach which allows two reactive stream styles: ephemeral and long-living. This allows the developers to profit from both; the extensive features of reactive stream libraries and keeping the streams alive continuously.

When storing such data as nested hashtables or lists; the ability to do structural operations or calculations along an arbitrary dimensions is hampered. Tensorics is a Java library to provide a solution for these problems. A Tensor is a n-dimensional data structure; and both structural (e.g. extraction) and mathematical operations are possible along any dimension. Any Java class or interface can serve as a dimension; with coordinates being instances of a dimension class.

FESA designs are defined in an XML document which is validated against a schema to enforce framework constraints; and are used to automatically generate C++ boilerplate code in which the developer can then implement specific code. Design files can rapidly grow in complexity making the overview of the resulting system almost impossible to understand. One way to overcome this is to benefit from a graph-based representation of the design; with XML fragments summarized into logical blocks and association between the blocks depicted by arrows. As the intricacy of the graph is analogous to a potential complex design; it is also essential to provide an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for parameterising and editing the graph generation in order to fine-tune a simpler and cleaner illustration of a FESA design.

Triggered by the deprecation of Java's Swing toolkit; the JavaFX toolkit has been adopted for the creation of new GUIs; and is foreseen for future migration of Swing-based GUIs. To increase homogenisation and encourage modular coding of JavaFX GUIs; libraries have been developed to standardise accelerator context selection; provide inter-component GUI communication and optimise data streaming between the control system and modules that make up an expert GUI. This paper describes how this has allowed the use of model-view-controller techniques and naming conventions via Maven archetypes.

The original goal was to communicate; via websockets with a PandABox in order to allow a user to examine and set attributes of numerous functional blocks within the instrument. With the continuing maturity of the JavaScript language; in particular the release of ES6; along with the availability of off-the-shelf reactive open-source JavaScript libraries; such as Facebook's React and Node.js; a rich set of tools and frameworks have entered the arena of user interface development suitable for control systems. This paper describes the design decisions based on these tools; experiences and lessons learned during and after the development process and the possibilities for future development as a generic; adaptable framework for instrument and control system user interfaces.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha184_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha184.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha184_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA184,

The main goal of this tool is to perform spectroscopy analysis without delays on the large amount of data that will be generated on Balder beamline at Max IV *. ParSeq was developed using Python and PyQt and can be operated via scripts or graphical user interface (GUI). The pipeline is consisted of nodes and transforms. Each node generally has a common group of components: data manager (also serves as legend); data combiner; metadata viewer; transform dialog; help panel and a plot window (from silx library **) as main element. The transforms connect nodes; applying the respective parameters in the active data. It is also possible to create cross-data linear combinations (e.g. averaging; RMS or PCA) and propagate them downstream. Calculations will be done with parallel execution on GPU. The GUI is very flexible and user-friendly; containing splitters; dock widgets; colormaps and undo/redo options.

The LCLS Machine Protection System (MPS) contains thousands of inputs and hundreds of protection interlocks. The inputs and logic configuration are defined in SQLite database files. Real-time state information is hosted by EPICS signals. Control room operators use a Graphical User Interface (MPSGUI) to view and manage faults. The MPSGUI provides a wealth of useful information; from hardware input details to high-level logic flow; but it was difficult for operators to take advantage of this. The workflow required cross-referencing between several screens. This poster presents the greatly improved workflow and usability of the MPSGUI. The requested improvements were defined in meetings between the MPS controls team and the control room operators.

The thermosiphon operates over a height of 90 metres and is integrated into the CERN UNICOS system and the ATLAS detector control system (DCS). The cooling system uses custom ultrasonic instrumentaton to measure very high coolant vapour flow (up to 1.2 kg/second); to analyse binary gas mixtures and detect leaks. In these instruments ultrasound pulses are transmitted in opposite directions in flowing gas streams. Pulse transit time measurements are used to calculate the flow rate and the sound velocity; which - at a given temperature and pressure - is a function of the molar concentration of the two gases. Gas composition is computed from comparisons of real-time sound velocity measurements with a database of predictions; using algorithms running in the Siemens SIMATIC WinCC SCADA environment.

Neutrons are produced by a pulsed proton beam from the PS directed to a lead target. In a typical experiment; a sample is placed in the neutron beam and the reaction products are recorded. The typical output signals from the nTOF detectors are characterized by a train of pulses; each one corresponding to a different neutron energy interacting with the sample. The Data Acquisition System (DAQ) has been upgraded in 2014 and is characterized by challenging requirements as more than hundreds of 12 or 14-bit channels at a sampling frequency of 1 GS/s and 1.8 GS/s acquired simultaneously every 1.2 s for up to 100 ms.

This is typically done manually and is very time-consuming. With the FAIR project the complexity of the facility increases furthermore and for efficiency reasons it is recommended to establish a high level of automation. Modern Accelerator Control Systems allow a fast access to both; accelerator settings and beam diagnostics data. This provides the opportunity together with the fast-switching magnets in GSI-beamlines to implement evolutionary algorithms for automated adjustment. A lightweight python interface to CERN Front-End Software Architecture (FESA) gave the opportunity to try this novel idea; fast and easy at the CRYRING@ESR injector. Furthermore; the python interface facilitates the work flow significantly as the evolutionary algorithms python package DEAP could be used.

Small variations in pitch and roll angles and translational shift between center of rotation and center of detector can cause large deviations in the captured sinogram; resulting in a degraded 3D image. Most of the popular reconstruction algorithms are based on previous adjustments of the sinogram ray offset before the reconstruction process. This work presents an automatic method for shift and angle adjust of the center of rotation (COR) before the beginning of the experiment removing the need of setting geometrical parameters to achieve a reliable reconstruction.

To identify and ensure sufficient control of the dynamic behaviour of all subcomponents in the proto-type; an implementation in MATLAB/Simulink Real-Time environment in a Speedgoat Real-Time Perfor-mance Machine was developed. This approach enables rapid prototyping; by allowing a shared environment for system modeling and testing.

Many advanced beamline systems; such as a new high-dynamic double crystal monochromator (HD-DCM); are under development for Sirius; the new machine under construction in Brazil. Among the expected performance challenges in such applications; complex coordinated movements during flyscans/continuous scans; hardware synchronization for pumpÂ­-and-Â­probe experiments and active noise suppression are goals to be met. Two architectures are proposed to cover general-purpose and advanced applications. The HD-DCM controller was implemented in a MATLAB/Simulink environment; which is optimized for RCP. Hence; its software must be adapted to a more cost-effective platform. One candidate controller is the NI cRIO. The portability of both MATLAB and NI PXI; the present standard control platform at LNLS; codes to cRIO is evaluated in this paper. Control resolution; acquisition rates and other factors that might limit the performance of these advanced applications are also discussed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/thpha215_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/thpha215.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/thpha215_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-THPHA215,

The future SKA project chose the TANGO controls technology stack. However; MeerKAT and phase 1 of the SKA-mid telescope are intimately related: SKA-mid will be co-located with MeerKAT at the SKA SA Karoo site; the first SKA-mid prototype dishes will be tested using MeerKAT systems; MeerKAT will later be incorporated into SKA-mid. To aid this interoperation; TANGO to KATCP and KATCP to TANGO translators were developed. A translator process connects to a device server of protocol A; inspects it and exposes an equivalent device server of protocol B. Client interactions with the translator are proxied to the real device. The translators are generic; needing no device-specific configuration. While KATCP and TANGO share many concepts; differences in representation fundamentally limits the abilities of a generic translator. Experience integrating TANGO devices into the MeerKAT and of exposing MeerKAT KATCP interfaces to TANGO based tools are presented.

Topics to be addressed include: - HDF5 on multiple-platforms and multiple versions - Use of additional definition standards like NeXus - New tools like HDFql; news on h5py; viewers; 3rd party libraries - Tuning and optimising for High Performance detector systems and HPC - Experiences and plans for use of new features such as Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR); Virtual Dataset (VDS) and Direct Chunk Write.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/Y-1MONyU9Gk,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/frbpl05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/frbpl05.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/frbpl05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-FRBPL05,
icalepcs2017,,FRBPL06,Control System Cybersecurity Workshop,"CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Today's accelerator and detector control systems do not differ significantly from the control systems used in industry or devices being part of the ""Internet-of-Things""(IoT). Modern Information Technologies(IT) are commonly used; control systems are based more and more on common-of-the-shelf hardware/software(VME crates; PLCs; VxWorks; LynxOS; network switches; networked controls hardware; SCADA; commercial middleware; etc.) or Windows/Linux PCs. Furthermore; due to the academic freedom in the High Energy Physics community; control systems are produced in a wide; decentralized community; which leads to heterogeneous systems and often necessitates remote access. With this adoption of modern IT standards; control systems are also exposed to the inherent vulnerabilities of the corresponding hardware and software. The consequences of a security breach in an accelerator or detector control system might be severe; and attackers won't ignore HEP systems just because it's HEP. The series of (CS)2/HEP workshops is intended to share and discuss counter-measures; to review configuration and development procedures for secure control systems; and to review the progress since the last (CS)2/HEP workshop",,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/vx3mlzM5eYg,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/frbpl06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/frbpl06.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/frbpl06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-FRBPL06,

Its purpose is to get feedback from attendees to make the workshop as interesting and as pleasurable as possible. This group will remain alive after the workshop to be the input for the future ICALEPCS MOCRAF meeting. The aim of the workshop is to be helpful to you the community and so we welcome input (*) on the content and style. After the previous workshop in at ICALEPCS in Melbourne it was suggested that more time should be put aside for interactive group discussions. We are proposing two talks per session each of around 15 to 20 minutes leaving 50 - 60 minutes for relevant discussion topics.

icalepcs2017,,FRBPL08,Sardana - Scientific SCADA Suite,ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron; Cerdanyola del Vallès; Spain; Sardana (www.sardana-controls.org) is an open source; python software suite for Supervision; Control and Data Acquisition in scientific installations. This workshop will demonstrate how to build a complete laboratory control system from scratch. After a quick guide on how to install and configure the Sardana system the workshop participants will start from learning the generic interfaces of the most common laboratory equipment exposed by the device Pool. Afterwards some practical example of how to integrate a new hardware into Sardana will be demonstrated. In continuation a basic course on how to write and execute the user procedures; called macros; will be given. Finally; it will be demonstrated how easy it is to build a modern and flexible graphical interface to the laboratory instruments using Taurus library (www.taurus-scada.org). Furthermore an example on how to mix different data sources in the same GUI will be shown with the how to write a custom Taurus scheme tutorial.,,Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/QY49oFlW6nU,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/talks/frbpl08_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/papers/frbpl08.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2017/posters/frbpl08_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2017-FRBPL08,
