        "responsibility for controls design and fabrication was transferred to SLAC from LBNL to promote commonality with the rest of the LCLS-II control subsystems. Collaboration between the LBNL APEX controls community and SLAC LCSL-II controls team proved vital in advancing the controls architecture toward standardized implementations integrated with the rest of LCLS-II. An added challenge was a decision to commission the injector ~1.5 years ahead of the rest of the machine",

The SXR line is comprised of 21 variable gap undulator segments separated by an interspace stands with a cam positioning system capable of positioning in 5 degrees of freedom (DOF). The undulator segment motion control utilizes the Aerotech Ensemble motion controller through an EPICS Soft IOC (input-output controller). Its drive system consists of a Harmonic Drive servo system with feedback from two absolute full-gap encoders. Additional Aerotech motion controllers are used to control the cam-positioning system and phase shifters of the interspace stand. The HXR line is comprised of 32 undulator segments each including an integrated interspace assembly. The segment girder is placed on two stands with a similar cam-positioning system as in the SXR line allowing for movement in 5 DOF. As one of the design goals of the HXR line was to reuse the original LCLS girder positioning system",

The beam commissioning was focused on the most important working parameters in order to optimize the beam production performance taking into account the ESS accelerator requirements. The development of a MATLAB custom code able to interact with the EPICS control system framework was needed to optimize the short time available for the beam commissioning. The code was used as an additional high level control system layer able to change all source parameters and read all beam diagnostics output data. More than four hundred of thousand configurations have been explored in a wide range of working parameters. The capability to connect Matlab to EPICS enabled also the developing of a genetic algorithm optimization code able to automatic tune the source towards a precise current value and stability. A dedicated graphical tool was developed for the data analysis. Unexpected benefit come out from this approach that will be shown in this paper.",

It consists of a Detector Control System (DCS) node linked to 256 HVRemote boards through a tree of Ethernet connections. Each HVRemote includes a smart Ethernet transceiver for converting data and commands from the DCS into serial peripheral interface (SPI) signals routed to SPI-capable devices in the HVRemote. The DCS connection to the transceiver and the control of some SPI-capable devices via Ethernet has been tested successfully. It was fabricated a test board (HVRemote-ctrl) with the interfacing sub-system of the HVRemote. It is being tested through SPI-interfaces and several devices were already validated. A next version adds a few more ADC/DAC devices for checking their suitability for the final design."

Testing of all systems using the real superconducting cavities would be very expensive and in case of a failure can lead to serious damages. To lower the testing cost and avoid potential risks it is planned to design and build a device that simulates the behavior of a superconducting cavity. The cavity simulator will utilize fast data converters equipped with an RF front-end and a digital signal processing unit based on a high performance FPGA.

The ITER Interlock Control System has been designed to protect the tokamak and its auxiliary systems from failures of the components or incorrect machine operation. ITER has developed a method to assure that some critical operator commands have been correctly received and executed in the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The implementation of the method in a PLC program is a critical part of the interlock system. A methodology designed at CERN has been applied to verify this PLC program. The methodology is the result of 5 years of research in the applicability of model checking to PLC programs. A proof-of-concept tool called PLCverif implements this methodology. This paper presents the challenges and results of the ongoing collaboration between CERN and ITER on formal verification of critical PLC programs."

Jenkins continuous integration system is the server used to run the automated tests together with Git and Docker as the supporting tools to the process. In addition to the aforementioned tools we also use an Automated Qualification Framework (AQF) which is an in-house developed software that automates as much as possible of the functional testing of the Control and Monitoring (CAM) software. The AQF is invoked from Jenkins by launching a fully simulated CAM system and executing the Integrated CAM Tests against this simulated system as CAM Regression Testing. The advantages and limitations of the automated testing will be elaborated in the paper in detail."

The Streaming Pool framework provides a comfortable way to transform arbitrary signals from devices into long-living reactive streams. The combination of these two concepts provides a powerful tool to describe modules for online analysis. In this paper we describe this approach",

        "The Front-End Software Architecture (FESA) framework is the basis for most real-time software development for accelerator control at CERN. FESA designs are defined in an XML document which is validated against a schema to enforce framework constraints",
        "and are used to automatically generate C++ boilerplate code in which the developer can then implement specific code. Design files can rapidly grow in complexity making the overview of the resulting system almost impossible to understand. One way to overcome this is to benefit from a graph-based representation of the design",
        "with XML fragments summarized into logical blocks and association between the blocks depicted by arrows. As the intricacy of the graph is analogous to a potential complex design",
        "it is also essential to provide an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for parameterising and editing the graph generation in order to fine-tune a simpler and cleaner illustration of a FESA design. This paper describes such a GUI (FESA Graph Editor) and outlines how it benefits the design and documentation process of the FESA-design-document."

The thermosiphon operates over a height of 90 metres and is integrated into the CERN UNICOS system and the ATLAS detector control system (DCS). The cooling system uses custom ultrasonic instrumentaton to measure very high coolant vapour flow (up to 1.2 kg/second)",

        "which is fully integrated into the PSI control system. The tool is implemented as a set of user friendly graphical user interface applications dealing with particular magnet measurement techniques supported at PSI",
        "which include Hall probe",

        "and moving wire methods. The core of each application is the state machine software developed by magnet measurement and control system experts. Applications act as very efficient assistants to the magnet measurement personnel by monitoring the whole measurement process on-line and helping to react in a timely manner to any possible operational errors. The paper concentrates on the PCT structure and its performance."

The aim is to create a modular system based on commercial hardware components. Because of the convincing hardware interfacing and good experience with PXI devices we choose this as hardware platform and LabVIEW as software development system. Starting in late 2015",
        "we developed a framework with modules for configuration",

        "standard commissioning tools as well as specialised instrument setups. It is integrated into the metadata catalogue system (ICAT) of the HZB in terms of collecting log and meta data and storing those according to the data policy of the institute. We will present an overview of the system features in general and a specific instrument view of a rather complex beamline at HZB."
