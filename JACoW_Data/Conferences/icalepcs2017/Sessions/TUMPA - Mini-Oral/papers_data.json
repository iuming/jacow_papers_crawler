        "The Korea multi-purpose accelerator complex (KOMAC) has two beam extraction points at 20 and 100 MeV for proton beam utilization. High availability should be achieved through high system reliability and short maintenance times to prevent and mitigate damage. A machine protection system is essential for avoiding damage leading to long maintenance times. KOMAC MPS that was developed using analog circuit interlock box has its limit to cover increasing interlock signals and modify interlock logic. The disadvantage has been solved with digital-based system for more efficient logic modification and interlock extension. The MPS is configured remotely using the EPICS-based application. In this paper",
        "we present KOMAC machine protection architecture and performance results of the new machine protection system."

        "The European XFEL is a 3.4km long X-ray Free Electron Laser. The accelerating structure consists of 96 cryo modules running at 1.3 GHz with 10 Hz repetition rate. The injector adds two modules running at 1.3 and 3.9 GHz respectively. The cryo modules are operated at 2 Kelvin. Cold compressors (CCs) pump down the liquid Helium to 30 mbar which corresponds to 2 Kelvin. Stable conditions in the cryogenic system are mandatory for successful accelerator operations. Pressure fluctuations at 2 K may cause detuning of cavities and could result in unstable CC operations. The RF losses in the cavities may be compensated by reducing the heater power in the liquid Helium baths of the nine cryogenic strings. This requires a stable readout of the current RF settings. The detailed signals are read out from several severs in the accelerator control system and then computed in the cryogenic control system for heater compensation. This paper will describe the commissioning of the cryogenic control system",
