      "abstract": "The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a Partnership of 17 European Nations committed to the goal of collectively building and operating the world's leading facility for research by use of neutrons by the second quarter of the 21st Century. The strive for innovation and the challenges that need to be overcome in order to achieve the requested performances pushed towards the adoption of one of the newest standards available on the market. ESS has decided to use MicroTCA as standard platform for the systems that require high data throughput and high uptime. The implications of this choice on the architecture of the systems will be described with emphasis on the data acquisition electronics. Talk as video stream: https://youtu.be/warsqk8bwJs",

        "The optical-link remote I/O system OPT-VME that consists of a VME master and several kinds of slave boards is widely used in SPring-8 and SACLA. As the next generation low-end platform instead of the outdated VMEbus",
        "a Linux PLC such as Yokogawa e-RT3 has been considered. We have developed an e-RT3-based master module OPT-PLC to fully utilize a large number of existing remote boards. In the original system",
        "low-level communication is performed by FPGA and high-level communication procedures are handled in the Solaris device driver on a VME CPU board. This driver becomes a barrier to port the system to e-RT3 platform. OPT-PLC should be handled by the e-RT3 standard driver in the same manner as other e-RT3 I/O modules. To solve the difficulty",
        "OPT-PLC was equipped with Xilinx SoC and the high-level communication procedures were implemented as application software on ARM Linux in the SoC. As the result",
        "OPT-PLC can be controlled through the standard e-RT3 driver. Furthermore",
        "the system will be ported to other platform like PCI Express by replacing bus interface block in the PL part. This paper reports on our development as an approach to maximize cross-platform portability using SoC."

The platform is based on a FPGA responsible of acquisition and synchronization where a real-time protocol between the modules has been implemented (Harmony) [*]. The data acquired is transmitted via PCIe to a Single Board Computer with an embedded Linux distribution where high level processing and synchronization with upper levels of Control System is executed.
