WR is a backwards compatible extension of Ethernet and IEEE 1588 (aka Precise Time Protocol). The WR collaboration typically conducts workshops where users and core developers present their progress and applications. In this ICALEPCS pre-conference workshop",
        "we would like to take a slightly different approach. We would like to make this a tutorial workshop",
        "meaning that somebody who has never been exposed to WR technology should walk out of the workshop with a very good idea of how to use WR to solve real life problems",

The aim of the workshop is to be helpful to you the community and so we welcome input (*) on the content and style.
