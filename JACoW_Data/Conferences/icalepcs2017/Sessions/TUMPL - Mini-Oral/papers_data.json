        "The LINAC Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) is an upgrade of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory LCLS facility to a superconducting LINAC with multiple destinations at different power levels. The challenge in delivering timing to a superconducting LINAC is dictated by the stability requirements for the beam power and the 1MHz rate. A timing generator will produce patterns instead of events because of the large number of event codes required. The poster explains how the stability requirements are addressed by the design of two Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). The Allow Table GUI filters the timing pattern requests respecting the Machine Protection System (MPS) defined Power Class and the electron beam dump capacities. The Timing Pattern Generator (TPG) programs Sequence Engines to deliver the beam rate configuration requested by the user. The low level program",
        "The TPG generates the patterns",
        "which contains the timing information propagated to the Timing Pattern Receiver (TPR). Both are implemented with an FPGA solution and configured by EPICS. The poster shows an overall design of the high-level software solutions that meet the physics requirements for LCLS-II timing."

The control system is based on Tango and Sardana for managing the main elements of the beamline. Data acquisition and experiment control is done through MXCuBE v3, which interfaces with the control layer. Currently, the most critical elements such as the detector and diffractometer are already integrated into the control system, whereas the integration of the sample changer has already started. BioMAX has received its first users, who successfully collected diffraction data and provided feedback on the general performance of the control system and its usability. The present work describes the main features of the control system and its operation, as well as the next instrument integration plans",
