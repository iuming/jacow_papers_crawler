It will be one of a small number of cornerstone observatories around the world that will provide astrophysicists and cosmologists with a transformational view of the Universe. Two major goals of the SKA is to study the history and role of neutral Hydrogen in the Universe from the dark ages to the present-day",

LCLS-II operates in CW mode with a bunch repetition rate of 1 MHz compared to the pulsed 120 Hz operation at LCLS-I. Tuning and optimization of the beam requires single bunch measurement of beam parameters at up to the full beam rate. We rely on FPGA-based embedded controls and data processing to handle this high bandwidth of data. The presentation will give an overview of the major global systems including the timing and machine protection systems as well as detailing the individual diagnostics for beam position",

A major challenge is to keep the present ring operating 24x7 while designing and pre-constructing all the elements of the new ring.
