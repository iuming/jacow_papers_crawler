        "The ESRF timing system",
        "dating from the early 90's and still in operation",
        "is built around a centralized RF driven sequencer distributing synchronization signals along copper cables. The RF clock is broadcasted over a separate copper network. White Rabbit",
        "offers many attractive features for the refurbishment of a synchrotron timing system",
        "the key one being the possibility to carry RF over the White Rabbit optical fiber network. CERN having improved the feature to provide network-wide phase together with frequency control over the distributed RF",
        "the whole technology is now mature enough to propose a White Rabbit based solution for the replacement of the ESRF system",
        "providing flexibility and accurate time stamping of events. We describe here the main features and first performance results of the WHIST module",
        "an ESRF development based on the White Rabbit standalone SPEC board embedding the White Rabbit protocol and a custom mezzanine (DDSIO) extending the FMC-DDS hardware to provide up to 12 programmable output signals. All WHIST modules in the network run in phase duplicates of a common RF driven sequencer. A master module broadcasts the RF and the injection trigger."

        "employing available hardware functionalities to implement complex and varying operational demands and provide them in the control system has its own challenges. After a brief introduction to the new MRF hardware this paper describes operational aspects of the SwissFEL timing and related control system applications. We describe a new technique for beam rate control and how this scheme is used for the machine protection system (MPS). We show how a well thought modular software-side design enables us to maintain various rep rates across the facility and allows us to implement complex triggering patterns with minimum development effort. We also discuss our timestamping method and its interface to the beam synchronous data acquisition system. Further we share our experience in timing network installation",

The phase drift of the signal is detected based on Michelson interference and is then compensated with optical methods. The dispersion drift is corrected by appropriative dispersion compensating fiber. The system design and the test results in the lab are demonstrated in the paper."

Deterministic network calculus (DNC) can derive upper bounds on message delivery latencies. This paper presents an approach for calculating worst-case descriptors of runtime traffic patterns. These so-called arrival curves are deduced from specified partial traffic sequences and are used to calculate end-to-end traffic properties. With the arrival curves and a DNC model of the FAIR CS network",
