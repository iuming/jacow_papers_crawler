        "Safety is likely the most critical concern in many process industries",
        "yet there is a general uncertainty on the proper engineering to reduce the risks and ensure the safety of persons or material at the same time of providing the process control system. Some of the reasons for this misperception are unclear requirements",
        "lack of functional safety engineering knowledge or incorrect protection functionalities attributed to the BPCS (Basic Process Control System). Occasionally the control engineers are not aware of the hazards inherent to an industrial process and this causes the lack of the right design of the overall controls. This paper illustrates the engineering of the SIS (Safety Instrumented System) and the BPCS of the plasma vapour controls of the AWAKE R&D project",

Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is a method in IEC61511 for assigning the SIL to a safety function. This method is well suited for complex applications and is widely adopted in the process industry. The outputs of the LOPA study provide not only the basis for setting safety functions design objective",
