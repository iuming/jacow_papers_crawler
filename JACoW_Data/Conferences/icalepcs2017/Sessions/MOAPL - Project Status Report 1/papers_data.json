        "The European XFEL (E-XFEL) is a 3.4 km long X-ray Free-Electron Laser facility and consists of a superconducting",
        "linear accelerator with initially three undulator beam lines. The construction and installation of the E-XFEL is being completed this year and commissioning is well underway. First photon beams are expected to be available for early users in the second half of 2017. This paper will focus on the control system parts for the linear accelerator with its more than 7 million parameters and highlight briefly its design and implementation. Namely the hardware framework based on the MicroTCA.4 standard",
        "testing software concepts and components at real and virtual accelerator facilities and a well-established method for integrating high-level controls into the middle layer through a shot-synchronized data acquisition allowed for a rapid deployment and commissioning of the accelerator. Status and experiences from a technical and an operational point-of-view will be presented."

        "many new system control and diagnostic capabilities have been commissioned for operational use to maximize the scientific value produced. With NIF expecting to be operational for greater than 20 years focus has also been placed on optimizing the software processes to improve the sustainability of the control system. This talk will report on the current status of each of these areas in support of the wide variety of experiments being conducted in the facility."

The close interaction of experiment and accelerator components as well as the pulsed electron beam required a well thought out integration of the control system including some new concepts and layouts.
