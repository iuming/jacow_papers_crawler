One of the main difficulties in these solutions is how to make compatible a full custom digital design with a generic interface and the high-level control software.

        "the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) cryogenic system employs about 4900 PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) regulation loops distributed over the 27 km of the accelerator. Tuning all these regulation loops is a complex task and the systematic monitoring of them should be done in an automated way to be sure that the overall plant performance is improved by identifying the poorest performing PID controllers. It is nearly impossible to check the performance of a regulation loop with a classical threshold technique as the controlled variables could evolve in large operation ranges and the amount of data cannot be manually checked daily. This paper presents the adaptation and the application of an existing regulation indicator performance algorithm on the LHC cryogenic system and the different results obtained in the past year of operation. This technique is generic for any PID feedback control loop",
        "it does not use any process model and needs only a few tuning parameters. The publication also describes the data analytics architecture and the different tools deployed on the CERN control infrastructure to implement the indicator performance algorithm."
