        "in the BEPCII",
        "the fault of the magnet power supply front-end electronics devices may cause accelerator energy instability and even lead to beam loss. Therefore",
        "it is very necessary to diagnose and locate the device fault accurately and rapidly",
        "that will induce the high cost of the accelerator operation. Faults diagnosis can not only improve the safety and reliability of the equipment",
        "but also effectively reduce the equipment's cycle costing. The multi-signal flow model proposed by Pattipati K.R is considered as the preferred method of industrial equipment faults detection. However",
        "there are still some problems about fault probability conflict in the processing of correlation matrix diagnosis due to the hierarchical nature of multi-signal flow modeling. Thus we develop the fault diagnosis strategy based on the important prior knowledge of the fault. This method is applied to the front-end electronic devices of BEPCII magnet power supply control system and improves the fault diagnosis and analysis ability of magnet power supply control system."

Three classes of telescopes with different mirror size will be located in the northern and southern hemispheres. The ASTRI mini-array of CTA preproduction is one of the small sized telescopes mini-arrays proposed to be installed at the CTA southern site. The ASTRI mini-array will consist of nine units based on the end-to-end ASTRI SST-2M prototype already installed on Mt. Etna (Italy). The mini-array software system (MASS) supports the end to end ASTRI SST-2M prototype and miniarray operations. The ASTRI software integration team defined the procedures to perform effectively the integration test and release activities. The developer has to properly use the repository tree and branches according to the development status. We require that the software includes also specific sections for automated tests and that the software is well tested (in simulated and real system) before any release. Here we present the method adopted to release the first MASS version to support the ASTRI SST-2M prototype test and operation activities. * conforti@iasfbo.inaf.it",

        "CERNs Accelerator Fault Tracking (AFT) system aims to facilitate answering questions like: \"Why are we not doing Physics when we should be?\" and \"What can we do to increase machine availability?\" People have tracked faults for many years, using numerous, diverse, distributed and un-related systems. As a result, and despite a lot of effort, it has been difficult to get a clear and consistent overview of what is going on, where the problems are, how long they last for, and what is the impact. This is particularly true for the LHC, where faults may induce long recovery times after being fixed. The AFT project was launched in February 2014 as collaboration between the Controls and Operations groups with stakeholders from the LHC Availability Working Group (AWG). The AFT system has been used successfully in operation for LHC since 2015, yielding a lot of attention and generating a growing user community. In 2017 the scope has been extended to cover the entire Injector Complex. This paper will describe the AFT system and the way it is used in terms of architecture, features, user communities, workflows and added value for the organisation."

        "For the new FAIR accelerator complex at GSI the settings management system LSA is used. It is developed in collaboration with CERN and until now it is executed strictly serial. Nowadays the performance gain of single core processors have nearly stagnated and multicore processors dominate the market. This evolution forces software projects to make use of the parallel hardware to increase their performance. In this thesis LSA is analyzed and parallelized using different parallelization patterns like task and loop parallelization. The most common case of user interaction is to change specific settings so that the accelerator performs at its best. For each changed setting",
        "LSA needs to calculate all child settings of the parameter hierarchy. To maximize the speedup of the calculations",
        "they are also optimized sequentially. The used data structures and algorithms are reviewed to ensure minimal resource usage and maximal compatibility with parallel execution. The overall goal of this thesis is to speed up the calculations so that the results can be shown in a user interface with nearly no noticeable latency."

The tool is a response to a growing demand for smart solutions in the supervision and analysis of control systems data. Large scale data analytics is a rapidly advancing field",
        "but simply performing the analysis is not enough; the results must be made available to the appropriate users (for example operators and process engineers). The tool can report data analytics for objects such as valves and PID controllers directly into the SCADA systems used for operations. More complex analyses involving process interconnections (such as correlation analysis based on machine learning) can also be displayed. A pilot project is being developed for the WinCC Open Architecture (WinCC OA) SCADA system using Hadoop for storage. The reporting tool obtains the metadata and analysis results from Hadoop using Impala",
        "but can easily be switched to any database system that supports SQL standards."

A calibration method reported in the literature is based on the use of a pulsed LED that flashes on the photomultiplier by generating a train of reference pulses. A new technique may be the use of an LED with continuous sinusoidal intensity emission. This provides as an output of the detector chain a small sinusoidal signal which can be digitally processed in real time",

The sensitivity of the sensor is -34 dBm and the dynamic range 48 dB. The slaves are battery powered for easy installation. Special care has been taken to minimize the power consumption resulting in battery life to be 4-13 months using 3xAAA batteries. The footprint of the module is 60x100x40 mm. The communication between the master and the slaves uses a Wireless Link operating at the 868 MHz ISM band. The system is controlled by EPICS using the StreamDevice driver.

To increase signal to noise ratio between the two beam polarisations and increase temporal resolution the beamline is fed by two separate IDs that are typically configured with opposite handed polarisations. A chicane of steering magnets with programmable power supplies is used to provide 10 Hz switching between the two photon beams by producing a dynamic closed bump that alternates the on-axis trajectory of the electron beam between the two IDs. In order to maintain the closed bump and make the switching transparent to the rest of the photon beamlines the phase and amplitude of the sine functions applied to the chicane magnets must be exactly correct. In this paper the linear scheme that was used to correct the residual 10 Hz orbit distortion is presented. Future work that uses the fully programmable nature of the magnet power supply controllers to correct high order distortions is also discussed.",

The control PLC handles the status of the interlock signals between a power supply and a magnet",

The previous data of the beam profile monitors located on the upstream side of the beam dump and the temperature distribution on the beam dump show a possibility of the automatic correction of the beam orbit to the beam dump. The optimized current for the horizontal steering magnet was calculated from the horizontal displacement of the proton beam measured with the beam profile monitors. This paper reports the current status of the power supply control system which can automatically correct the horizontal beam position at the beam dump."

A multiple power supplies control through network including real time control is now operational at ESRF. It manages 4 power supplies to generate 3 waveforms defined with 3x1600 values in a setpoint file. The power supplies states are managed by PLCs. The ramping waveforms are managed by a real time program running on a FPGA board. And a high level control on top of them is assumed by a TANGO multiple classes system.

        "and JSON over websockets. When running as a webserver this allows a web GUI to be used to visualize the connections between these blocks (like the wiring of EPICS areaDetector plugins). This paper details the architecture and design of framework",

Experience at DESY has shown that it is beneficial for the software quality to use a high level of abstraction from the beginning of a project. Some hardware registers for instance can immediately be treated as process variables if an appropriate library is taking care of most of the error handling. Other parts of the hardware need an additional layer to match the abstraction level of the application. Like this development cycles can be shortened and the code is easier to read and maintain because the logic focuses on what is done",

All components of the beamline, including the motorisation, vacuum and diagnostic elements, were integrated into the TANGO-based control system, which through the SARDANA layer also managed the collection of diffraction and fluorescence data from one- and two-dimensional detector channels. Hardware-synchronised continuous scanning (‘‘fly-scanning'') of the sample, mounted on a piezo stage, was achieved using a system built around a standard pulse generator and acquisition board controlled by a dedicated TANGO device. SARDANA macros were used to configure and execute the continuous scanning, and position data from the piezo controller were buffered in synchronization with triggers sent to the detectors, with all data subsequently written to HDF5 files. After successful initial operation, the system is currently being revised and expanded for the users expected in 2018.",

      "abstract": "Diagnostics of beam parameters is vital for the operation of any particle accelerator and contributes to the precision of the physics experiments. At COoler SYnchrotron of the Forschungszentrum Jülich there are several beam instrumentation subsystems with data acquired and processed in real-time for machine and operator use to ensure safe and efficient performance. Here are presented current development for the Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) with regard to usage of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to achieve fast data processing and integration into the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) used at COSY. Also presented is a way to create and run Graphical User Interfaces based on EPICS variables with Control System Studio (CSS) connected to a data archiving system to display and use previously collected data.",
