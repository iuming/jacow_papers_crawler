HF2014,,THP1H2,A New Paradigm: Role of Electron-positron and Hadron Colliders,ITP-PKU; Beijing; People's Republic of China; In 2012; a light scalar boson (denoted as H(125) in this paper) was discovered at the LHC. We explore the possible correlation between the lightness of H(125) and the smallness of CP-violation based on the Lee model; namely the spontaneous CP-violation two-Higgs-doublet-model. It is a new way to understand why H(125) is light. Based on this we propose that it is the much heavier scalar bosons; instead of the H(125); which need to be understood. This opens a new paradigm that one tries to understand the electro-weak symmetry breaking and CP violation. For the new paradigm; similar to many other physics beyond the standard model; one need both electron-positron and higher energy hadron collider; as well as the low energy experiments; in order to pin down the whole picture.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/HF2014/talks/thp1h2_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/HF2014/papers/thp1h2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/HF2014/posters/thp1h2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HF2014-THP1H2,1

HF2014,,THT4B2,Single Ring Multibunch Operation and Beam Separation,Cornell University (CLASSE); Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; New York; USA; The counter-circulating electrons and positrons in a circular Higgs Factory have to be separated everywhere except at the N* intersection points (IP).

HF2014,,THT5A1,Energy Consumption and Savings Potential of CLIC,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; High-energy accelerators have developed into large machines consuming tens of MW electrical power; thus making the energy bill a major component of their operating costs and eventually of their acceptability by society. With several new projects under study beyond the Large Hadron Collider (LHC); and projections of rising electricity prices by energy agencies; this trend is expected to grow into a critical issue for future machines. Clearly identified in the conceptual design of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC); the concern was addressed by studying power consumption and energy efficiency in the different accelerator systems and energy management in diverse operating scenarios compatible with the physics objectives *. The study triggered specific developments; in the laboratory and in industry; aiming at improving efficiency of technical components or subsystems; as well as first investigations of energy recovery potential. We present analytical estimates of CLIC power consumption and paths being explored to improve its energy efficiency along the four lines of sobriety; efficiency; energy management and waste heat recovery.; * Ph.

This large circular collider would allow the Higgs boson to be studied with greater precision than at the much smaller Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. However; several hundreds of MW wall power is needed to run such a huge machine. With the development of China nuclear power; a huge amount of long-lived nuclear waste needs to be safe disposed. The nuclear waste can be safely disposed by Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System (ADS) and provide electric power at the same time. Both CEPC and ADS are based on the superconducting accelerator technology and the power of the CEPC can be fully covered by the ADS. A green CEPC running in China is possible in the future.; ESS; Lund; Sweden; IIIEE; Lund; Sweden; Throughout history; scientific advancement has been dependent upon advances in the technologies of research. Modern accelerator science also has massive (and increasing) energy needs; yet the very provision of secure; equitable; clean and cost effective energy is one of the greatest sustainability challenges facing society. Modern energy provision systems are fundamental to development; yet also constitute one of the greatest threats to sustainability via their contribution to environmental degradation and climate change. This discussion works from a premise that any new proposal for investment in an RI should credibly demonstrate that it will deliver more value than cost to society.

We discuss the effect of beamstrahlung and maximum achievable luminosities at different FCC-ee energies: Z; W; H; tt.

Aside from two strong focusing systems and a low-emittance lattice in acrs that are required to achieve a factory luminosity of 1.0×1034cm-2s-1; a large momentum aperture of 2% is absolutely necessary to mitigate the effect of beamstrahlung and retain an adequate beam lifetime. This turns out to be the most challenging aspect in the design.

HF2014,,SAT1B1,Synchrotron Radiation Issues for the CEPC IR,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Synchrotron radiation from the high-energy electron and positron beams is a primary concern for both the detector and the machine in the interaction region area of the CEPC collider. Radiation from bending magnets as well as focusing magnets must be investigated; modeled and traced. The power from these sources is quite high and can be a problem for both the detector and the accelerator if they are not carefully controlled. I will show preliminary calculations of the synchrotron radiation generated by the current design.; INFN/LNF; Frascati (Roma); Italy; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The loss of beam particles has to be well under control in high energy and high luminosity e+e− colliders 'namely Higgs Factories- especially at the interaction regions. In the design stage the main beam related effects causing particle losses need to be studied in details by means of full simulation to check that machine induced background rates are tolerable for the experiments and; if not; conceive an efficient collimation system to intercept particles that would eventually be lost in the Interaction region (IR). These studies can also give a realistic evaluation of beam lifetime. We will review how main beam backgrounds have been handled at SuperB and DAΦNE and we will mention the LEP experience.

The method is based on a magnetic spectrometer; but does not require absolute knowledge of its bending field. Inverse Compton scattering of laser radiation on the electron beam provides accurate calibration of the bending force. Due to scattering kinematics; the beam energy determination is based on the laser wavelength together with accurate measurement of the ratio of deflection angles. The approach has no serious limitations in the electron beam energy range. The same apparatus allows to measure the electron beam polarization.; E.B. Levichev; S.A. Nikitin; BINP SB RAS; Novosibirsk; Russia; Possibility to monitor beam energy in FCCee with an accuracy of ~10-4 using Compton scattering on a waveguide wave is under consideration. Methods based on interaction of a beam with circularly polarized ""soft photons"" and ""hard photons"" for obtaining beam polarization; proposed and theoretically substantiated in the past but not yet approved anywhere; are discussed in regard to parameters of FCCee.",,In this paper we deal with aspects of transverse polarization for the purpose of energy calibration of proposed circular colliders like the FCC-ee and the CEPC. The main issues of such a measurement will be discussed. The possibility of using this method to accurately determine the energy at the WW threshold as well as the Z peak will be addressed. The use of wigglers for reducing long polarization times will be discussed and a possible strategy will be presented for minimising the energy uncertainty error in these large machines. Longitudinal Polarization and Acceleration of Polarized Beams The paper describes a scheme of creation of the longitudinally polarized electron beam at the collision point of the future FCC-ee collider. A scheme is based on use of two 90-degrees spin rotators placed in appropriate points of the interaction region. The solenoid type spin rotators are proposed to use for that purpose. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach are discussed.
