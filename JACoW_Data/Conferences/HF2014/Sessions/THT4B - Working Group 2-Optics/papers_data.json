        "the separation has to be horizontal. This paper considers only head-on collisions at N*=2 IP's",

Very high beamstrahlung effects at high energies and the beam-beam limit at low energies request emittance parameters that rise with decreasing beam energy. This talk will present the status of the lattice design and the lattice modifications needed to achieve the requested emittance parameters.",
