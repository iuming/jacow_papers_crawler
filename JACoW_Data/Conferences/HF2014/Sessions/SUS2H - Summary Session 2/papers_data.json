        "Beijing. The first section was dedicated to the overall consideration of optics in circular Higgs factory (CHF)",
        "and the existing designs from IHEP and CERN. The second one focused on single-particle beam dynamics",
        "in particular dynamic aperture in SuperKEKB and CHF. The third session was a joined one together the working group 3: interaction region (IR) and machine detector interface. The topic was final focus system (FFS) and local chromatic compensation. Three approaches by IHEP",
        "CERN",
        "and BINP were presented. In the final session we had a discussion of beamstralung",
