      "abstract": "In this paper we deal with aspects of transverse polarization for the purpose of energy calibration of proposed circular colliders like the FCC-ee and the CEPC. The main issues of such a measurement will be discussed. The possibility of using this method to accurately determine the energy at the WW threshold as well as the Z peak will be addressed. The use of wigglers for reducing long polarization times will be discussed and a possible strategy will be presented for minimising the energy uncertainty error in these large machines. Longitudinal Polarization and Acceleration of Polarized Beams The paper describes a scheme of creation of the longitudinally polarized electron beam at the collision point of the future FCC-ee collider. A scheme is based on use of two 90-degrees spin rotators placed in appropriate points of the interaction region. The solenoid type spin rotators are proposed to use for that purpose. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach are discussed.
