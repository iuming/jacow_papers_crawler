        "At high energies",
        "one of the main factors limiting the luminosity of electron-positron colliders is beamstrahlung",
        "which affects the energy spread",
        "bunch length and beam lifetime. We discuss the effect of beamstrahlung and maximum achievable luminosities at different FCC-ee energies: Z",
        "W",
        "H",
        "tt. At \"low\" energies (Z",
        "W)",
        "the luminosity can be increased several times if the Crab Waist scheme is used. At \"high\" energies (H",
        "tt) Crab Waist and Head-on collisions are of equal efficiency.",

        "People's Republic of China",
        "In this paper",
        "parameter optimization of Higgs factories is discussed focusing on the designs of CEPC and FCCee. The total beam current in Higgs factories is limited by synchrotron radiation power",
        "and then the machine size and cost; maximum linear tune shift is limited by beam-beam interaction; reduction of beta-function at interaction point is restricted by the distance of the final focusing quadrupole to the interaction point",
        "bunch length",
        "'hour glass' effect and dynamic aperture. Beamstrahlung effects beam energy spread and lifetime in the colliders",
        "limiting luminosity reach. High luminosity in the Higgs factories requires optimization of parameters.",

        "For precise beam energy measurements at the FCC the use of resonant depolarization has been suggested. The time constant of self-polarization (Sokolov-Ternov effect)",
        "which in such a large ring is 14 hours even at 80 GeV (WW resonance)",
        "is the first issue. This time can be greatly reduced by inserting proper wigglers in the machine lattice. The resulting large beam energy spread however may destroy polarization in presence of unavoidable magnet misalignments. This calls for precise machine alignment and careful orbit correction. In this paper the possibility of polarization in the FCC in presence of wigglers is investigated and first calculations are presented.",
