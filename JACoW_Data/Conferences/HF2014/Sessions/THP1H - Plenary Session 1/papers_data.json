        "In 2012",
        "a light scalar boson (denoted as H(125) in this paper) was discovered at the LHC. We explore the possible correlation between the lightness of H(125) and the smallness of CP-violation based on the Lee model",
        "namely the spontaneous CP-violation two-Higgs-doublet-model. It is a new way to understand why H(125) is light. Based on this we propose that it is the much heavier scalar bosons",
        "instead of the H(125)",
        "which need to be understood. This opens a new paradigm that one tries to understand the electro-weak symmetry breaking and CP violation. For the new paradigm",
        "similar to many other physics beyond the standard model",
        "one need both electron-positron and higher energy hadron collider",
        "as well as the low energy experiments",
        "in order to pin down the whole picture."
