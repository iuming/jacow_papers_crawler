        "The beam-induced background expected at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) will impose stringent requirements on the interaction region design and also the detector performance. Therefore the background should be carefully evaluated with dedicated simulation studies",
        "which would eventually provide guidance for the detector design as well as the technologies suitable for the detecting systems. In this article",
        "preliminary results on the dominant background of pair-production are presented."
