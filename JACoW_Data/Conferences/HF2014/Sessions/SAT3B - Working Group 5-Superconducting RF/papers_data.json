Recent tuner systems have significantly advanced at many laboratories and a number of tuner technologies now exist for a variety of requirements. We will review those tuner systems and discuss applicability. The second issue is stability of cavity operation. The SRF systems for the Higgs factory must have as low trip rate as possible. Maintenance work is necessary to keep the trip rate at low level. The SRF cavity design that takes into account the ease of maintenance is required. Operational experience of KEKB is an useful example for practical considerations. The third issue is performance degradation and its recovery method. In a long-term operation",
