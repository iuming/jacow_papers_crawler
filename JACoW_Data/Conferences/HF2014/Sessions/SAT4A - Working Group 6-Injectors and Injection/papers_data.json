        "Top-off injection was developed in PEP-II from the linac injector to allow constant luminosity with the BaBar detector being fully operational during injection. The electron beam top-off was developed first as its lifetime was the shortest and thus made the luminosity nearly constant. Second",
        "the positron beam top-off was developed make the luminosity fully constant. Either electrons or positron could be injection up to 30 Hz if needed",
        "deciding pulse-by-pulse which beam (bunch) was desired. Technical details of PEP-II top-off will be presented. The implications for top-off into a circular Higgs factory will also be discussed.",

        "the parasitic crossings reduce the acceptance for horizontal betatron stacking of injected particles. Furthermore",
