        "A design of the interaction region optics from the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamics and dynamic aperture limitation is discussed. We suggest the first order tune-amplitude shift as a figure-of-merit to characterize the power of nonlinear perturbation caused by different sources including the kinematic term",

        "octupole field error in QD0 and chromatic sextupoles. Theoretical prediction is compared with the tracking results. Dynamic aperture limited by different nonlinearities is presented and analyzed."
