        "Higgs factories are designed with very low beta at IP and low emittance. Since chromaticity becomes very high",
        "momentum acceptance is limited. Energy spreading due to Beamstrahlung is serious issues for Higgs factories. We discuss energy spread and tail caused by beamstrahlung and requirement for the momentum acceptance.",

        "The magnets of the very final focus are among the most challenging devices of a collider. They must be very compact to leave empty space for the surrounding detectors still providing strong focusing power together with excellent field quality not to degrade the beam line dynamic aperture. Being all placed very close one respect each other and well inside the detector (which is usually a magnetic spectrometer) several strategies to compensate the cross talk of the leaking field and the coupling introduced by the detector field had been recently proposed and some are now in the construction phase. In this paper I will shortly review these novel compensation techniques",
