Currently two interaction region designs are being developed by CERN and BINP using different approaches to the definition of baseline parameters. Both preliminary designs are presented with the aim of highlighting the challenges the FCC-ee is facing.",

Crab waist interaction region provides collisions with luminosity higher than 2×1036~cm-2sec-1 at beam energy of 45~GeV. The small values of the beta functions at the interaction point and distant final focus lenses are the reasons for high nonlinear chromaticity limiting energy acceptance of the whole ring.
