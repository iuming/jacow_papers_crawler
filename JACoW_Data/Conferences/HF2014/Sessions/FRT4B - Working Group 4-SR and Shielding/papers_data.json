        "The circular electron positron collider (CEPC) has been proposed by IHEP. Two 120GeV beams circulate around the 54km accelerator rings",
        "which produce intense synchrotron radiation with photon energies up to a few of mega-electron volts. It is very important to analysis the source of synchrotron radiation. Two techniques of designing vacuum chamber which are contained Al covered by Pb and total by Cu are put forward to protect sensitive machine components. A Monte-Carlo program called MCNP has been used to calculate dose rate",
        "heat and energy spectrum of synchrotron radiation in the tunnel in former two designing cases. The results including dose rate",
        "heat and energy spectrum which performed in various components of the CEPC are shown in this article.",

        "HFs are not as extreme as some existing SR light sources",
        "for which cooling and pumping solutions have been conceived and validated. The main problem with HFs is their sheer size",
