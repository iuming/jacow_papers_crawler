        "We discuss beam-beam limit in Higgs factories for luminosity limit and beam lifetime. Higgs factory is very high energy circular collider. The damping time is order of 100 turns. A high beam-beam tune shift (~0.1) is achieved in LEP",
        "and is adopted as design value based on the experience. We now review this point",
