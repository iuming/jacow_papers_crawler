Most Input/Output Controllers (IOCs) installed along the 3 km beamline at SuperKEKB are developed with only two kinds of CPU module. In addition to providing standard IOC for individual hardware",
            "we develop some beam operation system which promotes the beam commissioning. The alarm monitoring system",

It obviously promotes the beam commissioning at those rings. The other highlight is the precisely synchronized control system. It is necessary to realize the highly complicated control of beam injection process. We configure the dedicated network with the Event Timing System and the distributed shared memory. The distant hardware components are synchronously operated with this network. The beam commissioning of SuperKEKB has been started in 2016. The control system supports its fruitful beam operation without serious problem."

This paper presents a new way of building a large experimental device control system using web technology instead of EPICS toolkit. The goal is to improve the interoperability of the control system allowing different component in the control system to talk to each other effortlessly. An abstraction of the control system is made. The control system components are abstracted into resources. The accessing of the resources is done via standard HTTP RESTful web API. HMI is based on HTML and JavaScript in browsers. Web Socket is used for event distribution. The main feature of this design is that all interfaces in the system are based on open web standards",

            "At a time when virtually all accelerator control systems were custom developments for each individual laboratory",
            "an idea emerged from a meeting between the Los Alamos National Laboratory developers of the Ground Test Accelerator Control System and those tasked to design the control system for the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. In a joint effort",
            "the GTACS toolkit concept morphed into the beginnings of a powerful toolkit for building control systems for scientific facilities. From this humble beginning the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) Collaboration quickly grew. EPICS is now used as a framework for control systems for scientific facilities on seven continents. The EPICS Collaboration started from a dedicated group of developers with very different ideas. This software continues to meet the increasingly challenging requirements for new facilities. This paper is a retrospective look at the creation and evolution of a collaboration that has grown for thirty years",
            "with a look ahead to the future."

            "The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project is an international effort to build two radio interferometers in South Africa and Australia to form one observatory monitored and controlled from the global headquarters (GHQ) in the United Kingdom. The project is very close to the end of its design phase and many decisions have already been made like the adoption of the Tango-controls framework. The time from the end of the design phases and the beginning of the construction has been called bridging with the goal of promoting CI-CD practices. CI-CD is an acronym for Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery and/or continuous deployment. CI is the practice of merging all developers’ local (working) copies into the mainline very often (at least daily). Continuous delivery is the approach of developing software in short cycle ensuring that it can be released anytime",
            "and continuous deployment is the approach of delivering the software frequently and automatically. The present paper analyzes the decision taken by the system team (a specialized agile team for continuous practices in the Safe framework) for promoting those practices within the Tango-controls framework."

The current method for aligning collimators is semi-automated requiring a collimation expert to monitor the loss signals and continuously select and update the threshold accordingly. The human element in this procedure is a major bottleneck for speeding up the alignment. This paper therefore proposes a method to fully automate this threshold selection. A data set was formed from previous alignment campaigns and analyzed to define an algorithm that produced results consistent with the user selections. In over 90% of the cases the difference between the two was negligible and the algorithm presented in this study was used for collimator alignments throughout 2018."

            "in our case a flat X-ray mirror system. Several diagnostic devices and actuators can be selected according to the specific experimental area where a beam position feedback is needed. In this contribution",
            "we analyze the improvement of pointing stability of X-rays using different diagnostic devices as an input source for our feedback system. Different types of photon diagnostic devices such as gas-based X-ray monitors [4]",
            "quadrant detectors based on avalanche photo diodes [5] and optical cameras imaging the X-ray footprint on scintillator screens have been evaluated in our pointing stability studies."

Beam Containment System (BCS) is employed to limit the beam power and prevent excessive radiation in case of electron beam loss or FEL breach. Fast and slow shut-off paths are designed for devices with different response requirements. The system is required to shut-off the beam within 200 µs for some of the fast sensors. Fast path is based on custom electronic designs",

Device-related parameters like register addresses and data types are configurable in the EPICS record database making the support module independent of the hardware and the application.

          "abstract": "The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next generation ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy at very-high energies. CTA will consist of two large arrays with 118 Cherenkov telescopes in total, deployed in Paranal (Chile) and Roque de Los Muchachos Observatories (Canary Islands, Spain). The Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) system provides the means to execute observations and to handle the acquisition of scientific data in CTA. The Resource Manager & Central Control (RM&CC) sub-system is a core element in the ACADA system. It implements the execution of observation requests received from the scheduler sub-system and provides infrastructure services concerning the administration of various resources to all ACADA sub-systems. The RM&CC is also responsible of the dynamic allocation and management of concurrent operations of up to nine telescope sub-arrays, which are logical groupings of individual CTA telescopes performing coordinated scientific operations. This contribution presents a summary of the main RM&CC design features, and of the future plans for prototyping.",

The use of non-transparent bridges in PCI systems supporting intelligent adapters in enterprise and multiple processors in embedded systems is a well established technology.

This can be ported to the PCI Express standard by replacing one of the transparent switches on the PCI Express switch with a non-transparent switch.

As evidence of this, the last call issued addressed 10 beamlines. As of summer 2019, MAX IV has reached a point where 11 beamlines simultaneously have shutters open and are thus receiving light under stable operation. With 16 beamlines funded, the number of beamlines will grow over the coming years. The Controls and IT group has performed numerous beamline system installations such as a sample changer at BioMAX, Dectris detector at Nanomax, and End Station at Hippie. It has additionally developed processes, such as automated IT infrastructure with a view to accepting users. We foresee a focus on end stations and detectors, as well as data storage, data handling and scientific software. As an example, a project entitled \"DataStaMP\" has been recently funded aiming to increase the data and metadata storage and management system in order to accommodate the ever increasing demand for storage and access."

We implemented required functions on the FPGA logic of a commercially available I/O card. We develop a module to distribute a trigger and clocks. We also developed cards used for the beam position monitor (BPM) and low-level RF system (LLRF). Those are included two types of cards. One is a 16-bit digitizer used for LLRF for the SPring-8 since 2018 march. We will use the card for the BPM with modified FPGA logic. Second is an implementation of functions with the pulsed RF signals processed on the FPGA logic of a commercially available card. These functions are used for the BPM of the beam transport line from the SACLA to SPring-8. The existing system is used 1 Hz beam repetition but we need more than 10 Hz to achieve an injection time less than 20 minutes to maximize user time. We will report the performance of the MTCA.4 cards",

            "The new MRF event timing system is one of the most important components to maintain the reliable and stable operation of the SuperKEKB project. This system is utilized to distribute high precision level timing signals and accompanying control instructions to synchronize different subsystems and machines. Event generator (EVG) generates signals of different beam modes every 50 Hz pulse which contains several event codes while Event receivers (EVR) receives them and output signals to dedicated devices all over the installation. To certain these events are consistent during the distribution, an event fault diagnosis system is essentially needed. An EVR based event timing diagnostic system is thus developed by modifying the driver support module to provide a log system of persistent event data as well as comparing the received event codes with the beam injector pattern, detecting the event timing interval fault and notifying the results by email every day. Then, we are able to locate the fault, analyze the data, fix bugs or replace hardware and resume accelerator operation quickly."

A layer of software application called the timing manager has been created to track the LEReC beam concerning the RHIC beam and allow instruments to be fired in real-time units instead of bunch timing or RHIC turns. The manager also automates set-tings of different modes based on the RF frequency and maintains the timing of instrumentation with a beam. A detailed description of the bunch structure and scheme of synchronizing the RF and laser pulses will be discussed in the paper."

            "The German Helmholtz Innovation Pool project will explore and provide novel cutting edge Machine Learning techniques to address some of the most urgent challenges in the era of large data harvests in accelerator physics. Progress in virtually all areas of accelerator based physics research relies on recording and analyzing enormous amounts of data. This data is produced by progressively sophisticated fast detectors alongside increasingly precise accelerator diagnostic systems. As KIT contribution to AMALEA it is planned to investigate a design of a fast and adaptive feedback system that reacts to small changes in the charge distribution of the electron bunch and establishes extensive control over the longitudinal beam dynamics. As a promising and well-motivated approach",
            "reinforcement learning methods are considered. In a second step the algorithm will be implemented as a pilot experiment to a novel PCIe FPGA readout electronics card based on Zynq UltraScale+ MultiProcessor System on-Chip (MPSoC)."

            "horizontally polarized undulators while the HXR line is composed of 32 undulator segments designed to operate on the horizontal axis and to produce a vertically polarized beam. The HXR undulators will replace the LCLS ones and thus the control system was designed with the main goal of maximizing the re-utilization of existing hardware and software. For this purpose",
            "the motion control system based on RTEMS running on VME with Animatics SmartMotors was developed as an upgrade of the LCLS design and the cam-based undulator girder positioning system has been reused. The all new SXR undulators employ a new control system design based on Aerotech motion controllers and EPICS soft IOCs (input-output controllers).

LCLS-II is in an advanced stage of construction with equipment for both Cryoplants as well as more than half of the 37 cryomodules onsite. Jefferson Lab (JLab) is a partner lab responsible for building half of the LCLS-II cryomodules. Hence the Low Energy Recirculation Facility (LERF) at JLab was used to stage and test LCLS-II cryomodules before shipping them to SLAC. LERF was set up to test two cryomodules at a time. LERF used LCLS-II cryogenic controls instrumentation racks",

The cryogenic controls first utilized at LERF would then be replicated for controlling all 37 cryomodules via an EPICS user interface. This paper discusses the cryogenic controls currently developed for implementation in the LCLS-II project."

The new fast wire scanner control system has several advantages over LCLS fast wire scanner controls with the capability to program safety features directly on the drive and integrate machine protection checks on an FPGA.

The device has a configurable list of sensors and actuators, response matrix inversion, gain and frequency regulation, takes account of the validity of the sensor inputs and may respond to external interlocks. In the storage rings, it performs the slow orbit feedback (SOFB) using the 10 Hz data stream from the Libera Brilliance Plus Beam Position Measurement (BPM) electronics, reading 194 (34) BPMs in the large (small) ring as sensor inputs. The BPM readings are received as Tango events and a corrector-to-BPM response matrix calculation outputs the corrector magnet settings. In the linac, the device is used for the trajectory correction, again with sensor input data sent as Tango events, in this case from the Single Pass BPM electronics. The device is also used for tune feedback in the storage rings, making use of its own polling thread to read the sensors. In the future, a custom SOFB device may be spun off in order to integrate the hardware-based fast orbit feedback, though the general device is also seeing new applications at the beamlines. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

We intend to use this process of analysis and investigation to formulate proposals for a revised architecture to address the issues with the existing architecture, making use of the opportunities presented by modern technologies and methods, where appropriate. In doing so we hope to design a more flexible and maintainable system which addresses technical debt and functional limitations that have built up over the lifetime of our current software. This will allow us to go on to implement a powerful acquisition and analysis system to be used with the new facilities of Diamond II.",

            "Germany",
            "is based on Siemens S7 PLCs. A communication protocol called PMcomm which is optimized for motion control applications in neutron instruments has been developed at JCNS. PMcomm (PROFI motion communication) is based on PROFINET or PROFIBUS as the underlying transport protocol in order to facilitate the easy integration into the PLC world. It relies on the producer/consumer communication mechanism of PROFINET and PROFIBUS for the efficient direct access to often-used data like positions or status information. Coordinated movement of groups of axes is facilitated by a generic controller/axes model that abstracts from the specifics of the underlying motion control hardware. Simplicity was a major design goal of the protocol in order to allow an efficient and easy implementation on PLCs."

The 17.5 GeV superconducting accelerator will provide photons simultaneously to several user stations. Currently 12 Wire Scanner stations are used to image transverse beam profiles in the high energy sections. These scanners provide a slow scan mode for single bunch operation. When operating with long bunch trains (>100 bunches) fast scans are used to measure beam sizes in an almost nondestructive manner. To operate fast scans multiple impacts on the beam loss system (BLM) and the charge transmission interlock (TIS) have to be taken into account. This paper focuses on the interaction between these systems and first experiences performing measurements. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

            "Light Use Cooling Appliance for Surface Zones (LUCASZ) is the first movable medium size evaporative CO2 detector cooling system. By 2018 a series of 4 LUCASZ units has been fully deployed by the EP-DT group at CERN. LUCASZ is capable to provide CO2 cooling for various needs of detector development and testing required for Phase I&II upgrades of LHC experiments. This paper describes selected software and controls hardware ideas used to develop the LUCASZ control system as baseline solutions for CO2 cooling systems for Phase II upgrade of ATLAS and CMS trackers. The main challenges for future control system development will come from the number of cooling plants",

In doing so, the NIF routinely operates above the damage threshold for its optics. To extend optic lifetimes, we developed a recycle loop during which each damage site on an optic is tracked through time, protected when it approaches an optic-specific size limit, and then repaired so the optic can be reused. Here we describe an overview of custom image analysis, machine learning, and deep learning methods used throughout the recycle loop for optics inspection on the NIF beamlines and off. Most recently, we helped automate the optic repair process by identifying microscopic damage before its repair and then evaluating the repaired site for quality control. Since 2007 we’ve used machine learning to improve accuracy and automate tedious processes to enable and inform an efficient optics recycle loop.",

The distant hardware components are synchronously operated with this network. The beam commissioning of SuperKEKB has been started in 2016.

This paper presents a new way of building a large experimental device control system using web technology instead of EPICS toolkit. The goal is to improve the interoperability of the control system allowing different component in the control system to talk to each other effortlessly. An abstraction of the control system is made. The control system components are abstracted into resources. The accessing of the resources is done via standard HTTP RESTful web API. HMI is based on HTML and JavaScript in browsers. Web Socket is used for event distribution. The main feature of this design is that all interfaces in the system are based on open web standards",
        "which are interoperable among almost all kinds of devices. The paper also presents a software toolkit to build this kind of control system. A control system for a diagnostic on J-TEXT tokamak built using this toolkit will be presented."

The project is very close to the end of its design phase and many decisions have already been made like the adoption of the Tango-controls framework. The time from the end of the design phases and the beginning of the construction has been called bridging with the goal of promoting CI-CD practices. CI-CD is an acronym for Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery and/or continuous deployment. CI is the practice of merging all developers’ local (working) copies into the mainline very often (at least daily). Continuous delivery is the approach of developing software in short cycle ensuring that it can be released anytime",
        "and continuous deployment is the approach of delivering the software frequently and automatically. The present paper analyzes the decision taken by the system team (a specialized agile team for continuous practices in the Safe framework) for promoting those practices within the Tango-controls framework."

The current method for aligning collimators is semi-automated requiring a collimation expert to monitor the loss signals and continuously select and update the threshold accordingly. The human element in this procedure is a major bottleneck for speeding up the alignment. This paper therefore proposes a method to fully automate this threshold selection. A data set was formed from previous alignment campaigns and analyzed to define an algorithm that produced results consistent with the user selections. In over 90% of the cases the difference between the two was negligible and the algorithm presented in this study was used for collimator alignments throughout 2018."

The new simulation architecture has two independent parts; together they cover a large amount of ADOs frequently used by developers. The first part of the simulation framework focuses on testing ADOs with GPIB connections to devices. It consists of several function blocks and has a switch mechanism which enables users to conveniently turn on and off the simulation mode without changing the ADO codes. Moreover",
        "it contains a special module which automates testing on ADO codes. Testing results are summarized and presented to users for codes analysis. The second part of the framework adopts a totally different structure. It simulates a different type of interface. Specifically",
        "it focuses on testing ADOs with Ethernet connections to devices. It is based on a powerful networking engine called Twisted",
        "which is an event-driven network programming framework developed by the Twisted Matrix Labs. The simulation framework can handle multiple types of devices at the same time."

Fast path is based on custom electronic designs",

        "The driver linac of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) contains 332 cavities which are controlled by individual FPGA-based low-level RF controllers. Due to limited hardware resources the EPICS IOCs cannot be embedded in the low-level RF controllers but are running on virtual machines communicating with the devices over Ethernet. An EPICS support module communicating with the devices over UDP has been developed based on the Asyn library. It supports efficient read and write access for both scalar and array data as well as support for triggering actions on the device. Device-related parameters like register addresses and data types are configurable in the EPICS record database making the support module independent of the hardware and the application. This also allows engineers to keep up with evolving firmware without recompiling the support library. The implementation of the support module leverages modern C++ features and relies on timers for periodic communication",
        "timeouts",
        "and detection of communication problems. The latter allows the communication code to be tested separately from the timers keeping the run time of the unit tests short."

      "abstract": "The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next generation ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy at very-high energies. CTA will consist of two large arrays with 118 Cherenkov telescopes in total, deployed in Paranal (Chile) and Roque de Los Muchachos Observatories (Canary Islands, Spain). The Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) system provides the means to execute observations and to handle the acquisition of scientific data in CTA. The Resource Manager & Central Control (RM&CC) sub-system is a core element in the ACADA system. It implements the execution of observation requests received from the scheduler sub-system and provides infrastructure services concerning the administration of various resources to all ACADA sub-systems. The RM&CC is also responsible of the dynamic allocation and management of concurrent operations of up to nine telescope sub-arrays, which are logical groupings of individual CTA telescopes performing coordinated scientific operations. This contribution presents a summary of the main RM&CC design features, and of the future plans for prototyping.",

Multiprocessor systems are known to provide not only the ability for higher processing bandwidth",

The use of non-transparent bridges in PCI systems supporting intelligent adapters in enterprise and multiple processors in embedded systems is a well established technology. There the non-transparent bridge acts as a gateway between the local subsystem and the system backplane. This can be ported to the PCI Express standard by replacing one of the transparent switches on the PCI Express switch with a non-transparent switch. Our experience of establishing non-transparent bridging in MTCA systems will be presented."

As evidence of this, the last call issued addressed 10 beamlines. As of summer 2019, MAX IV has reached a point where 11 beamlines simultaneously have shutters open and are thus receiving light under stable operation. With 16 beamlines funded, the number of beamlines will grow over the coming years. The Controls and IT group has performed numerous beamline system installations such as a sample changer at BioMAX, Dectris detector at Nanomax, and End Station at Hippie. It has additionally developed processes, such as automated IT infrastructure with a view to accepting users. We foresee a focus on end stations and detectors, as well as data storage, data handling and scientific software. As an example, a project entitled \"DataStaMP\" has been recently funded aiming to increase the data and metadata storage and management system in order to accommodate the ever increasing demand for storage and access."

        "Many applications in experimental physics facilities require custom hardware solutions to control process parameters or to acquire data at high rates with high integrity. These hardware solutions typically require custom software implementations. The neutron scattering detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL* implement custom protocols over optical fiber connected to a PCI express based read-out board. A dedicated kernel device driver provides an interface to the software application and must be able to sustain data bursts from a pulsed source while acquiring data for long periods of time. The same optical channel is also used as low-latency communication link to detector electronics for configuration and real time fault detection. This paper presents a Linux device driver design",

        "real use case benchmarks and importance of clean application programming interface for seamless integration in control systems. This software implementation was developed as a generic framework and has been extended beyond neutron data acquisition. It is suitable to diverse applications where it allows for rapid FPGA development."

We implemented required functions on the FPGA logic of a commercially available I/O card. We develop a module to distribute a trigger and clocks. We also developed cards used for the beam position monitor (BPM) and low-level RF system (LLRF). Those are included two types of cards. One is a 16-bit digitizer used for LLRF for the SPring-8 since 2018 march. We will use the card for the BPM with modified FPGA logic. Second is an implementation of functions with the pulsed RF signals processed on the FPGA logic of a commercially available card. These functions are used for the BPM of the beam transport line from the SACLA to SPring-8. The existing system is used 1 Hz beam repetition but we need more than 10 Hz to achieve an injection time less than 20 minutes to maximize user time.

This system is utilized to distribute high precision level timing signals and accompanying control instructions to synchronize different subsystems and machines. Event generator (EVG) generates signals of different beam modes every 50 Hz pulse which contains several event codes while Event receivers (EVR) receives them and output signals to dedicated devices all over the installation. To certain these events are consistent during the distribution, an event fault diagnosis system is essentially needed. An EVR based event timing diagnostic system is thus developed by modifying the driver support module to provide a log system of persistent event data as well as comparing the received event codes with the beam injector pattern, detecting the event timing interval fault and notifying the results by email every day. Then, we are able to locate the fault, analyze the data, fix bugs or replace hardware and resume accelerator operation quickly."

Delivery of innovation induced by evolution of technologies and refactoring of the ageing code must be done in a way that ensures backward-compatibility for existing systems. The vision and the current state of the frameworks is discussed",
        "alongside the main deliveries planned in the medium term. Lessons learnt",
        "optimizations of processes to make best use of available resources and efforts towards open-source licensing of the frameworks are also presented."

Jefferson Lab (JLab) is a partner lab responsible for building half of the LCLS-II cryomodules. Hence the Low Energy Recirculation Facility (LERF) at JLab was used to stage and test LCLS-II cryomodules before shipping them to SLAC. LERF was set up to test two cryomodules at a time. LERF used LCLS-II cryogenic controls instrumentation racks",

The cryogenic controls first utilized at LERF would then be replicated for controlling all 37 cryomodules via an EPICS user interface. This paper discusses the cryogenic controls currently developed for implementation in the LCLS-II project."

The device has a configurable list of sensors and actuators, response matrix inversion, gain and frequency regulation, takes account of the validity of the sensor inputs and may respond to external interlocks. In the storage rings, it performs the slow orbit feedback (SOFB) using the 10 Hz data stream from the Libera Brilliance Plus Beam Position Measurement (BPM) electronics, reading 194 (34) BPMs in the large (small) ring as sensor inputs. The BPM readings are received as Tango events and a corrector-to-BPM response matrix calculation outputs the corrector magnet settings. In the linac, the device is used for the trajectory correction, again with sensor input data sent as Tango events, in this case from the Single Pass BPM electronics. The device is also used for tune feedback in the storage rings, making use of its own polling thread to read the sensors. In the future, a custom SOFB device may be spun off in order to integrate the hardware-based fast orbit feedback, though the general device is also seeing new applications at the beamlines. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

RL uses an agent that takes actions within its environment to maximize a reward related to the goal it is designed to achieve. We have recently used RL as a model-free approach to improve the performance of the FERMI Free Electron Laser. A number of machine parameters are adjusted to find the optimum FEL output in terms of intensity and spectral quality. In particular we focus on the problem of the alignment of the seed laser with the electron beam",

In doing so we hope to design a more flexible and maintainable system which addresses technical debt and functional limitations that have built up over the lifetime of our current software.

It relies on the producer/consumer communication mechanism of PROFINET and PROFIBUS for the efficient direct access to often-used data like positions or status information. Coordinated movement of groups of axes is facilitated by a generic controller/axes model that abstracts from the specifics of the underlying motion control hardware. Simplicity was a major design goal of the protocol in order to allow an efficient and easy implementation on PLCs."

The 17.5 GeV superconducting accelerator will provide photons simultaneously to several user stations. Currently 12 Wire Scanner stations are used to image transverse beam profiles in the high energy sections. These scanners provide a slow scan mode for single bunch operation. When operating with long bunch trains (>100 bunches) fast scans are used to measure beam sizes in an almost nondestructive manner. To operate fast scans multiple impacts on the beam loss system (BLM) and the charge transmission interlock (TIS) have to be taken into account.

        "it is often not possible to test the system live on an instrument prior to an experiment and thus we must be sure that it is ready to go as soon as we have users. To test that we are correctly communicating with hardware we have built a framework to automate testing of EPICS IOCs using device emulators created using the LeWIS*** Python package. This lets us test that new drivers are functionally the same as those under SECI. To ensure that the full instrument control system stack is working as intended we are also using the Squish testing tool****. Whilst this is used by industry as a GUI focused tool we have used it in conjugation with a fully simulated IBEX installation to create system tests",
        "letting us directly simulate the interactions a user has with IBEX and validate its behavior. This poster will present how using these tools has made IBEX a more robust system."

        "a robust design was achieved based on AMD’s TAXI chip**: clock and events are distributed from a central emitter over a star shaped network of simplex optical links to electronic crates around the tokamak. Unfortunately",

The Beam Permit is encoded as a specific frequency traveling over a more than 30 km long network of optical fibers all around the LHC ring. The progressive degradation of the optical fibers and the aging of electronics affect the decoding of the Beam Permit",

Commercial off-the-shelf SFP transceivers were studied with the aim to improve the performance of the optical transmission of the Beam Permit Network. This paper describes the tests carried out in the LHC accelerator to evaluate the selected SFP transceivers and it reports the results of the test loop reaction time measurements during operation. The use of SFPs to optically transmit safety critical signals is being considered as an interesting option not only for the planned major upgrade of the BIS for the HL-LHC era but also for other protection systems."

In doing so, the NIF routinely operates above the damage threshold for its optics. To extend optic lifetimes, we developed a recycle loop during which each damage site on an optic is tracked through time, protected when it approaches an optic-specific size limit, and then repaired so the optic can be reused. Here we describe an overview of custom image analysis, machine learning, and deep learning methods used throughout the recycle loop for optics inspection on the NIF beamlines and off. Most recently, we helped automate the optic repair process by identifying microscopic damage before its repair and then evaluating the repaired site for quality control. Since 2007 we’ve used machine learning to improve accuracy and automate tedious processes to enable and inform an efficient optics recycle loop.",

At the time of this conference the first segment of the accelerator is scheduled to become online. For commissioning and operation of the facility the standard set of EPICS tools form the back-bone. A set of generic Python applications already developed at BESSY/MLS will be adapted to the specifics of BERLinPro. Scope and current project status are described in this paper."
