        "The detection of Gravitational Wave signals from binary black holes and binary neutron stars coalescences opened a new era in modern astronomy. Those discoveries were made possible by high accuracy control systems",
        "capable of maintaining the resonance condition in the interferometric detectors at the femto meter level in the length degrees of freedom",
        "and at the nano radian level in the angular degrees of freedom. This talk describes the control strategies currently implemented in the LIGO gravitational wave detectors",
        "their performance and limitations",
        "and discuss future research directions."
