        "The integration of structured data and the PV Access network protocol into the EPICS toolkit has opened up many possibilities for added functionality and features",
        "which more and more facilities are looking to leverage. At the same time however the core developers also have to cope with technical debt incurred in the race to deliver working software. This paper will describe the current status of EPICS 7",
        "and some of the work done in the last two years following the reorganization of the code-base. It will cover some of the development group’s technical and process changes",
        "and echo questions being asked about support for recent language standards that may affect support for older target platforms",
        "and adoption of other internal standards for coding and documentation."

They represent hardware",

        "which makes it possible for us to operate one LINAC as if it were ten virtual LINACs. Even Software feedback to compensate small drift of output current is available for each mode independently. During two years of operation",
        "there were no significant problem. Although the Windows is not a real-time OS",
        "dropping rate of the trigger coming every 20 ms is less than a ppm. Rebooting of the PC or software is necessary only a few times in a year."
