        "For too long",
        "cybersecurity has been treated as an optional special topic in computer science: separable from the core design and development of emerging technologies. It has also been practiced and learned by a select and narrow group of specialists",
        "typically lacking in diversity. This has led to predictable failures to anticipate certain kinds of challenges to securing systems in practice",
        "and also to accommodate the needs of diverse users of technology. In this talk",
        "weâ€™ll discuss early-stage efforts to create a cybersecurity curriculum for the general public",
        "and how scientists from other disciplines can become more informed and more involved."
