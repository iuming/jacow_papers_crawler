        "For most of its over 30 years of operation the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source has been using bespoke control software on its beamlines. In the last few years",
        "we have been converting the beamline control software to IBEX*",
        "which is based on the Open Source EPICS toolkit**. More than half the instruments at ISIS are now converted. IBEX must be robust and flexible enough to allow instrument scientists to perform the many experiments they can conceive of. Using EPICS as a base",
        "we have built Python services and scripting support as well as developing an Eclipse/RCP GUI based on Control System Studio***. We use an Agile based development methodology with heavy use of automated testing and device emulators. As we move to the final implementation stage",
        "we are handling new instrument challenges (such as reflectometry) and providing new functionality (live neutron data view",
        "script generator and server). This presentation will cover an overview of the IBEX architecture",
        "our development practices",
        "what is currently in progress",

Control of new components and refactoring and reassembly of legacy software should fit into a device based framework. This approach guides the integration of motors",

Strategic goal is the mapping of real beamline components into modelling software to provide the corresponding digital twin. First tests applying DMA methods within this context for tuning are promising."
