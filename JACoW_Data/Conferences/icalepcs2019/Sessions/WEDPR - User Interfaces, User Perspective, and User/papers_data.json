        "apps can be designed for the desktop and mobile devices. Switching between the two targets is an immediate operation. A WebSocket based service* has been used to test Qt + QML mobile applications on portable devices. It makes it possible to connect to Tango and EPICS without their installation. A new tool called \"la-cumparsita\" lets non-programmers use the Qt designer to realize complete applications ready to communicate with the control system in use: Tango",
        "EPICS or any other abstraction framework (e.g. WebSocket). These apps seamlessly integrate with the desktop. Most demanding users can integrate JavaScript functions and use them as data sources for the GUI elements."
