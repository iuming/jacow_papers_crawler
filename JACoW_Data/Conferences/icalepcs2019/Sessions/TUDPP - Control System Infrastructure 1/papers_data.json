        "The ALICE Experiment has been designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter with heavy-ion collisions at the CERN LHC. A major upgrade of the detector and computing model (O2",
        "Offline-Online) is currently ongoing. The ALICE O2 farm will consist of almost 1000 nodes enabled to readout and process on-the-fly about 27 Tb/s of raw data. To increase the efficiency of computing farm operations a general-purpose near real-time monitoring system has been developed: it lays on features like high-performance",

This system will interface with several technical subsystems to provide time-correlated and synchronously sampled data acquisition for commissioning",

KVM and LXD have been evaluated against our current system and Ansible has been used to automate many tasks that were normally done by hand. The Archiver Appliance is being exploited beyond its original deployment and is a critical component of several analysis tool-chains. Virtualization allows development",
