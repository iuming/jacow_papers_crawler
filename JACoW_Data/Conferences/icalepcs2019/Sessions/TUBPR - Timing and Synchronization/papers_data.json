        "A common need in large scientific experiments is the ability to monitor by means of simultaneous data acquisition across the whole installation. Data is acquired as a result of triggers which may either come from external sources",
        "or from internal triggering of one of the acquisition nodes. However",
        "a problem arises from the fact that once the trigger is generated",
        "it will not arrive to the receiving nodes simultaneously",
        "due to varying distances and environmental conditions. The Distributed Oscilloscope (DO) concept attempts to address this problem by leveraging the sub-nanosecond synchronization and deterministic data delivery provided by White Rabbit (WR) and augmenting it with automatic discovery of acquisition nodes and complex trigger event scheduling",
        "in order to provide the illusion of a virtual oscilloscope. This paper presents the current state of the DO",
        "including work done on the FPGA and software level to enhance existing acquisition hardware",
        "as well as a new protocol based on existing industrial standards. It also includes test results obtained from a demonstrator based on two digitizers separated by a 10 km optical fiber",
        "used as a showcase of the DO concept."

The output pulse generation occurs when the capacitor voltage exceeds a threshold voltage. The delay full scale is automatically set to match the period of the master clock",
        "ranging from 5-7 ns",
        "with the help of an embedded calibration circuit. The delay value is controlled with the help of a 14-bit DAC setting the threshold voltage",

The chip is compliant with pulse repetition frequencies up to 20 MHz. The measured INL is 100 LSB and the RMS jitter is 1.8 ps. The power consumption has been measured to 350 mW for 4 active channels."

Early TSN implementations in embedded controller boards and switches were obtained in a test installation in autumn of 2018 to study feasibility",

        "The new MRF event timing system is one of the most important components to maintain the reliable and stable operation of the SuperKEKB project. This system is utilized to distribute high precision level timing signals and accompanying control instructions to synchronize different subsystems and machines. Event generator (EVG) generates signals of different beam modes every 50 Hz pulse which contains several event codes while Event receivers (EVR) receives them and output signals to dedicated devices all over the installation. To certain these events are consistent during the distribution, an event fault diagnosis system is essentially needed. An EVR based event timing diagnostic system is thus developed by modifying the driver support module to provide a log system of persistent event data as well as comparing the received event codes with the beam injector pattern, detecting the event timing interval fault and notifying the results by email every day. Then, we are able to locate the fault, analyze the data, fix bugs or replace hardware and resume accelerator operation quickly."

        "it produces corresponding electron bunches which are accelerated and transported to overlap an ion beam bunched at 9 MHz RF frequency The need for precise timing is handled well by the existing infrastructure. A layer of software application called the timing manager has been created to track the LEReC beam concerning the RHIC beam and allow instruments to be fired in real-time units instead of bunch timing or RHIC turns. The manager also automates set-tings of different modes based on the RF frequency and maintains the timing of instrumentation with a beam. A detailed description of the bunch structure and scheme of synchronizing the RF and laser pulses will be discussed in the paper."

Each output deliver trigger or fiducial signals with jitter down to 5 ps and peak-to-peak wander less than 10 ps over a week. Test performance of this LMJ timing system is in progress all over the LMJ facility. Besides it will be installed on the petawatt laser (PETAL) this year."
