In 2019 the vertical IP beta function will be squeezed towards the design value of ~300 micron. Achieving the target value of the specific luminosity is one of the challenges. Another concern is the detector background; e.g. due to beam-beam tails or due to top-up injection. An international collaboration participates in the SuperKEKB beam commissioning.

Since accelerating dc electron beams above few MeV is technologically challenging; rf-acceleration of electron bunches becomes more practical for high-energy applications. A world’s first electron cooling of ion beams employing such rf-accelerated electron bunches was recently demonstrated at BNL using the Low Energy RHIC electron Cooler (LEReC). Many challenges associated with such an approach were successfully overcome. The cooling task becomes even more challenging when one attempts to cool ion beams in collisions; requiring careful optimization between the electron cooling process and the ion beam lifetime due to various effects; including the beam-beam interactions. In this paper; we discuss first successful application of electron cooling for colliding ion beams in RHIC; as well as requirements and challenges of electron cooling in a collider.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/movir05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/movir05.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/movir05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-MOVIR05,

The strong coherent radiation from the steady-state microbunches will support a facility with high-power; high-repetition-rate or continuous-wave; narrow-band; and short-wavelength radiation; which can provide unprecedented new possibilities for accelerator photon science and industry applications. It has been proved that the electron beam energy modulation induced by an externally applied 1064 nm laser in an undulator can yield microbunching and coherent radiation one turn later at exactly the same place where the modulation was applied. The results confirm that the phase of an electron beam relative to a laser in a storage ring can be locked turn-by-turn in a sub-laser-wavelength precision; therefore making SSMB possible. This validation represents the first key advance in the development of an SSMB high-power light source.; Phys. Rev. Lett. 105; 154801 (2010)  The SSMB collaboration: [FLS2018-THP2WB02] X.

Here we present a novel method; which allows boosting the alternating frequency between right- and left-handed photons to the MHz regime; more than three orders of magnitude faster than present state-of-the-art technologies. The method is based on a twin elliptical undulator installed in a low emittance electron storage ring being operated in a novel mode. Here; the electron optics is tuned close to a resonance where the electron bunches are spatially separated in so-called transverse resonance island buckets (TRIBs). Propagating through the magnetic structures of the twin undulator; electrons from different islands emit photons of the same wavelength but of opposite helicity. Radiation from these two helicity components can be alternated as fast as 2 ns; given by the radio frequency of the accelerator cavity. In the present proof-of-principle experiment at BESSY II we demonstrate a XMCD measurement at the L2; 3 absorption edges of a Ni sample with an 800 ns helicity flip.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/movir12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/movir12.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/movir12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-MOVIR12,

ipac2020,,TUVIR03,Progress in Plasma-Based Accelerators Driven by Particle Beams,LOA; Palaiseau; France; Plasma wakefield acceleration is a promising concept for a compact particle accelerator with broad range of future applications; such as high energy physics or secondary light sources. Plasma can sustain accelerating fields > 100 GeV/m; driven by intense laser pulses (LWFA) or particle beams (PWFA). The latter one allows to overcome limitations on the accelerating length caused by the speed difference between laser and accelerated beam in LWFA; but requires a dense beam of relativistic particles to drive the wakefield; which are produced by expensive large scale conventional accelerators. Here we report on experimental progress made in PWFA using particle beam drivers from conventional RF accelerators as well as from LWFA. First; we will present results on the successful acceleration of positron beams in a PWFA; and discuss intrinsic limitations; from experimental measurements; theory and simulations. Second; we will show the first demonstration of a PWFA powered by laser-accelerated electron beams; and will discuss new possibilities opened by these results; from the direct optical imaging of the accelerating structure to the generation of bright beams beyond the state of the art.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/tuvir03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/tuvir03.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/tuvir03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-TUVIR03,

The advantage of DAA structure is that it has an extremely high quality (Q0 > 105) factor and a high shunt impedance (Zsh > 600 MOhm/m) at room temperature since the electromagnetic field distribution of the accelerating mode can be controlled by the geometry of its structure to reduce the wall loss on metallic surface. However; in a prototype of a DAA structure; multipactor discharge occurred between the ceramic cells; and high gradient operation has not been achieved.

Recently such reduction has been observed in particle-driven plasma-wakefield accelerators. The correlated energy spread is reduced by using the interaction of the electron bunch with its wakefields generated in the plasma. This contribution reviews the working principle of such a dechirper and the experimental observations in the different test facilities. A view on future directions and various ideas and concepts is presented. reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/tuvir05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/tuvir05.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/tuvir05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-TUVIR05,

Acceleration; compression and streaking have all been demonstrated with low energy electrons* but operation at relativistic energies remains limited. Here; we report on the first demonstration of phase-velocity matched acceleration of a relativistic electron beam in a THz-driven linear accelerator**; confirmed through frequency-tuning of the THz source. Operating in the highest beam energy (35 MeV) and charge (60 pC) regimes reported to date; we use narrowband THz pulses centered at 0.4 THz to drive collinear THz-electron interaction in a dielectric-lined waveguide. We exploit multi-cycle energy modulation of a chirped 6 ps electron bunch to extract the often-inaccessible longitudinal phase-space distribution; highlighting the potential for THz-driven bunch diagnostics. We also show injection-time-dependent preferential energy gain/loss for 2 ps bunches; demonstrating a route to whole-bunch acceleration of sub-ps relativistic electron beams.; *D. Zhang et al. Nat.

Each FEL uses a dedicated compact collinear wakefield accelerator (CWA) delivering 5-GeV electron bunches with up to 50-kHz repetition rate. The CWA uses a cylindrical copper structure with a 2-mm ID and fine corrugations on the wall. It causes a 10-nC ""drive"" bunch to radiate an electromagnetic field with a field amplitude ~ 100 MV/m acting on a ~ 0.3-nC ""witness"" bunch trailing behind. The entire accelerator will span a few tens of meters and will contain almost identical ~ 0.5-m-long accelerator modules. The accelerator module includes a 4-cm-long transition section with an output coupler; a notch filter; an integrated offset monitor; bellows; pumping and water-cooling ports. All CWAs share a 1-GeV superconducting linac for production of asymmetrically shaped drive bunches with a high repetition rate. The design of this accelerator is nearing completion and will be presented.

One of the critical issues in slow extraction of a high intensity proton beam is an inevitable beam loss caused by the extraction process at septum devices. A unique dynamic bump scheme for the slow extraction has been applied to reduce the beam loss. We have achieved 51 kW stable operation at 5.2s cycle in the recent physics run. The extraction efficiency is very high; typically 99.5%. However; the dynamic bump scheme is sensitive to the beam orbit angle at the first electrostatic septum (ESS1). The orbit angle of the dynamic bump must be sometimes readjusted to keep such a high efficiency. In future; diffusers and/or a silicon bend crystal; which are more sensitive to the orbit angle fluctuation; would be introduced to achieve a further high slow extraction efficiency. A long-term stability of the beam position and angle at the ESS1 has been investigated. We observed the fluctuations synchronized with tides and estimated to be due to tunnel expansion.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/tuvir15_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/tuvir15.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/tuvir15_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-TUVIR15,31

In order to provide the desired beam powers; these linacs will require significant numbers of SRF cavities which increases the probability of beam trips. The SRF linac at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is currently operating with 81 SRF cavities to provide 1 GeV protons for neutron production. The typical SRF cavity trip rate is approximately 2-3 trips per week each with a recovery time on the order of a few minutes. Occasionally an SRF cavity cannot be recovered and downstream cavities must be re-phased in order to recover the beam energy. Downtime for this type of event is on the order of 30 minutes. As part of a controlled test; it has been demonstrated that after an SRF cavity trip high-power production-quality beam can be recovered automatically without operator intervention in only a few seconds.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/tuvir16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/tuvir16.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/tuvir16_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-TUVIR16,

ipac2020,,WEVIR01,Use of Reverse Bending Magnets in MBA Lattices,PSI; Villigen PSI; Switzerland; Including reverse bending magnets further reduces the equilibrium emittance of multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattices through decoupling of dispersion and horizontal beta function. This coupling is a shortcoming of the classical theoretical minimum emittance (TME) cell preventing it from reaching lowest emittance at realistic; moderate focusing conditions. Rather small deflection angles of the reverse bends; in the order of 10% of the unit cell bending angle; are usually sufficient; and realized through down-feed by displacing the horizontally focusing quadrupoles of the unit cell by a small amount towards the storage ring inside. Reverse bends are indispensable in particular to enable emittance reduction from dipoles with longitudinal field variation; since these require very small dispersion at the central region of highest field strength. In past decades reverse bends were employed occasionally for isochronous lattices or to enhance damping. Now they are becoming an integral component of low emittance MBA lattices.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/wevir01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/wevir01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/wevir01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-WEVIR01,

This instability may also be very detrimental in Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities; because the resulting distortion of the beam phase space can strongly deteriorate the FEL intensity. The Laser Heater; which induces an increase of the beam energy in a controlled way; is used to mitigate this instability. In this paper we propose an alternative or complementary way to reduce the induced energy spread by using a long response time material as photocathode. By choosing a photocathode material with a response time larger than the value corresponding to the maximum amplification of the microbunching instability; the photocathode acts as a low pass filter of the laser profile; reducing in this way one of the possible sources of microbunching instability. The present experience shows that with this approach SwissFEL; the FEL facility in user operation at the Paul Scherrer Institute; efficiently lases without or with a very limited use of the laser heater.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/wevir02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/wevir02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/wevir02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-WEVIR02,

For certain applications; one would like to preserve this microbunching structure of the electron bunch as it experiences a dipole kick which bends its trajectory. This process; called microbunch rotation; rotates the microbunches and aligns them perpendicular to the new direction of electron travel. Microbunch rotation was demonstrated experimentally by MacArthur et al. with soft x-rays* and additional unpublished data demonstrated microbunch rotation with hard x-rays. Further investigations into the magnetic lattice used to rotate these microbunches showed that microbunches can be rotated using an achromatic lattice with a small R56; connecting this technique to earlier studies of achromatic bends.

Each method has its advantages and limitations and provides complementary information. Pinhole imaging is the most commonly used technique which has the simplest setup but with limited resolution. Double-slit interferometry gives the highest sensitivity among the three methods. The ps-BPM system has a reasonable resolution in measuring source size and divergence; and at the same time; provides real-time information on source position and angle.

A common strategy for the measurement of ultra-short electron bunches is to sample the Coulomb field with femtosecond laser pulses. In recent years; such electro-optic detection schemes evolved to compact and reliable techniques. However; serious limitations on time resolution have been encountered; when long recording lengths are required. This has been recognised as a fundamental bottleneck and coined the term ""Fourier limit"". We present here a novel electro-optic sampling strategy that is theoretically capable to overcome this limit and achieve femtosecond resolution for any recording length. This new approach is based on the mathematical concept of information diversity. We present first results obtained both with table-top experiments as well as at the European XFEL.

The design gives full control of the streaking plane; which can be tuned in order to characterize the projections of the beam distribution in arbitrary transverse axes. This novel feature opens new opportunities for complete characterization of the electron beam including also the 3D reconstruction of the charge-density distribution of the bunch**. A collaboration of three research institutes (DESY; CERN and PSI) was formed to realize the prototype structure in view of future in-series production***. This new RF-cavity design requires very high manufacturing precision. The prototype was assembled using the high-precision-tuning-free assembly procedure developed at PSI****. Late 2019 the first PolariX TDS was installed in the FLASHForward beamline at DESY; where the expected performance of the structure has been validated during the first commissioning with electron beam.

The shot-to-shot fluctuation of the diffraction pattern is then decomposed to two basic modes; i.e.; the distance between the Bragg peaks as well as its variation (radial mode) and the overall lateral shift of the whole pattern (drift mode). Since these two modes are completely decoupled; the Bragg-diffraction method can simultaneously measure the shot-to-shot energy fluctuation from the radial mode with 2; 10-4 precision and spatial-pointing jitter from the drift mode having wide measurement span covering energy jitter range from 10-4 to 10-1. The key advantage of this method is that it allows us to extract the electron beam energy spread concurrently with the ongoing experiment and enables online optimization of the electron beam especially for future high charge single-shot ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) and ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) experiments.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/wevir16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/wevir16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/wevir16_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-WEVIR16,67

The first target station uses a mercury target and its lifetime is mainly restricted by cavitation erosion: when the proton beam pulses hit the target; strong pressure waves are developed causing cavitation damage. A successful approach to mitigate the pressure wave has been to inject small helium bubbles into the mercury. Experience at SNS shows that even a small amount of Helium was enough to successfully mitigate the pressure wave and the cavitation erosion at 1.4 MW. However; at higher power more mitigation will be necessary. A substantially new design target vessel design will be presented that leverages lessons from operational experience and post-irradiation examination of previous targets. The 2MW target will be equipped with two methods of gas injection: swirl bubblers to introduce small bubbles and a second gas injection port closer to the nose.

Reducing the operating temperature of NC linacs to cryogenic-temperature decreases the surface resistance compared to room-temperature operation. This results in large increase in the shunt impedance and the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity; which enables higher gradient operation as well as increased beam loading capabilities. Moreover; low temperature operation increases surface hardness and results in large reduction in breakdown rates compared to room-temperature operation. We are experimentally investigating the operation of an X-band; 20 cells; standing wave; linac at LN temperature of 77k. This structure was previously processed and tested at room-temperature for reference. Operating with LN results in much reduced cost compared to the complicated setup required for operation with LHe; and still provides much enhanced characteristics of NC accelerator structures. In this paper; we will present the experimental setup and initial measurement results of our NC linac testing at cryogenic-temperature at SLAC.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/thvir10_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/thvir10.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/thvir10_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-THVIR10,
ipac2020,,THVIR11,Introduction to 3D Printing Techniques for Accelerator Vacuum Systems,T. Ha; S.H. Kim; C.D. Park; S. Shin; PAL; Pohang; Republic of Korea; HG. Kim; H.K. Park; KITECH; Gangneung; Republic of Korea; A large variety of small aperture magnets is required for modern low emittance storage rings. These magnets restrict the flexibility of the vacuum system. The low conductance of the vacuum chamber together with the small aperture is the main limiting factor for achieving the required vacuum performance. In addition it is challenging to accommodate high heat loads from synchrotron radiation because of the tight space available for the vacuum parts. Metal 3D printing techniques for vacuum system components of 4th generation storage ring (4GSR) could mitigate some of the difficulties. An overview of the world-wide status; the expected benefits and the challenges of 3D printing techniques for accelerator vacuum systems is presented. Projects at existing and future synchrotron facilities are described. One example is the design of the vacuum system for the PAL-4GSR at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL); which includes 3D printed NEGs for distributed pumping and a compact sputter ion pump with 3D printed anode structures.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/thvir11_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/thvir11.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/thvir11_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-THVIR11,

The FLASH methodology consists in delivering millisecond pulses of radiation (total beam-on time < 100-500 ms) delivered at a high mean dose-rate (> 40-100 Gy/s) and pulse amplitude (> 1E6 Gy/s); over 2000 times faster than in conventional RT. New accelerator ideas are under development or are being tested to deliver this type of beam. In this paper we will report the accelerator technology used for the pre-clinical studies and the necessary developments to deliver this novel dose RT technique.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/thvir12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/thvir12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/thvir12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-THVIR12,71

It exploits in a Class A work sector; a dedicated isotope separator beam line; a target irradiation station at the 1.4 GeV Proton Synchroton Booster (PSB) and receives activated targets from external institutes during CERN Long Shut-Downs. The target is heated up at high temperatures to allow for the diffusion and effusion of the atoms out of the target that are subsequently ionized. The ions are accelerated and sent through an off-line mass separator. The radionuclide of interest is extracted through mass separation and implanted into a thin metallic collection foil. After collection; the batch is prepared to be dispatched to a research center. In the near-future; the radiochemistry process will also be performed in MEDICIS. Since its commissioning in December 2017; the facility has provided novel radionuclides such as Tb-149; Tb-155; Tm-165; Er-169 and Yb-175 with high specific activity; some for the first time; to European research institutes part of the collaboration.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/thvir13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/thvir13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/thvir13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-THVIR13,75

It is unique - in a single technological system - addresses all three types of emissions simultaneously. It promises to be cheaper and more efficient than existing solutions. There are two main stages involved: 1) SO2 and NOx oxidation during irradiation of wet gases by the EB from the accelerator and 2) the pollution products absorption into aqueous solution. For the very first time; test trials in the real maritime environment where conducted and attracted interest of maritime industry; policy makers and accelerator community. Proof-of-Concept clearly confirmed potential of this accelerator technology and formed basis for the full-scale project where this hybrid system will be applied to the sea-going ferry on the regular traffic.

Amongst typical beam performance requirements; the operational reliability of the accelerator is exceptionally demanding. The advantages and challenges of different driver options; like cyclotrons and linacs; are evaluated and worldwide design studies are summarized. The MYRRHA design is based on a 600 MeV superconducting proton linac. The first stage towards its realization was recently approved to be constructed by SCK•CEN in Belgium. The 100 MeV linac will serve as technology demonstrator for MYRRHA as well as driver for independent two target stations; one for fusion material research and one for research and medical isotope production. MYRRHA in its final implementation is envisaged as an international collaboration.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/talks/thvir15_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/papers/thvir15.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2020/posters/thvir15_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2020-THVIR15,86
