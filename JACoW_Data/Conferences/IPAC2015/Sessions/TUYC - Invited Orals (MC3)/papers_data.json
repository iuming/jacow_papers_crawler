        "Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs)* are being investigated as a compact driver for light sources and high-energy linear colliders. Recently 2 GeV beams were generated by focusing ≈ 100 J laser pulses onto a gas target**. We report here on the generation of beams with energy up to 4.2 GeV using 16 J of laser pulse energy at the BErkeley Lab Laser Accelerator (BELLA)***. This was achieved by using laser pulses of high spatial and temporal quality coupled to a pre-formed capillary discharge waveguide of length 9 cm. The waveguide (in conjunction with self-guiding) allowed for mitigation of diffraction. High spatial quality (Strehl ratio at focus 0.8±0.1) was achieved using a deformable mirror placed before the focusing optic. The dominant contribution to the non-Gaussian content of the focal spot was the near-field intensity profile. For maximum efficiency high-power femtosecond systems employ super-Gaussian near-field profiles of the form I(r)∝e-2(r/wN)",
        "where I is the intensity",
        "r is the radial coordinate",
        "w is the spot size",
        "and N is the order. Compared with Gaussian laser pulses where N=2",
        "pulses from the BELLA laser system had N=10. Simulations showed that an increased contribution of self-guiding was required to effectively confine the laser energy for optimum acceleration and mitigation of damage to the capillary waveguide. Through appropriate choice of plasma density electron beams with energy up to 4.2 GeV were observed. In this regime the electron beam angular fluctuations were > 2 mrad rms",
        "caused in part by errors in waveguide alignment and by laser-induced damage to the capillary that introduces plasma asymmetry. Improved alignment of the waveguide and mitigation of capillary damage allowed for reduction in angular fluctuations to 0.6 mrad rms. The electron beams had energy of 2.7±0.1 GeV",
        "charge of 150 pC",
