        "The correction of the lattice nonlinearity of the storage rings is crucial for the enlargement of the dynamic aperture of the storage rings",
        "which in general leads to the higher injection efficiency and the longer lifetime. At the SPring-8 storage ring",
        "it is realized that the higher order coupling resonances are considerably excited. After the usual correction of the nonlinear dynamics in terms of the normal sextupole magnets",
        "we suppress one of the resonances by using the skew sextupole magnets for the purpose of further improving the dynamic aperture. As a result of the correction by the skew sextupoles",
        "the reckoned improvement of the injection efficiency and the lifetime is achieved. Furthermore",
        "at the SPring-8 storage ring",
        "it is observed that the error magnetic field of a particular insertion device (ID) excites the higher nonlinear coupling resonance of the skew octupoles",
        "which remarkably deteriorates the injection efficiency. In order to correct the coupling resonance",
        "we have installed the octupole magnets at the ID",
        "by which we restore the injection efficiency."
