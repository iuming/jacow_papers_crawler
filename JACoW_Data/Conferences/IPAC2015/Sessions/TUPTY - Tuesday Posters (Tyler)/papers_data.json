Solenoid snakes substantially reconstruct beam’s orbital motion. The change of the polarization direction in the vertical plane of MPD and SPD detectors occurs due to insertion of polarization control (PC) solenoids in the magnetic lattice of the collider. The solenoids rotating particle’s spin by small angels practically do not influence on the beam’s orbital motion parameters.

The new collimation system will have to attenuate more and be more robust than its predecessor. The active jaw length of the new transfer line collimators will therefore be 2.1 m instead of currently 1.2 m. The transfer line optics will have to be adjusted for the new collimator locations and larger beta functions at the collimators for absorber robustness reasons. In this paper the new design of the transfer line collimation system will be presented with its implications on transfer line optics and powering",

        "The six-dimensional ionization cooling is essential to design a bright muon source. A geometry constraint is a challenge issue in a compact helical cooling channel (HCC). Especially",
        "the HCC requires a large bore helical magnet and a compact helical RF system to incorporate the RF into the magnet chamber. A new emittance evolution has been designed to mitigate the geometry constraint. The HCC was functionally separated into three parts sections. The lattice at the initial section provides a large transverse acceptance by using a strong helical focus magnet. Once the transverse beam size is small enough to get into the compact RF the HCC lattice in the middle section generates a large longitudinal beta tune to dominate the longitudinal cooling. Consequently",
        "the longitudinal emittance becomes smaller than the transverse one at the end of middle section. In the final section",
        "the magnetic field strength is gradually reduced to match out the helical channel to the straight solenoid. As a result",
        "the emittance exchange takes place and the final transverse emittance becomes smaller than the longitudinal one. The new emittance evolution scenario will be discussed in this presentation."

A conventional solution for this trouble is insertion of bent chicanes in the arcs space. In our report we consider a method to provide space coincidence of encountering bunches in the crab-crossing orbits Interaction Region (IR) while repetition rates of two beams do not coincide. The method utilizes pair of fast kickers realizing a bypass for the electron bunches as the way to equalize positions of the colliding bunches at the Interaction Point (IP). A dipole-mode warm or SRF cavities fed by the magnetron transmitters are used as fast kickers",

This synchronization method is evaluated as perspective for the Medium Energy Electron-Ion collider (MEIC) project of JLab with its very high bunch repetition rate."
