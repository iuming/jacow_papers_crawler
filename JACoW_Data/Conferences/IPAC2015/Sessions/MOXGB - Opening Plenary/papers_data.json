        "The LHC has just come to the end of its first Long Shutdown (LS1) and preparations are underway to prepare for Run 2 data taking at 13 TeV centre of mass energy. After briefly recalling the major work undertaken during the 2-year long LS1",
        "details will be given of the cool-down and hardware commissioning phase where each individual superconducting circuit is individually qualified for operation at nominal current. For the main dipole circuits this phase was completed with a quench training campaign in order to operate reliably at the required field. In parallel to the training campaign a rigorous cold checkout has been used to qualify the machine as an ensemble and to establish the conditions necessary for beam operation. The details of this phase will be given together with associated dry runs and beam injection tests. Finally",
        "the latest news will be presented concerning the beam commissioning of the machine in preparation for first physics operation",
        "which will hopefully begin in June."
