        "This talk will present the challenges and progress required in beam instrumentation for next generation storage-ring light sources. These light sources aim at small natural emittance of approximately 100 pm rad in order to achieve much higher brightness than the present 3rd generation light sources. This small emittance is realized by a multi-bend lattice",
        "which has a small dynamic aperture of only several mm",
        "a small beam size of approximately 10 microns",
        "etc. Therefore",
        "the beam orbit must be precisely measured by beam position monitors (BPM) for the orbit correction and the beam size should be monitored with less than 10-micron resolution in order to estimate the beam emittance. A bunch-by-bunch feedback system is also required for the suppression of various instabilities coming from narrow beam chamber. In addition",
        "since the stable tune region is small",
        "a real-time tune monitor is demanded for the tune correction. We introduce leading-edge instrumentation techniques to overcome these difficulties",
        "comparing with of 3rd generation light sources."

        "The optical method of measuring the transverse beam profile and size using visible synchrotron radiation (SR) began with simple imaging systems. The resolution was limited by both the diffraction and the wavefront error making it difficult to resolve beam sizes less than 50 μm. Instead of imaging",
        "a method for measuring the beam profile and size using the spatial coherence was introduced. The method is based on Van Cittert-Zernike’s theorem",
        "and can resolve 4-5 μm beam sizes with an error of only 0.5 μm. In this presentation",
        "the principle of the measurement",
        "the SR interferometer design",
        "and some resent measurement results are reviewed. The incoherent field depth effect for the horizontal beam size measurement is also described with some results. Design study calculations for the SR interferometer at the LHC will be presented."
