        "which are compared to their counterparts derived from the lattice model. By fitting the model to the data with quadrupole and skew quadrupole variables",
        "the linear optics and coupling of the machine can be obtained. Simulation demonstrates that errors in the lattice and BPM parameters can be recovered with this method. Experiments on the NSLS-II storage ring show that it can find the same optics as the linear optics from closed orbit (LOCO) method."
