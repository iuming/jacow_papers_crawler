        "Photocathode emission properties are critical for electron beam applications such as photoinjectors for free electron lasers (FEL) and energy recovery Linacs (ERL). We investigate whether emission properties of photocathodes can be manipulated through the engineering of the surface electronic structure. The multilayers described here have been predicted to have emission properties in correlation with the film thickness. This paper describes how ultra-thin multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO films in the crystallographic orientations (001) and (111) multilayers were synthesized and characterized. Preliminary results of work function measurements are provided. Films were grown by pulsed laser deposition at 130 °C for the (001) orientation and 210 °C for the (111) orientation at a background pressure of ~ 5×10-9 Torr. Epitaxial growth was monitored in-situ using reflection high-energy electron diffraction",
        "which showed single crystal island growth for each stage of the multilayer formation. Photoelectron spectroscopy was used to track the chemical state transition from Ag to MgO during the deposition of successive layers. The Kelvin probe technique was used to measure the change in contact potential difference",
        "and thus work function",
        "for various MgO layer thicknesses in comparison with bare single crystal Ag(001)and Ag(111) thin films. The work function was observed to reduce with increasing thickness of MgO from 0 to 4 monolayers as much as 0.89 eV and 0.72 eV for the (001) and (111) orientations",
        "respectively. Photoelectron spectra near the Fermi level revealed electron density shifts toward zero binding energy for the multilayered surfaces with respect to the clean Ag surfaces."

Such \"microbunching instabilities\" were recently shown to be potentially useful to support the generation of broadband coherent radiation pulses. Therefore there has been an increasing interest in devising accelerator beamlines capable of sustaining this LSC instability as a mechanism to produce a coherent light source. To date most of these studies have been carried out with a one-dimensional impedance model for the LSC. In this paper we use a N-body \"Barnes-Hut\" algorithm * to simulate the 3D space charge force in the beam combined with Elegant ** and explore the limitation of the 1D model often used. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Measurement of the displacement in the wire over time using a motion detector yields the first or second integrals of the magnetic field.

The previous theory used a square-wave approximation of the time varying field to solve for the total kinetic energy deposited on the cathode due to the back-bombarded electrons. In addition the transit time factor was added as a correction to compensate for the non-sinusoidal field. By solving for the back-bombardment power using a sinusoidal field",
        "the transit time factor can be removed and therefore a better overall model is produced. These alterations continue to accurately predict how back-bombardment varies as a function of the gun parameters and provides improvement when compared to the existing theory."

      "abstract": "We report the observation of de-chirping of a linearly chirped (in energy) electron bunch by its passage through a 4 inch long rectangular waveguide loaded with two silicon bars 0.25 inch thick and 0.5 inch wide. Silicon being a semiconductor has a conductivity that allows it to drain the charge fast in case if some electrons get intercepted by the dechirper. At the same time the conductivity is low enough for the skin depth to be large (on the order of 1 cm) making the silicon loaded waveguide a slow wave structure supporting wakefields that dechirp the beam. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The booster was designed to accelerate up to 15 nC each cycle. Linac commissioning was completed in April 2012. Booster commissioning was started in November 2013 and completed in March 2014. All of the significant design goals were satisfied including beam emittance",

Operating experience and reliability during the first year of NSLS-II operation will be discussed."

      "abstract": "The NSLS-II accelerators are installed within radiation shielding walls that are designed to attenuate the radiation generated from an assumed beam loss power to a level of <0.5mrem/h at the outer surface of the bulk shield walls. Any operational losses greater than specified level are expected to be addressed by installing supplemental shielding near the loss point in order to attenuate the radiation outside the shield wall to the design level. In this paper we report the analysis of the electron beam mis-steering in the NSLS-II storage ring for the determination of supplementary shielding. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

      "abstract": "The NSLS-II accelerators are installed within 0.8 – 1 m thick radiation shielding walls. The safety considerations require attenuating the radiation generated from possible electron beam losses to a level of <0.5mrem/h at the outer surface of the bulk shield walls. Any operational losses greater than specified level shall be addressed by installing supplemental shielding near the loss point. In this paper we discuss simulation studies that identified potential beam loss locations. Results of these studies were used for identification of imposed radiation risks and for specification of the supplemental shielding design necessary to mitigate those risks. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

      "abstract": "The NSLS-II storage ring is protected from possible damage from insertion devices (IDs) synchrotron radiation by a dedicated active interlock system (AIS). It monitors electron beam position and angle and triggers beam drop if beam orbit exceeds the boundaries of pre-calculated active interlock envelope. In this paper we describe functional details of the AIS and discuss our experience with commissioning of the AIS for the first six IDs installed in the storage ring. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
