Finally I will go into several more exotic methods that are being developed to achieve an even higher degree of spatial coherence and temporal resolution: sources based on laser plasma acceleration and ultracold sources based on photoionization of laser-cooled gases or on cryo-cooled semiconductors photocathodes."
