        "Alkali antimonide photocathodes are a strong contender for the cathode of choice for next-generation photon sources such as LCLS II or the XFEL. These materials have already found extensive use in photodetectors and image intensifiers. However",
        "only recently have modern synchrotron techniques enabled a systematic study of the formation chemistry of these materials. Such analysis has led to the understanding that these materials are inherently rough when grown through traditional sequential deposition; this roughness has a detrimental impact on the intrinsic emittance of the emitted beam. Sputter deposition may provide a path to achieving a far smoother photocathode",
        "while maintaining adequate quantum efficiency. We report on the creation and vacuum transport of a K2CsSb sputter target",
        "and its use to create an ultra-smooth (sub nm roughness) cathode with a 2% quantum efficiency at 532 nm."

        "Muon beam ionization cooling is a key component for the next generation of high-luminosity muon colliders. To reach adequately high luminosity without excessively large muon intensities",
        "it was proposed previously to combine ionization cooling with techniques using a parametric resonance (PIC). Practical implementation of PIC proposal is a subject of this report. We show that an addition of skew quadrupoles to a planar PIC channel gives enough flexibility in the design to avoid unwanted resonances",
        "while meeting the requirements of radially-periodic beam focusing at ionization-cooling plates",
        "large dynamic aperture and an oscillating dispersion needed for aberration corrections. Theoretical arguments are corroborated with models and a detailed numerical analysis",
        "providing step-by-step guidance for the design of Skew-quad PIC (SPIC) beamline."
