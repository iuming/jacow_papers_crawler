        "The UNIversal Linear Accelerator (UNILAC) at GSI serves as injector for all ion species from protons to uranium since four decades. Its 108 MHz Alvarez type DTL providing acceleration from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u has suffered from material fatigue. The DTL will be replaced by a completely new section with almost same design parameters",
        "i.e. pulsed current of up to 15 mA of 238U28+ at 11.4 MeV/u. A dedicated terminal & LEBT for operation with 238U4+ is currently constructed. The uranium sources need to be upgraded in order to provide increased beam brilliances and for operation at 3 Hz. In parallel a 70 MeV / 70 mA proton linac based on H-mode cavities is under design and construction. This contribution will also give a brief summary of the overall status of the FAIR project."
