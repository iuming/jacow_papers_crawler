        "The Australian Synchrotron Light Source has been operating successfully since 2007 and in top-up mode since 2012 while gradually being upgraded to reach an excellent beam availability exceeding 99 %. Considering the ageing of the equipment",
        "effort is required in order to maintain the reliability at this level. The proposed upgrade of the linac with a SLED cavity has been chosen to mitigate the risks of single point of failure and lack of spare parts. The linac is normally fed from two independent 35 MW pulsed klystrons to reach 100 MeV beam energy and can be operated in single (SBM) or multi-bunch mode (MBM). The SLED cavity upgrade will allow remote selection of single klystron operation in SMB and possibly limited MBM without degradation of beam energy and reduce down time in case of a klystron failure. The proposal for the SLED cavity upgrade is shown and the linac designs are detailed."

        "we suggested a means of reducing the residual resistance by warming up a cavity after initial cooldown to about 20K and cooling it down again. In subsequent studies we used this technique to manipulate the residual resistance by more than a factor of 2. We postulated that thermocurrents during cooldown generate additional trapped magnetic flux that impacts the cavity quality factor. Since several questions remained open",
        "we present here a more extensive study including measurement of two additional passband modes of the 9-cell cavity that confirms the effect. We also discuss simulations that substantiate the claim. While the layout of the cavity LHe tank system is cylindrically symmetric",
        "we show that the temperature dependence of the material parameters result in a non-symmetric current distribution. Hence a significant amount of magnetic flux can be generated at the RF surface resulting in an increased surface resistance."

Here we report, how we integrated the combination of klystron, high voltage modulator, and auxiliaries to accumulate operating experience. RF operation of the klystron started on a water cooled load, soon the circulator will be included and then the prototype CH cavity in the radiation shielded area will be powered. The 45 kW amplifiers for the 3 buncher structures of the FAIR proton Linac were checked at the test stand, and the results are presented here."

The input power will be injected to the cavity via a loop coupler from the side of the first cell. The operating frequency of the designed cavity is about 3 GHz with an adjustable bandwidth. The long range longitudinal wakefield calculation results are reported to investigate the cavity performance for multi-beam operation up to 3 MHz bunch repetition rate. The results declare that the influence of the long range wakefield on the arrival time jitter is less than 1 fs."

Different types of external loads on the resonator walls predetermine the main working conditions of the SC cavities. The most important of them are very high electromagnetic fields that result in strong Lorentz forces and the pressure on cavity walls from the helium tank that also deforms the cavity shape. Also mechanical eigen resonances of cavities are the main source of the microphonics. To withstand any kind of external loads on the resonator walls different schemes of the cavity stiffening were applied. In the paper we report the basic investigations of the cavity stiffening using FNAL 650 MHz β=0.92 and 0.61 as an example. The single-cell investigation results were used as the reference to develop the ultimate scheme of the helium vessel structure to ensure the best resonator stability. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

One of the disadvantages of this design is the RF power leakage from the accelerating gun cavity cells to the cathode housing that results in the excessive cathode heating. To minimize the RF power leak different kinds of choke filters are used to protect the cathode structure. These choke filters represent resonant circuits with a zero input impedance and installed at the entrance of the cathode structure that shunt the cathode housing. Still",
        "since the choke filter frequency shift under working conditions is bigger than its bandwidth a filter tuning during assembly only in the warm stage seems insufficient and requires also fine-tuning during operation. To eliminate the problems of the choke filter fine-tuning and hence ensure its stability during operation",

The thermal analysis and the temperature measurement with the designed heater was performed. The ideal temperature distribution for the kicker degassing was obtained. The outgassing of the graphite during rising the temperature was measured. The result showed that the outgassing was extremely suppressed by the first heating. This means the outgassing of the graphite heater was negligible as long as it is used in the beam line without exposure to the air. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "we are developing SRF-TEM that is a new type of transmission electron microscope using special-shaped superconducting cavity. By applying our new RF control system to the SRF-TEM",
        "it is expected to obtain stable accelerating fields so that we can acquire good spatial resolution. In this presentation",
        "we will explain the required stabilities of accelerating fields for SRF-TEM and the feasibility of SRF-TEM in the case of applying the cavity frequency tracking type RF control system."
