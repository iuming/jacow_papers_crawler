        "and summarize the basic requirements for EUVL sources including factors driving potential future power scaling needs."

        "and second the efficient magnetic flux expulsion from the niobium walls via controlled cavity cooling though transition temperature. The talk will give an overview from the discovery of these effects at FNAL to the development into a cryomodule ready technology by the partner labs Cornell",

        "FNAL and SLAC for implementation in the LCLS-2 accelerator. New results will be presented from surface analysis",
        "cavity diagnostics tools and very high Q obtained in dressed cavities in cryomodule environment."

        "the new 3rd generation light source at BNL was designed for a brightness of 1022 photons s-1 mm-2 mrad-2 (0.1%BW)-1. It was constructed between 2009 and 2014. The storage ring was commissioned in April 2014 which was followed by insertion device and beamline commissioning in the fall of 2014. All ambitious design parameters of the facility have already been achieved except for commissioning the full beam intensity of 500 mA which requires more RF installation. This paper reports on the results of commissioning."
