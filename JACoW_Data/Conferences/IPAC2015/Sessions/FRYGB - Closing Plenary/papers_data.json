        "High power proton accelerators are increasingly popular as drivers for secondary beams with a large variety of applications",
        "such as neutron sources for materials science and neutrino factories for high energy physics. In the last few decades",
        "average beam powers have increased substantially",
        "giving rise to an array of challenges centered on providing high beam power and availability while maintaining low activation levels. This talk summarizes the current status of high power proton accelerators. It discusses recent operational experiences and lessons learned",
        "and identifies the primary hardware and beam dynamics limitations. A brief review of planned next generation facilities and driving technologies is also presented."
