        "dedicated to non-clinical research. A slow-extracted proton beam of maximum clinical energy has been delivered for the first time in IR3 in October 2014",
        "thus providing the technical proof-of-principle of the accelerator chain. The recent related beam commissioning efforts included setting up of the multi-turn injection into the synchrotron at 7 MeV",
        "the acceleration on first harmonic up to 250 MeV",
        "the slow extraction on the third integer resonance with a betatron core and the matching of the High Energy Beam Transfer line. The accelerator optimization phase leading to IR3 medical commissioning of proton beams is ongoing. The main characteristics of the MedAustron accelerator system will be presented",
        "along with the results obtained during the commissioning process."
