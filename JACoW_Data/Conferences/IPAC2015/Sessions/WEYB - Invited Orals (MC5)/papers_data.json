        "CERN is constructing a 750 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) which can accelerate a proton beam to 5 MeV in a length of 2 m. The beam dynamics strategic parameters have been chosen to make this RFQ a good candidate for the injector of a medical facility operating at frequency of 3 GHz. Minimising beam losses above 1 MeV",
        "containing the RF power losses and opening the road to industrialisation have been the guidelines for an unconventional RFQ design. In this paper",

        "the structure design and the expected beam qualities will be detailed. The status of the construction as well as the potential for further developments will be presented."
