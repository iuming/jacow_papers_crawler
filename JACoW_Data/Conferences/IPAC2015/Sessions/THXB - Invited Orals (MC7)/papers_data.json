        "The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) energy upgrade from 6 GeV to 12 GeV includes the installation of eleven new 100 MV cryomodules (88 cavities). The superconducting RF cavities are designed to operate CW at an accelerating gradient of 19.3 MV/m with a QL of 3×107. Not all the cavities were operated at the minimum gradient of 19.3 MV/m with the beam. Though the initial 12 GeV milestones were achieved during the initial commissioning of CEBAF",
        "there are still some issues to be addressed for long term reliable operation of these modules. This paper reports the operational experiences during the initial commissioning and the path forward to improve the performance of C100 (100 MV) modules."

        "the luminosity can be limited due to incomplete overlap of the colliding bunches. Crab cavities are introduced to restore head-on collisions by providing destined opposite deflection to the head and tail of the bunch. Luminosity increase has been demonstrated at KEKB with global crab crossing",
