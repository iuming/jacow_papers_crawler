This effect comes about due to the instantaneous opening angle of the emitted synchrotron radiation (SR) and the acceptance angle of the SR light monitor beamline. Measurements were made using a visible light interferometer at the visible light beamlines in three circular accelerators at ATF"

Both harmonic linearization and phase modulation linearization are considered and their relative strengths and weaknesses compared. Simulations were performed to compare the performance of an s-band injector with a higher harmonic RF linearization and an x-band injector. One motivation for the study is to optimise the length of the AXXS machine",

The electron storage ring is based on a modified 5BA cell to achieve a bare lattice emittance of 0.27 nm.rad in a 518 m circumference ring that contains 20 straight sections of alternating 6 and 7 meters in length. The 5BA cell accommodates a thin permanent magnet high field (2 T) dipole in the center of the middle bend producing hard X-ray radiation (εc=12 keV) with a modest contribution to the total energy loss. In this paper we discuss the main achievements and issues for Sirius accelerators. Developments in beamlines are not discussed here."

Consequently it becomes crucial to know the distribution of electron beam losses to optimize the radiation shielding and to protect the insertion devices from radiation damage. Such loss maps of the storage ring can be produced thanks to the simulation of the Touschek scattering process along the lattice. It is shown that about 80 % of the beam losses can be collimated in a few chosen locations only",

As a possible later upgrade the option to transport higher energy electrons (up to 800 MeV) or positrons (up to 400 MeV) from the existing DESY Linac 2 to the facility is studied. Though existing a possible connection using e.g. a part of the DESY synchrotron as a transfer line and other currently unused transfer-line",
        "these machines were not designed for the desired longitudinal bunch compression and high peak current required by e.g. beam driven plasma wake-field experiments. Simulation results illustrate the modifications to the current layout that would have to be implemented and the corresponding achievable beam parameters are given."

Regular user operation started in summer 2010 with a very low emittance of 1 nm at a beam energy of 6 GeV and a total beam current of 100 mA. All photon beamlines were installed in one octant of the storage ring. Nine straight sections facilitated the installation of insertion devices for 14 beam lines. Due to the high demand for additional beamlines the lattice of the ring was redesigned to accommodate 10 additional beamlines in the future. In a one year long shut-down two new experimental halls were built. The recommissioning of PETRA III started in February 2015. We are reporting the current status of synchrotron light source including the performance of the subsystems."

        "3-D ellipsoidal photo cathode laser pulses are considered as the next step in optimization of photo injectors required for a successful operation of linac based free electron lasers. Beam dynamics simulations using such laser pulses compared to conventional cylindrical pulses have shown a significant improvement in electron beam emittance. In collaboration with the Institute of Applied Physics (Nizhny Novgorod, Russia) and the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) such a 3-D ellipsoidal laser pulse system has been developed and afterwards installed at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ). The pulse shaping is realized using the spatial light modulator technique. This allows very fine amplitude modulation within a laser pulse. The characterization of the shape of the laser pulses can be done by cross-correlation measurements. Using this method the ability to generate and measure quasi ellipsoidal laser pulses has been demonstrated. In this contribution the overall set-up, working principle and first results received with the new photo cathode laser system at PITZ will be reported."
