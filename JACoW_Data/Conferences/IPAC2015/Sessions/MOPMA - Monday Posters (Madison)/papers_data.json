The design goal of the ring is to achieve a momentum acceptance of 3.8±10\\% GeV/c and a phase space acceptance of 2000 μm·rad. The design has many challenges because the acceptance will be affected by many nonlinearity terms with large particle emittance and/or large momentum offset. In this paper",

The technique and the cooling concept will be applied to design a cooling channel for the extracted muon beam at nuSTORM in the future study."

Microwave measurements of electron cloud in the Recycler show a corresponding dependence on the batch injection pattern. These electron cloud measurements are compared to those made with a retarding field analyzer (RFA) installed in a field-free region of the Recycler in November. RFAs are also used in the Main Injector to evaluate the performance of beampipe coatings for the mitigation of electron cloud. Contamination from an unexpected vacuum leak revealed a potential vulnerability in the amorphous carbon beampipe coating. The diamond-like carbon coating",

Light from an undulator (the pickup) is amplified and fed back onto the particle beam via another undulator (the kicker). Fermilab is currently exploring a possible proof-of-principle experiment of the OSC at the integrable-optics test accelerator (IOTA) ring. To implement effective OSC a good correction of phase distortions in the entire band of the optical amplifier is required. In this contribution we present progress in experimental characterization of phase distortions associated to a Titanium Sapphire crystal laser-gain medium (a possible candidate gain medium for the OSC experiment to be performed at IOTA). We also discuss a possible option for a mid-IR amplifier. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Space charge effects play an important role in the beam transport therein. A series of experiments were performed to determine the level of proton beam space charge neutralization by residual gas ionization",

The value of compensated space charge was determined through comparison of results of measurements and simulations using macroparticle method and envelope code.
