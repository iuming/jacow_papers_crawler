        "To suppress intra-bunch oscillations and to reduce particle losses",
        "the intra-bunch feedback (IBFB) system has been developed in 2014 for the J-PARC Main Ring (MR). A new BPM was also installed to the MR for the IBFB system. This BPM has a sufficient frequency response and position sensitivity(up to 1.5GHz within 15% fluctuation ). However",
        "a better performance may be needed in future for more precise analysis of internal motions (e.g. due to an electron cloud). We report the development of the BPM and precise measurement results of the BPM characteristics. We also report simulation studies of the digital equalizer which helps to reconstructs the beam shape from beam signals."

This approach allows us to reduce the effective plate surface. In this case we can decrease effects related to induced charges and currents. In the result of modelling optimal construction was developed. It includes 6 wires. The magnet aperture is about 5 cm. Calculated field rise time (about 1.5 ns) satisfies the conditions. Induced current effect reducing idea was confirmed. For configuration with 3 wires pair (with cross section of 2 mm) induced current in one wire is about 10% and in the wall is about 40%. However for design with plates current is about 40% and 20% respectively. Obtained magnet construction allows controlling of high field homogeneity by changing currents magnitudes in wires. In general we demonstrated the method of field optimization. Optimal kicker design was obtained. Wires using idea was substantiated."

      "abstract": "A distributed beam loss monitor based on the Cherenkov effect in optical fiber has been implemented for the VEPP­5 electron and positron linacs and the 510 MeV damping ring at the Budker INP. The monitor operation is based on detection of the Cherenkov radiation generated in optical fiber by means of relativistic particles created in electromagnetic shower after highly relativistic beam particles (electrons or positrons) hit the vacuum pipe. The main advantage of the distributed monitor compared to local ones is that a long optical fiber section can be used instead of a large number of local beam loss monitors. In our experiments the Cherenkov light was detected by photomultiplier tube (PMT). Timing of PMT signal gives the location of the beam loss. In the experiment with 20 m long optical fiber we achieved 3 m spatial resolution. To improve spatial resolution optimization and selection process of optical fiber and PMT are needed and according to our theoretical estimations 0.5 m spatial resolution can be achieved. We also suggest similar techniques for detection of electron (or positron) losses due to Touschek effect in storage rings. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "Three-dimensional* and planar** periodic structures can be used for non-destructive diagnostics of charged particle bunches. Here we consider the semi-infinite planar structure comprised of thin conducting parallel wires. If the period of the structure is much less than the typical wavelength of the electromagnetic field",
        "then the structure's influence can be described with help of the averaged boundary conditions***. We study radiation of a charged particle bunch with small transversal size and arbitrary longitudinal one in two cases: (i) the bunch moves orthogonally to the grid at some distance from the edge and (ii) it moves along the edge of the grid. The problems are solved analytically. In both cases the bunch generates a surface wave which contains the information about the size of the bunch. The shape of the surface waves is similar to the radiation generated in the presence of 3D periodical wire structures*",
        "however planar structure is simpler for use in accelerating system. Some typical numerical results for bunches of various shapes are given.",

Three prototypes were tested: 1) A feedback system based on high-resolution stripline BPMs was used to stabilise the beam orbit in the beamline region c. 50m upstream of the final focus. 2) Information from this system was used in a feed-forward mode to stabilise the beam locally at the final focus. 3) A final-focus local feedback system utilising cavity BPMs was deployed. In all three cases the degree of beam stabilisation was observed in high-precision cavity BPMs at the ATF2 interaction point. Latest results are reported on stabilising the beam position to below 100 nanometres."
