IPAC2015,,SUWSM1,"The Impact of ""Big Science"" on the U.S. Economy",ORNL; Oak Ridge; Tennessee; USA; In the United States; the era of “Big Science” began during World War II with the large-scale mobilization of science to develop the first nuclear weapons. When the war ended; the facilities established to support the Manhattan Project were transferred from military control to a new civilian Atomic Energy Commission; which was charged with managing them as national laboratories. Today; the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) oversees 17 national laboratories that function as a unique system for the conduct of Big Science; organizing and deploying multidisciplinary teams of researchers who make use of large-scale scientific instruments such as research reactors and accelerators to tackle compelling problems in science; energy; and security. The national laboratories have delivered a host of ideas and discoveries in support of DOE’s missions. The translation of these innovations to practice has had profound economic impacts across a wide range of sectors; from health care to housing to information technology to manufacturing. As the scale of Big Science continues to expand; driven by factors such as growth in international research collaborations and increasingly massive data sets; we can expect additional economic benefits to result from future innovations.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/suwsm1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/suwsm1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/suwsm1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-SUWSM1,

IPAC2015,,MOAB3,Commissioning Results of the New BPM Electronics of the ESRF Booster Synchrotron,I-Tech; Solkan; Slovenia; ESRF; Grenoble; France; The 75 BPM stations of the Booster Synchrotron of the ESRF have been equiped with new RF electronics from December 2014. This new BPM system is based on the commercial Libera-Spark system and now provides beam position data at various output rates; and with a possible time resolution even below that of the orbit-turn time (1 us). All modules are situated inside the Booster tunnel and powered by an Ethernet cable. This implies that the RF cables from the BPM blocks are less then 3 m and only a single trigger signal in daisy chain is sufficient to keep the 75 stations in turn-by-turn phase over the full energy ramping (200 MeV to 6 GeV) time of typically 50 ms. The high sensitivity of the system yields excellent performance at very low beam currents down to 1 0uA. Full results of the system; including the application as a high quality betatron tune monitor; will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/moab3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/moab3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/moab3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOAB3,24

An electron beam will be injected into the plasma cell to probe the accelerating wakefield. Challenging modifications in the area and new installations are required for AWAKE. First proton beam to the experiment is expected late 2016. The accelerating electron physics will start late 2017.

IPAC2015,,MOAC3,Coherent Phase Space Matching for Staging Plasma and Traditional Accelerator Using Longitudinally Tailored Plasma Structure,TUB; Beijing; People's Republic of China; For the further development of plasma based accelerators; phase space matching between plasma acceleration stages and between plasma stages and traditional accelerator components becomes a very critical issue for high quality high energy acceleration and its applications in light sources and colliders. Without proper matching; catastrophic emittance growth in the presence of definite energy spread may occur when the beam propagating through different stages and components due to the drastic differences of transverse focusing strength. In this paper we propose to use longitudinally tailored plasma structures as phase space matching components to properly guide the beam through stages. Theoretical analysis and full 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are utilized to show clearly how these structures may work in four different scenarios. Very good agreements between theory and simulations are obtained.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/moac3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/moac3.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/moac3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOAC3,

The value of the chromaticity in ATF2 is comparable with the expected chromaticity in ILC; but 4 times lower than in a design of CLIC. ATF2 gives the unique possibility to test operation at CLIC chromaticity values by reducing the vertical beta function at the IP by a factor of 4 (the inverse proportionality of chromaticity with beta function value at IP is assumed). The experience collected in this way would be beneficial for both ILC and CLIC projects. Simulations show that the multipolar errors and Final Doublet fringe fields spoil the IP beam sizes at ATF2. Either increasing a value of the horizontal beta function or installing a pair of octupole magnets mitigate the impact of these aberrations.

It can cause a significant emittance degradation and microbunching. We present a new high-performance 2D; particle-in-cell code which uses massively parallel multicore GPU/GPU platforms to alleviate computational bottlenecks. The code formulates the CSR problem from first principles by using the retarded scalar and vector potentials to compute the self-interaction fields.

We have measured the breakdown rate in several RF cavities operating at several frequencies. Cavities operating within solenoidal magnetic fields B > 0.25 T show an increased RF breakdown rate at lower gradients compared with similar operation when B = 0 T. Ultimately; this breakdown behavior limits the maximum safe operating gradient of the cavity. Beyond ionization cooling; this issue affects the design of photoinjectors and klystrons; among other applications. We have built an 805 MHz pillbox-type RF cavity to serve as an experimental testbed for this phenomenon.

Such an essential vacuum component; while operating in the range 40-60 K; has to ensure the vacuum performance and to prevent the beam-induced heating from reaching the cold bore which is at 1.9 K. In addition; they have to shield the cold mass from physics debris coming from the nearby beam collision points. To such purpose; energy absorbers made of tungsten alloy are installed onto the beam screen in the vacuum system. In this contribution; the proposed mechanical design is shown; it covers different thermomechanical aspects such as the behaviour during a magnet quench and the heat transfer from the tungsten absorbers to the cooling tubes.

Through this model; it has been observed that; according to the electromagnetic field; the injection temperature and the charge density; the electron flow can be classified in two different stationary modes: magnetic insulation mode where most of the electrons returning to the cathode after a transient time and Child-Langmuir mode where most of the electrons reach the anode after a transient time. Focusing on magnetic insulated mode; it has been found that charge density and injection temperature define whether electrons are accelerated (accelerating regime) or decelerated (space-charge limited regime) on the cathode. Besides; when the injection temperature is relatively low (high); a small charge increase causes (does not cause) an abrupt transition between accelerating and space-charge limited regime. Basing on the results; it was possible to identify a critical temperature that separates abrupt and continuous behavior.

In our work; we propose an adaptive PIC method with optimal point distribution and a generalized finite difference (GFD) scheme.

The partial differential equation is then discretized using a GFD method and solved with fast linear solvers. The density of computational particles is chosen adaptively; so that the error from GFD and that from Monte Carlo integration are balanced and the total error is approximately minimized.

The Action and Phase Jump Technique is one of the available methods to perform this task. For this method to work, it is necessary to have one BPM measurement at the IR, the region where the magnetic error is evaluated. In some cases, this BPM measurement become the biggest source of uncertainty when the action and phase jump technique is used. In this paper, a new formulation based on this method is presented. This new formulation doesn't make any use of BPM measurements at the IR, thereby allowing more robust error estimations. Quadrupole errors in the LHC lattice are estimated with this new formulation, using both, simulated data and LHC experimental data. A comparison with the previous formulation is included. The results on simulated data show that the reformulation leads to a reduction in the uncertainty, while for the experimental case, the reduction is not so clear.

Typically; the x-ray spectrum from these sources extends up to 140 keV and this range covers the demand for most practical applications. The parameters of the electron beam determine the spectral brilliance of the x-ray source. The electron beam produced at the Fermilab new facility Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) meets the requirements to assemble an experimental high brilliance CR x-ray source. In the first stage of the experiment the energy of the beam is 20 MeV and due to the very low emittance (100 nm) at low bunch charge (20 pC) the expected average brilliance of the x-ray source is 0.8x107 photons/[s-(mm-mrad)2-0.1%BW]. In the second stage of the experiment the beam energy will be increased to 50 MeV and consequently the average brilliance will be 4.8x108 photons/[s-(mm-mrad)2-0.1%BW].

Multibunch tracking simulations predict that this threshold can be increased to several times its original value through the introduction of bunch lengthening harmonic cavities. One previously suggested explanation is the narrower spectra of the elongated bunches but reliable estimates for the threshold currents are not obtainable for anything other than rigid beam motion since the usual Sacherer formulism is not directly applicable to beams in a non-harmonic potential. A new scheme has been developed in which the decay time of a higher than zeroth order transverse head-tail mode may be estimated by taking into account the synchrotron tune spread generated by the harmonic cavity potential. This scheme is presented along with the results of numerical simulations performed in order to confirm the analytical predictions and justify the assumptions made.

The ThomX accelerator facility is composed by a 50-70 MeV linac driven by 3 GHz RF gun; a transfer line and a 18 meters long Storage Ring (SR). The Compton backscattering at each revolution between the 1 nC electron bunch and the 25 mJ laser pulses stacked in the Fabry-Perot cavity results in the production of ~1013 photons per second with energies in the X-ray regime. This high flux of the X-rays strongly depends on the quality (beam sizes) of the electron beam at the interaction point. To guarantee this; a good knowledge and quality of the linear lattice of the ThomX SR are required. Nowadays; LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits) is a well-known and widely used algorithm to measure and restore the linear optics of the SRs and ensure the designed performances.

Goetsch et al.,,"The beam lifetime in electron storage rings concerns machines running in decay mode as well as machines doing top-up. A standard procedure to increase the lifetime is via bunch lengthening as the lifetime depends on the electron density in the bunch. Bunch lengthening is typically achieved with higher harmonic (Landau) cavities. As noted in *, there are several advantages in using a different approach: it is possible to increase the bunch length by installing a Transverse Gradient (Robinson) Wiggler, which allows to transfer damping between the horizontal and the longitudinal plane.

IPAC2015,,MOPWA020,Longitudinal Stability Of Short Bunches in Storage Rings with Strong Longitudinal Focusing,HZB; Berlin; Germany; In the BESSY VSR project; the variable bunch length storage ring; two high gradient accelerating structures at 1.5 and 1.75 GHz will be phased such that long and short bunches can be stored simultaneously. The longitudinal stability of the short bunches is investigated taking into account the shielded CSR- and a purely inductive impedance. Multi particle tracking studies and numerical solutions of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation show that threshold currents for short bunches do not follow the simple scaling law which was found for long bunches. The inductive impedance can even lower the thresholds for the instability. With an 80 times increased accelerating gradient and reasonable assumptions on the inductive impedance for shorter bunches stable operation can be expected with bunches 1.8 ps long (RMS-value) and 0.8 mA current. According to the calculations and operating in a dedicated low-α mode will produce stable 40 μA bunches with 400 fs length,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwa020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwa020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwa020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA020,135

Within the FAIR project the laser cooling will be applied to high intensity and high energy beams for the first time. The laser cooling results in a further increase of the longitudinal phase space density and in non-Gaussian longitudinal beam profiles. In order to ensure stable operation and optimize the cooling process the interplay of the laser force and high intensity effects has to be studied numerically. This contribution will identify constrains of the cooling scheme for an efficient reduction of momentum spread. For high beam energies the scattering of photons has to be treated stochastically instead of using averaged forces.

The amount of beam flatness has been controlled by setting the solenoid field strength only. Increase of the product of the two transverse emittances is purely due to the stripping process that occurs anyway along an ion linac. Beams with different amounts of flatness were injected into a synchrotron applying horizontal multi-turn injection.

The set values for any accelerator are derived from a machine model; implemented by accelerator physicists using the features of the LSA framework. In view of the large number of accelerators in the FAIR facility; the aim is to develop a generic model; applicable to any of those machines. This requires the introduction of an additional logical layer on top of the LSA framework; ensuring the coherence of the modeling strategy across all accelerators. Following this design concept; a prototype of the FAIR settings management system has been realized at GSI; providing support for a large number of operation modes relevant for the later operation of FAIR.

We present studies of the long range electron cloud wakefields generated in electron clouds after interaction with relativistic proton bunch trains.

This task includes computational intensive numerical studies. To obtain the full eigenfrequency spectra most of these studies are performed in 3D; require a great amount of computation resources and thus are limited to a few hundred or thousand eigenmodes. To overcome this issue; some codes make use of the axisymmetric geometry of most of the RF-cavity-resonator structures and solve the problem in 2D. Solving in 2D however reduces the eigenmode spectra to eigenmodes with no azimuthal dependencies (so called monopole-modes). Due to the lack of freely available and easy to use 2.5D eigenmode solvers which are able to solve for the full 3D field in a reduced 2.5 dimensional problem; we developed yet another cavity solver (Yacs); a simple FEM based solver capable of solving for the full 3D eigenmodes of axisymmetric problems while only requiring a fraction of the computation resources required by most modern 3D codes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwa033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwa033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwa033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA033,175

Even under the assumption of strongest available damping of beam induced modes; the residual impedances of the cavities may cause collective multibunch instabilities at the frontier of stability available from current bunch-by-bunch feedback systems. At the DELTA electron storage ring; a phase modulation of the driving RF is used to suppress coupled-bunch instabilities and to increase the lifetime. The time dependent frequency variation in the order of the synchrotron frequency gives rise to additional damping of the bunch oscillators by decoherence and Landau damping. The behaviour and the additional damping of the bunch oscillators is investigated by the existing bunch-by-bunch feedback system e.g. the increase of the overall damping might support the capability of feedback systems under extreme operating conditions of BESSY-VSR.; * G.

The monitor theorem is based on an uncoupled case study described by the author in an earlier work and has been generalized as well as simplified in mathematical abstraction to provide a reliable and computationally stable framework for beam optics measurements. It is based on a closed-orbit measurement utilizing 4 dipole correctors (2 for each plane). The corrector theorem allows to obtain parameters of these dipole correctors using two turn-by-turn monitors at almost arbitrary positions in the ring (which do not need to be located in a drift space); so that it is possible to uniquely resolve closed orbits into optical parameters without sophisticated lattice models.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwa035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwa035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwa035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA035,183

The virtual probe can then be used for precise field control in case the probe signal is missing or corrupted. It can also be used to detect any deviation from the nominal probe profile.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwa040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwa040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwa040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA040,200

This operates in 40; 60; 480 or 960 bunches with 100 mA at an electron beam energy of 6 GeV. The horizontal beam emittance is 1nmrad while a coupling of 1% amounts to a vertical emittance of 10 pm-rad. The low emittance is achieved by deploying 80m of damping wigglers in two sections in west and north. Some of these undulators and wiggler devices have accumulated total radiation doses of about 100 kGy. Visible corrosion at the magnet structures of some permanent magnet undulators is seen. High dose rate measured regularly by Thermo Luminescent Dosimeters (TLDs) are monitored; which lead to inspect the magnetic field of all insertion devices in the PETRA tunnel. We are investigating particle losses with tracking simulation using SixTrack to gain a certain understanding of the radiation damage of the insertion devices. The goal is to develop a strategy to safeguard the insertion devices from further radiation damage.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwa041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwa041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwa041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA041,203

This method is based on two facts: in the equation of the spin precession the magnetic field dependence is entirely eliminated and at “magic” energy the spin precession frequency coincides with the precession frequency of the momentum. In case of deuteron the anomalous magnetic moment is negative (G=-0.142); therefore we have to use the electrical and magnetic field simultaneously keeping the frozen spin direction along the momentum as in the pure electrostatic ring. In this article we suggest the concept of the quasi-frozen spin when the spin oscillates around the momentum direction within the half value of the advanced spin phase each time returning back by special optics. Due to the low value of the anomalous magnetic moment of deuteron an effective contribution to the expected EDM effect is reduced only by a few percent.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwa044_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwa044.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwa044_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA044,213

The new interaction region also exploits the crab waist collision scheme; but features certain complications including the experimental detector solenoid; compensating anti-solenoids; and tilted quadrupole magnets. We have performed simulations of the beam-beam collisions in the collider taking into account the real DAΦNE nonlinear lattice. In particular; we have evaluated the effect of crab waist sextupoles and beam-beam interactions on the DAΦNE dynamical aperture and energy acceptance; and estimated the luminosity that can be potentially achieved with and without crab waist sextupoles in the present working conditions. A numerical analysis has been performed in order to propose possible steps for further luminosity increase in DAΦNE such as a better working point choice; crab sextupole strength optimization; correction of the phase advance between the sextupoles and the interaction region.

IPAC2015,,MOPWA050,Beam Dynamics Studies to Develop a High-energy Luminosity Model for the LHC,Rome University La Sapienza; Roma; Italy; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Luminosity; the key figure of merit of a collider as the LHC; depends on the brightness of the colliding beams. This makes the intensity dependent beam-beam effect the dominant performance limiting factor at collision. The parasitic interactions due to the electromagnetic mutual influence of the beams in the interaction region of a collider induce a diffusive behaviour in the tails of the beam. The evolution of charge density distribution is studied to model the beam tails evolution in order to characterize beam lifetime and luminosity. To achieve this; tools are developed for tracking distributions of arbitrary number of single particles interacting with the opposing strong-beam; to analyse the halo formation processes due to the combined effect of beam-beam and machine non-linearities. This paper presents preliminary results of the simulations; both for the LHC Run I and nominal LHC parameters.

The uniform beam is formed as follows: An ion beam extracted from the cyclotron is multiply-scattered with a thin foil so that the transverse beam intensity distribution can be smoothed into a Gaussian-like distribution; critical to the formation of a highly uniform distribution. Then; the tail of the Gaussian-like distribution is folded into the inside by the nonlinear force of octupole magnets and eventually a uniform intensity distribution can be formed on a target. Typically; the area and uniformity of the beam are over 100 cm2 and below 10%; respectively.

IPAC2015,,MOPWA065,Uniformization of the Transverse Beam Profile by a New Type Nonlinear Magnet,G. Gu; W.B. Liu; IHEP; Beijing; People's Republic of China; The uniform particle beam is desirable in many beam applications. One method to get this type of beam distribution is using octupoles; but loss of particles in the halo will be produced by this method. To reduce the beam loss; a new type of magnet is proposed in this paper. The field in the middle region of the new type magnet is similar to the octupole magnet field; but the rate of rise decline quickly in the edge. So that the particle in the edge experience a lower magnet field; and this would result in less particle loss. We also add a mechanical structure on the new type magnet to make it possible to adjust the size of middle region. So that the magnet can adapt to different transverse dimensions of the beam; and this would further reduce particle loss. Some numerical simulations have been done respectively with octuples and the new type of magnet. The simulation results show that the new type of magnet could get the uniform distribution of particle beam with less particle loss. We are processing a magnet now; and an experiment to test the magnet will be arranged on CPHS.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwa065_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwa065.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwa065_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA065,272

In this paper; a quite simple and inexpensive technique is proposed to smooth the electron beam current profile to suppress the instability. By directly adding a short undulator with transverse gradient field right after the injector to couple the transverse spread into the longitudinal direction; additional density mixing in the electron beam is introduced to smooth the current profile; which results in the reduction of the gain of the microbunching instability. The magnitude of the density mixing can be easily controlled by turning the strength of the undulator magnet field.

In the first meters of the accelerator; the non- linear space-charge force dominates the dynamics of the beam. The Drift Tube Linac; the Spoke resonators and the elliptical cavities; which are responsible for the 99.8% of the total energy gained by the beam along the accelerator; produce a significant longitudinal non-linear force on the proton beam. In this paper; we introduce a new theory to transport the probability density function of the beam under the effect of non-linear forces.

Around 500 high-impedance flanges of 8 different types have been identified. Three factors play an important role in the characterization of these flanges: the type of vacuum chambers that the flange interconnects; whether or not both sides are electrically isolated (by means of an enamel coating) and; finally; the presence of damping resistors which damp high-Q resonances. Not only; full-wave electromagnetic field simulations; but also RF measurements have been used to evaluate the impedance of these elements. The R/Q of the relevant resonances was measured using the well-known bead-pull technique. In particular; a subset of around 150 flanges has been found to be the source of a high-impedance resonance at 1.4 GHz; also observed in beam measurements.

A simpler injection protocol without energy modulation is here analyzed in detail to find the optimum initial conditions in terms of bucket filling and reduction of transverse and longitudinal space charge effects; with the advantage of minimizing the number of turns for the LHC beams.

The measurement requires detecting protons at distances as small as 1 mm from the beam center: TOTEM uses Roman Pots (RP); special beam pipe insertions; to move silicon detectors close to the beams to detect particles very near the beam axis. In the first period of running of the LHC no problems were detected with retracted Roman Pots and during insertions in special runs; however; during close insertions to highest intensity beam; impedance heating has been observed. After the LS1 the LHC beam current will increase and the equipment that can interact with the beam needed to be optimized. A new RP; optimized to minimize the beam coupling; has been designed with the help of CST Particle Studio; a prototype has been used to test the simulation results in the laboratory with wire and probe measurements.

Measurements over the past years indicate that the ATF2 vertical beam size strongly rises with bunch intensity. Several different origins of this increase are considered; e.g. wakefields occurring between the ATF damping ring and the IP; and/or intrabeam scattering (IBS) causing the increase of transverse emittances and energy spread in the damping ring with the increase of the bunch intensity. In this paper we address the second possibility. Past measurements and simulations of the IBS effects in the ATF are used to model the intensity-dependent initial emittances and energy spread at the entrance of the final focus. Particle tracking simulations predict the IP vertical beam size growth expected from the known optical aberrations for initial beam parameters corresponding to varying bunch intensities. Comparing simulation results with emittance measurements at different locations allows us to draw some conclusions about the impact of IBS in the damping ring on the IP spot size; and about possible single-bunch wakefields in the ATF2.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopje065_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopje065.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopje065_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPJE065,455

The reduction of the EC density as a function of machine operation time (scrubbing) is attributed to the growth of a low SEY carbon film induced by electron bombardment. In this paper; we study the time evolution of the conditioning of stainless steel beam pipes in a laboratory setup. The EC or multipacting is induced by Radio-Frequency (RF) fields in a coaxial resonator under vacuum. Strip detectors are used to monitor the current of the EC. Induced pressure rise is simultaneously detected. The multipacting intensity shows a linear dependence on the positive DC bias voltage up to 1000 V; applied to the central electrode. An accelerated conditioning is observed for the applied bias voltage. The SEY of samples exposed to the EC is measured and the surface composition is monitored by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.

Dipoles and quadrupoles are often based on hard-edged approximations. This is not only unrealistic; it also significantly slows down time-domain spacecharge tracking codes such as the General Particle Tracer (GPT) code. The underlying reason for the poor performance is that despite the fact that the simple hard-edged field equations are fast to evaluate; they force the integration process to use excessively small step sizes near the fields discontinuities in order to achieve the desired accuracy. In other worlds; the apparently simple equations turn out to be the most difficult ones to evaluate numerically. An obvious solution is to switch to field-maps; but this is not practical in the early design stages. In this contribution we show a new solution implemented in the GPT code based on analytical expressions for the fringes where the transverse size of the magnet is properly taken into account. In addition to producing more realistic results; the smooth fields increase tracking speed by over an order of magnitude for typical test cases.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopje075_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopje075.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopje075_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPJE075,489

Examples of the latter are short pulse; high charge; low emittance and low price. The classical solution to handle such problems is to combine all objectives into one merit function. This however implicitly assumes that the tradeoffs between all objectives are a-priori known. Especially in the early design stages this is hardly ever the case. A popular solution to this problem is to switch to multi-objective genetic optimization algorithms. This class of algorithms solves the problem by genetically optimising an entire population of sample solutions.

The Geant4 toolkit is used to give a full range of physics processes needed to simulate both the interaction of primary particles and the production and subsequent propagation of secondaries. BDSIM has already been used to simulate linear accelerators such as the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC); but it has recently been adapted to simulate circular accelerators as well; producing loss maps for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

A nominal design has previously been presented; featuring a lattice and optical configuration to focus one of the proton beams of the LHC (reaching a value of β*=10 cm) and to collide it head-on with an electron beam to produce collisions with the desired luminosity of L=1033 cm-2 s-1. The proton beam optics is achieved with the aid of a new inner triplet of quadrupoles at L*=10 m from the interaction point and the extension of the Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing (ATS) Scheme used for the High Luminosity-LHC project. The flexibility of this design has been studied in terms of minimising β* and increasing L*. In this work; particle tracking is performed in a thin lens approximation of the LHeC proton lattice to compute the dynamic aperture and perform frequency map analysis for different types of chromatic correction schemes; in order to find the one who will provide the most beam stability and to study the effects of non linearities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopje079_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopje079.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopje079_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPJE079,502

To achieve higher luminosities the β-function at the IP is decreased; which in turn will result in the hourglass effect becoming more prominent as the transverse bunch sizes become comparable to the length of the bunch. This effect reduces the luminosity since not all particles in the bunch will collide at the minimum IP. The standard derivation of the electric and magnetic fields of the beam-beam interaction is that undertaken by Bassetti and Erskine. The derivation by Bassetti Erskine does not include a coupling between bunch planes. When the transverse bunch sizes are comparable to the length of the bunch the magnitude of the transverse kick will be dependent on the longitudinal position. Currently only numerical methods are available to evaluate this effect. Here a theoretical framework is outlined that provides an analytical approach to derive the electric field for the beam-beam interaction with a coupling between the transverse and longitudinal planes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopje082_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopje082.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopje082_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPJE082,510

It enables the detection of the 2-dimensional transverse beam profile of essentially any charged particle beam with negligible disturbance of the primary beam and accelerator vacuum. Secondly; a monitor based on the Silicon strip VELO detector; originally developed for the LHCb experiment; was tested as an online beam monitor at the Clatterbridge Cancer Center in the UK.

IPAC2015,,MOPMA015,Applications of an MPI Enhanced Simulated Annealing Algorithm on nuSTORM and 6D Muon Cooling,Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; The nuSTORM decay ring is a compact racetrack storage ring with a circumference  ∼ 480 m using large aperture (∅=60 cm) magnets. The design goal of the ring is to achieve a momentum acceptance of 3.8±10\% GeV/c and a phase space acceptance of 2000 μm·rad. The design has many challenges because the acceptance will be affected by many nonlinearity terms with large particle emittance and/or large momentum offset. In this paper; we present the application of a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm to the sextupole correction in the ring. The algorithm is capable of finding a balanced compromise among corrections of the nonlinearity terms; and finding the largest acceptance.

This introduces much higher intensities into the Recycler than it has had before. Meeting radiation safety requirements with high intensity operations requires understanding the ef- fects of space charge induced tune spreads and resulting halo formation; and aperture restrictions in the real machine to de- velop a collimation strategy.

During slip-stacking; the Recycler or the Main Injector stores two particles beams that spatially overlap but have different momenta. The two particle beams are longitudinally focused by two 53 MHz 100 kV RF cavities with a small frequency difference between them. We propose an additional 106 MHz 20 kV RF cavity; with a frequency at the double the average of the upper and lower main RF frequencies.

Microwave measurements of electron cloud in the Recycler show a corresponding dependence on the batch injection pattern.

RFAs are also used in the Main Injector to evaluate the performance of beampipe coatings for the mitigation of electron cloud.

Landau damping can suppress these instabilities; which requires energy spread in the beam or introducing nonlinear magnets such as octupoles. However; this approach reduces dynamic aperture. Nonlinear integrable optics can suppress parametric instabilities independent of energy spread in the distribution; while preserving the dynamic aperture. This novel approach promises to reduce particle losses and enable order-of-magnitude increases in beam intensity. In this paper we present results; obtained using the Lie operator formalism; on how chromaticity and dispersion affect particle orbits in integrable optics. We conclude that chromaticity in general breaks the integrability; unless the vertical and horizontal chromaticities are equal. Because of this; the chromaticity correcting magnets can be weaker and fewer correcting magnet families are required; thus minimizing the impact on dynamic aperture.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopma028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopma028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopma028_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPMA028,608

IPAC2015,,MOPMA044,Barrier Shock Compression with Longitudinal Space Charge,UMD; College Park; Maryland; USA; Synchrotrons and storage rings routinely employ RF barrier buckets as a means of accumulating charge to increase the peak intensity and preserve longitudinal emittance while minimizing emittance growth [1-3]. This was shown in the main injector and recycler at Fermilab as well as the SIS-18 at GSI Helmholtz center for heavy ion research. The RF cavities typically used are ferrite loaded magnetic alloys with low Q to maximize bandwidth and generate single pulses; either as delta functions; triangular or half/full period sine waves. The University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) group is studying a novel scheme of bunch compression in the presence of longitudinal space charge. It has been analytically shown through 1-D computations that the presence of space-charge considerably improves the efficiency of the barrier compression by taking advantage of the shock-front that launches when the barrier moves into a space-charge dominated beam. In this paper; we summarize the initial results of the study.,,"B. Beaudoin, I. Haber, R.A. Kishek reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopma044_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopma044.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopma044_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPMA044,646

As one of the top ten algorithms of the 20th century; it has been applied in a wide range of fields. The FMM complexity is O(N); where N is the number of articles; allowing for large-scale simulations. However; it includes all the two-body collisional forces; in contrast to other methods such as the popular particle in-cell (PIC) methods. While collisionality can be very important; many applications require only the mean field effects. PIC is frequently used in this regime. Due to recent concerns of unphysical effects of grids; interpolation and other approximations in PIC codes; an alternative based on different underlying assumptions would prove enlightening. For these cases; a smoothed or softened FMM using a Plummer-like smoothing parameter holds much promise. Unfortunately; the original FMM based on analytic expansions of the 1/r-like potentials does not allow for Plummer softening. We present our new soft-FMM employing differential algebras (DA) to obtain the modified expansions. We also compare the performance of the smoothed DA-FMM with examples from PIC simulations.,,"* L.

The built-in compensation and tune knobs have demonstrated to be highly useful to allow transparent operation of the storage ring. To fully understand the effectiveness of the lattice tuning scheme; experiments have been carried to characterize the betatron tune knobs.

Finally; at the FEL a wiggler interaction code such as GENESIS; GINGER; or MINERVA must be used. These codes may be optimized to work with a wide range in magnitude of macro-particle numbers (from 104-108 in different codes) and have different input formats. It is therefore necessary to have translator codes to provide a bridge between each section. It is essential that these translators be able to preserve the statistical properties of the bunch while raising or lowering the number of macro-particles used between codes. In this work we show a suite of such translators designed to facilitate S2E simulations of an FEL with a new wiggler code; MINERVA; and use these codes to provide benchmarking of MINERVA against other common wiggler simulation codes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopma054_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopma054.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopma054_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPMA054,675

In the quasi-3D algorithm; the fields and currents are expanded into azimuthal harmonics and only a limited number of harmonics are kept. Field equations in (r; z) space are solved for a desired number of harmonics in φ. To suppress the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI) that inevitably arises due to the relativistic plasma drift in the simulation; we use a hybrid Yee-FFT solver in which the field equations are solved in (kz; r) space; where \hat{z} is the drifting direction. Preliminary results show that high fidelity LWFA boosted frame simulations can be carried out with no evidence of the NCI. Good agreement is found when comparing LWFA boosted frame simulations in the full 3D geometry against those in the quasi-3D geometry. In addition; we discuss how the moving window can be combined with the hybrid Yee-FFT solver to further speed up the simulation.

The stability of the beam charge at PHIL is a key issue for the succeful operation of the physic experiences that use the machine. At PHIL; the beam charge is quite stable; but we often note a slow charge drift on long duration experiences. Two ICTs; and a back-end electronics are used to monitor the stability of the beam charge; with an accuracy of about 1pC. Several types of jitter can impact the stability of the beam charge. The fluctuations of the RF power or the RF-laser relative phase drift could have significant influence; due to temperature variations that produce cables dilataion; and electronic components overheating. To correct the phase drift; we describe a method based on a slow analog-digital feedback loop between the RF wave in the gun (3 GHz) and the synchronisation signal of the laser (75MHz). It allows to maintain the jitter between the laser pulse and the RF wave stable at a very low value.

We developed a model based on the numerical solution of the 1D drift-diffusion equations; using the Scharfetter-Gummel discretization scheme. Inhomogeneity of the space-charge distribution together with the externally applied electric field are taken into account by analytically solving the Poisson equation at each time step. We identified two regimes of charge collection. The first corresponds to 1-105 MIPs; in this case the externally applied electric field is negligibly perturbed by space-charge effects during the separation of the electron/hole clouds. The second corresponds to intensities larger than 107 MIPs; where the space-charge effects significantly slow down the charge collection due to large concentrations of electron/hole pairs in the DS volume.

One of the most critical issues for the beam halo measurement is to reach high dynamic range. Two in vacuum diamond sensor beam halo scanners (DSv) with four strips each have been developed for the investigation of beam halo transverse distributions at ATF2. The first DSv was installed for horizontal beam halo scanning after the interaction point (IP) of ATF2; in Nov. 2014. It aims to measure the beam halo distribution with large dynamic range (~106); and investigate the possibility of probing the Compton recoil electrons produced in the interaction with the IPBSM laser beams.

Operating in continuous wave at high average accelerating field of 20 MV/m and phased at zero-crossing; the superconducting cavities have to be detuned within tight margins to ensure stable operation and low power consumption at a loaded Q of 5·107. The field variation of the cavities is mainly driven by the repetitive transient beam-loading of the envisaged complex bunch fill pattern in the ring. Within this work combined LLRF-cavity and longitudinal beam dynamics simulation will demonstrate the limits for stable operation; especially the coupling between synchrotron oscillation and RF feedback settings.

Investigations showed; that the maximum beam current is currently limited by excitation of beam instabilities. For separated characterization of single bunch instabilities from multi-bunch ones; a high beam current stored in a single revolving bunch is required. These high beam currents can only be achieved by accumulation of many shots from the injector. The existing timing system is not capable of single bunch injection and accumulation in the main stretcher ring. Therefore a new FPGA based timing system; synchronized to the RF system of the accelerator; has been developed which will completely supersede the existing one. Simultaneously the ‘‘slow'' timing system; providing trigger signals for the typically 6 s long accelerator cycle; is also modernized using a similar FPGA based solution to achieve a much better duty cycle during standard operation.

The source of the degradation was found to be repeated striking of cavity surfaces with errant beam pulses. The Machine Protection System (MPS) was designed to turn the beam off during a fault condition in less than 20 μseconds [2] as these errant beam pulses were not unexpected. Unfortunately an improperly operating MPS was not turning off the beam within the designed 20 μseconds; and the SRF cavities were being damaged. The MPS issues were corrected; and the SRF performance was restored with cavity thermal cycling and RF processing. However; the SRF cavity performance has continued to degrade; though at a reduced rate compared to 2009.

It operates in cw-mode at a radio frequency of 3 GHz and provides either unpolarized or polarized electron beams. Before entering the main accelerator the electron beam passes both; a normal-conducting injector beamline for beam preparation and a superconducting 10 MeV injector beamline for preacceleration. The phase of the beam which is injected into the 40 MeV main accelerator is crucial for the efficiency of the acceleration process and the minimization of the energy spread. Due to thermal drifts of the normal-conducting injector cavities this injection phase varies by about 0.2 degree over a timescale of an hour. In order to compensate these drifts; a high level phase controller has been implemented. It adjusts the phase measured at an rf-monitor at the exit of the superconducting injector by changing the phase of a prebuncher in the normal-conducting injector beamline.

Using selectively kicked bunches; betatron phase advance; as well as potential growth of the betatron oscillation amplitude and the Twiss parameters alpha and beta can be extracted from BPM data. If done periodically; this data can be compiled into a long-term history that is accessible via the control system. This way it is possible to identify potential sources of beam optics errors. At FLASH the procedure could be implemented as a server/client tool. Since the whole procedure takes less than five seconds; operation is not disturbed significantly. In this work the possible implementation of the procedure is presented.

At the ANKA storage ring of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT); we have a dedicated visible light diagnostics beamline and two additional beam ports close to the radiation's source point. The visible light diagnostics beamline hosts a time-correlated single-photon-counting unit to measure the bunch filling pattern and a streak camera for longitudinal diagnostics. Recently; the beamline has been extended with a fast-gated intensified camera to study transverse instabilities. The synchrotron light monitor ports were previously used for direct source imaging. Due to the diffraction limit the vertical beam size could not be resolved. One of the two ports has recently been equipped with a double-slit to allow for interferometric measurements of the vertical beam size.

Using the method of electro-optical spectral decoding (EOSD); the current setup made it possible to study longitudinal beam dynamics (e.g. microbunching) occurring during ANKA's low-alpha-operation with sub-ps resolution (granularity). However; the setup induces strong wake-fields spanning the distance between consecutive bunches which cause heat load to the in-vacuum setup for high beam currents. This heat load in turn leads to a laser misalignment thus preventing measurements during multi-bunch operation. Fortunately; the EOSD setup also allows us to directly study these wake-fields so simulation results can be compared to measurement data. This paper reviews possible changes of the setup's geometry with respect to a reduction of the wakefield effects.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopha038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopha038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopha038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPHA038,869

The experimental layout consists of an optical setup; which magnifies the image of the beam in the horizontal and demagnifies it in the vertical plane to obtain a projection of the horizontal beam shape; the camera itself and a fast scanning galvanometric mirror that sweeps this image across the sensor.

The producing of radiation in the so-called THz-gap is challenging; but this intense THz radiation is very attractive for certain user experiments. The high degree of compression in this so-called low-alpha optics leads to a complex longitudinal dynamics of the electron bunches. The resulting micro-bunching instability leads to time dependent fluctuations and strong bursts in the radiated THz power. The study of these fluctuations in the emitted THz radiation provides insight into the longitudinal beam dynamics. Fast THz detectors combined with KAPTURE; the dedicated KArlsruhe Pulstaking and Ultrafast Readout Electronics system developed at KIT; allow the simultaneous measurement of the radiated THz intensity for each bunch individually in a multi-bunch environment.

In this study; the femtosecond electron beams were generated using a laser photocathode radio-frequency gun linac and a magnetic bunch compressor.

The monitor operation is based on detection of the Cherenkov radiation generated in optical fiber by means of relativistic particles created in electromagnetic shower after highly relativistic beam particles (electrons or positrons) hit the vacuum pipe. The main advantage of the distributed monitor compared to local ones is that a long optical fiber section can be used instead of a large number of local beam loss monitors. In our experiments the Cherenkov light was detected by photomultiplier tube (PMT). Timing of PMT signal gives the location of the beam loss. In the experiment with 20 m long optical fiber we achieved 3 m spatial resolution. To improve spatial resolution optimization and selection process of optical fiber and PMT are needed and according to our theoretical estimations 0.5 m spatial resolution can be achieved.

Beam of this power must be strictly monitored by a specialized Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) System to detect any abnormal losses and to ensure that operational losses do not lead to excessive activation. A long series of beam loss simulations was performed using MARS Monte Carlo code system in order to optimize the number and setting mounting locations of the detectors for best coverage; distinguishability and sensitivity. Simulations anticipated multiple possible beam loss scenarios resulting in different loss patterns. The results of energy deposition in air in the linac tunnel in multiple locations were analysed in several different ways. Incorporated methods varied from simple brute force approach to more sophisticated singular value decomposition based algorithms; all resulting in detector layout proposals. Locations selected for BLMs were evaluated for all methods.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopty047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopty047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopty047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPTY047,

To optimize the operational efficiency of the ESS facility allowing for very high beam availability with high reliability towards the end-users; accidents should be avoided and interruptions of beam operation have to be rare and limited to a short time. Finding the right balance between efficient protection of equipment from damage and high beam availability is the key idea on which the ESS Machine Protection Strategy is being based on. Implementing and realizing the measures needed to provide the correct level of machine protection in case of a complex facility like the ESS; requires a systematic approach; which will be discussed in this paper. A method of how to derive machine protection relevant requirements and how to assure completeness of these will be outlined as well.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopty048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopty048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopty048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPTY048,

In order to protect this equipment from damage (e.g. due to overheating) and to take the appropriate actions required to minimise recovery time; a dedicated magnet powering interlock system is being designed. The magnet powering interlock system will safely switch off a PS upon the detection of an internal magnet or PS failure and inform the beam interlock system to inhibit further beam operation. The different failure modes and related mitigation techniques of magnets and their PS will be presented. Failures of the magnet cooling system can be detected for example by interlocking the opening of a thermo-switch or a flow-switch. To achieve the required level of dependability; an interlock system based on safety PLC technology; distributed safety PLC software programming tools; PROFINET fieldbus networking; and current loops for hardwired interlock signal exchanges; has been prototyped and will be discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopty050_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopty050.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopty050_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPTY050,

These studies have shown that the range of the 7 TeV LHC proton beam is significantly extended compared to that of a single proton due to hydrodynamic tunneling effect. For instance; it was evaluated that the protons and their showers will penetrate up to a length of 25 m in solid carbon compared to a static range of around 3 m. To check the validity of these simulations; beam- target heating experiments using the 440 GeV proton beam generated by the SPS were performed at the HiRadMat test facility at CERN *. Solid copper targets were facially irradiated by the beam and measurements confirmed hydrodynamic tunneling of the protons and their showers. Simulations have been done by running the energy deposition code FLUKA and the 2D hydrodynamic code; BIG2; iteratively.

The main task of the system is to prevent the superconducting magnets from quenching and protect the machine components from damage; as a result of critical beam losses. The BLM system therefore requests a beam abort when the measured dose in the chambers exceeds a threshold value. During Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) a series of modifications were made to the system. Based on the experience from Run 1 and from improved simulation models; all the threshold settings were revised; and modified where required. This was done to improve the machine safety at 7 TeV; and to reduce beam abort requests when neither a magnet quench or damage to machine components is expected. In addition to the updates of the threshold values; about 800 monitors were relocated. This improves the response to unforeseen beam losses in the millisecond time scale due to micron size dust particles present in the vacuum chamber.

During the rise of the extraction kickers to their full strength a particle-free abort gap; with a length of 3 us in the LHC filling pattern; is required to prevent beam losses that could lead to substantial quenching of magnets; with a risk of damage. Therefore the particle population in the abort gap; which is mainly due to un-bunched beam; is monitored. Above a certain threshold an active cleaning by excitation of betatron oscillations with the transverse feedback system is initiated. This paper describes a novel method of monitoring the abort gap population using diamond particle detectors for detecting the interactions of beam in the abort gap with neon gas; injected in the beam pipe.

The existing BLM system using ionization chambers is not adequate to resolve losses with a time resolution below some 10 us. Ionization chambers are also not adequate to measure very large transient losses; e.g. beam impacting on collimators. Diamond particle detectors with bunch-by-bunch resolution have therefore been used in LHC to measure fast particle losses with a time resolution down to a level of single bunches. Diamond detectors have also successfully been used for material damage studies in other facilities; e.g. HiRadMat at the CERN-SPS. To fully understand their potential; such detectors were characterized with an electron beam at the BTF in LNF INFN Italy; with bunch intensities from 103 to 109 electrons. The detector response and efficiency has been measured with a 50 Ω and a 1 Ω read-out system. This paper describes the experimental setup and the results of the experiment.

Major diagnostics R&D components are improved rf beam position processing using commercially available fpga based bpm processors; new XRay beam position monitors sensitive only to hard X-rays; mechanical motion sensing and remediation to detect and correct long term drift and a new feedback system featuring a tenfold increase in sampling rate and a several-fold increase in the number of fast correctors and bpms. Feedback system development represents a major effort and we are pursuing development of a novel algorithm that integrates orbit correction for both slow and fast correctors down to DC simultaneously.

They have investigated a hadron monitor to diagnose the primary/secondary beam quality. The existing hadron monitor based on an ionization chamber is not robust in the high-radiation environment vicinity of MW-class secondary particle production targets. We propose a gas-filled RF resonator to use as the hadron monitor since it is simple and hence radiation robust in this environment. When charged particles pass through the resonator they produce ionized plasma via the Coulomb interaction with the inert gas. The beam-induced plasma changes the permittivity of inert gas. As a result; a resonant frequency in the resonator shifts with the amount of ionized electrons. The radiation sensitivity is adjustable by the inert gas pressure and the RF amplitude. The hadron profile will be reconstructed with a tomography technique in the hodoscope which consists of X; Y; and theta layers by using a strip-shaped gas resonator.

Emittance tuning begins with precision beam based measurement of lattice errors (orbit; transverse coupling; and dispersion) followed by compensation with corrector magnets. Traditional techniques for measuring lattice errors are incompatible with simultaneous operation of the storage ring as light source or damping ring. Dedicated machine time is required. The gated tune tracker (the device that drives the beam at the normal mode frequencies) and the bunch-by-bunch; turn-by-turn beam position monitor system developed at CESR are integrated to allow synchronous detection of phase. The system is capable of measuring lattice errors during routine operation. A single bunch at the end of a train of arbitrary length; is designated as the witness. The witness bunch alone is resonantly excited; and the phase and amplitude of the witness is mea- sured at each of the 100 beam position monitors. Lattice errors are extracted from the measurements.

IPAC2015,,MOPWI031,Microwave Modeling for Electron Cloud Density Measurements at CesrTA,J.P. Sikora; Y. Li; Cornell University (CLASSE); Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; New York; USA; LBNL; Berkeley; California; USA; The electron cloud (EC) density in accelerator beam-pipe has been measured using resonant microwaves. The resonances are produced by changes in beam-pipe geometry that generate reflections and standing waves; with typical behavior being similar to a section of waveguide with shorted ends. The technique uses fact that the EC density will shift the resonant frequencies. In previous analysis; we have made the simplifying approximation that the standing waves are multiples of a half-wavelength and that the magnitude of the electric field is symmetric about the longitudinal center of the resonance. In this paper we show that some changes in beam-pipe geometry will result in asymmetric electric field magnitudes along the resonant length. When this is combined with an EC density that varies along this length; the magnitude of the frequency shift will be altered. We present our initial attempt to correct for this effect by modeling the existing beam-pipe using CST Microwave Studio(R) to obtain a more realistic electric field distribution. This correction is then applied to data taken with beam at several resonant frequencies. The measurements were made at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR); which has been reconfigured as a test accelerator (CesrTA) providing electron or positron beams ranging in energy from 2 to 5 GeV.,"Funding: This work is supported by the US National Science Foundation PHY-0734867, PHY-1002467, and the US Department of Energy DE-FC02-08ER41538, DE-SC0006505.",* http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2014.03.063 reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwi031_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwi031.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwi031_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWI031,

A nanocrystalline diamond film; typically 17x45 mm with an aerial density of 0.35 mg/cm2; is deposited on a corrugated silicon substrate by plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. After growth; 30 mm of the silicon substrate is etched away; leaving a freestanding diamond foil with a silicon handle that can be inserted into SNS for operation. An electron beam test facility was constructed to study stripper foil degradation and impact on foil lifetime. The electron beam capabilities include: current up to 5 mA; focused spot size of 0.30 mm2; and rastering in the x- and y-directions. A 30 keV and 1.6 mA/mm2 electron beam deposits the same power density on a diamond foil as a 1.4 MW beam on SNS target. Rastering of the electron beam can expose a similar area of the foil as SNS beams. Experiments were conducted using the foil test stand to study: foil flutter and lifetime; effects of corrugation patterns; aerial densities; crystal size (micro vs. nano); and boron doping; temperature distributions and film emissivity; and conversion rate of nanocrystalline diamond into graphite.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/mopwi032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/mopwi032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/mopwi032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWI032,

However; these models are not good enough to enable immediate transition to high-power operation. Instead; some amount of empirical adjustment is necessary to achieve stable; low beam-loss operation. At Los Alamos; we have been developing a new online model; which employs multiparticle beam dynamics; as a tool for providing more information and insight to the operations staff; especially during this transition to high-power operations.

While effective; scanning in this manner can be time consuming; with motors needing to accelerate; move and decelerate at each location before recording data. Information between data points may be missed unless fine grid scans are performed; which accounts for a further increase of scan time. Recent advances in commercial hardware and software enables a continuous scan capability for a wide range of applications; which saves the start and end of step motors. To compare scanning performance; both step and continuous scan modes were examined using the SPEC command language with both commercial and in-house hardware.

The effort is motivated by the plans to increase currents in the SPS as part of the HL-LHC upgrade. Parameters of the reduced order models are estimated based on driven beam SPS measurements.

This paper describes an upgrade consisting of replacing the EPICS based system tasked with managing all viewers with a mixed system utilizing EPICS and high level software. Most devices; particularly the beam viewers; cannot be safely inserted into the beam line during high-current beam operations. Software is partly responsible for protecting the machine from untimely insertions. The multiplicity of beam-blocking and beam-vulnerable devices motivate us to try a data-driven approach. The beamline insertions application components are centrally managed and configured through an object-oriented software framework created for this purpose. A rules-based engine tracks the configuration and status of every device; along with the beam status of the machine segment containing the device.

Several significant architectural enhancements and feature additions have been made concerning the handling and processing of simulation data. The major structural change is the creation of a single class Trajectory<> that manages all simulation data. Another significant design change was the development of standard tools for processing simulation results. One may obtain machine parameters such as fixed orbit; phase advance; dispersion; etc.; or beam-based calculations such as RMS size and centroid location simply by passing simulation results; i.e. a Trajectory<> object; to these computation tools. Finally; the ability to fully create composite modeling elements was implemented in the online model. Specifically; accelerator hardware can be modeled as a collection of constituent modeling elements.

The luminosity; exceeding 1033 cm-2s−1 in a broad range of the center-of-mass (CM) energy and maximum luminosity above 1034 cm-2s−1; is achieved by high-rate collisions of short small-emittance low-charge bunches made possible by high-energy electron cooling of the ion beam and synchrotron radiation damping of the electron beam. The polarization of light ion species (p; d; 3He) can be easily preserved and manipulated due to the unique figure-8 shape of the collider rings. A fully consistent set of parameters have been developed considering the balance of machine performance; required technical development and cost. This paper reports recent progress on the MEIC accelerator design including electron and ion complexes; integrated interaction region design; figure-8-ring-based electron and ion polarization schemes; RF/SRF systems and ERL-based high-energy electron cooling.

IPAC2015,,TUXC1,Novel Undulators for FEL and Storage Ring Light Sources,ANL; Argonne; Ilinois; USA; Developments of novel insertion devices (IDs) for storage rings (SR) and free-electron lasers (FELs) have remained quite active in recent years. The next generation of synchrotron radiation facilities; such as the already constructed or proposed storage rings at MAX-Lab; LNLS; ESRF; APS and SPring-8; provide strong motivation for continued improvements in IDs design and performance. Existing and newly built FEL facilities around the world also contribute important aspects of IDs fabrication: fast production of high quantity and high quality undulators that could be promptly installed in the FEL tunnels. Research institutions along with scientifically-oriented industries develop multiple approaches for the design and fabrication of single; unique IDs as well as a large quantity of standardized devices. A wide spectrum of existing and novel IDs for storage rings and FELs permits tailoring of ID performance to sometimes very specific experimental requirements. Currently; designers of light sources as well as users-experimentalists can choose from a variety of novel IDs that include undulators with wide spectrum coverage and relatively uniform flux; devices with controlled polarization properties; and electromagnetic undulators with fast polarization switching. Many of these undulators exploit new engineering solutions for their mechanical systems that make these devices quite compact and less expensive. The progress in the development of superconducting undulators has been quite noticeable in recent years. Once their construction is industrialized; these undulators could become the devices of choice for the next generation of storage rings and FELs.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tuxc1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tuxc1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tuxc1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUXC1,

Recently 2 GeV beams were generated by focusing ≈ 100 J laser pulses onto a gas target**. We report here on the generation of beams with energy up to 4.2 GeV using 16 J of laser pulse energy at the BErkeley Lab Laser Accelerator (BELLA)***. This was achieved by using laser pulses of high spatial and temporal quality coupled to a pre-formed capillary discharge waveguide of length 9 cm. The waveguide (in conjunction with self-guiding) allowed for mitigation of diffraction. High spatial quality (Strehl ratio at focus 0.8±0.1) was achieved using a deformable mirror placed before the focusing optic. The dominant contribution to the non-Gaussian content of the focal spot was the near-field intensity profile. For maximum efficiency high-power femtosecond systems employ super-Gaussian near-field profiles of the form I(r)∝e-2(r/wN); where I is the intensity; r is the radial coordinate; w is the spot size; and N is the order. Compared with Gaussian laser pulses where N=2; pulses from the BELLA laser system had N=10. Simulations showed that an increased contribution of self-guiding was required to effectively confine the laser energy for optimum acceleration and mitigation of damage to the capillary waveguide. Through appropriate choice of plasma density electron beams with energy up to 4.2 GeV were observed. In this regime the electron beam angular fluctuations were > 2 mrad rms; caused in part by errors in waveguide alignment and by laser-induced damage to the capillary that introduces plasma asymmetry. Improved alignment of the waveguide and mitigation of capillary damage allowed for reduction in angular fluctuations to 0.6 mrad rms. The electron beams had energy of 2.7±0.1 GeV; charge of 150 pC; and divergence less than 1 mrad.; * E. Esarey; et al.; Rev. Mod. Phys. 81; 1229 (2009)  ** X. Wang; et al.; Nat.

At the SPring-8 storage ring; it is realized that the higher order coupling resonances are considerably excited. After the usual correction of the nonlinear dynamics in terms of the normal sextupole magnets; we suppress one of the resonances by using the skew sextupole magnets for the purpose of further improving the dynamic aperture. As a result of the correction by the skew sextupoles; the reckoned improvement of the injection efficiency and the lifetime is achieved. Furthermore; at the SPring-8 storage ring; it is observed that the error magnetic field of a particular insertion device (ID) excites the higher nonlinear coupling resonance of the skew octupoles; which remarkably deteriorates the injection efficiency. In order to correct the coupling resonance; we have installed the octupole magnets at the ID; by which we restore the injection efficiency.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tuab1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tuab1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tuab1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUAB1,

The linac will accelerate ions up to U to energies above 200 MeV/u with beam powers up to 400 kW. At energies between 16 and 20 MeV/u the ions will be stripped to higher charge states to increase the energy gain downstream in the linac. The main challenges in the stripper design are due to the high power deposited by the ions in the stripping media (~ 30 MW/cm3) and radiation damage if solids are used. For that reason self-recovering stripper media must be used. The baseline stripper choice is a high-velocity; thin film of liquid lithium with an alternative option of a helium gas stripper.

We recently demonstrated successfully beam optics corrections during acceleration at RHIC. We verified conclusively the superior control of the beam realized via these corrections.

To preserve the emittance to an acceptable level; a dispersion correction with on-line dispersion-free steering (DFS) is inevitable. For this on-line technique; the dispersion has to be measured using beam energy variations of only about one per mil in order to not disturb the operation of the accelerator. For such small energy variations; the interaction of the particle beam and the accelerating structures creates large enough additional signals components in the measured dispersion to cause the dispersion correction to not work properly anymore. In this paper; the additional signals are described and their effect on the DFS algorithm is analysed. Finally; methods for the mitigation of the deteriorating signal components are presented and studied via simulations.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tubd3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tubd3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tubd3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUBD3,

The present work revisits the subject of mixing; saturation and space-charge effects in free-electron lasers. Use is made of the compressibility factor; which proves to be a helpful tool in the related systems of charged beams confined by static magnetic fields. The compressibility allows to build a semi-analytical model and to perform analytical estimates of the elapsed time until the onset of mixing; which in turn allows to estimate the saturated amplitude of the radiation field. In addition; the compressibility helps to pinpoint space-charge effects and the corresponding transition from Compton to Raman regimes.

For cases where the effect of undulator focusing significantly changes the electron beam optics; a compensation is needed in order to keep the optics constant in other parts of the accelerator. Since 2010; the free-electron laser (FEL) facility FLASH is equipped with two undulator sections along the same electron beamline. The first undulator is a variable-gap system used for seeding experiments; the second undulator is a fixed-gap system which serves the user facility with FEL radiation. Varying the gap in the first undulator will change the beam optics such that the FEL process in the second undulator is dramatically disturbed. For the correction of the beam optics an analytical model is used to generate feed forward tables which allows to make part of the beamline indiscernible for the subsequent sections. The method makes use of the implicit function theorem and can be used for any perturbation of the beam optics. Here; we present the method and its implementation as well as measurements performed at FLASH.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwa038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwa038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwa038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWA038,

The linac is based on S-band RF and consists in an RF Gun followed by 3 accelerating structures; while an energy upgrade based on 2 C-band accelerating structures is ready to be implemented. Short bunches are ordinarily produced by using the linear RF bunch compression concept. A harmonic RF structure interposed between the Gun and the 1st accelerating structure can be used to optimize the RF compression by a longitudinal phase space pre-correction; allowing to reach shorter bunches; a much more uniform current distribution and in general to control better the whole compression process. Here we report the results of numerical studies on the SPARC bunch compression optimization through the use of a harmonic cavity; and the design of a C-band RF system to implement it. The proposed system consists in a multi-cell SW cavity powered by a moderate portion of the total RF power spilled from the C-band power plant already installed for the linac energy upgrade.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwa058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwa058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwa058_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWA058,

At present; photoemission from strained GaAs activated to negative electron affinity (NEA) is a main source of polarized electrons. Future experiments at advanced electron colliders will require highly efficient polarized electron beams; which sets new requirements for photocathodes in terms of high quantum efficiency (QE) (>>1%) and spin polarization (~85%). Development of such materials includes modeling and design of photocathodes; material growth; fabrication of photocathodes; and photocathode testing. The purpose of the present work is to develop a semi-phenomenological model; which could predict photoemission and electron spin polarization from NEA GaAs photocathodes. Detailed Monte Carlo simulation and modeling of physical processes in photocathodes is important for optimization of their design in order to achieve high QE and reduce depolarization mechanisms. Electron-phonon interactions near the surface and influence of the presence of quantum heterostructures on the diffusion length are studied in depth. Simulation results will be compared to the experimental results obtained at Jefferson Lab and can be used to optimize the photocathode design and material growth; and thus develop high-polarization high-brightness electron source.,Funding: Work supported by The George Washington University and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwa059_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwa059.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwa059_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWA059,

Currently; we are designing a new ring based on the shape of a (11; 3) torus knot for our future plan ‘HiSOR-II.’ This ring is mid-low energy light source ring with beam energy of 700 MeV. Recently some light source rings are achieving very low emittance that reaches a diffraction limited light by adopting a multi-bend scheme to the arc section of the ring. It is not difficult for low-mid energy VUV-SX light source ring because the electron beam less than 10 nmrad can provide the diffraction limited light in the energy less than 10eV. On the other hand; the multi-bend lattice demands many families of the magnets and spaces to place them; therefore it is difficult to achieve diffraction limited emittance for compact SR ring. However; for the torus-knot type accumulation ring; it is not difficult to realize such a low emittance. We present the details of the designing procedure and the specifications of the ultra-low emittance light source ring having innovatively odd shape.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwa060_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwa060.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwa060_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWA060,

In this ring; a tandem-aligned double-APPLE undulator system similar to that in BESSY-II*** is installed for FEL and coherent light source experiments. Using this set-up; we observed spiral interference patterns between two different harmonic radiations with a scanning fiber multi-channel spectrometer and a CCD camera placed at the end of BL1U Beamline. By these measurements; various interference patterns such as single; double; and triple spirals were observed which concur with the theoretical prediction for every mode in the right or left circular polarization.

The photo-emission is possible up to 900nm wavelength. These advantages are due to NEA (Negative Electron Affinity) surface where the conduction band minimum is higher than the vacuum energy state. The NEA surface is artificially made with Cs-O/F evaporation on the cleaned GaAs surface; but the NEA surface is fragile; so that the emission is easily lost by poor vacuum environment and high emission density. NEA activation with any vital material is desirable. We found that the GaAs can be activated by CsTe thin film which is known as a vital photo-cathode material. The photo-electron emission spectrum extends up to 900 nm wavelength which corresponds to the band-gap energy of GaAs. The result strongly suggests that the surface becomes effectively NEA state by the CsTe thin film.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwa062_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwa062.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwa062_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWA062,

Many methods to improve FEL gain has been proposed by introducing an active modulation on the bunch charge distribution. The transverse-longitudinal phase-space rotation is one of the promising method to realize the density modulation as the micro-bunch structure. Initially; a beam density modulation in the transverse direction made by a mechanical slit; is properly transformed into the density modulation in the longitudinal direction by the phase-space rotation. The micro-bunch structure made with this method has a large tunability by changing the slit geometry; the beam line design; and the beam dynamics tuning.

The electron energy and circumference of the storage ring are 1.2 GeV and 72 m. The natural emittance is 53 nm-rad. Since the pulsed multipole injection scheme provides great advantages for relatively smaller SR rings*; we are developing a pulsed multipole injection system for Aichi SR storage ring. In this system; it is essential to minimize the perturbation to the stored beam. To realize the required performances; we have to minimize the residual field at stored beam position; taken into account the field generated by the copper current lead of the input terminal. In addition; we carried out the analytical calculation to estimate the magnet field due to the current lead and optimized the geometrical structure of them. Construction of the multipole magnet will be completed in March 2015 and the field measurement will be carried out in April.

For this reason; the SCSS test accelerator as the prototype of SACLA is reused and improved; because of terminating its role. SCSS with an electron beam energy of 250 MeV generated an extreme ultraviolet laser with 50-60 nm. We relocated SCSS into the SACLA undulator hall and improved its performance. Three newly designed C-band accelerator-units for the relocated SCSS accelerator with an acceleration gradient of 47 MeV/m at maximum boost an electron beam energy of up to 420 MeV. By FEL simulation; the EUV-FEL with 30-40 nm and 100 uJ are expected in conditions of the electron energy and 2 modified undulators with 5 m long each. As a further capability; the relocated SCSS accelerator has space to add 9 C-band accelerator units and 2 undulators and the units increase a beam energy of up to 1.4 GeV; as which can generate a soft X-ray FEL.

IPAC2015,,TUPJE009,Study on Frequency Multiplier of a Pulsed Laser Repetition using an Optical Cavity,Waseda University; Tokyo; Japan; We have been studying a compact electron accelerator based on an S-band Cs-Te photo-cathode rf gun at Waseda University. The system is using S-band rf of 2856MHz. When a repetition of the electron bunch is integral multiple of rf; it enables a lot of electron bunch acceleration for the rf gun. The repetition of the electron bunch generated by a photo-cathode rf gun depends on the oscillating frequency of the pulsed mode-locked laser. We have been developing a mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser based on Non-Linear Polarization Rotation (NLPR). However; its repetition is limited by the fiber length to produce NLPR. Therefore; we have started to develop the external optical cavity which is multiplier of a pulsed laser repetition. It would enable the rf gun to generate high-dose electron beam in a very short time. In this conference; we will report design of the external optical cavity to multiply the pulsed laser repetition; the experimental results of the frequency multiplying of a mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser; and the future prospects.; Work supported by Photon and Quantum Basic Research Coordinated Development Program from the Ministry of Education; Culture; Sports; Science and Technology; Japan.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupje009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupje009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupje009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPJE009,

In this study; our purpose is to clarify their property and to establish an ideal evaporation recipe. We succeeded in producing high quality Cs-Te photocathode; and electron beam generated by our Cs-Te photocathode shows high charge (4.6nC/bunch) and high Q.E. (1.74%) in our rf electron gun. Furthermore; we found a Q.E. recovery after Cs deposition process and it causes higher Q.E. than usual due to; we believe; Cs deposition quantity or Cs deposition speed.

The R&D includes the development of high repetition rate laser pump/X-ray probe for ultrafast dynamics detection in future source. In a typical laser pump/X-ray probe measurement; the X-ray pulse follows a laser pulse in adjustable delay. We are interested in the difference between laser on and laser off at different delay; which will snapshot dynamic process. To capture this trivial difference; it requires the acquisition system to single out the signal from this special X-ray pulse at adequate S/N ratio. For the R&D of high repetition rate pump-probe; we have set up a prototype counting acquisition system based on NIM modular electronics; which was tested in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The laser will be synchronized with a camshaft bunch at 124 kHz; a tenth of the revolution frequency. Avalanche Photo Diode (APD) was used to detect the X-ray pulse from this camshaft bunch due to its nanosecond response. Before the laser is delivered; we mimic the 124 kHz laser- on signal. The signals from APD are separated by power dividers into two Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD) input channels. The signal in laser-on/off channel is gated out at 1.24MHz using the 1.24MHz timing signal divided from 499.8 MHz RF signal; while the mimic laser-on signal gated out at 124 kHz. Multiplied by ten times; the mimic laser-on signal counts should be consistent with the laser-on+off counts; if our counting modular works well. We carried out this test at 1W1B wiggler beam line to measure the Fe fluorescence signal. The performance of our system is demonstrated in the good consistency between mimic laser on and laser on+off signals.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupje012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupje012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupje012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPJE012,

Currently; five insertion devices have been installed in the storage ring. It is known that the dynamics of the electron beam motion in the storage ring would be influenced by the insertion device; depending on its physical properties. In order to keep high performance operation of the storage ring and make the insertion device transparent to the rest of the storage ring; a complex compensation scheme is developed to match the beta functions at both ends of a ID and perform transverse tune compensation.

One is to compress the bunch length; the other one is to produce a wavy beam which has high spatial repetition along the longitudinal direction. The latter one can expand the radiation frequency range of a light source. However; CSR can bring nonlinear effect which brings in extra instability.

PAL is developing undulator magnetic structure based on EU-XFEL concepts. The key parameters are min pole gap of 8.3 mm; with period length 26 mm (HXU); 35 mm (SXU); and 5.0 m magnetic length. .

We need to give a reverse tapering to the planar undulators to make microbunching in the electron beam while the linearly polarized radiation power is depressed. In this case; however; resonance wavelengths in each planar undulator are different each other. Therefore; proper initial undulator parameter and tapering strength parameter have to be chosen to obtain high power polarized photon beam with fixed wavelength. In this research; method for deciding suitable reverse tapering is presented using simulation results of PAL-XFEL soft X-ray case with 10 GeV electron beam energy.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupje033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupje033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupje033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPJE033,

The main reason is the tendency towards building accelerators with high magnetic fields produced by small gap magnets; as well as the development of cryogenic or superconducting narrow-gap insertion devices. Usual approach; based on side-measurements made with a Hall probe mounted on the tip of a motorized arm based on a long granite bench is no more applicable to such closed structures. So; new concepts and approaches have been developed; mainly based on complex devices that insert a Hall probe inside the magnetic structure maintaining the desired position by close-loop controls. The main problem of these devices is that they are not general-purpose oriented: they need a special vacuum chamber; require a specific geometry of the magnetic structure; or does not provide 3D field-map measurements. We present in this paper a new bench that has been built at ALBA synchrotron that is simple; multi-purpose and can be a general solution for measuring big closed structures.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupje036_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupje036.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupje036_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPJE036,

The CLIC drive beam requires a high bunch charge of 8.4 nC and 0.14 ms long trains with 2 ns bunch spacing; which is challenging for a photoinjector. In particular the required long and high intensity laser pulses cause a degradation of the beam quality during the frequency conversion process; which generates the ultra-violet laser beam needed for standard Cs2Te photocathodes. To overcome this issue Cs3Sb cathodes sensitive to green light have been studied at the high-charge PHIN photoinjector since a few years.

One of the methods; linear optics from closed orbits (LOCO); is widely employed to correct linear optics. Due to the ring nature; a quadrupole error at a location of the ring affects the entire orbit response measurement data. The orbit response; however; can be localised to a certain range of the ring when an orbit feedback (or correction) is applied to the rest of the ring. The quadrupole errors located in the range; where the feedback is acting; then have no impact; and the ring optics can be locally examined.

Since emittance scales inversely cubically with the number of lattice cells; an SLS upgrade is challenged by the comparatively small ring circumference of only 288 m. A new concept for a compact low emittance lattice is based on longitudinal gradient bending magnets for emittance minimization and on anti-bends (i.e bends of opposite field polarity) to disentangle dispersion and horizontal beta function in order to provide the optimum matching to the longitudinal gradient bends while minimizing the contribution to chromaticity.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupje047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupje047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupje047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPJE047,

In the case of CLIC the gamma rays are produced by a Compton backscattering source; but in this paper we concentrate on undulator-based sources as proposed for the ILC. We present the development of a simulation to generate a magnetic field map based on a Fourier analysis of any measured field map. We have used a field map measured from the ILC helical undulator prototype to calculate the typical distribution of field errors; and used them in our calculations to produce simulated field maps. We show that a loss of gamma ray intensity of ~ 8% could be expected; compared to the ideal case. This leads to a similar drop in positron production which can be compensated for by increasing the undulator length.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupje057_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupje057.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupje057_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPJE057,

Cu and Nb thin films were grown onto a Si substrate by magnetron sputtering and subsequently were prepared by annealing and Ar ion sputtering. To determine the surface chemistry; x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed. QE measurements were enabled using a UV laser source giving 266 nm light. Wf measurements were carried out using a kelvin probe and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Annealing the Cu thin film to 250°C yielded a QE of 1.2E-4; one order of magnitude higher than the QE for sputter cleaned and post annealed polycrystalline Cu. The optimum QE measurement for Nb thin film was 2.6·10-4; which was found to be comparable to the results obtained for cleaned bulk Nb.

A superconducting undulator prototype (SCU0) has been operating in SR Sector 6 since the beginning of CY2013; and another undulator SCU1 (a 1.1-m length undulator that is three times the length of SCU0) is scheduled for installation in Sector 1 in 2015. The SCU0 main coil often quenches during beam dumps. MARS simulations have shown that relatively small beam loss (<1 nC) can lead to temperature excursions sufficient to cause quenching when the SCU0 windings are near critical current. To characterize local beam losses; high-purity fused-silica FO cables were installed in Sector 6 next to the SCU0 cryostat and in Sector 1 where SCU1 will be installed. These BLMs aid in the search for operating modes that protect the SCU structures from beam-loss-induced quenching. In this paper; we describe the BLM calibration process that included deliberate beam dumps at locations of BLMs. We also compare beam dump events where SCU0 did and did not quench.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupje064_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupje064.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupje064_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPJE064,

SCU0 often quenches during beam dumps triggered by the machine protection system (MPS). SCU0 typically recovers quickly after a quench; but SCU1; a second; longer device to be installed in 2015; may take longer to recover. We tested using injection kickers as an abort system to dump the beam away from SCU0 and the planned location of SCU1. An alternate trigger was tested that fires the kickers with MPS. We demonstrated that controlling the beam dump location with kickers can significantly reduce the beam losses at SCU0; as measured by fiber optic (FO) beam loss monitors (BLMs); and can also prevent a quench. A dedicated abort kicker system has been developed based on elegant simulations. A spare injection kicker was modified to produce the required waveform.

The injector laser strikes a copper photocathode which emits photo-electrons due to photo-electric effect. The emittance of the electron beam is highly related to the transverse shape of the injector laser. Currently the LCLS injector laser has hot spots that degrade the FEL performance. The goal of this project is to use adaptive optics to modulate the transverse shape of the injector laser; in order to produce a desired shape of electron beam. With a more controllable electron transverse profile; we can achieve lower emittance for the FEL; improve the FEL performance and operation reliability.

We have investigated a range of options including 3rd; 4th; and 5th harmonics of the main radio frequency (RF) system; as well as configurations with and without external RF power couplers. The current baseline is a single 4th harmonic superconducting cavity with adjustable RF couplers and a slow tuner which provide the flexibility to operate over a wide range of beam currents. The cavity is designed to provide 0.84 MV at 1408 MHz for the nominal 6 GeV; 200 mA electron beam; and 4.1 MV main RF voltage.

Ensuring that the desired 4.2 mA single bunch current can be stably stored requires a detailed understanding of the impedance in the MBA ring. We briefly discuss modeling sources of impedance using the electromagnetic codes GdfidL and ECHO; and how we then include both geometric and resistive wall wakefields using the tracking code elegant to predict collective instabilities. We first validate our procedures by comparing APS experimental measurements to tracking predictions using the APS storage ring impedance model. We then discuss the MBA impedance model; for which we find that a chromaticity of 5 units is sufficient to obtain the required 4.2 mA single bunch current.

We investigate whether emission properties of photocathodes can be manipulated through the engineering of the surface electronic structure. The multilayers described here have been predicted to have emission properties in correlation with the film thickness. This paper describes how ultra-thin multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO films in the crystallographic orientations (001) and (111) multilayers were synthesized and characterized. Preliminary results of work function measurements are provided. Films were grown by pulsed laser deposition at 130 °C for the (001) orientation and 210 °C for the (111) orientation at a background pressure of ~ 5×10-9 Torr. Epitaxial growth was monitored in-situ using reflection high-energy electron diffraction; which showed single crystal island growth for each stage of the multilayer formation. Photoelectron spectroscopy was used to track the chemical state transition from Ag to MgO during the deposition of successive layers. The Kelvin probe technique was used to measure the change in contact potential difference; and thus work function; for various MgO layer thicknesses in comparison with bare single crystal Ag(001)and Ag(111) thin films. The work function was observed to reduce with increasing thickness of MgO from 0 to 4 monolayers as much as 0.89 eV and 0.72 eV for the (001) and (111) orientations; respectively.

Currently; the energy range of the gamma-ray beam is from 1 MeV to about 100 MeV; with the maximum total gamma-ray flux about 3·1010 gammas per second around 10 MeV. The FEL is typically operated in quasi-CW mode. Some HIGS user experiments can benefit tremendously from a pulsed mode of FEL operation. For that purpose; a fast steering magnet was developed years ago to modulate the FEL gain. This FEL gain modulator decouples the e-beam from the FEL beam in the interaction region for most of time; but periodically allows a brief overlap of the electron and FEL beams. This allows us to build up a high peak power FEL pulse from a well-damped electron beam. However; the use of this gain modulator at low e-beam energies can dramatically limit e-beam current due to beam instability and poor injection. To overcome these shortcomings; we have successfully tested an RF frequency modulation technique to pulse the FEL beam.

The magnetic field on the axis of the undulator is transverse and sinusoidally varying due to the periodic sequence of dipoles. The ideal trajectory of a relativistic electron bunch; inserted along the axis; is sinusoidal in the plane of oscillation. Phase errors are produced when the path of the electron is not the ideal sinusoidal trajectory; due to imperfections in the magnetic field. The result of such phase errors is a reduction of laser gain impacting overall FEL performance. A pulsed-wire method can be used to determine the profile of the magnetic field. This is achieved by sending a square current pulse through the wire; which will induce an interaction with the magnetic field. Measurement of the displacement in the wire over time using a motion detector yields the first or second integrals of the magnetic field.

The previous theory used a square-wave approximation of the time varying field to solve for the total kinetic energy deposited on the cathode due to the back-bombarded electrons. In addition the transit time factor was added as a correction to compensate for the non-sinusoidal field. By solving for the back-bombardment power using a sinusoidal field; the transit time factor can be removed and therefore a better overall model is produced. These alterations continue to accurately predict how back-bombardment varies as a function of the gun parameters and provides improvement when compared to the existing theory.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupma018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupma018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupma018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPMA018,

Frascati; Frascati (Roma); Italy; Through the use of simulation tools and theoretical analysis techniques; the Free Electron Laser process is investigated for a wiggler that is generated by an ultrafast laser system. The development and availability of such systems allows for novel FEL designs due to the high peak power of such lasers. Even though such high powers are possible; difficulties arise due to inhomogeneity in the laser pulse. This project looks at simulation results for a system with a realistic laser pulse profile and looks in to the pulse-shape effects on various system parameters. Models are presented for the expected behavior with important parameters noted; as well as highlighting possible difficulties that might occur experimentally. While head-on interaction has been proven experimentally for the short wavelength regime *; we believe that using a co-propagating laser can provide benefits that have currently been untested.

An experiment demonstrating a new method for producing polarized positrons has been performed at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Lab. The PEPPo (Polarized Electrons for Polarized Positrons) concept relies on the production of polarized e−/e+ pairs from the bremsstrahlung radiation of a longitudinally polarized electron beam interacting within a high Z conversion target. PEPPo demonstrated the effective transfer of spin-polarization of an 8.2 MeV/c polarized (P~85%) electron beam to positrons produced in varying thickness tungsten production targets; and collected and measured in the range of 3.1 to 6.2 MeV/c.

The improved Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (iSASE) FEL utilizes phase shifters which allow for the spontaneously emitted radiation to interact with and stimulate more electrons to radiate coherently. Five phase shifters were simulated; with 34 normal-conducting undulators and focusing-defocusing quadrupoles as an LCLSII FEL lattice using the FEL software Genesis 1.3. Two general schemes; one providing a total phase shift of arbitrary distribution; the other providing a sequential or distributed phase shift; were simulated and optimized using a simulated annealing algorithm. The results suggest that the phase shifters must provide a total shift comparable to the bunch length; and the shifts must be distributed with one large shift; followed by smaller shifts.; * J.

L. Rubin; Cornell University (CLASSE); Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; New York; USA; The Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) operates most of the year as the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). CESR was originally designed and operated as an electron/positron collider; circulating high-emittance beams in order to maximize luminosity. Beam lines were developed to extract x-rays from both electron and positron beams. The two beams share a common vacuum chamber; and are electrostatically separated to avoid collisions. The requirement to store counter-rotating beams significantly constrains the storage ring optics; limiting emittance and; beam current; and bunch distributions. The proposed upgrade eliminates two-beam operation in favor of a single optimized on-axis beam. Several new undulator-based beam lines are planned. The horizontal emittance is reduced in steps; first from 90nm to 20nm at 5.3 GeV; and then in a ring-wide upgrade to as low as 300 pm-rad at 6GeV. The low-emittance optics are based on multi-bend achromats with combined function bends.

The state-of-the-art EO crystal THz source using tilted pulse front technique has been able to reach ~ 100 MV/m peak field strength; large enough to be used in an inverse Compton scattering process to push these low energy photons to shorter wavelengths of the desired 5-10 THz range.

To extend the interaction duration of electron and laser field; the electron and the laser will propagate toward each other with an small angle. In addition; to maintain the FEL lasing resonant condition; the laser pulse shape need be flattened and the pulse front will be titled. Due to the short pulse duration; the laser pulse has a broad bandwidth. In this paper; we will first describe the method of generalized Gaussian beam propagation using ray matrix. By applying the Gaussian beam ray matrix; we can study the dispersive property after the pulse front of the short laser is tilted.

This approach has at least three flaws: 1) it is difficult to correct aberrations- particularly RF curvature; 2) rising side acceleration exacerbates space charge-induced distortion of the longitudinal phase space; and 3) all achromatic ""negative compaction"" compressors create parasitic compression during the final compression process; increasing the CSR-induced emittance growth. One can avoid these deficiencies by using acceleration on the falling side of the RF waveform and a compressor with M56>0. This approach offers multiple advantages: 1) It is readily achieved in beam lines supporting simple schemes for aberration compensation; 2) Longitudinal space charge (LSC)-induced phase space distortion tends; on the falling side of the RF waveform; to enhance the chirp; and 3) Compressors with M56>0 can be configured to avoid spurious over-compression.

The ratio of the injector energy to the linac energy must remain 0.11284 at all times. Consequently; the injector was partially upgraded. The early injector; transport and acceleration from 130 keV to 6 MeV; is unchanged; but the downstream boost from 6 MeV to the final 123 MeV energy drove several changes. One of the two original CEBAF 25 MeV type cryomodules in the injector was upgraded to a 100 MeV capable one to provide more energy. Some trim magnets at the end of the injector were upgraded to compensate for the higher energy. The chicane region was expanded; and the full energy injector spectrometer was relocated to make room for the newly added Hall D line. Experience from the 6 GeV era indicated that the stray fields from the higher energy beam transport recombiners near the injection chicane adversely affect the injector orbit; so a study to understand and mitigate stray fields from the transport arc box supplies upgraded for 12 GeV led to shielding modifications for the beamline in the chicane region.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupma037_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupma037.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupma037_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPMA037,

And for a given amount of available laser power; higher QE would extend the photogun operating lifetime. The distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) concept was proposed to enhance the QE of strained-superlattice photocathodes by increasing the absorption of the incident photons using a Fabry-Perot cavity formed between the front surface of the photocathode and the substrate that includes a DBR; without compromising electron polarization. Here we present recent results showing QE enhancement of a GaAs/GaAsP strained-superlattice photocathode made with a DBR structure. Typically; a GaAs/GaAsP strained-superlattice photocathode without DBR provides a QE of 1%; at a laser wavelength corresponding to peak polarization. In comparison; the GaAs/GaAsP strained-superlattice photocathodes with DBR exhibited an enhancement of over 2 when the incident laser wavelength was tuned to meet the resonant condition for the Fabry-Perot resonator.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupma038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupma038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupma038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPMA038,
IPAC2015,,TUPMA041,On the Characterization of a CCR Source,RadiaBeam; Santa Monica; California; USA; Peak and spectral brightness of a resonant long-range wakefield extractor are evaluated. It is shown that the brightness is dominated by beam density within the slow wave structure and antenna gain of the outcoupling. Far field radiation patterns and brightness of circular and high-aspect-ratio planar radiators are compared. A possibility to approach the diffraction limited brightness is demonstrated. Role of group velocity in designing of the Cherenkov source is emphasized. The approach can be applied for design and characterization of various structure-dominated sources (e.g.; wakefield extractors with gratings or dielectrics; or FEL-Cherenkov combined sources) radiating into a free space using an antenna (from microwave to far infra-red regions). The high group velocity structures can be also effective as energy dechirpers and for diagnostics of microbunched relativistic electron beams.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupma041_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupma041.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupma041_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPMA041,

Silicon being a semiconductor has a conductivity that allows it to drain the charge fast in case if some electrons get intercepted by the dechirper. At the same time the conductivity is low enough for the skin depth to be large (on the order of 1 cm) making the silicon loaded waveguide a slow wave structure supporting wakefields that dechirp the beam. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupma043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupma043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupma043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPMA043,

The linac was designed to produce either a single bunch with a charge of 0.5 nC of electrons or a train of bunches up to 300 ns long containing a total charge of 15 nC. The booster was designed to accelerate up to 15 nC each cycle. Linac commissioning was completed in April 2012. Booster commissioning was started in November 2013 and completed in March 2014. All of the significant design goals were satisfied including beam emittance; energy spread; and transport efficiency. While the maximum booster charge accelerated was only 10 nC this has proven to be more than sufficient for storage ring commissioning.

These materials have already found extensive use in photodetectors and image intensifiers. However; only recently have modern synchrotron techniques enabled a systematic study of the formation chemistry of these materials. Such analysis has led to the understanding that these materials are inherently rough when grown through traditional sequential deposition; this roughness has a detrimental impact on the intrinsic emittance of the emitted beam. Sputter deposition may provide a path to achieving a far smoother photocathode; while maintaining adequate quantum efficiency.

To reach adequately high luminosity without excessively large muon intensities; it was proposed previously to combine ionization cooling with techniques using a parametric resonance (PIC). Practical implementation of PIC proposal is a subject of this report. We show that an addition of skew quadrupoles to a planar PIC channel gives enough flexibility in the design to avoid unwanted resonances; while meeting the requirements of radially-periodic beam focusing at ionization-cooling plates; large dynamic aperture and an oscillating dispersion needed for aberration corrections.

The target beam size of 1 nm dictates very tight alignment tolerances for the accelerating structures (AS). In order to assess the effect of short-term RF power interruptions (breakdowns or failure modes) on the alignment; the dynamic behaviour of the AS was investigated on the prototype two-beam module. On a dedicated experimental setup; the thermal and mechanical time constant (TC) was monitored as a function of ambient temperature; water flow and power. The experimental results showed that the thermal TC ranged between 4 and 11 minutes and presented strong correlation with the cooling water flow. These results were in very good agreement with the theoretical expectations. The displacement dynamics were found to be comparable with the thermal ones. The study indicates that temperature measurement; which is a fast and easy process; can be used as an indicator of the AS displacement. Moreover; it is shown than the transient response can be efficiently controlled through appropriate regulation of the cooling water flow.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupty003_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupty003.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupty003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPTY003,

A fraction of the secondary halo protons or heavy-ion fragments; scattered out of the primary collimator; is not captured by the secondary collimators but hit cold magnets in the IR7 dispersion suppressor (DS) where the dispersion starts to increase. A possible approach to reduce these losses is based on the installation of additional collimators in the DS region. In this paper; simulations of the cleaning efficiency for Pb82+ ions are used to evaluate the effect of the additional collimators.

IPAC2015,,TUPTY027,SixTrack Simulations of Beam Cleaning During High-beta Operation in the LHC,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The 1000 m high-beta run in the LHC provided very clean conditions for observing experimental backgrounds. In ATLAS; a much higher background was observed for Beam 2 than for Beam 1; suspected to be caused by upstream showers from beam losses on collimators or aperture. However; no local beam losses were observed in the vicinity. This paper presents SixTrack simulations of the beam cleaning during the high-beta run. The results demonstrate that; for the special optics and collimator settings used; the highest loss location in IR1 is at the TAS absorber just in front of the ATLAS detector; where no beam loss monitor is installed. Furthermore; the highest losses are seen in Beam 2. The results could thus provide a possible explanation of the ATLAS observations; although detailed shower calculations would be needed for a quantitative comparison.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupty027_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupty027.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupty027_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPTY027,

One of the major challenges for such a machine will be the beam dump system; which for each ring will have to reliably abort proton beams with stored energies in the range of 8 Gigajoule; more than an order of magnitude higher than planned for HL-LHC. The transverse proton beam energy densities are even more extreme; a factor of 100 above that of the presently operating LHC. The requirements for the beam dump subsystems are outlined; and the present technological limitations are described. First concepts for the beam dump system are presented and the feasibility is discussed; highlighting in particular the areas in which major technological progress will be needed.

In case of a failure of the extraction kicker magnets; which are part of the beam dumping system; it is important to ensure protection of the superconducting triplet magnets from missteered beam. The magnets are located to the right of Interaction Point 5 (IP5) and are protected by one set of collimators in the beam dumping insertion in IR6 and another set close to the triplet magnets. In this paper; a new method for verification of the correct collimator position with respect to the aperture is presented. It comprises the application of an extended orbit bump with identical trajectory as the beam trajectory after a deflection by the beam dump kickers. By further increasing the bump amplitude and successively moving in/out the collimators in the region of interest; the accurate positioning of the collimators can be validated.

Significant modifications [1] will be implemented to accelerator systems; including new superconducting magnets; crab cavities; superconducting links; new collimators and absorbers based on advanced materials and design and additional cryo-plants. Due to the limit imposed by the number of simultaneous events at the experiments (pile-up) on peak luminosity; the latter will be levelled to 5*1034 cm-2s−1. The target integrated luminosity can only be achieved with a significant increase of the total available time for beam collisions compared to the 2012 LHC run; despite a beam current that is planned to double the nominal 0.58 A. Therefore one of the key figures of merit to take into account for system upgrades and new designs is their impact on the accelerator availability. In this paper the main factors affecting LHC availability will be discussed and predictions on the impact of future system upgrades on integrated luminosity presented.

The β* is then reduced in steps as the beam intensity decays. This allows the luminosity to be kept constant over part of a physics fill. The use of round or flat optics will change the beam-beam effect of the head on collisions as well as the long range interactions.

A possible backup scenario would rely on a reduced crossing angle together with flat optics (with different horizontal and vertical β* values) for the preservation of luminosity performance.

Especially; the HCC requires a large bore helical magnet and a compact helical RF system to incorporate the RF into the magnet chamber. A new emittance evolution has been designed to mitigate the geometry constraint. The HCC was functionally separated into three parts sections. The lattice at the initial section provides a large transverse acceptance by using a strong helical focus magnet. Once the transverse beam size is small enough to get into the compact RF the HCC lattice in the middle section generates a large longitudinal beta tune to dominate the longitudinal cooling. Consequently; the longitudinal emittance becomes smaller than the transverse one at the end of middle section. In the final section; the magnetic field strength is gradually reduced to match out the helical channel to the straight solenoid. As a result; the emittance exchange takes place and the final transverse emittance becomes smaller than the longitudinal one. The new emittance evolution scenario will be discussed in this presentation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupty074_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupty074.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupty074_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPTY074,

A conventional solution for this trouble is insertion of bent chicanes in the arcs space. In our report we consider a method to provide space coincidence of encountering bunches in the crab-crossing orbits Interaction Region (IR) while repetition rates of two beams do not coincide. The method utilizes pair of fast kickers realizing a bypass for the electron bunches as the way to equalize positions of the colliding bunches at the Interaction Point (IP). A dipole-mode warm or SRF cavities fed by the magnetron transmitters are used as fast kickers; allowing a broad-band phase and amplitude control. The proposed scanning synchronization method implies stabilization of luminosity at a maximum via a feedback loop. This synchronization method is evaluated as perspective for the Medium Energy Electron-Ion collider (MEIC) project of JLab with its very high bunch repetition rate.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupty082_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupty082.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupty082_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPTY082,

The electron collider ring is proposed to reuse the 476MHz PEP-II RF system to achieve high installed voltage and high beam power. The MEIC electron injection requires 3-10 (or 12) GeV beam in 3-4μs long bunch trains with low duty factor and high peak current; resulting in strong transient beam loading for the CEBAF.

Protons are used for micromachining applications; in conjunction with porous silicon. Porous silicon does not form in areas irradiated with a given fluence of protons (>1014 cm-2). Our work concentrated on the applicability of masked irradiation of silicon wafers with 1.8 MeV proton beams delivered by the TOP-IMPLART LINAC. In our experiments 1-10 Ω*cm n; p-type silicon wafers were masked and irradiated with protons at fluences between 1014 and 1015 protons/cm2. Porous silicon did not form in the irradiated areas up to a distance from the surface corresponding to the stopping range (30um). The suppression of porous silicon formation is due to the to the neutralization of dopant impurities by implanted protons that increases the local resistivity. The interest in using RF LINAC for micromachining applications lies in the possibility of deep implantation; that allows the realization of 3D structures for MEMS applications.

Pulse radiolysis is one of the powerful methods to trace early chemical reactions by ionizing radiation. In pulse radiolysis; the probe light absorption; which produced by active species formed by electron beam of rf gun; is measured at each wavelength and made possible to trace reactions. Therefore; we have used the super continuum (SC) light for the probe light. The SC light has a broad spectrum and is generated by nonlinear optical effect caused by injecting picosecond laser to photonic crystal fiber. However; the resulting SC light was unstable because its peak intensity was not enough.

This work focuses on the matching from the exit of the multiple bunch HCC into the start of the helical bunch coalescing channel. The simulated helical matching section simultaneously matches the helical spatial period λ in addition to providing the necessary acceleration for efficient bunch coalescing. Previous studies assumed that the acceleration of muon bunches from p=209.15 MeV/c to 286.816 MeV/c and matching of λ from 0.5 m to 1.0 m could be accomplished with zero particle losses and zero emittance growth in the individual bunches.

However; realistic phase advances generated by sets of quadrupoles; or Final Focusing Blocks (FFB); between the crab cavities located in the expanded beam regions and the IP differ slightly from π/2. To understand the effect of crabbing on the beam dynamics in this case; a simple model of the optics of the Medium Energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) including local crabbing was developed using linear matrices and then studied numerically over multiple turns (1000 passes) of both electron and proton bunches. The same model was applied to both local and global crabbing schemes to determine the linear-order dynamical effects of the synchro-betatron coupling induced by crabbing.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwi039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwi039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwi039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWI039,

Efficient muon capture requires the muons to be first phase-rotated by rf cavities into a train of 21 bunches with much reduced energy spread. Since luminosity is proportional to the square of the number of muons per bunch; it is crucial for a Muon Collider to use relatively few bunches with many muons per bunch. In this paper we will describe a bunch merging scheme that should achieve this goal. We present for the first time a complete end-to-end simulation of a 6D bunch merger for a Muon Collider. The 21 bunches arising from the phase-rotator; after some initial cooling; are merged in longitudinal phase space into 7 bunches; which then go through 7 paths with different lengths and reach at the final collecting ”funnel” at the same time. The final single bunch has a transverse and a longitudinal emittance that matches well with the subsequent 6D rectilinear cooling scheme.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwi040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwi040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwi040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWI040,

Without proper chromaticity compensation; such transport channels exhibit high sensitivity to the random orbit errors causing significant emittance growth. Such emittance growth can come from both the correlated and the uncorrelated energy spread.

A flat muon beam with a series of quadrupole doublet half cells appears to provide the strong focusing required for final cooling. Each quadrupole doublet has a low beta region occupied by a dense; low Z absorber. After final cooling; normalized xyz emittances of (0.071; 0.141; 2.4) mm-rad are exchanged into (0.025; 0.025; 70) mm-rad. Thin electrostatic septa efficiently slice the bunch into 17 parts. The 17 bunches are interleaved into a 3.7 meter long train with RF deflector cavities. Snap bunch coalescence combines the muon bunch train longitudinally in a 21 GeV ring in 55 microseconds; one quarter of a synchrotron oscillation period. A linear long wavelength RF bucket gives each bunch a different energy causing the bunches to drift until they merge into one bunch and can be captured in a short wavelength RF bucket with a 13% muon decay loss and a packing fraction as high as 87%.,,D.V. Neufferpresenter reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/tupwi044_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/tupwi044.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/tupwi044_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-TUPWI044,
IPAC2015,,TUPWI045,Consequences of Bounds on Longitudinal Emittance Growth for the Design of Recirculating Linear Accelerators,BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; Recirculating linear accelerators (RLAs) are a cost-effective method for the acceleration of muons for a muon collider in energy ranges from a couple GeV to a few 10s of GeV. Muon beams generally have longitudinal emittances that are large for the RF frequency that is used; and it is important to limit the growth of that longitudinal emittance. This has particular consequences for the arc design of the RLAs. I estimate the longitudinal emittance growth in an RLA arising from the RF nonlinearity. Given an emittance growth limitation and other design parameters; one can then compute the maximum momentum compaction in the arcs. I describe how to obtain an approximate arc design satisfying these requirements based on the deisgn in Bogacz (2005)*. Longitudinal dynamics also determine the energy spread in the beam; and this has consequences on the transverse phase advance in the linac. This in turn has consequences for the arc design due to the need to match beta functions. I combine these considerations to discuss design parameters for the acceleration of muons for a collider in an RLA from 5 to 63 GeV.; *Bogacz; S. A. 2005. Low energy stages - 'dogbone' muon RLA.

To preserve polarization through numerous depolarizing resonances through the whole accelerator chain; harmonic orbit correction; partial snakes; horizontal tune jump system and full snakes have been used. In addition; close attentions have been paid to betatron tune control; orbit control and beam line alignment. The polarization of 60% at 255 GeV has been delivered to experiments with 1.8×1011 bunch intensity. For the eRHIC era; the beam brightness has to be maintained to reach the desired luminosity. Since we only have one hadron ring in the eRHIC era; existing spin rotator and snakes can be converted to six snake configuration for one hadron ring. With properly arranged six snakes; the polarization can be maintained at 70% at 250 GeV.

While the gas acts as a buffer to prevent rf breakdown; gas ionization may also occur as the beam passes through a HPRF cavity. The resulting plasma; may gain substantial energy from the rf electric field which it can transfer via collisions to the gas; an effect known as plasma loading.

The largest effort consisted of commissioning of the electron lenses; one in each ring; which are designed to compensate one of the two beam-beam interactions experienced by the proton bunches. The e-lenses therefore raise the per bunch intensity at which luminosity becomes beam-beam limited. A new lattice was designed to create the phase advances necessary for a functioning e-lens which also has an improved off-momentum dynamic aperture relative to previous runs. In order to take advantage of the new; higher intensity limit without suffering intensity driven emittance deterioration; other features were commissioned including a continuous transverse bunch-by-bunch damper in RHIC and a double harmonic capture scheme in the Booster.

In PSB operation; a single electron bunch is displaced transversely from the other electron bunches using a short-pulse; high-repetition-rate kicker magnet. Experiments that require light emitted only from a single bunch can stop the light emitted from the other bunches using a collimator. Other beam lines will only see a small reduction in flux due to the displaced bunch. As a result; PSB allows to run timing experiments during the multibunch operation. Furthermore; the time spacing of PSB pulses can be adjusted from milliseconds to microseconds with a novel “kick-and-cancel” scheme; which can significantly alleviate complications of using high-power choppers and substantially reduce the rate of sample damage.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wexb3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wexb3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wexb3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEXB3,

IPAC2015,,WEAB1,Compensating Tune Spread Induced by Space Charge in Bunched Beams,Stony Brook University; Stony Brook; USA; BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; The effects of space charge play a significant role in modern-day accelerators; frequently constraining the beam parameters attainable in an accelerator or in an accelerator chain. They also can limit the luminosity of hadron colliders operating either at low energies or with sub-TeV high-brightness hadron beams. The latter is applied for strongly cooled proton and ion beams in eRHIC – the proposed future electron-ion collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Several schemes were proposed to compensate for space charge effects in a coasting (e.g.; continuous) hadron beam; and some have been tested. Using an appropriate transverse profile of the electron beam (or plasma column) for a coasting beam would compensate both the tune shift and the tune spread in the hadron beam. But none of these methods address the issue of compensating space-charge induced tune spread in a bunched hadron beam. In this paper we propose and evaluate a novel idea of using a co-propagating electron bunch with miss-matched longitudinal velocity to compensate the space charge induced tune-shift and tune spread. We present several practical examples of such a system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/weab1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/weab1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/weab1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEAB1,
IPAC2015,,WEAB2,Beam and Spin Dynamics for Storage Ring Based EDM Search,FZJ; Jülich; Germany; Permanent EDMs (electric dipole moment) of fundamental particles violate both time invariance T and parity P. Assuming the CPT theorem this implies CP violation. The Standard Model (SM) predicts non-vanishing EDMs; their magnitudes; however; are expected to be unobservably small with current techniques. Hence; the discovery of a non-zero EDM would be a signal for “new physics”. As a first step towards EDM searches of charged particles in storage rings; R&D work at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY is pursued. On a longer time scale; the design and construction of a dedicated storage ring will be carried out. Spin-tracking simulations are absolutely crucial to explore the feasibility of the planned storage ring EDM experiments and to investigate systematic limitations. For a detailed study during the storage and buildup of the EDM signal; one needs to track a large sample of particles for billions of turns. Benchmarking experiments are performed at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY to check and to further improve the simulation tools and prototype accelerator components are tested.

A fundamental understanding of the underlying physics is vital; and hence an independent experiment has been set up at the beamline of the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY; Zeuthen Site (PITZ); to study the SM of electron beams in a plasma. This contribution presents simulation results on SM experiments at PITZ using the particle-in-cell code HiPACE.

Their further development is related to the availability of new diagnostic tools; nowadays consisting of few types only of devices designed on purpose for such compact machines. Microwave Interferometry is a non-invasive method for plasma diagnostics and represents the best candidate for the whole plasma density measurements. Interferometry in ECR Ion Sources is a challenging task due to their compact size. The typical density range of ECR plasmas (1011-1012 cm-3) causes the probing beam wavelength to be in the order of few centimetres; which is comparable to the chamber radius. The paper describes the design of a new microwave interferometer based on the so-called ""frequency sweep"" method: the density is here derived by the frequency shift of a beating signal obtained during the fast sweep of both probing and reference microwave signals; inner cavity multipaths contributions can thereby be suppressed by cleaning the spurious frequencies from the beating signal spectrum.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepwa012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepwa012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepwa012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPWA012,

A coniferous-tree-type carbon nanostructure (CCNS) is used for a field emission cathode in the C-band RF gun. A graphene sheet composed of carbon has a coniferous form; and the tip has a nanometer-size tubular structure that becomes thicker on the substrate side**. Owing to this configuration; the CCNS has a large field enhancement factor; and is considered to be more stable in high electric fields than Carbon nanotubes. We have fabricated the C-band RF gun of the single cell cavity. Emission current depending on the electric field strength on the CCNS cathode surface was measured. When the electric field strength was 30 MV/m; the total charge per a macro pulse was 30 nC. After applying a stronger electric field; a decline of the field enhancement factor was observed.

We developed a numerical simulation code based on the point spread function (PSF) and an estimated form of electric field distribution on an arbitrary gently undulating surface to deal with the problem.

IPAC2015,,WEPWA044,The Alignment of the MICE Tracker Detectors,Imperial College of Science and Technology; Department of Physics; London; United Kingdom; The Muon Ionization Cooling experiment (MICE) has been designed to demonstrate the reduction of the phase-space volume (cooling) occupied by a muon beam using the ionization-cooling technique. This demonstration will be an important step in establishing the feasibility of muon accelerators for particle physics. The emittance of the beam will be measured before and after the cooling cell using a solenoidal spectrometer. Each spectrometer will be instrumented with a high-precision scintillating-fibre tracking detector (Tracker). The Trackers will be immersed in a uniform magnetic field of 4T and will measure the normalised emittance reduction with a precision of 0.1%. A thorough knowledge of the alignment of the Trackers is essential for this accuracy to be achieved. The Trackers are aligned: mechanically inside the spectrometer solenoids; with respect to the MICE experimental hall; to one another; and to the magnetic and beam axes. These methods are described here.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepwa044_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepwa044.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepwa044_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPWA044,

This target material concept is primarily directed at high-power neutrino targets where the thermal shock is large due to small beam sizes and short durations; it also has applications to other high-power targets; particularly where the energy deposition is great or a high surface area is preferred. This approach ameliorates the problem of thermal shock by engineering a material with high strength on the microscale; but a very low modulus of elasticity on the mesoscale. The low modulus of elasticity is achieved by constructing the material of spring-like wire segments much smaller than the beam dimension. The intrinsic bends of the wires will allow them to absorb the strain of thermal shock with minimal stress. Furthermore; the interlaced nature of the wires provides containment of any segment that might become loose.

By tuning lattice parameters; it is possible to construct a staged cooling channel in which the beam emittance is always considerably greater than the minimum value. In the late stages of the cooling channel; space charge effects can become a significant obstacle to further emittance reduction once the beam becomes sufficiently condensed. A method has been implemented in COSY Infinity; a beam dynamics simulation and analysis code; which efficiently and accurately calculates the self-fields of all particles on each other based on a variant of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM).

It can determine high-order transfer maps of combinations of particle optical elements of arbitrary field configurations. For precision modeling; design; and optimization of next-generation muon beam facilities; its features make it a very attractive code. New features are being developed for inclusion in COSY to follow the distribution of charged particles through matter. To study in detail some of the properties of muons passing through material; the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map–Monte-Carlo approach in which transfer map methods describe the average behavior of the particles in the accelerator channel including energy loss; and Monte-Carlo methods are used to provide small corrections to the predictions of the transfer map accounting for the stochastic nature of scattering and straggling of particles. The advantage of the new approach is that it is very efficient in that the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects as well as possible particle decay. The gains in speed are expected to simplify the optimization of muon cooling channels which are usually very computationally demanding due to the need to repeatedly run large numbers of particles through large numbers of configurations.

In this contribution we explore the use of a low-energy electron beam produced out of a photoinjector coupled to a dielectric structure to produce a higher energy (~10-20 MeV) beam via a beam-driven acceleration scheme. The accelerated beam can then be used to produce X-ray via inverse Compton scattering.

The proposed technique is based on the use of surface acoustical waves (SAW) generated on the piezoelectric surface of a GaAs photocathode. The generation of SAW on piezoelectric substrates is known to produce strong piezoelectric fields that propagate on the surface of the material. These fields can significantly suppress recombination effects and result in enhanced quantum efficiency of photoemission. Experimental measurements of photoemission quantum efficiency will be done on semiconductors used as photocathode materials (e.g.; GaAs) in presence of SAW with varied parameters. The experimental results will be used as input for physics modeling that will provide a basis for design of operational SAW-enhanced photocathodes. While the improved quantum efficiency and parameter control expected from the use of SAW will be useful for many research devices and accelerators; the commercialization of such a widespread field as electron microscopy is compelling.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepje002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepje002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepje002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPJE002,

In a typical DWA scheme a higher energy lower charge main bunch is accelerated in the wakefield produced by a preceding lower energy higher charge drive bunch inside of a hollow metal-encapsulated dielectric tube. To make use of as much energy of the drive bunch as possible; it is highly important that all parts of it decelerate uniformly. Close to uniform drive bunch deceleration can be achieved if its current is properly shaped.* At Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at BNL we shaped the current of a chirped electron beam with an adjustable mask placed inside of the highly dispersive region in the magnetic dogleg. We passed the shaped beam current through a quartz tube and observed the beam particles’ energy modulation at the tube’s output with a spectrometer. By tuning the mask we were able to control the beam energy modulation and thus the wakefield profile in the tube.; * B. Jiang; C. Jing; P. Schoessow; J. Power; and W.

However DWAs will also produce high transverse wakefields if the beam propagates off-center; which grow even faster than the accelerating gradient when the width of the beam channel is decreased.* It is highly important to suppress single beam breakup (BBU) instability in order for the beam to propagate long enough so that a reasonable amount of energy (e.g.; 80%) from the drive bunch is extracted. In addition bending of the dielectric channel has a similar effect to off-center steering of the beam with the required tolerances on the channel straightness typically in a few micron range. For both rectangular and circular dielectric lined waveguides we use a FODO lattice with a tapered strength for suppression of BBU. We impose initial energy chirp on the drive beam to make use of the BNS damping. We change rectangular waveguide orientation by 90 degrees with a small step to make use of the quadrupole wakefield focusing.

Currently most of the muon beams are produced by protons hitting thin targets sitting upstream of spallation neutron targets. The intensity of the muons is greatly limited by the small thickness of the muon targets; which are intended to have minimum impact on the proton beams. When the majority of the proton beam hits the spallation target; a large number of pions/muons are produced. After being captured in a solenoidal magnetic field; a high intensity muon beam can be produced. In this paper we take the Chinese Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) target as an example and investigate the production of high intensity muon beams. Two possibilities are presented in this paper: an upstream collection of surface muons and a downstream collection of pions which is followed by a decay and compress channel to obtain a high intensity muon beam.

Considering the ageing of the equipment; effort is required in order to maintain the reliability at this level. The proposed upgrade of the linac with a SLED cavity has been chosen to mitigate the risks of single point of failure and lack of spare parts. The linac is normally fed from two independent 35 MW pulsed klystrons to reach 100 MeV beam energy and can be operated in single (SBM) or multi-bunch mode (MBM). The SLED cavity upgrade will allow remote selection of single klystron operation in SMB and possibly limited MBM without degradation of beam energy and reduce down time in case of a klystron failure.

Starting from the well-known accelerating cells design developed by the Laboratoire de l'Accélérateur Linéaire (LAL) and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC); for linear accelerators; it is possible to improve the main RF parameters; such as quality factor; shunt impedance; enhancement factor and group velocity; by choosing a suitable shape of the inner surface. Even though surface electric field is being considered as the only main quantity limiting the accelerating gradient; the importance of power flow and the modified Poynting vector*; has been highlighted from high-gradient experimental data. In this context; the new field quantity (Sc) is derived from a model describing the RF breakdown trigger phenomenon wherein field emission currents from potential breakdown sites produce local pulsed heating. In particular; the modified Poynting vector takes into account both active and reactive power flow travelling along the structure.

Starting in 2009; we suggested a means of reducing the residual resistance by warming up a cavity after initial cooldown to about 20K and cooling it down again. In subsequent studies we used this technique to manipulate the residual resistance by more than a factor of 2. We postulated that thermocurrents during cooldown generate additional trapped magnetic flux that impacts the cavity quality factor. Since several questions remained open; we present here a more extensive study including measurement of two additional passband modes of the 9-cell cavity that confirms the effect. We also discuss simulations that substantiate the claim. While the layout of the cavity LHe tank system is cylindrically symmetric; we show that the temperature dependence of the material parameters result in a non-symmetric current distribution. Hence a significant amount of magnetic flux can be generated at the RF surface resulting in an increased surface resistance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepma012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepma012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepma012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPMA012,

The operation of the accelerator places high demands on the beam pipes like static stress because of the inner vacuum and additional one-sided thermal stress caused by synchrotron radiation. A first generation of thin walled beam pipes had been developed and manufactured during the construction of the stretcher ring in 1985. These pipes were successfully in operating stage the following ten years. The beam pipes had a wall thickness of 0.3mm; a length of 3m; and a bending radius of ca. 10.5m. Special pipes with a sideway branch for synchrotron radiation experiments have been manufactured in the same assembly dimension. In the course of an intensity upgrade; a second generation of beam pipes has been developed in 1995. To reduce the thermal stress caused by the synchrotron radiation an internal water cooling was mounted.

The storage ring operates applying a fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s from 1.2 GeV to 3.2 GeV and afterwards a slow extraction over a few seconds to the hadron physics experiments. The beam current is mainly limited due to missing RF power at highest energies in order to compensate for synchrotron radiation losses. The current stretcher ring's RF station is based on a single 200 kW klystron driving two 5-cell PETRA type cavities. To achieve the desired beam current at maximum energy two additional 7-cell PETRA type cavities; drivin by a second klystron; will be installed.

Optimization criteria for cavity design are effective shunt impedance (ZTT); transit-time factor; and electrical breakdown limit. In geometrical op-timization we have aimed at increase of the energy gain in each RF gap of the DTL cells by maximizing ZTT per peak surface field with special designed tube profile. Mul-ti-pacting probability is evaluated for one gap of typical single cell. For the beta profile design; a code based on VBA macros of CST is developed to perform cell by cell design with pre-optimized 3D tube structures. With this code several beta profile designs are presented and com-pared for the balance of power consumption; ZTT; tank length; and breakdown possibility of the complete cavity. The stability of the field has been taken into account and for this the crossed stem arrangement is assessed. This paper gives a short introduction of the method; presents some important results. Possible countermeas-ures are discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepma017_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepma017.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepma017_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPMA017,

These hardware modules are expected to provide values such as the relative phase advance between the RF systems of both; the source and the target synchrotron according to an external timing system. These values are exchanged via optical fibers between different supply rooms; and the considered RF signals are re-synthesized locally.

The first step of the development consists in modeling the actual DDS and DSP-based LLRF environment of the SIS18 under Ptolemy-II.

The most important of them are very high electromagnetic fields that result in strong Lorentz forces and the pressure on cavity walls from the helium tank that also deforms the cavity shape. Also mechanical eigen resonances of cavities are the main source of the microphonics. To withstand any kind of external loads on the resonator walls different schemes of the cavity stiffening were applied.

One of the disadvantages of this design is the RF power leakage from the accelerating gun cavity cells to the cathode housing that results in the excessive cathode heating. To minimize the RF power leak different kinds of choke filters are used to protect the cathode structure. These choke filters represent resonant circuits with a zero input impedance and installed at the entrance of the cathode structure that shunt the cathode housing. Still; since the choke filter frequency shift under working conditions is bigger than its bandwidth a filter tuning during assembly only in the warm stage seems insufficient and requires also fine-tuning during operation. To eliminate the problems of the choke filter fine-tuning and hence ensure its stability during operation; a combination of the resonance choke elements can be implemented.

From the Photo-injector to the electron Main Beam Dump (MBD); there are more than 400 magnets and coils; including those mounted on the accelerating sections of the LINAC and on the Undulators. With few exceptions; each magnet power supply energizes a single magnet/coil: there are about 400 magnet power supplies spanning from few tens of watt up to 42 kW. The power supplies types range from custom-made ones; to COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf); to in-house design (these accounting to 88% of the total). Almost all magnet power supplies are in use since mid-2010.

For the repetition rate of electrum beam; the optional of 2 Hz; 5 Hz; 25 Hz and 50 Hz are requested. Although; more than 5 nC electron with single-bunch has been generated in the 2 Hz and 5 Hz; when the repetition rate increases to 25 Hz; the condition of the laser amplifier system such as the thermal lens effect is changed seriously. To correspond to 25 Hz repetition rate; the ytterbium-doped laser system was reformed. An AuSu (80:20) heat-dissipating solder is employed to reduce the thermal lens effect. Because of the damage threshold limitation of the thin-disk crystal and optical mirrors; Some improvement were performed to increase the quality of the pulses rather than the amplify power; which cause the SHG conversion efficiency is up to 60% and 30% with 2ω and 4ω respectively.

The Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) connecting lines in the tunnel will be exposed to the debris from 7+7 TeV p-p interaction. The Superconducting (SC) Links will arrive from the surface to the tunnel near the separation dipole; at about 80 m from the Interaction Point at IP1 and IP5. The Connection Box (where the cables of the SC Links are connected to the NbTi bus bar) will be close to the beam pipe. The debris and its effect on the MgB2 SC links in the connection box (energy deposition and displacement per atom) are presented. The effect of thermal neutrons on the Boron consumption and the contribution of the lithium nucleus and the alpha particle on the DPA are evaluated. The results are normalized to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb-1; value that represents the LHC High Luminosity lifetime. The dose delivered to the SC Links is found to be below the damage limit.

This is why both the inner and outer conductors of HOM coupler for 9-cell cavity have been conventionally produced by full machining; backward extrusion accompanied with annealing and so on. However; in the mass production of 9-cell cavities in ILC; further cost reduction is required. We produced both the inner and outer conductors of HOM coupler for 9-cell cavity in the advanced press forming methods aiming at cost reduction. Press forming of a pure Nb sheet for the outer conductor of HOM coupler was performed with fewer processes free from intermediate annealing and primary machining. For the inner conductor of HOM coupler; water jet cutting and press cold-forging of a plate was performed. The above advanced press forming methods showed favored results; leading to a possibility of simple mass-production of components and cost reduction. The vertical test on a 9-cell cavity with the press formed HOM couplers achieved 36 MV/m that is beyond ILC qualification.

The structure we are developing is that single turn air-coils are implanted along the longitudinal axis in the cylindrical ceramic chamber wall with thickness of 5mm. The ceramic wall works for separating the vacuum from the atmosphere; as well as holding the coil structures mechanically and the electrical insulation of coils. By this structure; magnet pole edges can be set close to the inside diameter of the chamber. The small gap increases magnetic field strength; which is for shorter length; and; as a result; the small magnet size reduces the inductance; which is for shorter pulse.

The thermal analysis and the temperature measurement with the designed heater was performed. The ideal temperature distribution for the kicker degassing was obtained. The outgassing of the graphite during rising the temperature was measured. The result showed that the outgassing was extremely suppressed by the first heating.

Generally; frequencies of input RFs are fixed; and resonant frequencies of cavities that are fluctuated by Lorentz force detuning and Microphonics are corrected by feedbacks of cavity frequency tuners and input RF power. Now; we aim to develop the cavity frequency tracking type RF control system where the frequency of input RF is not fixed and consistently modulated to match the varying resonant frequency of the cavity. In KEK (Tsukuba; Japan); we are developing SRF-TEM that is a new type of transmission electron microscope using special-shaped superconducting cavity.

Due to the high-Q nature of a superconducting RF resonator; it is sensitive to many factors such as loading variation (from either the accelerated beam or from parasitic field emitted electrons); mechanical vibration; and liquid helium bath pressure fluctuation etc. To increase the stability against those factors; a mechanically strong and stable RF structure is desirable. Guided by this consideration; multi-fold symmetry element-loaded superconducting radio frequency structures; cylindrical tanks with multiple (n>=3) rod-shaped radial elements; are being explored. The top goal of its optimization is to improve mechanical stability. A natural consequence of this structure is a lowered ratio of the peak surface electromagnetic field to the acceleration gradient as compared to the traditional spoke cavity. A disadvantage of this new structure is an increased size for a fixed resonant frequency and optimal beta.

We investigated the cause of the window vacuum pressure increment by studying the changes in the electric field distribution at the superconducting cavity and waveguide according to the beam current. An equivalent physical modeling was developed using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and it revealed that the electric field amplitude at the RF window is exponentially increased as the beam current increases; thus this high electric field amplitude causes a RF breakdown at the RF window.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepmn039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepmn039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepmn039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPMN039,

In accelerators with high current HOM could lead to high losses for the modes excitation; beam instability and beam break up. HOM couplers and waveguides are often used in such structures for HOM damping. Unfortunately they could lead to a violation of the axial symmetry of the accelerating field and negatively affect the beam emittance. Also these devices are subject for multipactor discharge and could be difficult in maintaining and fabrication.

One important aspect is the crosscheck of results obtained by using different and independent measurement and evaluation methods. Since a rather high DC bias current has to be applied; a dedicated network was designed that allows the passage of up to 50 A DC without degradation of the RF performance. With a combination of calibration methods and a compensating topology with two identical sample holders; a good performance was achieved. In this context; magnetic material parameters for about 10 different types of ferrite were obtained. The orthogonal magnetic bias was added by placing the entire test fixture into a large toroidal coil. Thus; the bias field can be supplied independently from; and in addition to the classical parallel bias. An optimal combination between the two biasing fields was found; resulting in a reduction of magnetic losses up to 50% on certain ferrites.

Amorphous carbon (a-C) coating of the beam screen surface is proposed to reduce electron cloud production; thereby minimising its dissipated power. To validate this solution; the COLDEX experiment has been re-commissioned. Such equipment mimics the performance of the LHC cold bore and beam screen cryogenic vacuum system in presence of LHC beams in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).

In Isolde; distributed primary pumping is sectorized in three parts; but all effluents are conveyed together in a unique tank. Thus; highly contaminated gas from the target and front end may be mixed with less contaminated gas from the beam transfer lines. This study aims at analysing and quantifying the distribution and propagation of neutral rare gas radioactive isotopes along the Isolde beam-line by numerical simulation (steady-state and time resolved Test-Particle Monte-Carlo; Molflow+) and experimental means. The time-resolved Monte-Carlo integrates decay time for the propagating species. To measure the distribution of contaminants; sampling filters are installed at the exhaust of the vacuum turbo-molecular pumps. Comparison between simulation and experiment shows excellent agreement; confirming the pertinence of the Monte-Carlo tool to radioactive species propagation.

It is a small machine; ~30 m in circumference; with a rather tight specification for the average pressure seen by the anti-proton beams injected by the anti-proton decelerator (AD). The average pressure in ELENA must be limited to 4x10-12 mbar (H2-equivalent) in order to limit the charge-exchange losses during the rather long deceleration process (several tens of seconds); during which the energy of the beam is reduced and the electron-cooler is used twice in order to decrease the transverse emittance of the anti-proton beam. This paper will discuss the design of the chambers of the injection line; extraction line and the ring. It will also mention the actual status of the vacuum system for the transfer lines to the experiments; LNE; which are under finalisation.

For such a reason; the study of secondary electron and photodesorption yields of vacuum materials is essential. The eradication or mitigation of both secondary electron and molecule desorption could strongly reduce the beam scrubbing time and increase the availability of nominal beams for experiments. Surface modifications with the desired characteristics can be achieved by thin-film coatings; in particular made of amorphous carbon and non-evaporable getters (NEG). In the framework of a new collaboration; several vacuum chambers have been produced; and different coatings on each of them have been applied. The samples were then irradiated at KEK’s Photon Factory with SR light of 4 keV critical energy during several days; allowing the measurement of the photodesorption yield as a function of the photon dose. This paper presents the experiment and briefly summarizes the preliminary photodesorption and photoelectron yield data of different coatings.

Once the SR distributions are computed; they are converted into outstanding profiles by using data available in literature. The test-particle Monte Carlo code Molflow+ is then used and the related pressure profiles and gas density distribution are computed.

Obvious candidates for upper bounds on the damage limit are overheating of insulation; and melting of the conductor. Lower bounds are obtained by the limits of elasticity in the conductor; taking into account dynamic effects (elastic stress waves). The plastic regime in between these two bounds will lead to differential thermal stress between the superconductor and stabilizer; which may lead to a permanent degradation of the magnet. An improved understanding of these mechanisms is required especially in view of the planned increase in brightness of the beams injected into the LHC and of the future High Luminosity-LHC [2] and Future Circular Collider (FCC). In this paper the plans for room temperature damage tests on critical parts of superconducting magnets and the strategy to test their damage levels at 4.3 K in the HiRadMat facility at CERN; using a 440 GeV proton beam generated by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS); is presented.

This ferrite tuner shall provide the possibility of a fast frequency shift of about 200 kHz on the fundamental mode; to allow a fast switching between proton and ion frequencies. In order to avoid water cooling and related issues; the challenge was to bring magnetic losses in the tuner to a minimum such that a forced air cooling scheme will be sufficient. The tuner was first designed with simulation tools; a prototype was built and low-power RF testing was performed on the tuner-cavity combination to evaluate tuning range; bandwidth; and stability.

The output current of the power supply follows the beam current from 150 MeV ramping to 3 GeV. The frequency of the power supply is 3 Hz. The power supply must thus push enormous energy into the dipole magnets at +1000 V and +1000 A; and can handle this job. Because the TPS booster dipole supply is bipolar and the voltage is large; the lodged capacitors have large effects that produce common-mode high-frequency current noise; which drives the power supply beyond specification. The TPS booster ring hence fails to meet the dc and ramping specification. We designed a common-mode filter to solve the high-frequency current noise by absorbing the current noise from the path of the lodged capacitors to the ground pad. The TPS booster dipole supply thus works within the specification when the power supply is in the dc or ramping mode. The beam current from the 150- MeV dc mode for the injection mode can ramp the beam current to 3 GeV. This paper reports the excellent results.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepha038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepha038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepha038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPHA038,

However; these results do not allow the prediction of the superconducting properties at RF frequencies. A dedicated RF cavity was designed to evaluate surface resistive losses on a flat sample. The cavity contains two parts: a half-elliptical cell made of bulk Nb and a flat Nb disc. The two parts can be thermally and electrically isolated via a vacuum gap; whereas the electromagnetic fields are constrained through the use of RF chokes. Both parts are conduction cooled hence the system is cryogen free. The flat disk can be replaced with a sample; such as a Cu disc coated with Nb film. The RF test provide the cavity Q-factor and thermometrical measurements of the losses on the sample. The design advantages are that the sample disc can be easily installed and replaced; installing a new sample requires no brazing/welding/vacuum or RF seal; so the sample preparation is simple and inexpensive.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepha052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepha052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepha052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPHA052,

In order to reduce this cost; thin layer of niobium are deposited on a copper cavity; which has lower material cost with higher availability and more importantly higher thermal conductivity. The coating of superconducting cavities currently is synthesized by physical vapour deposition (PVD) method which suffers from lack of conformity. By using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) it is possible to deposit thin Nb layers uniformly with density very close to bulk material.

The performance requirement of the power supply includes a -3dB at 10 kHz small-signal bandwidth for the output current. This requirement presents a technical challenge to the design of the power circuit and the power supply regulator because the magnet load may have a significant inductance and make it difficult to achieve a high bandwidth for the current. In order to meet the requirement; different circuit topologies and regulators are being investigated. One of the candidate designs combines a standard H-bridge pulse-width modulation (PWM) circuit and a linear power amplifier to provide a ±15A DC current and an AC component up to 1% of the full scale with the required bandwidth. An appropriate feedback control loop and a current regulator are being designed. The mathematical modeling and simulation of the power circuit and the control loop are being conducted to prove the concept of the design.

At LBNF’s final beam power of 2.4 MW and assuming the worst case condition of a 204 m long helium filled decay pipe; the absorber is required to handle a heat load of about 750 kW. This results in significant thermal management challenges which have been mitigated by the addition of an aluminum ‘spoiler’ and ‘sculpting’ the central portion of the aluminum core blocks. These thermal effects induce structural stresses which can lead to fatigue and creep considerations. Various accident conditions are considered and safety systems are planned to monitor operation and any accident pulses. Results from these thermal and structural analyses will be presented as well as the mechanical design of the absorber.

In multi-turn injection schemes; this notch in the beam may be generated either in the linac pulse prior to injection or in the accelerator itself after injection. In the case of the Fermilab Booster; the notch is created in the ring near injection energy by the use of fast kickers; thus depositing the beam in a shielded collimation region within the accelerator tunnel. With increasing beam powers; it is desirable to create this notch at the lowest possible energy to minimize activation. Fermilab has undertaken an R&D project to build a laser system to create the notch within a linac beam pulse; immediately after the RFQ at 750 keV; where activation issues are negligible.

The choice of perpendicular biasing over parallel biasing is that the Q of the cavity is much higher and thus allows the accelerating voltage to be a factor of 2 higher than a similar parallel biased cavity. This cavity will also provide a higher accelerating voltage per meter than the present folded transmission line cavity. However; this type of cavity presents technical challenges that need to be addressed. The two major issues are cooling of the garnet material from the effects of the RF and the cavity itself from eddy current heating because of the 15 Hz bias field ramp. This paper will address the technical challenge of preventing the garnet from overheating.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepty037_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepty037.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepty037_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPTY037,

The required space for these collimators could be provided by replacing some 15-m long 8.33 T NbTi LHC main dipoles (MB) with shorter 11 T Nb3Sn dipoles (MBH) compatible with the LHC lattice and main systems. FNAL and CERN magnet groups are developing a 5.5-m long twin-aperture dipole prototype with the nominal field of 11 T at the LHC nominal current of 11.85 kA suitable for installation in the LHC. Two of these magnets with a collimator in between will replace one MB dipole. The single-aperture 2-m long dipole demonstrator and two 1-m long dipole models have been assembled and tested at FNAL in 2012-2014. The 1 m long collared coils were then assembled into the first twin-aperture Nb3Sn demonstrator dipole and tested. This paper reports test results of the first twin-aperture Nb3Sn dipole model focusing on magnet training; ramp rate sensitivity and temperature dependence of the magnet quench current.

A 100 TeV HC in a ~100 km tunnel with a nominal operation field of ~15 T is being considered for the post-LHC era. The choice of a 15 T nominal field requires using the Nb3Sn technology. Practical demonstration of this field level in an accelerator-quality magnet and substantial reduction of magnet costs are key conditions for the realization of such a machine. FNAL has started the development of a 15 T Nb3Sn dipole demonstrator for a 100 TeV HC. As a first step in this direction; the existing 11 T dipole magnet; developed for LHC upgrades; will be modified by adding two layers to achieve the nominal field of 15 T in a 60 mm aperture. As the next step; to increase the field margin the innermost 2-layer coil will be replaced with an optimized coil using the conductor grading approach. This paper describes the design concept and parameters of the 15 T Nb3Sn dipole demonstrators.

(DTI) has designed and built an advanced, high-voltage solid-state modulator for long pulse klystrons for ESS. In 2014, DTI, in partnership with SigmaPhi Electronics, received two contracts for production and installation of this design for ESS-class modulators, which will be used for the testing and conditioning of ESS klystron tubes and testing of RF components. This modulator design uses a hybrid configuration (solid state switch and pulse transformer) with an advanced switching regulator to maintain a very flat voltage into the klystron over multi-millisecond pulses. This paper will describe the design and testing of these modulators, and the status of their installation. The major development introduced in this design is that the millisecond-long pulses produce a droop voltage of about 10% with a reasonably-sized capacitor bank–much larger than the 1% droop required. To eliminate the droop without a large and expensive capacitor bank, the modulator uses a non-dissipative regulator. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepty042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepty042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepty042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPTY042,

The channel consists of a series of low frequency (325 MHz-650 MHz) normal conducting pillbox cavities; which are enclosed within thin beryllium windows (foils) to increase shunt impedance and give a higher field on-axis for a given amount of power. These windows are subject to ohmic heating from RF currents and Lorentz force from the EM field in the cavity; both of which will produce out of plane displacements that can detune the cavity frequency.

In order to generate the necessary anti-neutrino flux; a high intensity primary proton beam is needed. In IsoDAR; H2+ is accelerated; and is stripped into protons just before the target; to overcome space charge issues at injection. As part of the design; we have refined an old proposal to use an RFQ to axially inject bunched H2+ ions into the driver cyclotron. This method has several advantages over a classical low energy beam transport (LEBT) design: (1) The bunching efficiency is higher than for the previously considered two-gap buncher and thus the overall injection efficiency is higher. This relaxes the constraints on the H2+ current required from the ion source. (2) The overall length of the LEBT can be reduced. (3) The RFQ can also accelerate the ions. This enables the ion source platform high voltage to be reduced from 70 kV to 30 kV; making underground installation easier. We will present preliminary RFQ design parameters and first beam dynamics simulations from the ion source to the spiral inflector.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepty048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepty048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepty048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPTY048,

In spite of that; the final frequency error after final welding is often far from the target due to difficult to predict material contraction and cavity deformation induced by electron beam welding (EBW). Final coarse tuning is required by plastic deformation or differential etching. In coaxial HWR; both can decrease the cavity frequency but are not easily suitable to increase it. A novel method developed at MSU is “virtual” welding; i.e. deformation of the cavity shape by applying systematically EBW on the cavity outer surface to induce controlled Nb material contraction in strategic positions.

Higher order mode (HOM) damping is vital for preserving the quality of high-current electron beams in novel SRF accelerators. Because HOMs are not confined by the PBG array; they can be effectively damped in order to raise the current threshold for beam instabilities. The PBG design increases the real-estate gradient of the linac because both HOM damping and the fundamental power coupling can be done through the PBG cell instead of via the beam pipe at the ends of the cavity. A superconducting multi-cell cavity with a PBG damping cell is therefore an attractive option for high-current linacs. The first-ever SRF multi-cell cavity incorporating a PBG cell was designed a LANL and built at Niowave Inc. The cavity was tuned to a desired gradient profile and underwent surface treatment at Niowave.

The MaRIE facility will utilize a 12 GeV linac to drive an X-ray FEL. Most of the same linac will also be used to perform electron radiography. The main linac is driven by two shorter linacs; one short linac optimized for X-FEL pulses and one for electron radiography. The RF systems have historically been the one of the largest single component costs of a linac. We will describe the details of the different types of RF systems required by each part of the linacs. Starting with the High Power RF system; we will present our methodology for the choice of RF system peak power and pulselength with respect to klystrons parameters; modulator parameters; performance requirements and relative costs. We will also present an overview of the low level RF systems that are proposed for MaRIE and briefly describe their use with some proposed control schemes. *; * A.

A uniform removal however is not readily achievable due to the complex fluid flow and varying temperatures of the acid mixture; which can lead to differential etching. This needs to be considered when envisaging a certain surface damage removal throughout the interior.

[1] Various nitrogen-doping recipes have been scrutinized to optimize process parameters with the aim to guarantee an unloaded quality factor (Q 0) of 2.7·1010 at an accelerating field (Eacc) of 16 MV/m at 2.0 K in the cryomodule. During the R&D phase the characteristic Q0 vs. Eacc performance curve of the cavities has been measured in JLab’s vertical test area at 2 K. The findings showed the characteristic rise of the Q0 with Eacc as expected from nitrogen-doping. Initially; five cavities achieved an average Q0 of 3.3·1010 at the limiting Eacc averaging to 16.8 MV/m; while one cavity experienced an early quench accompanied by an unusual Q 0 vs. Eacc curve. The project accounts for a cavity performance loss from the vertical dewar test (with or without the helium vessel) to the horizontal performance in a cryomodule; such that these results leave no save margin to the cryomodule specification. Consequently; a refinement of the nitrogen-doping has been initiated to guarantee an average quench field above 20 MV/m without impeding the Q 0.

Mechanical properties of Nb are typically obtained from uniaxial tensile tests of small samples. In this contribution we report the results of measurements of the resonant frequency and local strain along the contour of single-cell cavities made of ingot and fine-grain Nb of different purity subjected to increasing uniform differential pressure; up to 6 atm. Measurements have been done on cavities subjected to different heat treatments. Good agreement between finite element analysis simulations and experimental data in the elastic regime was obtained with a single set of values of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The experimental results indicate that the yield strength of medium-purity ingot Nb cavities is higher than that of fine-grain; high-purity Nb.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepwi032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepwi032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepwi032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPWI032,

This leads to a drop in the Q factor and limits the maximum acceleration gradient achievable per unit length of the cavities. The performance can be improved either by adjusting the fabrication and preparation parameters; or by mitigating the effects of fabrication and preparation techniques used. We have developed the experimental setup to determine Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) from the surface of Nb samples. Our aim is to show the effect of plasma processing on the SEY of Nb. The setup measures the secondary electron energy distribution at various incident angles as measured between the electron beam and the surface of the sample.

The increasing vacuum level indicated beam induced kicker ferrite heating causing lower magnetic kick field at a nominal pulse current. In anticipation of higher current and shorter bunches in FY2015 an accelerator improvement program was initiated to reduce the longitudinal coupling impedance with changes to the eddy-current strip geometry using Opera simulations and to change the CMD5005 to CMD10 ferrite. Results of the standard impedance measurements and of pulse current in heating tests to 170 °C are reported. All 10 dump kickers are being modified and are encapsulated with a cooling system for installation in the rings. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/wepwi054_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/wepwi054.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/wepwi054_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-WEPWI054,

These light sources aim at small natural emittance of approximately 100 pm rad in order to achieve much higher brightness than the present 3rd generation light sources. This small emittance is realized by a multi-bend lattice; which has a small dynamic aperture of only several mm; a small beam size of approximately 10 microns; etc. Therefore; the beam orbit must be precisely measured by beam position monitors (BPM) for the orbit correction and the beam size should be monitored with less than 10-micron resolution in order to estimate the beam emittance. A bunch-by-bunch feedback system is also required for the suppression of various instabilities coming from narrow beam chamber. In addition; since the stable tune region is small; a real-time tune monitor is demanded for the tune correction.

IPAC2015,,THZMS1,A New Class of Superconducting Structures for the Deflection and Crabbing of Particle Beams,ODU; Norfolk; Virginia; USA; Recently; superconducting deflecting and crabbing cavities for particle accelerators and colliders have been an area of intense research. The future colliders pushing the energy and luminosity frontiers and particle accelerators with multi-experimental stations have expanded the need of deflecting/crabbing cavities. The current applications in need of such cavities operate at low frequencies and have also specifications with strict dimensional constraints; high operating transverse gradients; and tight impedance budgets. At low operating frequencies the use of standard cavities operating in TM110-like modes has been very challenging. A new type of superconducting deflecting/crabbing structure has been designed that has a wide range of applications. The new rf-dipole cavity operates in a TE11-like mode where several cavities have been fabricated; and tested. The rf performance shows that these structures are capable of operating at high transverse gradients and will be a very attractive deflecting/crabbing cavity for many current applications.

Neustadt; Austria; MedAustron is a synchrotron based hadron therapy and research center in Wiener Neustadt; Austria; which currently is under commissioning for the first patient treatment. The High Energy Beam Transfer Line (HEBT) consists of mul- tiple functional modules amongst which the phase-shifter- stepper PSS* is the most important module located where the dispersion from the synchrotron is zero and upstream of the switching magnet to the first irradiation room. The PSS is used to control the beam size for the downstream modules and for this scope rotates the beam in horizontal phase space by adjusting the phase advance. This functionality is used in this study to measure beam profiles for multiple phase space angles which act as input for a tomographic reconstruction. Simulation and measurement results are presented.; * M.

Neustadt; Austria; In proton and ion storage rings using the third-order resonance extraction mechanism; beam particles are slowly extracted from the ring when reaching the resonance stop-band. Typically at beam injection; the horizontal tune is set to a value close to the resonance value. The tune is then moved towards the resonance value to trigger beam extraction in a controlled way. The tune shift generated by space charge forces needs to be taken into account. For this; the incoherent space-charge tune shift for protons of the MedAustron accelerator main ring has been evaluated. This has been performed by multi-particle tracking using an optics model based on MADX; considering a realistic Gaussian beam distribution and exact non-linear space charge electric field forces. The MedAustron accelerator is in the beam commissioning phase and is planned to start medical commissioning at the end of 2015.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF002,

The beam loss during the MTI must not exceed the limits determined by machine protection and vacuum requirements. Especially for low energy and intermediate charge state ions; the beam loss can cause a degradation of the vacuum and a corresponding reduction of the beam lifetime. In order to optimize the MTI a genetic algorithm based optimization is used to simultaneously minimize the loss and maximize the multiplication factor (e.g. stored currents in the synchrotron). The effect of transverse space charge force on the MTI has also been taken into account. The optimization resulted in injection parameters; which promise a significant improvement of the MTI performance for intense beams in the SIS18 synchrotron at GSI.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF007,

The required low charge states are subject to enhanced charge exchange processes in collisions with residual gas molecules. Therefore; highest vacuum quality is crucial for a reliable operation and minimal beam loss. The generation of the required low gas densities relies on the pumping capabilities of the cryogenic beam pipe walls. Most typical gas components in ultra high vacuum are bound by cryocondensation at LHe temperatures; resulting in ultimate low pressures with almost infinite pumping capacity. Hydrogen can not be crycondensated to acceptable low pressures. But if the surface coverage is sufficiently low; it can get bound by cryoadsorption. The pumping capabilities of cryogenic walls for Hydrogen have been investigated for SIS100-like conditions. The measurement results have been used in dynamic vacuum simulations at heavy ion operation.

Minimizing this effect; by providing low desorption yield surfaces; is an important issue for maintaining a stable ultra high vacuum during operation with medium charge state heavy ions. For room temperature targets; investigation shows a scaling of the desorption yield with the beam's near-surface electronic energy loss; i.e. a decrease with increasing energy*; **. An optimized material for a room temperature ion-catcher has been found. But for the planned superconducting heavy-ion synchrotron SIS100 at the FAIR accelerator complex; the ion catcher system has to work in a cryogenic environment.

IPAC2015,,THPF018,Simulation Studies of Plasma-based Charge Strippers,TEMF; TU Darmstadt; Darmstadt; Germany; Calculations on the charge state distributions in different charge stripping media are presented. The main focus of this work is the width and peak efficiency of the final charge state distribution. For equal number densities fully-stripped plasma stripping media achieve much higher charge states than gas stripping media of the same nuclear charge. This is due to the reduced electron capture rates of free target electrons compared to bound target electrons. Furthermore; targets with low nuclear charge like hydrogen achieve higher charge states than targets with high nuclear charge like nitrogen in the case of both a plasma and a gas target. Equal final mean charge states can thus be achieved with lower density for plasmas and targets with low nuclear charge. The widths of the charge state distributions are very similar; slightly smaller for plasmas due to the different scaling of the dielectronic recombination rate.

A following beam separation system will extract the deflected beam out of the beamline and minimize the thermal load by beam losses in the vacuum chamber. To further avoid an uncontrolled production of secondary particles; a novel massless septum system is designed for the beam separation. The septum system consists of a static C-magnet with optimized pole shapes; which will extract the beam with minimal losses; and a magnetic shielding tube; which will shield the transmitted pulsed beam from the fringing field of the dipole. The magnetic field and the beam transport properties of the system were numerically investigated. A main deflection field of about 250 mT was achieved; whereas the fringing field was reduced to below 0.3 mT on the beam axis at 60 mm distance from the dipole.

In the low energy section; between the Ion Source and the main linac an RFQ will be used. The 325 MHz RFQ will accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV. This particular high frequency for an RFQ creates difficulties; which are challenging in developing this cavity. In order to define a satisfactory geometrical configuration for this resonator; both from the RF and the mechanical point of view; different designs have been examined and compared. Very promising results have been reached with a ladder type RFQ; which has been investigated since 2013. We present recent 3D simulations of the general layout and of a complete cavity demonstrating the power of a ladder type RFQ as well as measurements of a 0; 8 m prototype RFQ; which was manufactured in late 2014 and designed for RF power and vacuum tests.

To check the necessity of cooling channels; simulations on the temperature distribution at the drift tubes and stems are conducted. A test bench for low power rf-measurements with a 10 gap aluminum model (scale 1:3) is under construction. The modular mechanical design of the model will allow probing experimentally a wide range of drift tube and stem geometries.

As measurements performed at our test bench have confirmed that there is a margin for higher transmissions especially for the RFQ we are currently preparing for a new RFQ design. While keeping the original design parameters; the new RFQ should be optimised with respect to the transmission of beams from different ion sources such as electron cyclotron resonance or electron beam ion sources.

For Injection and Accumulation of Antiprotons delivered from the CR at a momentum of 3.8 GeV/c (gamma=4.2); the HESR optics will be tuned to gamma-t=6.2. For deceleration down to a momentum of 1.5 GeV/c this optic is suitable as well. Stochastic cooling at an intermediate energy is required to avoid beam losses caused by adiabatic growth of the beam during deceleration. For acceleration to 8 GeV/c (gamma=8.6) the optics will be changed after accumulation of the antiproton beam to gamma-t=14.6.

IPAC2015,,THPF031,Towards an RF Wien-Filter for EDM Experiments at COSY,S. Mey; R. Gebel; FZJ; Jülich; Germany; The JEDI Collaboration (Jülich Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) Investigations) is developing tools for the measurement of permanent EDMs of charged; light hadrons in storage rings. The Standard Model predicts unobservably small values for the EDM; but a non-vanishing EDM can be detected by measuring a tiny build-up of vertical polarization in a beforehand horizontally polarized beam. This technique requires a spin tune modulation by an RF Dipole without any excitation of beam oscillations. In the course of 2014; a prototype RF ExB-Dipole has been successfully commissioned and tested. To determine the characteristics of the device; the force of a radial magnetic field is canceled out by a vertical electric one. In this configuration; the dipole fields form a Wien-Filter that directly rotates the particles' polarization vector. We verified that the device can be used to continuously flip the vertical polarization of a 970 MeV(c deuteron beam without exciting any coherent beam oscillations. For a first EDM Experiment; the RF ExB-Dipole in Wien-Filter Mode is going to be rotated by 90° around the beam axis and will be used for systematic investigations of sources for false EDM signals.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf031_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf031.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf031_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF031,

Therefore; the calculation of phase space transfer maps for time-varying fields has been implemented into an extensions for the software framework COSY INFINITY. Benchmarking with measured data and analytical estimates for rf solenoid induced spin resonances are in good agreement.

A modification of the stripper setup was developed to replace the N2-jet with a pulsed gas injection; synchronized with the transit of the beam pulse. The pulsed gas injection lowers the gas load for the differential pumping system; rendering possible the use of other promising gas targets.

The beam extraction is performed by means of two electrostatic deflectors and a set of magnetic channels. Recently; the experiment NUMEN has been proposed to study the nuclear matrix element for the double beta decay . The requirements on target are light ion beams (A<30); with an energy range of 15-60 AMeV and a beam power of 1-5 kW. To achieve this goal we have studied the feasibility of extraction by stripping through the existing extraction channel with an increased transversal section. In addition; a new extraction channel has been designed to increase as much as possible the number of the extracted ions and energies. To allow the realization of these new channels; a new superconducting magnet is needed. The major changes and the expected performances for the upgraded cyclotron; as well as the state-of-art of the design; are here presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf037_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf037.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf037_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF037,

It is not only an issue for reliable machine operation but also for facility maintenance. In the 3-GeV RCS of J-PARC; the residual radiation level is extremely high not only near the injection area but also the used foil itself including the foil holder even at the present operation with one third of the designed 1 MW beam power. As an alternate method; later-assisted stripping of 1 GeV H− beam has been intensively studied at SNS in Oak Ridge. The preparation for the next experiment is underway to demonstrate a three orders of magnitude improvement as compared to the earlier experiment. It is important to extend these studies for the lower H− beam energies.

The ESS neutrino superbeam project plans to use a 5 MW proton beam from the ESS linac to generate a high intensity neutrino superbeam; with the final goal of detecting leptonic CP-violation in an underground megaton Cherenkov water detector. The neutrino production requires a second target station and a complex focusing system for the pions emerging from the target. The normal-conducting magnetic horns that are normally used for these applications cannot accept the 2.86 ms long proton pulses of the ESS linac; which means that pulse shortening in an accumulator ring would be required. That; in turn; requires H− operation in the linac to accommodate the high intensity. As an attractive alternative; we investigate the possibility of using superconducting solenoids for the pion focusing. This solenoid horn system needs to also separate positive and negative pion charge as completely as possible; in order to generate separately neutrino and anti-neutrino beams. We present here progress in the study of such a solenoid horn.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF081,

As part of the LHC Injector Upgrade Project; the PSB injection energy will increase from 50 MeV to 160 MeV and a new H− charge-exchange injection scheme will be implemented. Beam losses are a concern due to the increased injection energy; and mitigation scenarios are under investigation. On the other hand it is desirable for low-intensity beams to have the possibility to precisely tailor sub-micron beam emittances through controlled scraping (transverse shaving process) towards a suitable aperture restriction. Challenges are the higher activation potential of the beam and the smaller transverse beam sizes around 160 MeV as compared to 63 MeV; at which the shaving is presently done. This paper describes the proposal of a new shaving scheme; more robust with respect to the steering errors and the choice of the working point; which localizes the scraping losses on the main PS Booster aperture restriction.

The extremely high stored beam energy means that machine protection considerations will constrain the functional design of the transfer; for instance in the amount of beam transferred; the kicker rise and fall times and hence the collider filling pattern. In addition the transfer lines may need dedicated insertions for passive protection devices.

This can be achieved by either relying on beam induced scrubbing or by coating the vacuum chambers with intrinsically low Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) material over a large fraction of the ring. To clearly establish the potential of beam induced scrubbing; and to eventually decide between the two above options; an extensive scrubbing campaign is taking place at the SPS. Ten days in 2014 and two full weeks in 2015 are devoted to machine scrubbing and scrubbing qualification studies. This paper summarizes the main findings in terms of scrubbing efficiency and reach so far; addressing also the option of using a special doublet beam and its implication for LHC.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf091_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf091.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf091_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF091,

Together with the specific RF design approach adopted; the choice of a 2.9985 GHz backward travelling wave (BTW) structure with 150° RF phase advance per cell was driven by the goal of reaching an accelerating gradient of 50 MV/m; which is more than twice that achieved so far. This choice dictated the need to develop a new code for tracking charged particles through travelling wave structures which were never used before in proton linacs. Nevertheless; the new code has the capability of tracking particles through any kind of accelerating structure; given its real and imaginary electromagnetic field map.

However; with increasing demand for improved reliability and higher beam power it has become clear that a machine upgrade is necessary in the medium to long term. One of the upgrade options is to replace the existing 70 MeV H− injector. In this paper we review the ongoing upgrade programme and highlight three linac upgrade scenarios now under study. The first option is to keep the existing infrastructure and replace the current linac with a higher frequency; more efficient machine. This would allow energies in excess of 100 MeV to be achieved in the same tunnel length. A second option is to replace the current linac with a new 180 MeV linac; requiring a new tunnel. A third option is part of a larger upgrade scenario and involves the construction of an 800 MeV superconducting linac.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf106_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf106.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf106_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF106,

Currently an ECR ion source is used to charge breed CARIBU beams. The EBIS will provide beams with much less contamination and higher breeding efficiencies. In preparation for its installation at ATLAS the EBIS has been successfully commissioned offline. The EBIS was configured in the offline facility to closely mimic the conditions expected in the ATLAS installation; so commissioning results should be representative of its performance with CARIBU. The EBIS breeding efficiency was tested with pulses of 133Cs1+ from a surface ionization source; and for multiple operational modes maximum breeding efficiencies greater than 25% could be achieved. After transmission losses the total efficiency of the system was 15-20%. The contaminants were expectedly very low for a UHV system with nominal pressures of ~1 – 3 x 10-10 Torr.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf110_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf110.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf110_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF110,
IPAC2015,,THPF112,A New Beam Injection Scheme for the Fermilab Booster,Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Here we present an improved beam injection scheme for the Fermilab Booster. The beam is injected on the deceleration part of the standard sinusoidal magnetic ramp and beam capture takes place almost immediately after the injection process; before the beam is fully de-bunched. During the entire capture process we impose in a changing field with changing from negative to zero to positive values. Our simulations clearly showed that this method of beam capture is more efficient to preserve longitudinal beam emittance at the early part of the acceleration cycle and helps to keep the required rf voltage to an optimal value of 15% lower than the current operational values. As a result of the reduced emittance growth at the early part of the Booster cycle we observe reduced required rf power on a typical Booster cycle by ~30%; which is quite important from the point of rf power requirements during the Booster operation. Further; we investigate snap bunch rotation at extraction to provide beam with lower to the MI/RR to improve the proton beam slip-stacking efficiency.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf112_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf112.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf112_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF112,

The injection energy of the Booster will be raised from the current 400 MeV to 800 MeV. Transverse phase space painting will be required due to the small linac transverse emittance (emitring/emitlinac ~ 10) and low average linac current of 2 mA. The painting is also helpful with reduction of beam distributions resulting in a reduction of space charge effects. The injection will require approximately 300 turns corresponding to a ~ 0.5 ms injection time. A factor of seven increase in injected beam power (relative to present operation) requires an injection waste beam absorber.

PIP-II includes the construction of a new 800 MeV H− Superconducting (SC) Linac at Fermilab and an upgrade of its current accelerator complex mostly focused on upgrades of the Booster and Main Injector synchrotrons. The SC Linac will initially operate in pulsed mode at 20 Hz. The design should be compatible with upgrades to CW mode and higher energy. A new transport line will connect the Linac to the Booster. This line has to provide adequate collimation and be instrumented for beam parameter measurements. In addition; to support beam based Linac energy stabilization; the line should provide a mechanism to redirect the beam from the dump to the Booster within one pulse.

However; two kinds of cryomodules would increase the cost in design; therefore would be quite inefficient. In this paper; the FRIB lattice with only single-type 4-cavity-QWR rebuncher cryomodule in folding segment 1 is discussed. Positions of lattice elements are adjusted to accommodate the new type of cryomodule. Beam dynamics is optimized to meet the on-stripper beam requirement. The lattice is then adjusted and rematches.,"Funding: The work is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY-11-02511, and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science under Cooperative Agreement DE-SC0000661.",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf136_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf136.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf136_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF136,

Because of the geometry; electric and magnetic multipole components; including steering terms; quadrupole terms; and higher order terms; would arise and have potential effects on beam dynamics. In this paper; we start with a simple linac periodic structure to study the effects of higher order terms. The action is defined as a figure of merit to quantify the effects. After that; we move to a more realistic situation of FRIB linac segment 1 (LS1). Multipole terms of quarter wave resonators (QWRs) are firstly calculated using multipole expansion scheme.

We derive a relatively simple analytic formula for the nonlinear angular focusing kick imparted to particles traversing the solenoid. Few approximations are made. The formula suggests that for beam transport; little can be done to reduce nonlinearities in solenoid-type magnets other than take a simple design without abrupt changes as a function of axial coordinate and appropriately choose the aspect ratio (characteristic bore radius over axial length) of the magnet system and the beam filling factor within the aperture to limit nonlinear effects.

IPAC2015,,THPF146,Spin Coherence Time Lengthening of a Polarized Deuteron Beam Using Sextupole FieldsFields,UNIFE; Ferrara; Italy; The measurement of a non-zero electric dipole moment (EDM) aligned along the spin of sub-atomic particles would probe new physics beyond the standard model. It has been proposed to search for the EDM of charged particles using a storage ring and a longitudinally polarized beam. The EDM signal would be a rotation of the polarization from the horizontal plane toward the vertical direction as a consequence of the radial electric field always present in the particle frame. This experiment requires ring conditions that can ensure a lifetime of the in-plane polarization (spin coherence time; SCT) up to 1000 s. At the COoler SYnchrotron (COSY) located at the Forschungszentrum Jülich; the JEDI collaboration has begun to examine the effects of emittance and momentum spread on the SCT of a polarized deuteron beam at 0.97 GeV/c. The set of data presented here shows how second-order effects from emittance and momentum spread of the beam affect the lifetime of the horizontal polarization of a bunched beam. It has been observed that sextupole fields can correct for depolarizing sources and increase the spin coherence time up to hundreds of seconds while setting the chromaticities equal to zero.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/talks/thpf146_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/papers/thpf146.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2015/posters/thpf146_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-THPF146,
