        "Beam loss measurement systems are often used for the protection of equipment against the damage caused by impacting particles creating secondary showers and their energy dissipation in the matter. Depending on the acceptable consequences and the frequency of particle impact events on equipment reliability requirements are scaling accordingly. Increasing reliability often leads to more complex systems. The downside of complexity is a reduction of availability",
        "therefore an optimum has to be found for these conflicting requirements. A detailed review of selected concepts and solutions from real-life examples will be given to show approaches used in various parts of the system from the sensors",
        "signal processing",
        "and software implementations up to the requirements for operation and documentation."
