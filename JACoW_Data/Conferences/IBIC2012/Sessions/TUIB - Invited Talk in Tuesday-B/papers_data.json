        "The generation of ultrashort x-ray pulses in the femtosecond (fs) regime in FELs requires electron bunches with lengths significantly below 1 ps with a strong tendency to aim for the 1 fs scale. This greatly challenges the present beam diagnostic methods. In this paper",
        "we will present an overview of the existing and proposed techniques of bunch profile diagnostics including transverse deflecting cavities",
        "electro optic methods",
        "frequency domain techniques as well as more complex approaches like \"optical replica synthesizers\" (ORS)."
