        "The electron-positron collider KEKB B-factory is currently being upgraded to SuperKEKB. The design luminosity of 8 x 1035 /cm2/s will be achieved using beams with low emittance of several nm and doubling beam currents to 2.6 A in the electron ring (HER) and 3.6 A in the positron ring (LER). A beam position monitor (BPM) system of HER and LER will be equipped with super-heterodyne detectors",
        "turn by turn log ratio detectors with fast gates to measure optics parameters during collision operation and detectors of BPMs near the collision point (IP) for orbit feedback to maintain stable collision. New X-ray beam profile monitors based on the coded aperture method will be installed aiming at bunch by bunch measurement of the beam profile. A large angle beamstrahlung monitor detecting polarization of the synchrotron radiation generated by beam-beam interaction will be installed near IP to obtain information about the beam-beam geometry. The bunch by bunch feedback system will be upgraded using low noise frontend electronics and new 12 bits iGp digital filters. An overview of beam instrumentation of SuperKEKB rings will be given in this paper."

We report on the development of a new vertical electron beam size measurement and monitoring technique which utilizes a vertical undulator. An APPLE-II type undulator was phased to produce a horizontal magnetic field",

Vertical electron beam emittances of several picometres have been observed at the Australian Synchrotron storage ring. With this apparatus immediately available at most existing electron and positron storage rings",
