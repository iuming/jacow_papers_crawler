IBIC2012,,MOIA02,Progress of Beam Instumentation in J-PARC Linac,JAEA/J-PARC; Tokai-mura; Japan; J-PARC; one of the high intensity proton accelerators; achieved the output power of 300 kW at the downstream rapid cycling synchrotron with a beam energy of 181 MeV and a beam current of 15 mA. When an upgrade of an ion source which can provide 50 mA and the installation of the additional acceleration cavities for the energy upgrade up to 400 MeV are completed; output power can reach 1MW. To meet with the requirements of the high intensity beam diagnostics; we prepare several measures against high intensity proton related issues. The following subjects have been reported among many subjects: development of strip-line type beam position monitors; beam current monitors; phase monitors and transverse profile monitors. And the subjects of the beam diagnostic for the energy upgraded linac including the longitudinal beam profile monitor and the developing laser based profile monitor will be mentioned. A big earthquake occurred on May 11; 2011. We successfully recovered to have commercial operation; but a partial recovery is still undergoing. Influence of the quake on the J-PARC linac is also mentioned.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/moia02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/moia02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/moia02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOIA02,1

The design luminosity of 8 x 1035 /cm2/s will be achieved using beams with low emittance of several nm and doubling beam currents to 2.6 A in the electron ring (HER) and 3.6 A in the positron ring (LER). A beam position monitor (BPM) system of HER and LER will be equipped with super-heterodyne detectors; turn by turn log ratio detectors with fast gates to measure optics parameters during collision operation and detectors of BPMs near the collision point (IP) for orbit feedback to maintain stable collision. New X-ray beam profile monitors based on the coded aperture method will be installed aiming at bunch by bunch measurement of the beam profile. A large angle beamstrahlung monitor detecting polarization of the synchrotron radiation generated by beam-beam interaction will be installed near IP to obtain information about the beam-beam geometry. The bunch by bunch feedback system will be upgraded using low noise frontend electronics and new 12 bits iGp digital filters.

We report on the development of a new vertical electron beam size measurement and monitoring technique which utilizes a vertical undulator. An APPLE-II type undulator was phased to produce a horizontal magnetic field; deflecting the electron beam in the vertical plane. The measured ratios of undulator spectral peak heights are evaluated by fitting to simulations of the apparatus. Vertical electron beam emittances of several picometres have been observed at the Australian Synchrotron storage ring. With this apparatus immediately available at most existing electron and positron storage rings; we find this to be an appropriate and novel vertical emittance diagnostic.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mocb04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mocb04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mocb04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOCB04,20
IBIC2012,,MOCC01,UV/X-ray Diffraction Radiation for Non-intercepting Micron-scale Beam Size Measurement,L.M. Bobb; N. Chritin; T. Lefèvre; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; CLASSE; Ithaca; New York; USA; L.M. Bobb; V. Karataev; JAI; Egham; Surrey; United Kingdom; Diffraction Radiation (DR) is produced when a relativistic charged particle moves in the vicinity of a medium. The electric field of the charged particle polarizes the target atoms which then oscillate; emitting radiation with a very broad spectrum. The spatial-spectral properties of DR are sensitive to a range of electron beam parameters. Furthermore; the energy loss due to DR is so small that the electron beam parameters are unchanged. Therefore DR can be used to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools. The aim of this project is to measure the transverse (vertical) beam size using incoherent DR. To achieve the micron-scale resolution required by CLIC; DR in the UV and X-ray spectral-range must be investigated. During the next few years; experimental validation of such a scheme will be conducted on the CesrTA at Cornell University; USA. Here we present the current status of the experiment preparation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mocc01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mocc01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mocc01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOCC01,24

A precise measurement of the electron bunch charge distribution (BCD) is crucial key to keep spatial and temporal overlaps between high-order harmonic (HH) laser pulses and electron bunches. R&D of the 3D-BCD monitor with a single-shot detection has been extensively promoted at SPring-8. The monitor adopts a spectral decoding based Electro-Optic (EO) sampling technique that is non-destructive and enables real-time reconstruction of the 3D-BCD with a temporal resolution of 30- to 40-fs (FWHM). So far; such EO sampling based BCD monitors have been developed by utilizing inorganic EO crystals such as ZnTe and their temporal resolutions are limited to ~130 fs (FWHM). As a part of this project; the first BCD measurement with an organic EO crystal DAST has been successfully demonstrated at the facility. Signal intensities; temporal resolutions and radiation related issues via both ZnTe and DAST are discussed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mocc03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mocc03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mocc03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOCC03,29

A screen monitor (SCM) system has been developed and was installed in order to obtain a direct image of a transverse beam profile with a spatial resolution of about 10 um; which is required to investigate electron-beam properties; such as a beam emittance. The SCM originally has a stainless steel target as a OTR radiator or a Ce:YAG crystal as a scintillation target. At the beginning of the SACLA operation; strong coherent OTR (COTR); which made an incorrect beam profile; was observed after bunch compressors. In order to suppress the COTR on the SCM; the stainless steel target was replaced to the Ce:YAG scintillation target. Since the COTR was still generated from the Ce:YAG target; a spatial mask was employed. The mask was mounted on the center of the optical line of the SCM; because the COTR light is emitted forward within ~1/γ radian; while the scintillation light has not angular dependence. Clear beam profiles with a diameter of a few tens of micro-meter are observed by means of the SCMs with this simple improvement.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mocc04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mocc04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mocc04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOCC04,34

The Japanese XFEL facility; SACLA; requires a normalized emittance less than 1 mm mrad and a peak current more than 3 kA. To achieve this high peak current; 1 A beam with 1 ns duration from a thermionic electron gun is compressed down to 30 fs by means of a multi-stage bunch compressor system. Therefore; the beam diagnostic system for SACLA was designed for the measurements of the emittance and bunch length at each compression stage. We developed a high-resolution transverse profile monitor and a temporal bunch structure measurement system with a C-band rf deflector cavity etc. In addition; precise overlapping between an electron beam and radiated x-rays in the undulator section is necessary to ensure the XFEL interaction. Therefore; we employed a C-band sub-micron resolution RF-BPM to fulfill the demanded accuracy of 4 um. The beam diagnostic system surely contributed to the first x-ray lasing at a wavelength of 1.2 Angstrom. We present a design strategy of the whole beam diagnostic system and the achieved performance for each monitor.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/moic02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/moic02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/moic02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOIC02,38

Several stripline kicker systems will be used to inject and extract the beam from the PDRs and DRs. Results of initial studies of the stripline cross-section and the beam coupling impedance; for a non-tapered beam pipe; have previously been reported. In this paper; we present the analysis to study the final choice of the cross-section design; based on impedance matching and field inhomogeneity requirements; the power reflected in the transition between an electrode and the input coaxial feedthrough; and the predicted beam coupling impedance. Mechanical tolerances for the stripline manufacturing process are presently being studied.

The main requirements of the design of two magnet system is to focus an electron beam having a spot size less than 3 mm X 3 mm; energy spread within 3% and divergence angle <= 3 mrad at the target. To achieve these parameters the simulation was carried out using Lorentz-3EM software. The beam spot; divergence angle and energy spread were observed with respect to the variation in angles of sector magnets and drift distance. From the simulated results; it has been optimized that the first and second magnet has an angle 195 degree and 75 degree and the drift distance 64 mm. It is also observed that at the 1396; 2878 and 4677 A-turn; the optimized design produces 3324; 6221 and 9317 Gauss of magnetic field at median plane require to bend 6; 12 and 18 MeV electron respectively.

Therefore; an electron beam current monitor and its electronic system have been designed and built to measure the distribution of a beam current either in the horizontal or vertical direction along with the beam dimensions. To obtain X-Y beam profile; a special type of Faraday Cup was designed which mainly consists of charge collecting electrodes made up of thin copper strips. Each strip having dimensions 0.5 mm wide; 4 mm thick and 20 mm long were fixed parallel to each other and separation between them was ~ 0.5 mm. This multi electrode Faraday was mounted at the extraction port of the Race Track Microtron; where 1 MeV electron beam allowed to fall on it. The beam characterization in the form of current and uniformity were measured. The current from each strip were measured using an electronic circuit developed based on the multiplexing principle. The uniformity of the beam can be measured with an accuracy of 10%. The minimum and maximum dimensions which can be measured are 3 mm and 15 mm respectively.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopa04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopa04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopa04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPA04,54
IBIC2012,,MOPA06,"VIMOS, New Capabilities for an Optical Safety System",K. Thomsen; J. Devlaminck; PSI; Villigen PSI; Switzerland; VIMOS is a dedicated safety system developed at the Spallation Neutron Source SINQ at the Paul Scherrer Institut; PSI; in Switzerland. VIMOS very directly monitors the correct current density distribution of the proton beam on the target by sampling the light emitted from a glowing mesh heated by the passing protons. The design has been optimized for obtaining maximum sensitivity and timely detection of beam irregularities relying on standard well-proven components. Recently it has been demonstrated that technical boundary conditions like radiation level and signal strength should allow for upgrading the system to a sensitive diagnostic device delivering quantitative and image-resolved values for the proton current density distribution on the SINQ target. By determining the temperature of the glowing mesh from the signals in two separate wavelength bands the temperature distribution over the mesh can be derived und subsequently the incident proton beam current density distribution. Work aimed at investigating the feasibility of adding these diagnostic abilities to VIMOS shows initial promising results. The status of the project and preliminary findings will be reported.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopa06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopa06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopa06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPA06,57

The HM-18 allows us to accelerate protons and deuterons at fixed energies of 18 and 9 MeV; respectively. It has four trim coils for generation of the isochronous fields. Until recently; currents of the four trim coils had been adjusted only by monitoring the output beam intensity. In order to exactly produce the isochronous fields; a new phase probe has been installed in the HM-18. The phase probe has a simple structure in which four copper electrode plates of 60 mm x70 mm in area are glued to a copper base plate with a polyimide insulator between them. The thicknesses of the copper plates and the polyimide are 0.1 mm. This structure has an advantage that it can be easily installed in the cyclotron; only one part of a pair of upper and lower electrodes; which is usually adopted; is simply attached on the surface of the (lower) sector pole. The development of the phase probe and some results of a preliminary beam test using it are reported.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopa07_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopa07.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopa07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPA07,60

The WCM signals are used as the input of the beam loading compensation system; and also used diagnosis to adjust the rf system parameters. Since the rf and beam frequency is in the range of a few MHz; direct measurement of the WCM signals is possible. For the diagnosis; the WCM signals are taken by an oscilloscope with the revolution clock signal generated by the LLRF control system; and slices of the WCM waveform with lengths of the revolution periods are generated. By stacking the slices; one can get a mountain plot; which shows motions of bunches and variations of the bunch shapes. Also; time variations of the bunching factor; which are important for acceleration of high intensity proton beams; are obtained. The harmonic analysis is performed on the WCM signal and the cavity voltage monitor signal. By using complex amplitudes of them; one can calculate the impedance seen by the beam. In this presentation; we show examples of the analyses described above. The rf parameters for high intensity beams have been successfully adjusted by using these analyses.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopa08_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopa08.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopa08_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPA08,63

Furthermore; an internal conversion reference is employed in the digitization; to provide an accurate absolute measurement.

IBIC2012,,MOPA13,Real-time Calculation of Scale Factors of X-ray Beam Position Monitors during User Operation,C. Bloomer; G. Rehm; Diamond; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom; Photoemission based X-ray Beam Position Monitors (XBPMs) are widely used at 3rd generation light sources to both monitor and stabilise the photon beam to sub-micron precision. Traditionally; finding the geometric scale factors requires either systematic stepper motor movements of the XBPM or well controlled electron beam displacements to measure the response of the XBPM. For each Insertion Device gap it is required to repeat this in order to build up a complete set of scale factors covering all possible operating conditions.

The BPM mechanics and Radio-Frequency front-end (RFFE) electronics are developed by CEA/Saclay. Two RFFEs and a digital back-end with two ADC mezzanines are integrated into a compact standalone unit called MBU (modular BPM unit) developed by PSI. The signal processing uses hybrids and a single stage downconversion to generate the signals sum and delta. Every RF/analog component of the re-entrant BPM electronics has been simulated with a Mathcad model and tested independently on test benches. The very low Q of the cavity monopole mode allows the new electronics to filter this mode at the dipole mode frequency and an IQ demodulation for delta and sum channels allow the digital back-end to determine the sign of the beam position just by comparing the phases of the channels; independently of beam arrival time jitter and external reference clock phase.

The BPMs were originally designed with the external capacitors. The aim was to improve the position response in wider frequencies and to get an adequate output voltage at the design intensity; 4x1013 ppb. It was modified; however; not to have the capacitors. Therefore we have sufficient signal intensity from low intensity beams of the initial beam commissioning; but too large from the design intensity beam. The processing circuits (BPMC) have to accommodate those output signals from high intensity beams. We are adding the attenuator-LPFs just before the BPMC. This paper will describe these additional attenuator-LPFs. In connection with the MR collimator upgrade; some BPMs are re-allocated.

The four signals from the BPM are sent to a digital oscilloscope and are recorded. In the switching circuit; coaxial switches of SPDT (Single Pole Dual Throw) and SP4T type are used. To control coaxial switches; we adopted 'mbed'; the ARM microcontroller development kit. The 'mbed' stores the control applications configured in the HTML file and JavaScript library which can handle multiple I/O ports. It responds as a HTTP server and the control application runs on a Web browser.

The ALICE arc has been designed to be isochronous; with the bunch compression achieved through a separate dedicated bunch compressor chicane. The arc incorporates two sextupoles for correcting non-linear longitudinal matrix terms and experimental evidence suggests that the off-centred beam in the sextupoles breaks the linear isochronicity.

However; an overshoot of the beam spill at the start of extraction is often induced by a slight variation of the beam emittance in operation cycles. It brings dose hot spot inside the target volume; because the tolerable beam-intensity in scanning irradiation is low. We have added short extraction; called preliminary extraction; before irradiation in order to remove the uncontrollable spilled particles. During preliminary extraction; it is necessary to prevent the beam delivering to the patient. Therefore; a fast beam shutter on which an ionization chamber is mounted was developed; and it was installed in the extraction line. The fast shutter enables us to switch from preliminary extraction to irradiation within 100 ms; and the reliability of the beam-intensity control system was drastically improved by the preliminary extraction technique.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopa37_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopa37.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopa37_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPA37,143

IBIC2012,,MOPA39,Introduction of Photon BPMs in SOLEIL Global Orbit Feedback Systems,N. Hubert; L. Cassinari; L.S. Nadolski; SOLEIL; Gif-sur-Yvette; France; SOLEIL global orbit feedback systems (slow and fast); based on 122 electron Beam Position Monitor (e-BPM) readings; are in operation since 2008 and give very satisfying performances (0.1Hz-500Hz vertical noise below 300 nm RMS and long term (8h) drifts below 1μm RMS). Whereas each straight section is equipped with an upstream and downstream e-BPM; there is no e-BPM next to a dipole magnet. For that reason; photon BPMs (x-BPMs) in the dipole beamline frontends give additional information that can be used to better stabilize the source point in the dipoles. In fact x-BPMs provide also a better position angular measurement resolution; as they are located at 4 meters from the source point. Results presented in this paper show that vertical position stability on bending magnet beamlines can be improved by including their x-BPM measurements in the global orbit feedback systems. As a first step x-BPMs have been introduced in the Slow Orbit FeedBack system (SOFB) that corrects the orbit with a repetition rate of 0.1Hz. In a second step x-BPMs will be introduced in the Fast Orbit FeedBack system (FOFB) running at a repetition rate of 10 kHz.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopa39_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopa39.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopa39_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPA39,150

As the bunch length becomes shorter; it is important to know and be able to measure the limitations of the instrument in terms of shortest measurable bunch length. In this paper we describe experiment of using blackbody source with the modified Matrin-Puplett interferometer that is routinely used for bunch length measurements at the JLab FEL; as a way to estimate the shortest; measurable with the device; bunch. The limitation comes from high frequency cut-off of the presently used wire-grid polarizer and is estimated to be 50 fs RMS. The measurements are made with the same Golay cell detector that is used for beam measurements.

Usually this method can only obtain the resolution about ~10ps with beam length ~30ps when using signal from button or stripline BPM. But in FEL case; the beam length is the ps or sub-ps order. The paper discusses the probability of beam length measurement based on the TM010 mode in FEL case.

Precise knowledge of the beam position in the chicane is of great significance for the longitudinal dynamics control. In the current implementation cylindrical pickup-striplines mounted perpendicularly to the beam are used as a Beam Position Monitor (BPM)(*). One can determine the horizontal beam position by measuring the phase difference of the beam induced signal at opposite ends of a pickup. Due to the different electrical and mechanical requirements for the European XFEL a new BPM has to be developed. In this paper; we present the design and analysis of a planar transmission line structure which is planned to be used as a BPM in the European XFEL. The planar design of the pickups can provide for proper impedance match to the subsequent electronics as well as sufficient mechanical stability along the aperture when using alumina substrates.

An X-ray streak camera (X-SC) can directly measure the temporal width of X-ray synchrotron radiation pulse. The temporal resolution of X-SC depends on the initial velocity distribution of the photoelectrons from a photocathode which converts the X-ray photons to the photoelectrons. To measure the temporal resolution of the X-SC; we have observed 'single photon' streak camera images and measured the temporal spread of the images. By this 'single photon' experiment; we have evaluated the dependence of the temporal resolution and the detection efficiency on the photon energy. We have also tried to evaluate the dependence of the temporal resolution and the detection efficiency on the thickness of the photocathode. For this purpose; we have developed a multi-array type CsI photocathode with 3 different thickness of the photocathode. The experimental setups; and the results of the measurements of the temporal spread and the detection efficiency of the single photon events will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopa48_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopa48.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopa48_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPA48,171

However; their temporal profile and frequency spectra have shot-to-shot fluctuation by a SASE process. One of the promising approached for the problems is a seeded FEL scheme by using a full-coherent light source. The seeded FEL has been demonstrated in the EUV region by employ the high-order harmonics (HH) generation from an external laser source at the SCSS test-accelerator in the SPring-8. It is important for the HH-seeded FEL scheme to synchronize and overlap between the seeding laser pulse and the electron bunch. Their timing difference and laser spatial pointing is drifting. Therefore; a timing feedback and non-destructive monitor are necessary to operate seeded FEL continuously. We have constructed the timing monitor based on Electro-Optic (EO) sampling which is measure the timing difference the seeded laser pulse and the electron bunch simultaneously with the seeded FEL process. The probe laser pulse for the EO-sampling system is optically split from the common external HH laser driver for the seeded FEL.

An important part of the research at CesrTA is the study of the growth; decay and mitigation of electron clouds. Electron Cloud (EC) densities can be measured with a Shielded Pickup (SPU); where cloud electrons pass into the detector through an array of small holes in the wall of the beam-pipe. The signals produced by SPU have proved to be very useful in measuring the mitigating effect of different vacuum chamber surfaces - including differences in quantum efficiency as well as secondary and elastic yield.

It is indispensable to perform beam tuning and evaluation of the beam quality at the same time for efficient operation. Therefore; we developed a real-time beam profile measurement system composed of two CCD cameras; fluorescent screens; and an image analysis program based on LabVIEW. In order to measure the transverse intensity distribution of the beam through the luminance map converted from a camera image; the characteristics of fluorescent screens; DRZ (Gd2O2S:Tb) and AF995R (Al2O3:Cr); were investigated using several species of ion beams.

To evaluate the uniformity of the 2D field; radiographic film is used due to its high spatial resolution and suit for the measurements of the integral dose. However; this technique is time consuming. Thus; we developed the QA tool with high spatial resolution to verify accuracy of the lateral size; position and uniformity of scanned ion beams in clinical application at the HIMAC; which we called the QA-SCN.

Contrary to the IPM it does not require in-vacuum components; making it a robust and inexpensive instrument. The SPM is suitable for high intensity operation rather than operation with low intensity polarised beams. A multichannel PMT is used to detect scintillation light. The rate of detectable scintillation events is about three orders of magnitude lower compared to the rate of ionisation events. To boost the photon yield; small amounts of nitrogen are injected into the SPM vacuum chamber. An adjustable light focusing system is being built to optimise the SPM performance for different machine operation modes.

In this contribution we describe our initial experience with the HDR imaging of the electron beam at the JLab FEL. On contrary to HDR measurements made with wire scanners in counting mode; which provide only two or three 1D projections of transverse beam distribution; imaging allows to measure the distribution itself. That is especially important for non-equilibrium beams in the LINACs. The measurements were made by means of simultaneous imaging with two CCD sensors with different exposure time. Two images are combined then numerically in to one HDR image. The system works as an online tool providing HDR images at 4 Hz. An optically polished YAG:Ce crystal with the thickness of 100 um was used for the measurements. When tested with a laser beam images with the DR of about 10+5 were obtained. With the electron beam the DR was somewhat smaller due to the limitations in the time structure of the tune-up beam macro pulse.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/mopb80_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/mopb80.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/mopb80_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-MOPB80,263

The electrons are guided to the segmented electrode with a uniform electrostatic field applied in the gap. A uniform magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric field to reduce diffusion of electrons travelling to the electrodes. Typical spatial resolution of the RGIPMs with a 10 cm gap; a 10 V/cm electrostatic field; and a 400 gauss magnetic field at center is 0.5 mm.

Using the visible light from the optical diagnostic beamline on the storage ring at the Australian Synchrotron an optical telescope was constructed to focus an image on the ICCD. The event driven timing system was then used to synchronise the camera with the injected beam. To overcome the problem of dynamic range between the amount of charge in an injected bunch and the stored beam; the beam was dumped by slowly phase flipping the RF by 180 degrees between each one 1 Hz injection cycle. The injection process was verified to be stable enough so that measurements of the different turns could be captured on successive injections and did not need to be captured in single shot. The beam was seen to come in relatively cleanly in a tight beam but would then rapidly decohere due to the strong non-linear fields needed to run the storage ring at high chromaticity. It would take thousands of turns for the beam to damp down again and recohere into a tight beam spot again.

The high-precision tune monitor has the resolution of 0.0002 and uses frequency analysis methods such as SRSA; zoom FFT; STFT; in addition to usual FFT. Tune shifts due to a slight difference of filling patterns during top-up operations can be observed with this monitor.

Because of the small acceptance of the ring; fine parameter tuning is required for the stable top-up injection. In that process; some single shot linac beam measurements were necessary to understand the shot-by-shot fluctuation of the injection efficiency. We used the electron ring itself as a linac beam monitor. The time-resolving visible light monitor in the ring records the profiles of the injected linac beam for many revolutions. The pulse width for the single rf bucket (500MHz) of the ring is normally 1 ns; which contains 3 linac bunches (2856MHz). The time profile in the ring gives the energy profile at after 1/4 of the synchrotron oscillation period. The spatial profile of several revolutions; recorded by a double-sweep streak camera or ICCD gated camera; gives a beam emittance of a single-shot. The streak camera enables the bunch by bunch measurement. The effective resolution depends on the beta function of the ring; which can easily be changed. For the vertical emittance; our spatial resolution of 0.3 mm FWHM at βy = 17 m was good enough to identify the quadrupole mismatch.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/tucc01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/tucc01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/tucc01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-TUCC01,302

The 'IPBSM'; installed at ATF2's virtual IP; is the only existing beam size monitor capable of measuring σy < 100 nm; making it indispensable for ATF's goals and R&D at future LCs. This owes to a novel technique of colliding e- beam against laser interference fringes. σy is derived from the modulation depth of resulting Compton photons; which is large for small σy. The measurable range from O(10) nm ~ a few μm; is controlled by switching between laser crossing angles θ = 174°; 30°; and 2° - 8° .

IBIC2012,,TUPA25,Signal Transmission Characteristics in Stripline-Type Beam Position Monitor,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; New stripline-type beam position monitor (BPM) system is under development at the KEKB injector linac in order to measure transverse beam positions with a high precision less than 10 micron meters towards the Super KEKB-factory (SKEKB) at KEK. During the KEKB operation; conventional stripline-type BPMs with a position resolution of 0.1 mm have been working well. However; the high-precision BPM system is strongly required for the SKEKB operation to stably accelerate single-bunch electron and positron beams with high bunch charges of ~5 nC/bunch; and also to keep the beam stability with higher brightness. The new stripline-type BPMs with large aperture compared with previously designed BPMs; which will be installed just after the positron production and capture section; have been designed.

The on-board FPGA device controls the integral periods; instructs the ADC devices to perform measurements at the end of each period and collects the measurements. In the next stage it combines the number of charge and discharge cycles accounted in the last interval together with the cycle fractions observed using the ADC samples to produce a digitized high precision value of the charges collected.

IBIC2012,,TUPA34,Inverse Response Matrix Computation for the Storage Ring Slow Orbit Feedback Control: Synthesized Topological Inversion Computation,J.M. Lee; J.Y. Huang; C. Kim; PAL; Pohang; Kyungbuk; Republic of Korea; Using the derivative response matrix between BPM-data and MPS-setting; we described the inverse computation methodology for the storage ring orbit feedback control. Practically useful for SOFB with assistance of FOFB; the inverse of SVD manipulation is less efficient because a type of consecutive instability noise irreversibly accumulates in the beam trajectory deviation. In contrast; a novel numerical recipe based on topological math can lead to a self-consistent solution; dramatically suppressing ill-posed instability problems. This approach; known as a singularity regularization method; makes it feasible to compute a system-matched de-noising filter. The response matrix in H/V dimensions reflects a global beam dynamics along the storage ring lattices. Matrix refinement manipulatcan can be made to filter out the uncertainty of measurement errors escaping from beam dynamics constraints. Then we believe that algorithm filter can be effective as a software part of FOFB control. Our math STIC (Synthesized Topological Inversion Computation*) appears to be the most reliable inverse computation methodology.

A powerful X-band deflecting cavity is being installed downstream of the FEL undulator and the streaked electron beam will be observed at an energy spectrometer screen at the beam dump. The single-shot measurements will reveal which time slices of the streaked beam have contributed to the FEL process by virtue of their greater energy loss and energy spread relative to the non-lasing portions of the electron bunch. Since the diagnostic is located downstream of the undulator it can be operated continuously without interrupting the beam to the users. The resolution of the new X-band system will be compared to the existing S-band RF deflecting diagnostic systems at SLAC and consideration is given to the required RF phase stability tolerances required for acceptable beam jitter on the monitor.

During the operation of 11 years; a pair of controlled beam abort systems worked more than 10000 times to protect the hardware components of KEKB accelerator and the detector against the high intensity beams of LER and HER. Optimization of the abort trigger was necessary to balance efficient operation with the safety of the hardware. Therefore; we analyzed one-by-one all of the aborts; and continually adjusted the abort system. The diagnostic system was based on a high-sampling-rate data logger that recorded beam currents; RF signals and beam loss monitor signals.

The fast diagnostic system observes a spatial profile of the undulator radiation on a selected harmonic number. Especially; the higher harmonic radiations than the 10th-order are sensitive to the energy spread. A fluorescence screen (YAG:Ce) with afterglow of several tens of nano-second converts the radiation profile into visible light image. The imaging optics makes the horizontal and vertical profiles as two line images by one-dimensional focusing using cylindrical lenses. A fast-gated CCD camera with image intensifier simultaneously captures the two line images.

The system is composed of a phase-space collimator in the low energy section and a beam intensity monitor in the high energy section. The phase-space collimator; which consists of two pairs of slits; allows very small-emittance beams to be injected into the cyclotron by limiting position and divergence angle of the beam from an ion source. The beam intensity monitor is used to obtain the ratio of beam intensity at the collimator to that at the monitor. In acceptance measurement; the small-emittance beams at various positions in a transverse phase-plane are injected to determine the distribution of relative transmission in the phase plane. In preliminary tests; only a part of acceptance was able to be measured because the injection-beam emittance from ion sources does not cover the whole acceptance. To expand the measurement area; a steering magnet has been added in the system. The magnet scans the injection beam in phase planes in synchronization with the acceptance measurement to simulate the large emittance.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/tupb65_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/tupb65.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/tupb65_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-TUPB65,499

When the intensity of the incident beams are much high; the gain reduction of the output signal from the MWPC monitor occurs due to the space charge effect of positive ions around the anode wires. The gain reduction is expected to be improved by changing geometric parameters; such as anode radius and distance between electrodes. In order to investigate the gain-reduction characteristics for different geometric parameters; we performed numerical simulation using a numerical code. The numerical code was developed using a two-dimensional drift-diffusion model to evaluate the gas gain including the reduction effect caused by the space charge effect of the moving positive ions. We investigate the gain-reduction rate for several parameters of the anode distance when changing the beam intensity. From these results; we discuss desirable distances between the anode wires to improve the gain reduction.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/tupb69_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/tupb69.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/tupb69_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-TUPB69,502

A technique has; therefore; been developed to measure the two-dimensional transverse intensity distribution of the ion beam using Gafchromic radiochromic films (Ashland Inc.). In order to show available fluence ranges of the film; the coloring response of the Gafchromic films irradiated with several species of ion beams is investigated as a change in the optical density of the film. It has been found that the optical density increases linearly with the fluence; whose range is practical for materials and biological research. Thus; the relative transverse intensity distribution of ion beams can be measured using the film. Furthermore; the intensity distribution determined by the Gafchromic film is compared with the area-density distribution of track-etched pores in a polymer film from a microscopic viewpoint.

Typical tune measurements excite the beam and measure the resulting motion over time using electromagnetic pickups. The novel measurement technique presented utilises high-speed MSM photodiodes in a balanced detector set-up to measure the vertical and horizontal betatron tunes. Radiation from a bending magnet consists of both visible light and X-rays. The visible light is separated from the X-rays with an optical chicane and focussed onto a pair of length-matched optical fibers each coupled to an MSM photodiode. The specialised biasing circuit for the photodiodes is constructed in a balanced detector configuration to emphasise any motion in the beam. Signal resulting from beam motion is amplified and digitised for analysis. Using this set-up the tunes for the storage ring at the Australian Synchrotron have been measured and verified with comparison to existing tune measurement technologies.

The basic tuning methods and operation of conventional OTR monitors are well established for transverse beam sizes not smaller than 3-5 um. Since the Point Spread Function (PSF) dimension defines the resolution of the conventional monitors; for small electron beam dimensions the PSF form significantly depends on a presence of OTR tails diffraction and aberrations in the optical system. In our experiment we have managed to squeeze the electron beam such that we can practically measure PSF distribution in one direction. The revealed PSF structure is such that the visibility depends on the transverse beam size on micron scale. We developed an empirical calibration technique and successfully overcame the resolution limit of the common OTR monitor reaching sub-micron level.

IBIC2012,,WEIB02,Review of Reliability Concepts Applied to Beam Loss Monitoring Systems,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Beam loss measurement systems are often used for the protection of equipment against the damage caused by impacting particles creating secondary showers and their energy dissipation in the matter. Depending on the acceptable consequences and the frequency of particle impact events on equipment reliability requirements are scaling accordingly. Increasing reliability often leads to more complex systems. The downside of complexity is a reduction of availability; therefore an optimum has to be found for these conflicting requirements. A detailed review of selected concepts and solutions from real-life examples will be given to show approaches used in various parts of the system from the sensors; signal processing; and software implementations up to the requirements for operation and documentation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/weib02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/weib02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/weib02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-WEIB02,550

Such a source will be driven using 2 deuteron accelerators 125 mA cw up to 40 MeV impinging into a lithium liquid curtain; thus producing very high neutron flux with a similar spectrum as those expected in fusion reactors. A validation phase was decided for this 10 MW facility consisting partly in the design of the prototype accelerator LIPAc (Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator). LIPAc; which is in design phase; will accelerate a 125 mA cw beam deuteron up to the first superconductive linac module (4 for IFMIF). The 9 MeV beam will be driven through a HEBT to beam dump.

However; one of the limitations of the technique is the dynamic range and noise level of CCD cameras when measuring ultra low emittance beams and hence visibilities close to unity. A new design has been successfully tested to overcome these limitations by introducing a know intensity imbalance in one of the light paths of the interferometer. This modification reduces the visibility in a controlled way and lifts the measured interference pattern out of the noise level of the CCD; thus increasing the dynamic range of the apparatus. Results are presented from tests at the ATF2 at KEK and on the optical diagnostic beamline at the Australian Synchrotron storage ring.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/talks/wecc03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/papers/wecc03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2012/posters/wecc03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2012-WECC03,566

In order to achieve single spike FEL pulses at FLASH; electron bunch charges down to 20 pC are of interest. With the current BAMs the required time resolution is not reachable for bunch charges below 500 pC. Therefore new pickups with a bandwidth of up to 40 GHz (2) are designed and manufactured. The signal evaluation takes place with a time-stabilized reference laser pulse train which is modulated with an Electro-Optical intensity Modulator (EOM). The new pickup system also requires a new electro-optical frontend with a 40 GHz EOM. The theoretical limits of the time resolution depending on the RF signal at different bunch charges and on the jitter of the reference laser pulses where analyzed for the new EOM.; (1) M. K.

L. Rubin; J.P. Shanks; K.G. Sonnad; CLASSE; Ithaca; New York; USA; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; The CESR Test Accelerator (CesrTA) program targets the study of beam physics issues relevant to linear collider damping rings and other low emittance storage rings. This endeavor requires new instrumentation to study the beam dynamics along trains of ultra low emittance bunches. A key element of the program has been the design; commissioning and operation of an x-ray beam size monitor capable; on a turn by turn basis; of collecting single pass measurements of each individual bunch in a train over many thousands of turns. This new instrument utilizes custom; high bandwidth amplifiers and digitization hardware and firmware to collect signals from a linear InGaAs diode array. The instrument has been optimized to allow measurements with 3x109 to 1x1011 particles per bunch. This paper reports on the operational capabilities of this instrument; improvements for its performance; and the methods utilized in data analysis.
