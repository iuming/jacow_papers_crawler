The first stage of the the FAIR project, the Modularized Start Version (MSV), was defined based on the available funding by the international partners. Although some of the accelerator systems are not included in the MSV, all major experiment collaborations will be provided with new or improved beam properties compared to the beam conditions presently offered at GSI. Beam cooling will mainly be employed in the preparation of secondary beams of rare isotopes and antiprotons. Besides stochastic cooling of secondary beams in the new Collector Ring (CR), cooling will also be applied in the new High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) and in the former CRYRING, which is presently prepared for installation behind the existing ESR. The HESR, which was originally designed for operation with cooled antiprotons, is presently redesigned to allow experiments with stable ions and rare isotope beams. The project CRYRING@ESR aims at the deceleration of highly charged ions and rare isotopes injected from the ESR at a typical energy of 4 MeV/u. In the first stage it will be used as a test facility for accelerator developments for FAIR.",

Since radial magnetic fields may lead to depolarizing spin resonances a first test with a vertical polarized beam at COSY subject to vertical stochastic cooling has been investigated. The polarization was measured at the beginning and the end of flat top momentum with the result that no polarization loss could be observed within five minutes. The spin motion under the influence of stochastic cooling was also studied with the Thomas-BMT equation including the estimated electromagnetic fields for a quarter wave length kicker structure. It is found that the resonance strength in the cooling bandwidth of 1-2 GHz is much smaller than the typical imperfection or intrinsic resonance strengths. The resonance condition of the spin rotation is not fulfilled as the harmonics of cooling RF kicker fields are not in phase with the spin rotation angle per turn. In conclusion it is expected that stochastic cooling will not lead to depolarization even when stochastic cooling is applied for a longer time as in the present experiment.",

            "two facilities are required for supporting a multi-staged cooling scheme; one is a 2 MeV DC cooler in the ion pre-booster; the other is a high electron energy (up to 55 MeV) ERL-circulator cooler in the collider ring. The simulation studies of beam dynamics in an ERL-circulator cooler are summarized and followed by a report on technology development for this cooler. We also discuss two proposed experiments for demonstrating high energy cooling with a bunched electron beam and the ERL-circulator cooler."

            "leading to significant emittance growth and particle losses at all energies. Particle losses during collisions are dominated by nuclear electromagnetic processes and the debunching effect arising from the influence of IBS",
            "resulting in a non-exponential intensity decay during the fill and short luminosity lifetimes. In the LHC heavy ion runs 3 experiments will be taking data and the average fill duration will be rather short as a consequence of the high burn off rate. The achievements with stochastic cooling at RHIC suggest that such a system at LHC could substantially reduce the emittance growth and the debunching component during injection and collisions. The luminosity lifetime and fill length could be improved to optimize the use of the limited run time of 4 weeks per year. This paper discusses the first results of a feasibility study to use stochastic cooling on the lead ion beams in the LHC. The present and expected future performance without cooling is presented and compared to preliminary simulations estimating the improvements if stochastic cooling is applied."

In this case Robinson damping criterion is not valid as frictional forces take place not only at the moment of their interaction with laser beam but in time delay between the interaction time and the gamma release (deexcitation) for the order of some periods of betatron oscillations*. The optimization of the lattice for this case of cooling is discussed. Fast cooling based on both electronic and nuclear transitions is important for the physics of colliding ion beams and light sources based on relativistic ion beams**.",

A possibility of electron cooling for ion beam with large velocity spread was studied by simulation. The electron beam velocity swept through the ion velocity distribution during cooling procedure. The average friction force will be increased at high electron-ion relative velocity range. The results show a fast beam distribution shrinking could be achieved through the electron energy sweep method. The cooling time dependence on the modulation frequency and amplitude was investigated by simulation. The simulation results also show different ion beam longitudinal velocity distribution can be produced via electron energy modulation.",

The barrier bucket system with stochastic cooling was found with simulation work to have enough capabilities to accumulate the pre-cooled 3 GeV anti-proton beam in the HESR. The Proof Of Principle (POP) experiment was performed at the GSI storage ring ESR with the use of Ar and Xe ion beam employing both stochastic and electron cooling. The experimental results were well in agreement with the prediction of the simulation study. The concept of BB accumulation could be applied to the planned Collider of the NICA project at JINR. In the present paper the concept of BB accumulation and the short bunch formation including the space charge effects are presented as well as the analysis of POP experiment."

At the beginning of 1980s the small ion storage ring TARN was constructed at Tokyo where we performed RF stacking and stochastic cooling of ion beams. In 1986 Dieter invited NT to CERN to join the low energy stochastic cooling work at the LEAR. TK also stayed at CERN as a visiting scientist at LEAR for half year in 1986. Through these collaboration works",

Dieter advised and worked with AN on the Kyoto S-LSR on the laser cooling. From 2004 to 2011",

The first stage of the the FAIR project, the Modularized Start Version (MSV), was defined based on the available funding by the international partners. Although some of the accelerator systems are not included in the MSV, all major experiment collaborations will be provided with new or improved beam properties compared to the beam conditions presently offered at GSI. Beam cooling will mainly be employed in the preparation of secondary beams of rare isotopes and antiprotons. Besides stochastic cooling of secondary beams in the new Collector Ring (CR), cooling will also be applied in the new High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) and in the former CRYRING, which is presently prepared for installation behind the existing ESR. The HESR, which was originally designed for operation with cooled antiprotons, is presently redesigned to allow experiments with stable ions and rare isotope beams. The project CRYRING@ESR aims at the deceleration of highly charged ions and rare isotopes injected from the ESR at a typical energy of 4 MeV/u. In the first stage it will be used as a test facility for accelerator developments for FAIR.",

        "a conceptual design of EIC@JLab has been developed; a comprehensive report summarizing the baseline and accelerator R&D progress has been released recently. The luminosity concept is based essentially on use of an ERL+circulator ring based electron cooling to access low emittance very short ion bunches at a high repetition rate. This report is briefly lighting up the recent progress of the low (LEIC) and medium (MEIC) ion energy staged EIC design studies in the following areas: development of the interaction regions (IR) and detectors design; studies of detector background; optimization of chromatic compensation and dynamic aperture in the collider rings; optimization of the polarization design in the figure-8 booster and collider rings; collider ring and ion large booster optics design optimization; study of dynamics of electron beam in the cooler ring and ERL."

Since radial magnetic fields may lead to depolarizing spin resonances a first test with a vertical polarized beam at COSY subject to vertical stochastic cooling has been investigated. The polarization was measured at the beginning and the end of flat top momentum with the result that no polarization loss could be observed within five minutes. The spin motion under the influence of stochastic cooling was also studied with the Thomas-BMT equation including the estimated electromagnetic fields for a quarter wave length kicker structure. It is found that the resonance strength in the cooling bandwidth of 1-2 GHz is much smaller than the typical imperfection or intrinsic resonance strengths. The resonance condition of the spin rotation is not fulfilled as the harmonics of cooling RF kicker fields are not in phase with the spin rotation angle per turn. In conclusion it is expected that stochastic cooling will not lead to depolarization even when stochastic cooling is applied for a longer time as in the present experiment.",

        "The dynamics of the high intensity lead beams in the LHC are strongly influenced by intra-beam scattering (IBS)",
        "leading to significant emittance growth and particle losses at all energies. Particle losses during collisions are dominated by nuclear electromagnetic processes and the debunching effect arising from the influence of IBS",
        "resulting in a non-exponential intensity decay during the fill and short luminosity lifetimes. In the LHC heavy ion runs 3 experiments will be taking data and the average fill duration will be rather short as a consequence of the high burn off rate. The achievements with stochastic cooling at RHIC suggest that such a system at LHC could substantially reduce the emittance growth and the debunching component during injection and collisions. The luminosity lifetime and fill length could be improved to optimize the use of the limited run time of 4 weeks per year. This paper discusses the first results of a feasibility study to use stochastic cooling on the lead ion beams in the LHC. The present and expected future performance without cooling is presented and compared to preliminary simulations estimating the improvements if stochastic cooling is applied."

The collector for 2 MeV COSY cooler is supplemented with Wien filter which allows increase efficiency of the system by deflection secondary electron flux in crossed transverse electric and magnetic fields.

The average friction force will be increased at high electron-ion relative velocity range. The results show a fast beam distribution shrinking could be achieved through the electron energy sweep method.

        "the RESR was postponed and the new concept of anti-proton accumulation in the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) was strongly demanded. The barrier bucket system with stochastic cooling was found with simulation work to have enough capabilities to accumulate the pre-cooled 3 GeV anti-proton beam in the HESR. The Proof Of Principle (POP) experiment was performed at the GSI storage ring ESR with the use of Ar and Xe ion beam employing both stochastic and electron cooling. The experimental results were well in agreement with the prediction of the simulation study. The concept of BB accumulation could be applied to the planned Collider of the NICA project at JINR. In the present paper the concept of BB accumulation and the short bunch formation including the space charge effects are presented as well as the analysis of POP experiment."

Such techniques are required to improve quality of hadron beams and for increasing the luminosity in hadron and electron-hadron colliders. The focus of the talk will be on the Coherent Electron Cooling technique",

Coherent Electron Cooling shares with the first the need for a broad bandwidth and with the second an electrostatic-form of interaction between the hadrons and the electrons. I will discuss the physics principles of the Coherent Electron Cooling and progress made in its theory in last five years. I will also discuss its advantages and limitations."

Several approaches to the noise suppression at sub-micron wavelengths have been studied in recent years both theoretically and experimentally. In this paper we review the proposed approaches to noise suppression and compare their suppressing capabilities at short wavelengths. We then develop a general approach for study of noise suppressors that use an interaction region in combination with a dispersion section. We apply this method for the case when undulators are used in the interaction region",

        "We have collaborated with Dieter for more than 30 years. First TK and AN met with Dieter at the Heavy Ion Fusion Workshop in 1979 at Berkeley. At the beginning of 1980s the small ion storage ring TARN was constructed at Tokyo where we performed RF stacking and stochastic cooling of ion beams. In 1986 Dieter invited NT to CERN to join the low energy stochastic cooling work at the LEAR. TK also stayed at CERN as a visiting scientist at LEAR for half year in 1986. Through these collaboration works",
        "the communication",
        "officially and personally",
        "with Dieter was strengthened. He stayed at RIKEN as an Eminent Scientist for several months in 2002 when he worked with TK on the crystallized beam and educated young students at the Beam Physics and Engineering Laboratory of RIKEN. Dieter advised and worked with AN on the Kyoto S-LSR on the laser cooling. From 2004 to 2011",
        "TK worked together with Dieter on the GSI/FAIR storage ring projects mainly on the stochastic cooling and stacking of Pbar and Rare Isotope Beam. All memories of Dieter recollect us his warm",
        "human and strict character in his life. Additional but important remark: he was a good teacher of skiing for TK and NT at Zermatt."
