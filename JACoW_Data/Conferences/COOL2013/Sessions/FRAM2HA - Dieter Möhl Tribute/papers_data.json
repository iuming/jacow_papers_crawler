        "advice to the management and human relations including human rights. Regarding the first point it should be recalled that Dieter is one of the founding fathers of LEAR and in parallel worked a lot on ICE",
        "the PS as well as the AAC until it became the AD. The list of other machines (not always built) which have profited from his contributions is very long and include the RCS",
        "SuperLEAR",
        "Tau-charm and neutrino factories and also various rings of FAIR. Dieter was one of leading theorists in accelerator physics making fundamental contributions to stochastic cooling",
        "ordered beam issues",
        "electron cooling",
        "polarized beams and beam stability problems. He was very often called in for advice by the management",
        "not only at CERN but in numerous advisory committees. His excellent human qualities are known worldwide and they are held in the highest esteem in particular in Russian laboratories. At this point his engagement in the Orlov committee must be mentioned again."

        "We have collaborated with Dieter for more than 30 years. First TK and AN met with Dieter at the Heavy Ion Fusion Workshop in 1979 at Berkeley. At the beginning of 1980s the small ion storage ring TARN was constructed at Tokyo where we performed RF stacking and stochastic cooling of ion beams. In 1986 Dieter invited NT to CERN to join the low energy stochastic cooling work at the LEAR. TK also stayed at CERN as a visiting scientist at LEAR for half year in 1986. Through these collaboration works",
        "the communication",
        "officially and personally",
        "with Dieter was strengthened. He stayed at RIKEN as an Eminent Scientist for several months in 2002 when he worked with TK on the crystallized beam and educated young students at the Beam Physics and Engineering Laboratory of RIKEN. Dieter advised and worked with AN on the Kyoto S-LSR on the laser cooling. From 2004 to 2011",
        "TK worked together with Dieter on the GSI/FAIR storage ring projects mainly on the stochastic cooling and stacking of Pbar and Rare Isotope Beam. All memories of Dieter recollect us his warm",
        "human and strict character in his life. Additional but important remark: he was a good teacher of skiing for TK and NT at Zermatt."
