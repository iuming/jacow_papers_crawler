      "abstract": "The development of electron cooling started in 1966 from a proposal by G.I. Budker who used this system for proton-proton colliders. Now the electron cooling used for many ions accelerators for shrinking ion beam emittance and for accumulation rare ions beam at very broad energy range. Many ideas was used for improved the cooling power and many problems was opened. The new ideas for extended the energy of cooled beam will discuss at the report. The energy of cooler up to 8 GeV still required for HESR for suppress the scattering antiproton in inner target. The experience obtain at time of the commissioning 2 MeV cooler for COSY are used. These results are practical test bench for estimation different solutions for the cooling systems.",

The simulation studies of beam dynamics in an ERL-circulator cooler are summarized and followed by a report on technology development for this cooler. We also discuss two proposed experiments for demonstrating high energy cooling with a bunched electron beam and the ERL-circulator cooler."
