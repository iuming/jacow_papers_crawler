        "highly charged ions that come from the ESR down to a few 100 keV/nucleon. It provides a high performance electron cooler in combination with a gas jet target and thus opens up a very attractive physics program as a natural extension of the ESR",
        "which can only operate down to about 4 MeV/nucleon. CRYRING@ESR also provides beams of low charged ions independently on the GSI accelerator. All this makes CRYRING@ESR the perfect machine for FAIR related tests of diagnostics",

        "highly charged ions stored at low energy. Perspectives are also opened up for low-energy nuclear physics investigations. CRYRING@ESR is a first step towards atomic physics with low-energy",
        "highly charged ions at FAIR as planned within the SPARC and APPA collaborations."

The project is now at stage of finishing the technical design. This presentation reviews the major features of ELENA: the ring",

Electron cooling plays a key role in ELENA both for efficient deceleration as well as for preparing the extracted beam with parameters defined by the experiments. The choice of machine optics as a tool for achieving the required parameters and fitting the available space is discussed. The important systems like the magnets",
