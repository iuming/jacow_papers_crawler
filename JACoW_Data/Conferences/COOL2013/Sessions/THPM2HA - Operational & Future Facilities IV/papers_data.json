        "Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is the new accelerator complex being constructed in Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. General goal of the project is to start experimental study of hot and dense strongly interacting QCD matter and search for possible manifestation of signs of the mixed phase and critical endpoint in heavy ion collisions. In this report the present status of the NICA accelerator complex are presented."

        "The High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is being designed and will be constructed by a consortium of several institutes from different countries under the leadership of R. Maier (Forschungszentrum Jülich). It was designed for storage and acceleration of anti-protons in the momentum range between 1.5 and 15 GeV/c for the PANDA experiment. As the modularized start version delayed the low energy storage ring for ion research the SPARC collaboration triggered first ideas to accelerate heavy ions in the HESR. Detailed studies about the storage",
        "acceleration and cooling of heavy ions in the HESR in the magnetic rigidity regime of the HESR (5 to 50 Tm) proved the possibility of high quality experiments with heavy ions in the HESR. Results of the beam dynamic simulations for heavy ions as well as studies of the accumulation process of anti-protons in the HESR will be shown."

The unique feature of TITAN is the combination of three online ion traps that enables mass measurement of short-lived isotopes with very high precision. Presently an EBIT increases the charge state to improve the precision. However",
        "the breeding process causes large energy spread. Accuracy of measured mass is linearly dependent on charge state while the increased emittance of beam has a negative impact on trapping efficiency and hence on precision. To overcome the drawback due to energy spread",
        "a cooler Penning trap being developed. The trap is designed to use charged particles to reduce the beam emittance by sympathetic cooling and currently undergoing off-line tests. Working principles and updates on the status will be presented."
