        "The CERN Antiproton Decelerator (AD) has now completed it’s 12th year of supplying low-energy antiproton beams for the successful physics program. Most of the machine’s key components are in operation since more than 25 years and prompted by the approval of the ELENA project",
        "a substantial consolidation program is now being launched to ensure continued reliable operation. Over the course of the next few years a progressive renovation of the AD-Target area and the AD-ring with all the associated systems will take place. Status and performance of the AD are presented along with an overview of planned and ongoing consolidation activities with emphasis on stochastic and electron beam cooling."

        "the ASACUSA collaboration is capable of providing ~100 keV pulsed antiproton beams. These antiprotons are further cooled in the MUSASHI [1] trap and finally transferred with an energy of a couple eV to the CUSP experiment. Here",
        "Antihydrogen atoms are produced by mixing an antiproton plasma with a positron plasma in a nested trap scheme. Behind this mixing region a so-called CUSP field is located [2]",
        "which focuses low-field anti-hydrogen atoms further downstream to the spinflip cavity followed by a sextupole magnet and antihydrogen detector. A measurement of the antihydrogen signal as a function of the frequency irradiated to the cavity gives direct access to the hyperfine structure (HFS). A detailed comparison with the hydrogen HFS provides a sensitive test of matter/antimatter symmetry. Recently",
        "the production of low energy anti-hydrogen atoms in the CUSP trap was reported [3]. Recent results",
        "development and the current status of the CUSP experiment will be reported with the emphasis on non-neutral plasmas.",
