        "A brief review is made of Coulomb crystallization of a charged particle beam circulating in a storage ring at high speed. An ideal crystalline state is reached when the beam is cooled to near the absolute zero temperature. The corresponding emittance is also nearly zero",
        "which means that the crystalline beam has the highest quality achievable in principle. Through past theoretical studies",
        "it has been revealed that beam crystallization is feasible only in a storage ring that satisfies several physical conditions. This talk summarizes those necessary conditions and illustrates why they are so important in establishing the ultimate state of a beam."

        "We present new results on broadband laser cooling of stored relativistic C3+ ion beams at the ESR in Darmstadt. For the first time we could show laser cooling of bunched relativistic ion beams using a UV-laser which could scan over a very large range and thus cool all the ions in the ‘bucket’. This scheme is much more versatile than a previous scheme",
        "where the bunching frequency was scanned relative to a fixed laser frequency. We have also demonstrated that this cooling scheme works without pre-electron cooling",
        "which is a pre-requisite for its general application to future storage rings and synchrotrons",
