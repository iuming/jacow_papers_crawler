        "An overview of the recent achievements and ongoing developments for the stochastic cooling system of the Collector Ring is given. In focus are the hardware developments as well as the progress in predicting the system performance. The system operates in the frequency band 1-2 GHz",
        "it has to provide fast 3D cooling of antiproton",
        "rare isotope and stable heavy ion beams. The main challenges are (i) the cooling of antiprotons by means of cryogenic movable pick-up electrodes and (ii) the fast two-stage cooling (pre-cooling by the Palmer method",
        "followed by the notch filter method) of the hot rare isotopes. Recently",
        "a novel code for simulating the cooling process in the time domain has been developed at CERN. First results for the momentum cooling for heavy ions in the CR will be shown in comparison with results obtained in the frequency domain with the Fokker-Planck equation."

      "abstract": "Stochastic cooling can increase the spin coherence time in storage ring experiments dedicated to the search of electric dipole moments of protons or deuterons. Since radial magnetic fields may lead to depolarizing spin resonances a first test with a vertical polarized beam at COSY subject to vertical stochastic cooling has been investigated. The polarization was measured at the beginning and the end of flat top momentum with the result that no polarization loss could be observed within five minutes. The spin motion under the influence of stochastic cooling was also studied with the Thomas-BMT equation including the estimated electromagnetic fields for a quarter wave length kicker structure. It is found that the resonance strength in the cooling bandwidth of 1-2 GHz is much smaller than the typical imperfection or intrinsic resonance strengths. The resonance condition of the spin rotation is not fulfilled as the harmonics of cooling RF kicker fields are not in phase with the spin rotation angle per turn. In conclusion it is expected that stochastic cooling will not lead to depolarization even when stochastic cooling is applied for a longer time as in the present experiment.",
