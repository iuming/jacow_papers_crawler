        "the original stainless steel plasma chamber of the Pantechnik PHOENIX ECR source has been exchanged to aluminium with an ultra pure aluminium coating",
        "all electrodes for injection and extraction of the ions have been replaced with aluminium and the iron joke at the extraction side",
        "which is part of the vacuum system in the PHOENIX source has been coated as well. This combined effect has reduced the amount of background ions substantially. Detailed results on the performance of the source after those changes will be presented."

        "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University is currently being designed and will provide intense beams of rare isotopes for research in nuclear physics",
        "nuclear astrophysics and study of fundamental interactions. The FRIB driver linac will accelerate all stable isotopes from Oxygen to Uranium to energies beyond 200 MeV/u at beam powers up to 400 kW. In the case of Uranium about 13.3 pμA of U33+ are required from the ion source to reach the maximum beam power on the target. Such current is at the limit of what an ECR ion source can produce and led us to design the FRIB driver linac to accelerate concurrently two charges. The ECR ion source for FRIB will be based on the VENUS ion source developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Recent beam measurements done with VENUS have demonstrated that the ion source can actually produce close to 13pμA of U33+ and therefore could possibly meet the current required for FRIB in one charge state. This paper reviews the status of the FRIB ECR ion source and the modifications that have been made to the VENUS ion source design. The Low energy beam line transport (LEBT) will also be presented and discussed."

        "we recently focused on the low-mass species sodium and potassium which up to present have been difficult to charge breed efficiently. Charge breeding efficiencies of 10.1% for 23Na7+ and 17.9% for 39K10+ were obtained injecting stable Na+ and K+ beams from a surface ionization source. Details of these studies will be presented as well as simulations detailing the injection of the low charge state beams into the charge breeder."
