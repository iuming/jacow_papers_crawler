        "construction and characterization of the 140 mA continuous deuteron Injector for the IFMIF project. This injector includes the source and the low energy beam line (LEBT) with its own diagnostics. The Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source operates at 2.45 GHz and the 2 m long LEBT is based on 2 solenoids. Krypton gas injection in the beam line is foreseen in order to reach a high level of space charge compensation for the beam matching at the RFQ entrance. During the last months hydrogen beam has been produced in pulsed and continuous mode and the beam diagnostics have been installed and commissioned. Recently a 125 mA-100 keV pulsed deuteron beam has been produced with a 1% duty cycle. In this article",
        "the high intensity proton and deuteron beam characterization will be presented."

      "abstract": "A project using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is underway at the ATLAS facility to measure the atom densities of transmutation products present in samples irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor at INL. These atom densities will be used to infer effective actinide neutron capture cross-sections ranging from Thorium to Califorium isotopes in different neutron spectra relevant to advanced fuel cycles. This project will require the measurement of many samples with high precision and accuracy. The AMS technique at ATLAS is based on production of highly-charged positive ions in an ECRIS followed by injection into a linear accelerator. We use a picosecond laser to ablate the actinide material into the ion source. We expect that the laser ablation technique will have higher efficiency and lower chamber contamination than sputtering or oven evaporation thus reducing 'cross talk' between samples. The results of off-line ablation tests and first results of an accelerate beam generated by the laser coupled to the ECR will be discussed as well as the overall project schedule.",
