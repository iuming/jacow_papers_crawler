        "GANIL (Grand accélérateur National d'Ions Lourds) uses ECRIS for producing stable and radioactive ions since more than 20 years. 2 ECR4 type IS deliver intense multi-charged stable ion beams of gaseous and metallic elements to cyclotrons for post acceleration to energies up to 100 A·MeV. A full permanent magnet ECRIS is also used for producing multi-charged radioactive ion beams in the frame of SPIRAL 1 (Système de Production d'Ions radioactifs Accélérés en Ligne",
        "part 1). For atomic physic experiment",
        "a high performance ECRIS named GTS developed at CENG/ Grenoble (France) is currently used to deliver high intensity",

        "Heavy-ion radiotherapy is successfully carried out at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) since 1994. Now three facilities are in operation and two are under construction in Japan. Over 8000 cancer patients have already been treated. 140-400 MeV/u carbon beams were selected for the first clinical trials at HIMAC because carbon is one of the best candidates which gives good localized biological dose distribution for the typical conditions",
        "a depth of 10 - 25 cm and a thickness of several cm. Based on the clinical results",
        "all the patients have been treated by carbon beams at present. The ion source needs to realize a stable carbon beam with the same conditions for daily operation. Since operators are usually not specialists of the ion source",
        "the source should not require complicated manual tuning. In addition",
        "shorter maintenance time and cycle are better for a hospital. ECR ion sources are utilized for such requirements in each facility. We report the recent status of the ECR ion sources at heavy-ion radiotherapy facilities in Japan."

        "plasma and ion beam instabilities and afterglow processes. The afterglow and instability experiments will be presented elsewhere in these proceedings [1]. In addition",
        "studies involving in the photoelectric induced electron emission and charge exchange reactions will be briefly discussed and the experiments concerning the resonance properties of empty and plasma loaded cavity will be presented. An improvement in ion beam transport of the JYFL K130 cyclotron facility was achieved as a result of the work performed on ion beam formation. This work will be described in more detailed elsewhere in these proceedings [2]. The MIVOC method and sputtering technique were further studied in order to produce intensive titanium ion beams. As a result",
        "an intensive {50}Ti ion beam was successfully produced with the MIVOC method and interesting behavior regarding the sputtering was noticed."
