        "LPSC and LNCMI (Laboratoire National des Champs Magnétiques Intenses) of Grenoble have developed the first and unique magnetic confinement structure in the world that allows a closed 60 GHz ECR zone",
        "using high field magnet technologies. The magnetic structure has been validated for 28 GHz resonance and a closed 1 T iso-B surface was measured. Calculated and measured field maps were carefully compared in order to determine an operation range for 28 GHz plasma tests. A whole test bench",
        "including high pressure water for helix cooling",
        "intense currents (up to 15 kA) for helix powering and a beam line with mass separation is under construction at LNCMI. This contribution presents the status of the experiment",
        "hopefully including the results of the first beam tests scheduled in September. The 350 kW - 60 GHz gyrotron has been built at IAP",
        "the status of its operation will be shown."

        "it is expected to be able to develop new beams while we produce the beam for the experiment of RIBF. Based on the structure of 18 GHz ECR ion source which have been developed in RIKEN",
        "this ion source has additional features as follows: Owing to three solenoid coils",
        "Bext can be adjusted while Bmin is fixed to an optimum value.  We adopt the variable frequency (17.2-18.4 GHz) RF power source. Therefore",
        "further enhancement of the beam intensity is expected because the frequency band suited to a size of plasma chamber is selectable",
        "In order to simplify the maintenance work",
        "we improved a structure of the chamber. In this contribution",
        "we report the design of new ion source in detail."
