        "designed and installed at the injection side of the source. The resulted stronger magnetic trap has shown significant effect on the beam intensity and on the charge states distribution. The new magnetic configuration was re-calculated by the TrapCAD code developed by our group. The spatial movement and energy evolution of a high number of electrons were followed in the calculation. A post-calculation energy filtering carried out for the lost and non-lost electrons reveals numerous interesting and important information in 3D."

An electron temperature of about 1 keV is needed to reproduce the experimentally observed performance of our 14 GHz ECR source. We assume that a pre-sheath is located outside the ECR zone",

The ion production is modeled assuming the ion confinement by a ponderomotive barrier formed at the boundary of the ECR zone. The barrier height is defined by the RF radiation density at the electron resonance layer and is taken as an adjustable parameter; when the plasma becomes overdense",
        "we set the barrier value to zero. With these assumptions",

It was demonstrated that ultra bright proton beam with 4.5 mA current and 0.1 π·mm·mrad normalized emittance (brightness=45 A/(π·mm·mrad)2) can be formed with 1-hole (1 mm in diameter) extraction. For production of high current beams a 13-hole extractor was used. 200 mA and 1.1 π·mm·mrad normalized emittance proton beam was obtained. A possibility of further beam parameters enhancement by developing of extraction system and its power supply is discussed. It was shown that in generated proton beams H2+ component was less than 6%."

        "it is observed that the plasma potential minimises at an optimum value of the gas pressure of the mixing gas and the mean charge state maximises at this value. The energy spread arising from the plasma potential influences the longitudinal optics of the high current injector in terms of increased phase spread which deteriorates the transmission through the RFQ. Details of the measurements carried out as a function of various source parameters and its impact on the longitudinal optics are presented."
