These know how transfer is executed by DESY and INFN/LASA team. The preparation phase based on prototype cavities covered: qualification of potential vendors for material and cavity fabrication; work out recipe and strategy for qualification of the infrastructure for cavity surface treatment at industry; definition of the quality management strategy; documentation and electronically data exchange. Production of 800 series cavities on the principle “build to print” is contracted to companies Research Instruments and Ettore Zanon. High purity niobium and NbTi for resonators provides DESY. The principles of the material and cavities production in conformity with European Pressure Equipment Directive are developed together with the notified body. New or upgraded infrastructure has been established at both companies. The first several tens of series cavities have been produced and treated. Most of the cavities handed over to DESY up to now fulfill immediately the EXFEL specifications. The cavity production for EXFEL will be finished mid of 2015.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/moioa03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/moioa03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/moioa03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-MOIOA03,18

Thanks to the on-going efficient development of the superconducting RF technology; more and more projects based on such machines have emerged during the last 2 decades.

To address these challenges of producing a high peak brightness beam at high repetition rate; at first HZB tested a fully superconducting injector with a lead cathode*; followed now by the design of a SC cavity allowing operation up to 4 mA using CW-modified TTF-III couplers and inserting a normal conducting high quantum efficiency cathode using the HZDR-style insert scheme.

SRF2013,,MOIOB03,SRF Photoemission Electron Guns at BNL: First Commissioning Results,BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; Stony Brook University; Stony Brook; USA; Two SRF photoemission electron guns are under development at BNL. The first gun operates at 704 MHz and is design to deliver high bunch charge and high average current beams for the R&D ERL accelerator. Its cavity is of an elliptical geometry. The gun cryomodule has been commission without a cathode up to the design voltage of 2 MV. The experiments with a copper cathode are underway. The second gun utilizes a quarter wave resonator geometry with coaxial cathode insert and beam tube RF power coupler. It will be used to produce high bunch charges; but low average beam currents for the coherent electron cooling proof-of-principle experiment. This 112 MHz SRF gun was first tested two years ago. Since then it was rebuilt in a new cryomodule and cryogenically re-tested in late 2012/early 2013; reaching the accelerating gap voltage of 0.9 MV.

SRF2013,,MOIOC01,Heat Transfer at the Interface Between Niobium and Liquid Helium for 6 GHz SRF Cavities,INFN/LNL; Legnaro (PD); Italy; Cavity Thermal Boundary Resistance is something extremely complex and not completely understood by the theory. Often identified with the Kapitza resistance or with the Khalatnikov acoustic phonon mismatch at the interface metal-liquid Helium; it depends on so many different and uncontrolled parameters; that its interpretation is not covered by a complete treatise of the phenomenon. Therefore; 99% of the literature on superconducting cavities worries about the cavity interior surface state; while almost nothing is reported on treatments applied to the exterior. In the authors opinion; there is a lack in experimental data analysis due to the fact that the cavity is often considered as a whole adiabatic entity interacting only with RF fields. On the contrary; the cavity is immersed in liquid Helium and the cavity behavior cannot prescind from its thermal properties. Indeed in the normal state He-I has poor thermal conductivity and high specific heat. Moreover the heat exchange at HeII obeys to further mechanisms besides the phonon mismatch. Driven by the hypothesis that thermal losses are dominant for ultraclean cavities; we have collected a plethora of surprising experimental results.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/moioc01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/moioc01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/moioc01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-MOIOC01,57
SRF2013,,MOIOC02,A New First-Principles Calculation of Field-Dependent RF Surface Impedance of BCS Superconductor,B. P. Xiao; C.E. Reece; JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; There is a need to understand the intrinsic limit of RF surface impedance that determines the performance of superconducting RF cavities in particle accelerators. Here we present a field-dependent derivation of Mattis-Bardeen theory of the RF surface impedance of BCS superconductors; based on the shifted density of states resulting from coherently moving Cooper pairs. Our theoretical prediction of the effective BCS RF surface resistance of niobium as a function of peak surface magnetic field amplitude agrees well with recently reported record low loss resonant cavity measurements from JLab and Fermi Lab with carefully prepared niobium material. The surprising reduction in resistance with increasing field is explained to be an intrinsic effect.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/moioc02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/moioc02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/moioc02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-MOIOC02,63
SRF2013,,MOIOC03,Density-Functional Theory Calculations Relevant to Hydride Formation and Prevention,Fermilab; Batavia; USA; Chemical impurities such as hydrogen; oxygen; nitrogen; and carbon atoms can be absorbed into niobium during processing treatments applied to SRF cavities and affect the performance of the cavities. These impurities may reside in niobium lattice interstices and lower the superconducting transition temperature of the niobium or form precipitates with properties that differ from niobium. Of particular concern is the formation of hydride precipitates which may be relevant to Q-disease and Q-slope.

We believe that cooling conditions have an additional impact; as they appear to influence the amount of trapped flux and hence the residual resistance. We constructed a test stand using a niobium rod shorted out by a titanium rod to mimic a cavity in its helium tank to study flux trapping. Here we can precisely control the temperature and measure the dynamics of flux trapping at the superconducting phase transition. We learned that magnetic flux can be generated when a temperature gradient exists along the rod and when the niobium transitions into the superconducting state it subsequently remains trapped. Furthermore; it was shown that the cooling rate during isothermal cooldown through the transition temperature can influence the amount of externally applied flux which remains trapped. The acquired knowledge may be used to modify the cooldown procedure of SRF cavities leading to a reduced level of trapped flux and hence operation closer to the BCS limit.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/tuioa01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/tuioa01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/tuioa01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-TUIOA01,370

Then; new cavity results will be presented where record low values of surface resistances have been achieved. New processing strategies such as annealing and heat treatments in partial pressure of certain gases will be presented; complemented by surface studies.

SRF2013,,TUIOA05,New Insights Into Quench Caused by Surface Pits in SRF Cavities,Y. Xie; M. Liepe; Cornell University (CLASSE); Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; New York; USA; Surface defects such as pits have been identified as some of the main sources of limitations of srf cavity performance. A single cell cavity with 30 artificial pits in the high magnetic field region was made to gain new insight in how pits limit the cavity performance*. The test of the pit cavity showed clear evidence that the edges of two of the largest radius pits transitioned into the normal conducting state at field just below the quench field of the cavity; and that the quench was indeed induced by these two pits. The pit geometrical information measured by laser confocal microscopy combined with a numerical finite element ring-type defect model will be compared with temperature mapping results. Insights about quench and non-linear rf resistances will be presented.; *Y.

Complete understanding and reliable control of the issue are still needed; especially in full-scale multi-cell cavities. Our work aims at developing a generic procedure for finding an active field emitter in a multi-cell cavity and benchmarking the procedure through cavity vertical test. Our ultimate goal is to provide feedback to cavity preparation and cavity string assembly in order to reduce or eliminate filed emission in SRF cavities. Systematic analysis of behaviors of field emitted electrons is obtained by ACE3P developed by SLAC. Experimental benchmark of the procedure was carried out in a 9-cell cavity vertical test at JLab. The energy spectrum of Bremsstrahlung X-rays is measured using a NaI(Tl) detector. The end-point energy in the X-ray energy spectrum is taken as the highest kinetic electron energy to predict longitudinal position of the active field emitter. Angular location of the field emitter is determined by an array of silicon diodes around irises of the cavity. High-resolution optical inspection was conducted at the predicted field emitter location.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/tuioa06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/tuioa06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/tuioa06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-TUIOA06,392

During the CBP process a cylindrically symmetric SRF cavity is filled with relatively cheap and environmentally friendly abrasive and sealed. The cavity is then spun around the cylindrical axis at high speeds uniformly conditioning the inner surface. This uniformity is especially relevant for SRF application because many times a single manufacturing defects limits cavity’s performance well below it’s theoretical limit. In addition CBP has created surfaces with roughness’s on the order of 10’s of nm which create a unique surface for wet chemistry or thin film deposition. CBP is now being utilized at Jefferson Laboratory; Fermi Laboratory and Cornell University in the US; Ko Enerugi Kasokuki Kenkyu Kiku in Japan; Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in Germany; Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro in Italy; and Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology in India.

Reducing the personnel and environmental risks associated with using these chemicals is a priority at Fermilab. Therefore; Fermilab pursued a project to adapt a non-hazardous and relatively benign bipolar electropolishing technique to SRF cavities that Faraday Technology; Inc. developed. Faraday initially developed this electropolishing technique to polish metal alloys used in automotive and semiconductor components as well as medical devices and implants. By modifying the cathodic/anodic interaction via a pulse forward/pulse reverse technique; Fermilab and Faraday Technology demonstrate the capability to polish 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities utilizing an aqueous 10% sulfuric acid electrolyte.

In 2006; INFN-LNL was the first to apply a mixture of Choline Chloride and Urea to Niobium electropolishing.

Subsequently the process was successfully applied to the electropolishing of a 6 GHz monocell cavity with the addition of sulphamic acid. In this work; we will report an intense investigation of the possible variants of the original recipe. We studied the influence on Niobium surface roughness of several parameters such as: other sulphamic; ammonium and carboxylic containing additives different than sulfamic acid; the possible substitution of Urea with ethylene glycol and malic acid; the current regime; the electrolyte temperature and the cathode shape; rotating horizontal electropolishing versus vertical electropolishing.

The increase in quality factors is the result of the reduction of the surface resistance of the materials. A recent test [*] on a 1.5 GHz single cell cavity made from ingot niobium of medium purity and heat treated at 1400 C in a ultra-high vacuum induction furnace resulted in a residual resistance of ~ 1nanoohm and a quality factor increasing with field up to ~ 5×1010 at a peak magnetic field of 90 mT. In this contribution; we present some results on the investigation of the origin of the extended Q0-increase; obtained by multiple HF rinses; oxypolishing and heat treatment of “all Nb” cavities.; [*] P.

The main advantages of 6 GHz bulk-Nb cavities are saving cost; materials and time to collect statistics of surface treatments and RF test. Cavities are RF tested before and after high temperature treatment under UHV conditions. Induction heating method is used to anneal the cavity at temperatures higher than 2000°C and close to the melting point of Nb for less than a minute while few seconds at maximum temperature. Before RF test and UHV annealing; the surface treatment processes like tumbling; chemical; electro-chemical (such as BCP and EP); ultrasonic cleaning and high pressure rinsing (HPR) have been employed. This kind of Nb 6 GHz cavity purification allow to reduce hydrogen; oxygen and other elemental impurities content; which effects on cavity Q-factor degradation; by a rapid annealing over 2000°C and a subsequent rapid reduction at room temperature.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/tuioc05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/tuioc05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/tuioc05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-TUIOC05,419

SRF2013,,WEIOA02,Energetic Condensation Growth of Niobium Films,M. Krishnan; I. Irfan; AASC; San Leandro; California; USA; Energetic Condensation refers to thinfilm growth on a surface using ~100eV ions; versus lower energy deposition using sputtering (~1-10eV with no substrate bias) or still lower energy thermal evaporation. The relatively high incident energy of energetic condensation creates defects and vacancies within the first few atomic layers and enables diffusion to lower free-energy sites in the lattice. Shallow defects migrate to the heated surface and are annihilated; leading to low-defect crystal growth. It has been shown [1] that the purer the film; the closer are its superconducting parameters to those of the bulk metal. Use of cathodic arc plasmas was proposed in 2000 by Langner [TESLA Rep. 2000-15; Ed. D. Proch; DESY 2000]; followed by detailed development of the process [2]. AASC picked up from the European Community-Research Infrastructure Activity and has demonstrated very high RRR=541 in Nb films grown on crystal substrates [3]. Ongoing work to coat 1.3GHz copper cavities using cathodic arc plasmas; as well as growth of higher temperature films such as NbTiN; Nb3Sn and MgB2 are described.

Additionally; theoretical predictions suggest that the maximum operating field of Nb3Sn cavities could be twice that of niobium cavities. Early work on a small number of Nb3Sn coated cavities indeed showed 2K to 4.2K quality factors well above what is achievable with niobium; though at accelerating fields below ~10 MV/m only. After many years of worldwide inactivity; Cornell has taken the lead and initiated a new R&D program on Nb3Sn to explore its full potential for SRF applications. New facilities for coating cavities with Nb3Sn have been set up at Cornell; and 1.3 GHz single cell cavities have been coated and tested.

The challenge has been to understand the dependence of the SRF properties on the detailed characteristics of real surfaces and then to employ appropriate techniques to tailor these surface properties for greatest benefit. Our aim is to achieve gradients >100 MV/m and no simple material is known to be capable of sustaining this performance. A theoretical framework has been proposed which could yield such behavior [1] and it requires creation of thin film layered structures. I will present our systematic studies on such proof-of-principle samples. Our overarching goal has been to build a basic understanding of key nano-scale film growth parameters for materials that show promise for SRF cavity multilayer coatings and to demonstrate the ability to elevate the barrier for vortex entry in such layered structures above the bulk value of Hc1 for type-II superconductors and thus to sustain higher accelerating fields.; [1].

The trapped flux adds to the residual rf surface resistance. For this reason magnetic shielding is added to the cryomodules to shield the cavities from the environmental magnetic field. The low beta portion of many superconducting hadron linear accelerators; either in operation or in production; includes cryomodules containing one or more high field superconducting solenoids. The operation of a high field solenoid in close proximity to a cavity adds a level of complexity to the cryomodule design considerations.

Permeability measurements were made in order to understand the characteristics of such materials at both room and cryogenic temperatures; and the results will be used as a database for designing magnetic shields.

The goal of the 12 GeV Upgrade is a doubling of the available beam energy of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) from 6 GeV to 12 GeV. The increase in beam energy will largely be due to the addition of ten C100 cryomodules and the associated RF in the CEBAF linacs. These cryomodules are designed to deliver 100 MeV per cryomodule. Each C100 cryomodule contains a string of eight seven-cell; electro-polished; superconducting RF cavities. While an average performance of 100 MV is needed to achieve the overall 12 GeV beam energy goal; the actual performance goal for the cryomodules is an average energy gain of 108 MV to provide operational headroom. All ten of the C100 cryomodules are installed in the linac tunnels and are on schedule to be commissioned by September 2013. Commissioned performance has ranged from 104 MV to 118 MV. In May; 2012; a test of an early C100 achieved 108 MV with full beam loading. This paper will discuss the performance of the C100 cryomodules along with operational challenges and lessons learned for future designs.; The U.S. Govt. retains a non-exclusive; paid-up; irrevocable; world-wide license to publish or reproduce this manuscript.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/thiob01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/thiob01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/thiob01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-THIOB01,836

The aim is to provide at least 17.5 MV accelerating potential with large acceptance and minimal beam losses for high intensity ion beams. The cavity electromagnetic design uses optimizations not used before with QWR including a large taper on both the inner and outer conductors in order to reduce surface fields and make efficient use of space along the beam line. Electropolishing (EP) on the finished cavities with integral helium jacket and no demountable RF joints has been performed; and is the first for any low beta SC cavity. This type of EP; adapted from Argonne systems for the linear collider effort; appears to have a large benefit in terms of the average quench field which range between 103-165 mT for five QWR tested to date. Cavity residual resistances at the proposed operating point of ~70 mT are low; clustering close to a value of ~2nOhm.

We propose to present a review of the RF and mechanical design studies of the Spoke cavity. We will conclude with the integration of the Spoke cavity with its ancillaries inside the cryomodule.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/frioc01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/frioc01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/frioc01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-FRIOC01,

Its superconducting section is composed of 3 cavity families: double spoke resonators; medium beta and high beta elliptical multicell cavities. This paper presents the electromagnetic and mechanical design of the 704.42 MHz elliptical cavities. Both elliptical famillies are housed in 4-cavity cryomodules which share a common design and set of components which will be described here.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/frioc02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/frioc02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/frioc02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-FRIOC02,

SRF2013,,FRIOD02,"Quantum Measurement with ""Trapped"" Microwave Photons in a SRF Cavity",LKB; Paris; France; We present experiments where photons are trapped in a nearly ideal “photon box” as introduced by Einstein and Bohr in one of the gedanken experiments they introduced for discussing the unbelievable strangeness of quantum theory. Our photon box consists in a high Q cavity trapping microwave photons between superconducting mirrors. In the experiments; we probe and manipulate the trapped microwave field with single Rydberg atoms; which act as extremely sensitive and even non-destructive probes of the cavity field. We will show how this system is used for exploring the most fundamental aspects of quantum theory of measurement such as state collapse or the occurrence of quantum jumps in a quantum dynamic. The problem of the transition between the quantumess of small isolated quantum systems as opposed to the classical behavior of the measurement apparatus will also be addressed by preparing a “Schrödinger kitten” state of the field an by observing its decoherence.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/talks/friod02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/papers/friod02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/SRF2013/posters/friod02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2013-FRIOD02,
