        "Centrifugal Barrel polishing (CBP) is becoming a common R&D tool for SRF cavity preparation around the word. During the CBP process a cylindrically symmetric SRF cavity is filled with relatively cheap and environmentally friendly abrasive and sealed. The cavity is then spun around the cylindrical axis at high speeds uniformly conditioning the inner surface. This uniformity is especially relevant for SRF application because many times a single manufacturing defects limits cavity’s performance well below it’s theoretical limit. In addition CBP has created surfaces with roughness’s on the order of 10’s of nm which create a unique surface for wet chemistry or thin film deposition. CBP is now being utilized at Jefferson Laboratory",
