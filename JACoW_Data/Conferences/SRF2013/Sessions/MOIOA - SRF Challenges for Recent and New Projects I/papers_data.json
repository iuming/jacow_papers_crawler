These know how transfer is executed by DESY and INFN/LASA team. The preparation phase based on prototype cavities covered: qualification of potential vendors for material and cavity fabrication; work out recipe and strategy for qualification of the infrastructure for cavity surface treatment at industry; definition of the quality management strategy",
        "documentation and electronically data exchange. Production of 800 series cavities on the principle “build to print” is contracted to companies Research Instruments and Ettore Zanon. High purity niobium and NbTi for resonators provides DESY. The principles of the material and cavities production in conformity with European Pressure Equipment Directive are developed together with the notified body. New or upgraded infrastructure has been established at both companies. The first several tens of series cavities have been produced and treated. Most of the cavities handed over to DESY up to now fulfill immediately the EXFEL specifications. The cavity production for EXFEL will be finished mid of 2015."
