        "Two SRF photoemission electron guns are under development at BNL. The first gun operates at 704 MHz and is design to deliver high bunch charge and high average current beams for the R&D ERL accelerator. Its cavity is of an elliptical geometry. The gun cryomodule has been commission without a cathode up to the design voltage of 2 MV. The experiments with a copper cathode are underway. The second gun utilizes a quarter wave resonator geometry with coaxial cathode insert and beam tube RF power coupler. It will be used to produce high bunch charges",
        "but low average beam currents for the coherent electron cooling proof-of-principle experiment. This 112 MHz SRF gun was first tested two years ago. Since then it was rebuilt in a new cryomodule and cryogenically re-tested in late 2012/early 2013",
        "reaching the accelerating gap voltage of 0.9 MV. This paper describes main design features of two SRF guns",
        "presents test results and discusses future plans."
