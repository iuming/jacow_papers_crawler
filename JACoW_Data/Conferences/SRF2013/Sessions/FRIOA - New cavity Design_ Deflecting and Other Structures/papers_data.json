        "Three novel superconducting RF crab cavity designs proposed for the LHC luminosity upgrade have rapidly progressed. First Niobium prototypes are reaching close to the design performance and beyond. The highlights of the RF test results from the prototypes along with design modifications for initial beam tests in the SPS are presented. The status of the cryomodule development",
        "integration into the SPS and the beam tests in view of validating the crab cavity system for LHC upgrade are addressed."

        "application of QWRs is carrying over into hadron colliders aiming at various goals. A 56 MHz superconducting QWR is under testing at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). It will be installed in the Relativistic Hadron Ion Collider (RHIC) as a storage cavity",
        "which would be the first QWR operating in a high energy storage ring. A Compact crab cavity using QWR concept is another active SRF project at BNL. This crab cavity is a candidate for the Large Hadron Collider HiLumi upgrade",

        "2.815 GHz crab cavities for Argonne’s Short-Pulse X-ray project. These cavities are unique in that the cavity and waveguides were milled from bulk large grain niobium ingot material directly from 3D CAD files. No forming of sub components was used with the exception of the beam-pipes. The cavity and helium vessel design along with the RF performance requirements makes this project extremely challenging for fabrication. Production challenges and fabrication techniques as well as testing results will be discussed in this paper."

The superconducting rf-dipole cavity is one of the first compact designs with attractive properties such as higher gradients",

        "fabricated and tested as proof-of-principle designs of compact deflecting and crabbing cavities for the LHC high luminosity upgrade and Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade. The first rf tests have been performed on the rf-dipole geometries at 4.2 K and 2.0 K in a vertical test assembly with excellent results. The cavities have achieved high gradients with high intrinsic quality factors",
        "and multipacting levels were easily processed."
