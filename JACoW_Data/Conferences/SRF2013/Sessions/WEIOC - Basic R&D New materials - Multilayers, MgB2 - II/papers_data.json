        "The attempt to reach quality factors beyond 1011 and pushing the accelerating gradients of SRF cavities to the theoretical limit",
        "the treatment depending loss mechanisms in niobium need better understanding. CERNs Quadrupole Resonator enables sub-nΩ-resolution measurements of the surface resistance. The available parameters cover resonant modes at 400",
        "800 and 1200 MHz",
        "any temperature up to 15 K and rf fields up to 60 mT. Recently the setup has been extended with a coil creating a dc magnetic field for trapped flux studies. Overall",
        "much more information about the rf performance is accessible compared to regular cavity measurements. Since the samples are flat disks of 75 mm diameter geometric fabrication issues are simplified which makes the Quadrupole Resonator also the perfect tool to study alternative materials or new coating techniques. In this contribution in depth studies of a heat treated bulk niobium sample exploiting the complete parameter range of the setup are presented."
