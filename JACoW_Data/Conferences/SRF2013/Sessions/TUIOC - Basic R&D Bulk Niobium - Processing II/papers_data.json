A recent test [*] on a 1.5 GHz single cell cavity made from ingot niobium of medium purity and heat treated at 1400 C in a ultra-high vacuum induction furnace resulted in a residual resistance of ~ 1nanoohm and a quality factor increasing with field up to ~ 5×1010 at a peak magnetic field of 90 mT.
