Checking the beam dynamic of the particle is one of the most important and necessary steps after magnet simulation. The phenomenon which confirms simulated magnet validity is obtaining reasonable particle trajectory. This paper focused on the optimization process in magnet design and simulation of the beam dynamic. Some results which ensure a particle can be accelerated up to 18 MeV energy",
        "are presented. All magnetic field calculation in whole magnet was calculated by OPERA-3D(TOSCA) code. Also beam dynamic analysis by applying magnetic field data from the magnet simulation was done in CYCLONE code."

The scattering parameters obtained for main resonators of the cyclotron and Dee parts as a diaphragm for each of cavity sections and also for the whole structure. All the characteristics modeled and calculated by the electromagnetic rules and theory of resonators from circuit model. Then it analysed with numerical methods for bench-marking. Finally",
