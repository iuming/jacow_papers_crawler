sap2017,,MOAH2,Generation of Strong Terahertz Radiation in Intense Laser-plasma Interactions,Institute of Physics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing; People's Republic of China; Recently Terahertz radiation from laser-produced plasmas has attracted much interest since plasmas can work at arbitrarily high laser intensity. However; only few experiments with relativistic laser pulses are reported. We have studied strong THz radiation from solid targets driven by relativistic laser pulses. THz radiation with pulse energy of hundreds mJ/sr has been observed. In this talk; we will concentrate on the THz generation due to coherent transition radiation of relativistic laser-driven electron beams when they pass the solid-vacuum boundary. Targets including mass-limited foils and layered metal-plastic targets are used to verify the radiation mechanism and characterize the radiation properties. Observations of THz emissions as a function of target parameters agree well with the formation-zone and diffraction model of transition radiation. Particle-in-cell simulations also well reproduce the observed characteristics of THz emissions. The present THz transition radiation enables not only a potential tabletop brilliant THz source; but also a novel noninvasive diagnostic for fast electron generation and transport in laser-plasma interactions.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/moah2_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/moah2.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/moah2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-MOAH2,
sap2017,,MOAH3,Recent Progress on Laser Plasma Physics and Advanced Accelerator Research at Tsinghua University,TUB; Beijing; People's Republic of China; The main research theme of L2PA at Tsinghua University; focuses on compact high-quality plasma accelerator and its derivative light sources. A 10-40MeV high-quality electron beam had been obtained by running the laser at 5TW peak power. Under certain conditions very low relative energy spread of <1% and extremely low absolute energy spread of 0.18MeV can be achieved. An ultrafast electron beam has been proposed and successfully used to take a snapshot of wakefield; and the dedicated beam diagnostics for high brightness electron beams has been developed in plasma-based accelerators. The experiments for a plasma dechirper and external injection acceleration have also been demonstrated in a laser-plasma accelerator using a RF photocathode gun-based linac. On theory and simulation part; several ideas on how to obtain high quality electron beams with extremely high brightness through wakefield acceleration will be discussed. A theoretical model on the phase space dynamics of ionization injection scheme has been derived; and phase space matching for staging accelerator components using longitudinally tailored plasma profiles is proposed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/moah3_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/moah3.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/moah3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-MOAH3,

In order to get higher beam power with lower beam extraction voltage; the beam optics of accelerator was analyzed based on the structure of EAST-NBI tetrode accelerator. The beam optics of a tetrode accelerator and a new designed three-electrode accelerator was analyzed with beam energy of 50 keV. The results shown that; the two types of accelerator can get high beam perveance (4.6μp) with lower beam divergence angle compare to the EAST-NBI accelerator (2.8μp ). And the tetrode accelerator can gets lower beam divergence angle compare to the three-electrode accelerator; but the electric field between two electrode is much higher than three-electrode accelerator.

Introducing superconducting technologies; China Institute of Atomic Energy has designed a cyclotron to extract 230 MeV proton for cancer therapy. Extracted beam loss is one of the very crucial parameter in this machine. A low beam loss has benefit in reducing the dose level inside the cyclotron and preventing device damage; and consequently keeps the machine operate stable in long time. Two electrostatic deflectors are installed in the adjacent magnet hills to deflect the beam for extraction. The Vr=1 resonance and precession motion are introduced in extraction region to enlarge the turn separation. After the deflectors; passive magnetic channels provide radial focusing force to restrain the beam dispersion in the edge field.

For RCS; because of the magnetic saturation and the eddy current effects; there may be magnetic field tracking errors between different magnets. A new method of harmonic compensation for magnets of RCS was investigated to reduce the magnetic field tracking errors at CSNS/RCS. For CSNS/RCS; 24 dipoles are powered by the same power supply; and 48 quadrupoles are powered by five power supplies. The field divergences between the magnets powered by the same power supply can induce beam closed orbit distortion (COD) and beta-beating. The sorting of magnets is performed at CSNS/RCS to reduce the COD and beta-beating induced by the field divergences.

This paper proposed a novel electron beam focusing scheme for distributed x-ray sources. The sources used dispenser cathode as electron emitter; mesh grid to control emission current; and two electrostatic lenses for beam shaping; focusing and deflecting or not. Because the mesh is a non-linear optical system; after beam passes the mesh; the beam emittance grows. In order to minimize this emittance growth; the first lens was placed behind the mesh. The second lens; called focusing lens; with two semi-ellipses opening make the beam shaping; deflecting or not. If the voltages of two semi-elliptical electrodes are different; the beam will deflect after passing through the focusing lens. The voltage difference between the two semi-elliptical focusing lens is set to +V; 0; -V. Then three focal spots will be obtained on the anode target.

In this new MBA concept; two pairs of dispersion bumps are created in each cell; which accommodate sextupoles to correct chromaticities. For each pair of dispersion bumps; from the point of view of two different representations of a cell; many nonlinear effects caused by itself are cancelled out within one cell. For the two pairs of dispersion bumps; from the nonlinear cancellation point of view; they are interleaved. Compared to the hybrid MBA where only one pair of dispersion bumps is created in each cell; this new MBA can provide more knobs so as to better control tune shift terms; which is especially beneficial for enlarging dynamic momentum aperture.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/moph13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/moph13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/moph13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-MOPH13,52

We show the relations of the time correction to the corresponding transverse focusing and that the main correction for large emittance corresponds directly to the chromaticity correction for transverse focusing of the beam.

So far; it has collisions of Au+Au; Cu+Cu; U+U; d+Au; Cu+Au; p+Au and polarized protons at various energies. The polarized proton collisions are unique in the world. The luminosity has been increased by steady intensity improvements from injectors; special beam pipe coating; stochastic cooling and electron lens as well as smaller beta functions.

In this report; a novel all-optical scheme for overdense electron-positron pair production by two counter-propagating lasers irradiating the double-cone target with near-critical density plasmas at only 1022W/cm2 is proposed. In this scheme; bright gama-rays are generated by radiation-trapped electrons oscillating in the laser fields. The dense gama-photons then collide with the focused counter-propagating lasers to initiate the multi-photon Breit-Wheeler process. It is indicated by PIC-QED simulations that a high-yield (1011) overdense (1022/cm-3) GeV positron beam may be obtained by using 10 PW scale lasers. Such a bright pair source has many practical applications and could be basis for future compact high-luminosity electron positron colliders.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/tuah2_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/tuah2.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/tuah2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-TUAH2,

The simulations of laser cooling of the 12C3+ ion beams by scanning the frequency of RF-buncher or laser wavelength were performed.

The optimized parameters for scanning the RF-buncher frequency or laser frequency were obtained. Moreover; the Schottky noise spectra of longitudinally modulated and laser-cooled ion beams was simulated to fully explain and anticipate the experimental results.

The concept of laser plasma based accelerator has turn to realization in recent years. The laser intensity can be retained with a long distance in plasma through technical control of Rayleigh length; self-focusing; and laser guiding. Electrons can be accelerated upto GeV energy in centimeter scale; as there is no voltage breakdown in plasma; which results in a 100GV/m acceleration field as well. There are two main mechanisms of electron acceleration in laser-plasma acceleration; Direct laser acceleration (DLA) and Laser wakefiled acceleration (LWFA); which prevail in different plasma density regime. A 200-TW laser facility was recently built in Peking University; specified for laser plasma acceleration research. Different laser conditions were investigated to generate electrons which allow us to achieve electrons with energy up to 290 MeV with relatively small divergence angle of 4 mrad; and also can achieve lower energy electrons with several pC charge for direct imaging or generating X-ray for imaging as well.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/tuch2_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/tuch2.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/tuch2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-TUCH2,

It may cause a big enough tune shift in a circular accelerator moving the beam onto a resonance. In this paper; the transverse tune shift in High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) storage ring and booster ring caused by space-charge effects is firstly estimated based on the existing theory. Since the tune shift is at the level of 0.2; it may move the beam onto a resonance in the operation mode with high bunch charges. Then some simulations are made by tracking particles with elegant in the HEPS storage ring and booster including the space-charge effects. During the tracking; some particles are lost in HEPS booster ring with bunch charge of 14.4nC for the so called 'swap-out' mode. Further simulation shows that no particles would be lost if the charge of single bunch was less than 8.6nC in HEPS booster.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/tuch3_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/tuch3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/tuch3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-TUCH3,131

The duration of the electron bunch is usually investigated based on coherent transition radiation in a laser wakefield accelerator. In order to diagnostic the longitudinal profile; however; the reconstruction from the spectrum measured from the mid-infrared spectrometer is required for random temporal distribution of ultrashort electron bunch. We discuss the ambiguities in phase retrieval problems and introduce the concept of compressed sensing and a sparsity based weighted greedy sparse retrieval(GESPAR) algorithm for bunch profile reconstruction. The GESPAR algorithm is demonstrated to have the better performance than the traditional phase retrieval algorithms such as Kramer Kronig reconstruction and Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm with truncated noisy spectrum.

C. Du; J.F. Hua; W. Lu; C.H. Pai; J. Zhang; S.Y. Zhou; Z. Zhou; TUB; Beijing; People's Republic of China; The first experimental study is presented using a low density plasma dechirper to reduce a correlated energy chirp from the 41.5-MeV; 300-fs (RMS) beam at the linac in Tsinghua University. The plasma dechirper operates through the interaction of the electron bunch with its near linear self-wake to dechirp itself; leading to a reduction in energy spread. The experimental results demonstrate that the projected FWHM energy spread of the beam can be reduced from 1.2% to 0.9% with a 12 mm long plasma dechirper; which are in good agreement with full three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Theoretical analyses and simulations indicate that by optimizing the plasma density and length; the plasma dechirper can also be used to completely remove the characteristic energy chirp of the ultra-short high-current bunch generated from plasma based accelerator; such that its energy spread can be reduced from one percent level to 0.1 percent level [1].

However; present analytical model is only suitable when beam size and hosing amplitude is much less than plasma blow-out radius. By developing a physically simple model which incorporates the single particle betatron motion and particle loss due to large betatron amplitude; this work demonstrates that the asymmetric particle loss due to the phase mismatch between beam hose and plasma respondency can damp hosing amplitude in magnitudes with negligible beam loss. We find excellent agreement between our model and 3D particle-in-cell simulations. Besides; for wide driver; we achieve stable propagation when transformer ration is about 5; which is almost impossible based on the previous understanding.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/tuph07_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/tuph07.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/tuph07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-TUPH07,

In many applications; higher spatial resolution is needed to discover smaller defects. Rhodotron have been used to produce high power CW electron beam in hundreds of kilowatts level. In this paper; we propose to use an improved Rhodotron to generate high brightness electron beam with high average power. Beam dynamics study shows that when producing tens of kilowatts electron beam; the normalized RMS emittance can be lower than 10 μm; and the relative RMS energy spread can be lower than 0.2%. The beam can be focused to a spot size of about 100μm; and converted to X-Ray by using a rotating target within several kilowatts beam power.

The dose distribution of the accelerator is obtained through the Monte Carlo simulation; according to this; a labyrinth wall is designed to meet dose-limiting conditions.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/tuph28_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/tuph28.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/tuph28_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-TUPH28,

Stable proton beams have been generated in the experiments of high intensity (8.3*1019 W/cm2) laser pulses irradiating on home-made sub-micrometer thick plastic targets. The temporal contrast of the laser pulse was 1010 at 100 ps before the main pulse with a cross-polarized wave (XPW) system; and no plasma mirror was used in CLAPA system. The maximum proton energy exceeded 15 MeV when using 1.2 um plastic targets. Proton beams with energy higher than 8.5 MeV were also detected with 20 nm thick plastic targets. A beam line that consists of common magnetic devices is also designed and built; aiming to deliver proton beams with energy of 1~44 MeV; energy spread of ±5% and 108 protons per pulse to the irradiation target platform. The parameters of the beamline system are carefully designed and optimised to obtain a radially symmetric proton distribution at the irradiation platform. In the preliminary CLAPA accelerator and beam line joint experiments; the effective transporting and focusing of accelerated protons with selected energy has been observed.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,"Funding: Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 11575011, and National Grand Instrument Project under Grant No 2012YQ030142.",reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/weah3_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/weah3.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/weah3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-WEAH3,

So far; the whole system has been installed and the preliminary high voltage conditioning has been carried out. Since the photocathode response time influence the beam quality; the bunch length measurement system is required; which consist of a solenoid; a 1.3 GHz standing wave deflecting cavity; a slit and a YAG screen. In this paper; the design of a deflecting cavity with TM210 mode is presented. In addition; the beam dynamics study of the bunch measurement system is performed using ASTRA and the layout of the bunch measurement system is determined. The bunch length in simulation is in good agreement with theoretical calculation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/weah4_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/weah4.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/weah4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-WEAH4,172
sap2017,,WEBH3,Experimental Polarization Control of Thomson Scattering X-ray Source,Tsinghua University; Beijing; People's Republic of China; Thomson scattering of intense laser pulses from relativistic electrons allows us to generate high-brightness and tunable-polarization X/gama-ray pulses. In this paper we demonstrate the polarization control of the Thomson scattering source experimentally. We control the incident laser polarization by rotating a quarter-wave plate; thus controlling X/gama-ray polarization. In order to measure the polarization; we use Compton scattering method. Meanwhile; stokes parameters of X/gama-ray whose energy varies between tens of keV and MeV are simulated. The simulation results show that with the increasing of X-ray Energy; X-ray polarization is a constant value in a small cone of motivation. According to modulation curves analyzed from experiment results; we can get the conclusion that the polarization of Thomson scattering source is tunable and controllable.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/talks/webh3_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/papers/webh3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/sap2017/posters/webh3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SAP2017-WEBH3,176

Dozens of the DC-SRF-injector parameters have been considered in the optimization. Some measurements of the electron beam are also introduced; including emittance measurement with the three-profile method; energy spread measurement with analyzing magnet and beam length diagnostics with zero-phasing method.
