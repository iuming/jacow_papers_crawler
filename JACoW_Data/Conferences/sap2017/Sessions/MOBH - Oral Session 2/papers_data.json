        "Experimental study on superconducting electron linac has been developed at Peking University. Stable operation of a DC-SRF photoinjector and a 2*9-cell SRF linac has been realized with an average beam current of mA scale in macro pulses of several ms with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. A compact high repetition rate THz radiation source has been developed based on DC-SRF photo-injector through velocity bunching. Superradiant THz radiation with a repetition rate of 16.25 MHz and a frequency that can be tuned from 0.24 to 0.42 THz was generated by varying the electron beam energy from 2.4 to 3.1 MeV. MeV UED at MHz repetition rate has been demonstrated experimentally using electron pulses from the DC-SRF photoinjector. THz undulator radiation of ~1THz central frequency with an average power of 1W has been achieved with 13MeV electron beam from SRF linac and applications are underway."
