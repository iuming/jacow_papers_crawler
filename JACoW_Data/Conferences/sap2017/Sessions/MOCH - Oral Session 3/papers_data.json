        "A 2×4-cell superconducting linac module for the THz-FEL facility has been developed at the China Academy of Engineering Physics",
        "which is expected to provide 6~8 MeV quasi-CW electron beams with an average current of 1~5 mA. The module consists of two 4-cell cavities",
        "two power couplers",
        "two tuners and the cyromodule. The main components are tested before the module assembly. The cavity test includes microwave measurement at room temperature and vertical test at 2 K. The conditioning and test of the couplers are also finished. The performances of the main components and the whole module are present-ed in this paper. The horizontal test indicated that the effective field gradients of both cavities have reached 10 MV/m",
        "which have satisfied our designed goal."
