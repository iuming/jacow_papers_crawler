        "Thomson scattering of intense laser pulses from relativistic electrons allows us to generate high-brightness and tunable-polarization X/gama-ray pulses. In this paper we demonstrate the polarization control of the Thomson scattering source experimentally. We control the incident laser polarization by rotating a quarter-wave plate",
        "thus controlling X/gama-ray polarization. In order to measure the polarization",
        "we use Compton scattering method. Meanwhile",
        "stokes parameters of X/gama-ray whose energy varies between tens of keV and MeV are simulated. The simulation results show that with the increasing of X-ray Energy",
        "X-ray polarization is a constant value in a small cone of motivation. According to modulation curves analyzed from experiment results",
        "we can get the conclusion that the polarization of Thomson scattering source is tunable and controllable."

        "some studies of beam optimization based on differential evolution (DE) algorithm and Astra code are shown. Dozens of the DC-SRF-injector parameters have been considered in the optimization. Some measurements of the electron beam are also introduced",
        "including emittance measurement with the three-profile method",
        "energy spread measurement with analyzing magnet and beam length diagnostics with zero-phasing method. These studies indicate that the injector beam quality satisfies the requirement of the FEL-THz facility."
