        "A proton-type of compact laser plasma accelerator (CLAPA) has been built at Peking University. Stable proton beams have been generated in the experiments of high intensity (8.3*1019 W/cm2) laser pulses irradiating on home-made sub-micrometer thick plastic targets. The temporal contrast of the laser pulse was 1010 at 100 ps before the main pulse with a cross-polarized wave (XPW) system",
        "and no plasma mirror was used in CLAPA system. The maximum proton energy exceeded 15 MeV when using 1.2 um plastic targets. Proton beams with energy higher than 8.5 MeV were also detected with 20 nm thick plastic targets. A beam line that consists of common magnetic devices is also designed and built",
        "aiming to deliver proton beams with energy of 1~44 MeV",
        "energy spread of ±5% and 108 protons per pulse to the irradiation target platform. The parameters of the beamline system are carefully designed and optimised to obtain a radially symmetric proton distribution at the irradiation platform. In the preliminary CLAPA accelerator and beam line joint experiments",
        "the effective transporting and focusing of accelerated protons with selected energy has been observed.",
