        "bright gama-rays are generated by radiation-trapped electrons oscillating in the laser fields. The dense gama-photons then collide with the focused counter-propagating lasers to initiate the multi-photon Breit-Wheeler process. It is indicated by PIC-QED simulations that a high-yield (1011) overdense (1022/cm-3) GeV positron beam may be obtained by using 10 PW scale lasers. Such a bright pair source has many practical applications and could be basis for future compact high-luminosity electron positron colliders.",
