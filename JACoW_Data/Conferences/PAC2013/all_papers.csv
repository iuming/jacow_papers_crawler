PAC2013,,MOYAA1,LHC Operation at Higher Energy and Luminosity,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Geneva) was commissioned and operated in the years 2009-2013 up to a beam energy of 4 TeV. A peak luminosity of 0.77 1034 cm-2s−1 was reached and an integrated luminosity of around 29 fb-1 was delivered to both ATLAS and CMS. This performance allowed the discovery of a scalar boson. The LHC is presently in a shutdown phase dedicated to consolidation and maintenance that will allow the restart of beam operation in early 2015 at an increased beam energy of 6.5 to 7 TeV. Maximum acceptable pile-up; effectiveness of electron-cloud scrubbing; and fast loss events are some of the issues that will shape the choice of operational parameters; cycle setup; and the commissioning strategy. The baseline choices and options for the restart after the shutdown are presented. In addition the roadmap for future performance upgrades is sketched.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/moyaa1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/moyaa1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/moyaa1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOYAA1,1

PAC2013,,MOOAA1,"Colliders - ""Quo Vadis?"": Past 20 Years, Next 20 Years, and Beyond",Fermilab; Batavia; USA; Particle colliders for high-energy physics have been in the forefront of scientific discoveries for more than half a century. The accelerator technology of the colliders has progressed immensely; while the beam energy; luminosity; facility size; and cost have grown by several orders of magnitude. The method of colliding beams has not fully exhausted its potential but has slowed down considerably in its progress. This paper briefly reviews the colliding beam method and the history of colliders; discusses the development of the method over the last two decades in detail; and examines near-term collider projects that are currently under development. The paper concludes with an attempt to look beyond the current horizon and to find what paradigm changes are necessary for breakthroughs in the field.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mooaa1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mooaa1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mooaa1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOOAA1,11

The last season was dedicated to the energy range of 160-510 MeV per beam. Compton back-scattering based energy measurements were used for the regular energy calibration of the VEPP-2000 together with resonance depolarization and NMR based methods. The concept of the round colliding beams lattice along with the precise orbit and lattice correction yielded the high peak luminosity of 1.2×1031 cm-2s-1 at 505 MeV with average luminosity of 0.9×1031 cm-2s-1 per run. The total beam-beam tune shift up to 0.174 was achieved in the runs at 392.5 MeV. This corresponds to beam-beam parameter ξ=0.125 per one interaction point. The injection system is currently being upgraded to allow for the injection of particles at the top energy of VEPP-2000 collider and to eliminate the present lack of positrons.,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mooaa2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mooaa2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mooaa2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOOAA2,14

While large circumference rings are favoured in reaching ultra small emittance; recent advances in design and optimisation tools allow also medium size ring to reach emittances down to the 100s pm region with workeable lattices. Diamond is investigating a novel design whereby low emittance is conjugated with doubling of the capacity of the ring; based on a double double bend achromat (DDBA) cell.

Instabilities were mainly observed at low energies. About 30% of particles are lost due to the instabilities if the feedback system is turned off at the beam power of 120kW. Both horizontal and vertical instabilities were observed. An analysis unveils that a dipole mode has a temporal appearance of higher-order head-tail modes if the chromaticity is suffisiently large.

In this technique a primary proton beam inside the high magnetic field solenoid is produced by charge-exchange ionization of the atomic hydrogen beam in the He-gas ionizer cell. Further proton polarization is produced in the process of polarized electron capture from the optically-pumped Rb vapour. Formation of the proton beam is produced by four-electrode spherical multi-aperture ion-optical system with geometrical focusing. Polarized beam intensity produced in the source exceeds 4.0 mA.Maximum polarization of 84% was measured at 0.3 mA beam intensity and 80% at 0.5 mA in 200 MeV polarimeter. This high beam intensity allowed reduction of the longitudinal and transverse beam emittances at injection to AGS to reduce polarization losses in AGS. The source reliably delivered polarized beam for 2013 run in RHIC at √s=510 GeV.

PAC2013,,MOOBB1,The AWAKE Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment at CERN,MPI; Muenchen; Germany; Proton (p+) bunches are interesting as wakefield drivers because they carry large amounts of energy (many kJ) and because the p+ rigidity is also large. Simulations show that a short p+ bunch (~100 microns) can drive and sustain GV/m accelerating fields over very long plasma distance; corresponding to a large average acceleration gradient. These wakefields can potentially accelerate a witness electron bunch to the TeV level in a few hundred meters. Self-modulation instability (SMI) of long p+ bunches (~10 cm) available today can lead to the formation of a train ofμbunches that can resonantly drive wakefields to the GV/m level. Based on this scheme the AWAKE collaboration proposes to use the CERN SPS bunch to study the SMI of p+ bunches in ~10m plasma with density in the 1-10x1015/cc range. The wakefields is sampled by externally “side-injected” electrons. Acceleration from a few MeV to a few GeV is expected. Operating at lower plasma density eases external injection requirements. The experimental set up and program will be presented. Expectations based on numerical simulations of the SMI and acceleration processes will be described.

By irradiating a laser beam on a multi-species target made of carbon and hydrogen; the proton layer can be accelerated ahead of the carbon ion layer due to a higher charge-to-mass ratio. And the shielded Coulomb repulsion provided by the left-behind electron-carbon layer can not only further accelerate the proton layer; but also stabilize it for a long time. The acceleration time of quasi-monoenergetic protons by the combined mechanisms is extended over ten times longer compared to the case of applying single-species targets and using radiation pressure acceleration alone. 60 MeV of quasi-monoenergetic protons from a multi-species foil with input laser power of 70 TW is obtained; which is at least five times greater than the energy obtainable from pure hydrogen targets. To further increase the efficiency; we achieve an improvement of 30 percent energy enhancement by introducing a polarization switch in the laser profile.

PAC2013,,MOODB1,Beam-Beam Limit in an Integrable System,A. Valishev; S. Nagaitsev; Fermilab; Batavia; USA; ORNL; Oak Ridge; Tennessee; USA; BINP SB RAS; Novosibirsk; Russia; Round colliding beams have been proposed as a way to push the attainable beam-beam tune shift limit; and recent successful experiments at the VEPP-2000 collider at BINP demonstrated the viability of the concept. In a round-beam system the dynamical stability is improved by introducing an additional integral of motion; which effectively reduces the system from a two and a half dimensional to one and a half dimensional. In this report we discuss the possible further improvement through adding the second integral of motion and thus making the system fully integrable. We explore the ultimate beam-beam limit in such a system using numerical simulations taking into account various imperfections.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/moodb1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/moodb1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/moodb1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOODB1,75
PAC2013,,MOODB2,A Model Ring With Exactly Solvable Nonlinear Motion,"University of Chicago; Chicago; Illinois; USA; Y. Kharkov; I.A. Morozov; BINP SB RAS; Novosibirsk; Russia; Fermilab; Batavia; USA; Recently; a concept of nonlinear accelerator lattices with two analytic invariants has been proposed. Based on further studies; the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) was designed and is being constructed at the FNAL. Despite the clarity and transparency of the proposed idea; the detailed analysis of the beam motion remains quite complicated and should be understood better even for the case when no perturbations are taken into account. In this paper we will review one of the three proposed realizations of the integrable optics; where the variables separation is possible in polar coordinates. This system allows for an exact analytical solution expressed in terms of elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions. It gives the possibility to check numerical algorithms used for tracking and to perform more rigorous analysis of the motion in comparison with the ""crude"" analysis of the topology of the phase space. In addition we will discuss some difficulties associated with numerical simulations of such a comparatively complex dynamical system and will take a look at the possible perturbations for a model machine.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/moodb2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/moodb2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/moodb2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOODB2,78

The E-209 collaboration was formed to carry SMI experiments at SLAC-FACET. Here we show through full-scale Osiris simulations that electron self-modulation grows and saturates in less than 10cm. Wakefield excitation in the blowout regime leads to acceleration gradients in excess of 20GeV/m. The self-modulated e- bunch then sustains stable wakefields over meter-long plasmas. As a result; 7(12)GeV e- energy gain(loss) could be observed. In the blowout regime; most of the wakefield phase defocuses e+.

These structures are usually driven by an external source of electromagnetic energy and the structure distributes that energy is such a way as being favorable to accelerate charged particles. Photonic crystals typically consist of periodic arrays of metal and/or dielectric structures spaced on a scale comparable to the wavelength of interest; have been investigated for use both as sources of microwave radiation and particle accelerators. In this case we consider driving a photonic crystal structure using a repetitive sequence of charge bunches driven from a photo-injector to resonantly excite the structure to produce an acceleration field to accelerate a suitably-delayed witness charge bunch to high energy. We examine the generation of the acceleration field as well as spurious modes. The dynamics of the witness bunch are examined to determine the longitudinal dynamics of the bunch and the energy spectra.,Funding: Parts of this work were performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mopac07_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mopac07.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mopac07_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOPAC07,87

A. Sahai; T.C. Katsouleas; Duke ECE; Durham; North Carolina; USA; W.B. Mori; F.S. Tsung; UCLA; Los Angeles; California; USA; We study the long-term evolution of plasma wakefields over multiple plasma-electron periods and few plasma-ion periods; much less than a recombination time. The evolution and relaxation of such a wakefield-perturbed plasma over these timescales has important implications on the upper limits of repetition-rates in plasma colliders. Intense fields in relativistic lasers (or intense beams) create highly non-linear space-charge wakefields by transferring energy to the plasma electrons. Synchronized charged-particle beams may be accelerated with acceleration/focusing gradients of tens of GeV/m. However; wakefields leave behind a plasma; not in equilibrium; with a relaxation time of multiple plasma-electron periods. Ion motion; over ion timescales; caused by energy transfer from the driven plasma-electrons to the plasma-ions can create interesting plasma states. Eventually; during this long-term evolution the dynamics of plasma de-coheres; thermalizing into random motion (2nd law of thermodynamics); dissipating energy away from the wakefields. Wakefield-drivers interacting with such a relativistically hot-plasma lead to plasma wakefields that differ from the wakefields in a cold-plasma.; * J. Marques et al.; Phys. Rev.

In experiments to date this has not been problematic with appropriate choice of dielectric material. However; given the high repetition rate that would be required; the device would be subjected to essentially a dc bombardment from the beam halo and thus be vulnerable to these effects because there is no time between machine pulses for discharge of the dielectric. We have begun reexamining this problem; emphasizing the expected charging rate and charge distribution in a thin walled dielectric device and the physics of conductivity and discharge phenomena in a dielectric medium. Simulations of the charging process and halo formation will be presented.

This extremely high acceleration gradient can offer various opportunities in accelerator community for future HEP collider in Energy Frontier.

Carbon-based nanostructures have great potential with a wide range of flexibility and superior physical strength; which can be applied to channeling acceleration.

In this paper; we will investigate two aspects of the PBG for acceleration. First; the excitation of the accelerating mode can be achieved by directing high-power lasers from free space. Simulation using ACE3P has demonstrated that; by appropriately shaping the end of the PBG fiber; power can be coupled into the fiber using a simple laser configuration. Second; the wakefield generated by the transit of a beam through a PBG fiber will be simulated using ACE3P.

Since the accelerating channel in DLA structures typically have dimensions in the 1 micron range; the ability to precisely control particle position within these structures will be critical for operation. A number of beam deflection and focusing schemes have been devised; but without the ability to measure the position of the particle beam to nanometer accuracy; these schemes will be extremely difficult to implement. We present a new concept for a beam position monitor with the unique ability to map particle beam position to a measurable wavelength. Coupled with an optical spectrograph; this beam position monitor is capable of sub-nanometer resolution.

We describe a new structure of silica rod array for laser driven acceleration. The structure consists of two rows of equally spaced circular or elliptical rods; with a gap between the rows as the particle channel. Similar to the grating; the periodic arrangement of the rods along the channel provides phase reset of the EM fields and thus required phase synchronicity for acceleration. Resonances among rods enhance the near E-field in the channel to achieve high gradient. The structure has been optimized dimensionally in simulations; and exhibited quite uniform net acceleration in the gap region.

Most experiments use solid state laser pulses focused onto thin foil targets. However; recent progress in CO2 laser technology allows for the creation of intense pulses at λ ~10μm. The longer wavelength permits the use of low density targets. In these conditions ion acceleration is primarily driven by a shock wave due to the radiation pressure of the laser. This acceleration mode has the advantage of producing narrow energy spectra while scaling well with pulse intensity. New improvements to the CO2 laser at the Accelerator Test Facility allow for the unique production of single picoseconds-scale pulses with 1TW peak power. We report on the interaction of an intense CO2 laser pulse with overdense hydrogen and helium gas jets. Using a two pulse optical probe; we are able to obtain real-time density profiles at different times during the interaction; allowing for the characterization of shock wave velocities and peak density conditions.

Studies have been limited to single shot experiments even though optimization of the laser-plasma interaction may only be possible at a high repetition rate. Use of a gas jet is advantageous because it offers debris free interactions at a density around the critical plasma density for 10 μm pulses(1019 cm-3) and can be retuned for different ion species. At the UCLA Neptune Laboratory we have upgraded our laser system to run at a high repetition rate. We have demonstrated the amplification of 20 GW; 3 ps; laser pulses at 1 Hz. Final amplification is achieved in a 1atm CO2 laser where the bandwidth for ps pulse amplification is provided via field broadening from the laser pulse itself. However; peak powers on the order of 0.2 TW are required for producing 3 MeV proton beams. An increase in our peak power by a factor of 10 is possible through nonlinear chirping and broadening of these pulses in a gas filled hollow waveguide followed by pulse compression.

The source of the injected charge is tunnel ionization of Rb+ inside the wake; which occurs along the length of the interaction at each minima of envelope betatron oscillation. Rb was used specifically to mitigate the problem of head erosion; which limited the energy gain in earlier experiments using Li that were carried out at FFTB in SLAC. In the present experiment however; electrons produced via secondary ionization of Rb were injected in the wake and led to a severe depletion of the accelerating wake; i.e. beam loading; which is observed as a reduction of mean; i.e. measured; transformer ratio.

The long (~3.2 ps) bunch available at BNL ATF drives wakefields with periods one to one sixth of the bunch length in plasmas of a 1015 to 1016 cm-3 density range; which is observed as a periodic modulation of the bunch correlated energy spectrum after the 2 cm long plasma. OSIRIS* simulations show that electron bunches with a square temporal current profile seed effectively the wakefield and the development of the transverse modulation instability. Although the self-modulation instability (SMI) does not grow significantly over the 2cm-long plasma with a 50 pC bunch; simulations show that the SMI of the 1 nC bunch grows significantly and reaches saturation over the 2 cm propagation distance. We further examine the possibility of measuring the energy spectrum experimentally to confirm the development of SMI. Initial results show that due to dephasing between the bunch particles and the wakefields; the actual energy gain/loss by drive bunch particles is much lower than expected.; ＊R. A.

It can determine high-order transfer maps of combinations of particle optical elements of arbitrary field configurations. For precision modeling; design; and optimization of next-generation muon beam facilities; its features make it the ideal code. The one component that needs to be included in COSY is the algorithm necessary to follow the distribution of charged particles through matter. Muon beams are tertiary production particles and high-intensity collection necessitates a large initial phase space volume. Therefore; accurate modeling of the dynamics and correction of aberrations is imperative. To study in detail some of the properties of particles passing through material; the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map - Monte-Carlo approach in which transfer map methods are used when there is no material in the accelerator channel; and Monte-Carlo methods when particles pass through material.

It relies on an automatic multigrid-based decomposition of charges in near and far regions and the use of high-order differential algebra methods to obtain decompositions of far fields that lead to an error that scales with a high power of the order. Given an ensemble of N particles; the method allows the computation of the self-fields of all particles on each other with a computational expense that scales as O(N). Furthermore; the method allows the computation of all high-order multipoles of the space charge fields that are necessary for the computation of high-order transfer maps and all resulting aberrations.

The run time of the FMM is significantly less than that of the pairwise calculation if the particle number; N is sufficiently large. Two major parts in the FMM are the upward pass and the downward pass. The upward pass calculates multipole expansions and then performs multipole- to-multipole translations. The downward pass calculates multipole-to- local expansions and local-to local expansions. The multipole-to-local translation in the downward pass is the most time consuming translation in the FMM. In order to make the FMM more efficient; we sought to minimize the time taken by the multipole-to-local translation. The promising and practical strategy to minimize the multipole-to-local translation time is to replace the 3D multipole-to-local translation with a 1D multipole-to-local translation in conjunction with rotations of the coordinate axes. In this paper we show how to perform the 1D multipole-to-local translation and the time comparisons between the two FMM variants.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mopba13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mopba13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mopba13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOPBA13,201

For 1 A radiation this leads to a typical requirement of 8 pm rad vertical emittance. In ultralow-emittance storage rings like the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring this corresponds to a comparably large setting of the emittance coupling (2.5%). This approach; however; does not produce the brightest radiation and needs to be revisited taking into account that overall photon brightness depends on the emittances of the electron beam and the intrinsic photon beam. This paper summarizes an analytic approach to maximizing brightness as a function of emittance coupling while retaining sufficient lifetime. Instead of ""meeting the diffraction limit""; we further reduce the coupling; thus increasing both the brightness and transverse coherence of the emitted radiation. We derive that reducing the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring's vertical emittance to 2 pm rad (0.6% coupling) will increase brightness and transverse coherence by almost a factor two while 10 h overall lifetime can still be achieved.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mopho05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mopho05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mopho05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOPHO05,243

A preliminary design and LiTrack 1D simulation studies were presented before in an older publication~[chris]. In numerical simulations this X-band RF driven hard X-ray FEL achieves/exceeds LCLS-like performance in a much shorter overall length of 350 m; compared with 1200 m in the LCLS case. One key feature of this design is that it may achieve a higher final beam current of 5 kA plus a uniform energy profile; mainly due to the employment of stronger longitudinal wake fields in the last X-band RF linac~[tor].,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mopho12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mopho12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mopho12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOPHO12,264

In PSB operation; a single electron bunch is displaced transversely from the other electron bunches using a short-pulse; high-repetition-rate kicker magnet. Experiments that require light emitted only from a single bunch can stop the light emitted from the other bunches using a collimator. Other beam lines will only see a small reduction in flux due to the displaced bunch. As a result; PSB eliminates the need to schedule multibunch and timing experiments during different running periods. Furthermore; the time spacing of PSB pulses can be adjusted from milliseconds to microseconds with a novel “kick-and-cancel” scheme; which can significantly alleviate complications of using high-power choppers and substantially reduce the rate of sample damage.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mopho22_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mopho22.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mopho22_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOPHO22,285

Back-streaming neutrons at the CSNS spallation target are to be employed as a white neutron source. The available high RF voltage in the high intensity rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) of CSNS makes it possible to extract very short bunches by using the bunch rotation method. A special desynchrotronization method is designed to avoid the slow acceleration during the bunch rotation when magentic field is still ramping. Different extraction scenarios together with the changes in the injection have been studies for the purpose. Together with the calculations; multiple simulations have been carried out to show the effectiveness of the method. With a sacrifice of about two-third beam power; the rms bunch length of the extracted beam can be reduced to about one tenth of the one in the nominal operation mode. Other scenarios also show the improvement in the bunch length.

Moderated neutrons from this target will be delivered to a suite of 22 neutron instruments. In the accelerator-to-target region; design choices must balance the demands of the accelerator; the target; and the neutron instruments. For example; the transport line upstream of the target station expands and shapes the small; low emittance linac beam into a large beam that is safe for the target components. It must do this with low loss in order to reduce activation of the beam line and minimize a potential source of background in the neutron instruments. To meet availability goals; beam-induced damage to critical components must be avoided by instrumenting beamline components; deploying a suite of beam instrumentation within the target monolith; and interfacing some of these devices to the machine protection system.

This scheme uses two choppers; one fast and one slow; each kicks a portion of beam into its corresponding downstream beam dump.

Operation at high intensity in CW mode puts stringent tolerances on beamline elements. Any fault scenario that affects nominal operation of beamline elements results in beam mismatch with subsequent sections. This in turn leads to emittance growth; and ultimately triggers beam losses. In worst case; it could affect the reliability of the machine and long downtime may be needed to replace the faulty elements. In order to reduce beam interruptions; a robust lattice design is required which can allow local retuning to make the machine operable in such scenarios.

One-turn injection can be approximated as single-particle injection with initial betatron position and angle (x0 and x0’). The turn-by-turn beam position data from single-turn injection allows measurement of the betatron tune; closed orbit (CO); and injection offset (x0 and x0’ at the injection point). In accumulation mode; many turns are injected into the ring; the transverse phase space is quickly filled; and there is no coherent betatron motion. The injection offset; which determines the accumulated beam size and is very sensitive to steering upstream of the ring; is not measurable during accumulation. We review our approach for measuring the injection offset during accumulation; focus discussion on recent experimental results; and compare measurements of the betatron tune; CO; and injection offset in single-turn injection mode and in a “diagnostic pulse” mode.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mopma15_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mopma15.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mopma15_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOPMA15,330

The goal is to provide new insights on the beam distribution inside the linac and to help understand the impact of set point adjustments on it. The simulator utilizes the well established beam dynamics algorithms of the PARMILA code. By employing Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technology; the performance of the simulator has been significantly increased over that of a single CPU and is therefore viable as an online tool in the demanding accelerator operations environment. The combination of a high-level scripting language (Python) and low-level compiled language (C++ and CUDA C) was adopted to streamline application development and to enable efficient execution. Once connected to the EPICS control system; the simulator can track in pseudo real time machine parameter changes; convert control set points to model quantities and rapidly update the simulation results.

Due to the change of the ambience temperature in the linac tunnel; the electrical length of reference rf cables may change significantly; which results in unacceptable phase changes in cavities. So; sometimes the reference line is very expensive; for example; made of optical fiber housed in a lengthy thermostatic chamber. The frequencies of FRIB linac cavities are 80.5 and 322 MHz (not very high). We also take advantage of the double-folded linac geometry and feed the reference line in the center of the linac to effectively reduced the reference line by 6 times. Our studies show that the FRIB linac can tolerate up to 12ps phase stability of the rf reference line. Therefore; no special treatment is needed for the reference line.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/mopma20_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/mopma20.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/mopma20_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-MOPMA20,342

High voltage (HV) filter is designed to protect it from severe HV sparks and multiple level of relays with high precision medium HV divider are used to protect it from possible power supply failure. Homemade HV divider is used for rough measurement and control. Measurement results are converted to optical signals and then used to control power supplies to achieve the desired platform voltages.

PAC2013,,TUYB1,Corrugated Structures for Terahertz Generation and Beam Dechirping,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; In recent studies a metallic pipe with small corrugations has been considered for two applications: as a beam-based method of generating pulses of terahertz radiation; and for simply and cheaply removing unwanted energy chirp in linac-based X-ray FEL's. With a pipe of length ~10 cm and aperture ~1 mm; narrow-band; multi-cycle pulses of radiation can be generated; with frequency ~1 THz and pulse energy of a few mJ. In linac-based FEL's; after the final bunch compressor; the electron bunch typically is left with an energy chirp. An inexpensive way for dechirping is to have the beam pass through ~10 m of corrugated pipe. This report presents and analyzes the performance of the corrugated structure for both mentioned purposes.

Such high single bunch currents are achieved by a combination of high operational chromaticity and transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback. In the near future; more narrow-gap insertion device vacuum chambers will be installed; which will increase impedance of the storage ring and make operation with high single-bunch current more problematic. Simulations exist that quantify the effect of increased impedance on the APS single-bunch accumulation limit; however; no experimental verification has been performed yet. In this paper; we will present our first measurement of the single-bunch accumulation limit as a function of effective impedance. Different impedance values were achieved by changing storage ring beta functions.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tuobb2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tuobb2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tuobb2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUOBB2,405
PAC2013,,TUOBB3,Imposing Strong Energy Slews with Transverse Deflecting Cavities,N.A. Yampolsky; A. Malyzhenkov; LANL; Los Alamos; New Mexico; USA; We propose a novel scheme for imposing strong energy slews in short electron bunches using a set of transverse deflecting cavities. Such a cavity introduces the angular divergence depending on the longitudinal position and the energy variation depending on the transverse position. Combining several cavities and vacuum drifts we first expand the beam transversally keeping x-z correlation of the distribution; then apply the energy variation; and focus the beam back. The transform matrix of the scheme is equivalent to a single chirping cavity. At the same time; the strength of the R65 element is strongly increased compared to conventional accelerating cavities. The overall energy variation along the bunch is defined by the transverse size of the beam in the middle of the beamline rather than its longitudinal size. As a result; the strength of the R65 element can be increased by 2 orders of magnitude compared to conventional design. This scheme allows for acceleration on crest increasing average accelerating gradient and reducing accelerator cost. It also allows for using weaker chicanes in compressors.,Funding: This research was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program of Los Alamos National Laboratory.,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tuobb3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tuobb3.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tuobb3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUOBB3,

The resulting energy loss per electron-ion pair produced has been measured at 10-18 to 10-16 J every RF cycle. Doping the hydrogen gas with oxygen greatly decreases the lifetime of an electron; thereby improving the performance of the HPRF cavity. Electron lifetimes as short as 1 ns have been measured. The recombination rate of positive and negative ions in the cavity has been measured on the order of 10-8 cm3/s.

PAC2013,,TUODB3,Multi-Turn Injection of 50 MeV Protons Into the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster,V. Raginel; E. Benedetto; C. Carli; B. Mikulec; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Since 1978; Linac2 produces beams of 50 MeV protons with a current around 160 mA; which are injected into the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) with conventional multi-turn injection using a horizontal septum. It is planned to replace Linac2 during a future long stop with a new H− linac; Linac4; injecting at higher energy (160 MeV) and making use of the modern charge-exchange injection principle. Due to the age of Linac2 and to a delicate vacuum situation the risk of a serious Linac2 breakdown has to be considered. Therefore it is necessary to study if the PSB could produce beams useful for the LHC and other experiments injecting a Linac4 proton beam at 50 MeV with much lower average current compared to Linac2 and without the need for a long installation of the 160 MeV H− injection hardware. Benchmarking of the PSB injection model with the existing injection system with Linac2 using the ORBIT code has been done for a LHC-type beam and then the injection model was used to estimate the brightness for LHC-type beams that could potentially be reached in one PSB ring with the injection of a Linac4 proton beam at 50 MeV.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tuodb3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tuodb3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tuodb3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUODB3,442

In this talk; I will describe the facility; nuSTORM; and show how the unique neutrino beam at the facility will enable experiments of unprecedented precision to be carried out. I will present sensitivity plots that indicated that this approach can provide well over 5 σ confirmation or rejection of the LSND/MinBooNE results and can be used to perform neutrino interaction measurements of unprecedented precision. The unique ν beam available at the nuSTORM facility has the potential to be transformational in our approach to ν interaction physics; offering a “ν light source” to physicists from a number of disciplines.

The separator is divided into pre and main stages. The pre-separator contains a thin target to produce the isotope beam and beam dump to remove unreacted primary beam. The maximum primary beam power is 400 kW. As a result; radiation level is very high in the target area and some of the magnets will utilize high-Tc superconductor coils operating at 20-50 K to efficiently remove the radiation heat deposited on the coil. A major function of the pre-separator is to remove the primary beam; which is complicated by different charge states produced when the primary beam passes through the target and wedge-shaped energy degrader. Some detailed calculations in beam optics and on the layout of the major separator components have been performed using GICOSY and LISE++ considering contaminant isotope beams due to nuclear reactions.

The CLIC baseline design uses heavy damping of the modes which constitute the wakefield (Q~10). In this damping scheme only the wake from the immediately preceding bunch has a significant impact on the projected emittance and figures of merit to ensure an acceptable emittance dilution are discussed in *. Here we discuss an alternative damping scheme based on the experience of the NLC **. The wakefield suppression is provided by a strong detuning and moderate damping (Q~700) by 4 manifolds which are slot-coupled to each cell. Interleaving neighboring structure frequencies helps to enhance wakefield suppression. In this damping scheme it is the total wake distribution produced by the whole bunch train which has an impact on the projected emittance. We use the beam tracking code PLACET to analyze the stability of the full system made of more than 71; 000 structures; over a relatively large number of slightly different machines and the influence of random frequency errors also be incorporated.; * D.

Due to the non-linear field; the beam-based alignment of sextupoles becomes more difficult and often requires a sophisticated post-data process. A simple method had been developed at the APS that measures the vertical orbit variation (orbit change at BPM with variation of sextupole strength) versus beam trajectory through a sextupole in one plane while keeping the trajectory in other plane fixed.

Timing of the tune jumps requires accurate tune and energy measurements. Although cross calibration using measurements of the beam revolution frequency shows good accuracy for most of the AGS energy range it is not adequately sensitive as the beam becomes highly relativistic. This drives a strong interest for a new independent energy measurement method. Reduction in the vertical tune across vertical intrinsic spin resonances can induce important depolarization of the beam. Therefore it was proposed to use the negative vertical tune shift created by this tune jump system to calibrate the energy measurement at few locations along the AGS acceleration cycle. The fast tune jump; of ΔQ≈-0.02 within 100μs in the vertical plane; allows to accurately locate the spin resonant condition; independently from orbit or field conditions. Simulations using the AGS Zgoubi on-line model facilitates the interpretation of the experimental results.

However; for multi-charge state acceleration situation; where the transfer matrix is different between charge-states; the linear envelope tracking model cannot be utilized. A direct way to handle multi-charge state acceleration is using multi-particle tracking; which is usually high in precision; but lack in efficiency; therefore is not suitable for linac on-line beam tuning. In this paper; a new approach of adapting linear envelope tracking model onto multi-charge state acceleration situation is proposed. The lattice of FRIB is used to test the scheme in both linac segment and folding segment.

The accuracy of the model’s prediction is dependent on how well the real machine’s focusing lattice is known and represented. While quadrupoles may be mapped magnetically and their focusing properties well understood; the focusing effect due to dipole edge fields is less certain. For rings with rectangular dipoles like the Proton Storage Ring (PSR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory; the dipole edge focusing can be a significant contributor to the vertical focusing. Most accelerator modeling codes; like MAD and AT; use the K. Brown formulation and can lead to errors ~10% in the model’s betatron tune prediction. Here we discuss particle tracking through simulated dipole fields; including edge effects; with TOSCA 3D to obtain the focal lengths of the edge focusing. We verify model focal lengths by operating the PSR in the weak focusing regime (without vertically focusing quadrupoles) and show that the model predicts the betatron amplitude functions and tunes even in this unusual operating condition.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tupac19_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tupac19.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tupac19_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUPAC19,490

We also observe the tune shift to vary with turn during a store. Quality measurements of the coherent space charge tune shift may provide a unique handle on interesting physics including wake field effects and electron cloud buildup. We digitize beam signals from a beam position monitor; stack the digitized vector turn-by-turn; and fit the tune for each slice (0.5 ns digitization bin) along the pulse after a single-turn vertical kick.

The limit can be overcome if a plasma is introduced in the beam path between the focusing element and the target in order to neutralize the space charge of the beam. This concept is implemented on the Neutralized Drift Compression eXperiment (NDCX) at LBNL using Ferroelectric Plasma Sources (FEPS). FEPS are developed at PPPL where we are currently conducting experiments on beam neutralization by FEPS plasma. A 30-60 keV space charge dominated Argon beam is focused with an Einzel lens into a FEPS located approximately at the waist of the unneutralized beam. The beam is intercepted downstream from the FEPS by a movable Faraday cup array that provides time-resolved 2D current density profiles of the beam spot on target.

JLab’s MEIC is designed for high luminosities of up to 1034 cm-2 s-1. This is achieved in part due to an aggressively small beta-star; which imposes stringent requirements on the collider rings’ dynamical properties. Additionally; one of the unique features of MEIC is a full-acceptance detector with a dedicated; small-angle; high-resolution detection system; capable of covering a wide range of momenta (and charge-to-mass ratios) with respect to the original ion beam to enable access to new physics. We present an interaction region design developed with close integration of the detection and beam dynamical aspects. The dynamical aspect of the design rests on a symmetry-based concept for compensation of non-linear effects. The optics and geometry have been optimized to accommodate the detection requirements and to ensure the interaction region’s modularity for easiness of integration into the collider ring lattices. As a result; the design offers an excellent detector performance combined with the necessary non-linear dynamical properties.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tupac28_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tupac28.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tupac28_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUPAC28,508

PAC2013,,TUPAC33,Measurement of Plasma Wave Speed from Electron Beam End Erosion,UMD; College Park; Maryland; USA; The University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) normally injects a beam that is square in longitudinal profile (constant line density); filling one half the ring. When operating without longitudinal focusing; the beam head and tail erode at a constant plasma wave speed. Because the beam is very long (580 cm) compared to the beam pipe diameter (5 cm); the two eroding edges remain sharply defined until they meet. This paper describes how the plasma wave speed in the beam can be obtained experimentally by measuring only the initial pulse length; the time it takes for the eroding ends to meet and the kinetic energy. The plasma wave velocity can then be used to get an estimate of the average beam radius during the erosion time.

The final focus system (FFS) of a LC is meant to deliver such small beam sizes. The Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) aims to test the feasibility of the new local chromaticity correction scheme which the future LCs are based on. To this end the ATF2 nominal and ultra-low β* lattices are design to vertically focus the beam at the IP to 37nm and 23nm; respectively if error-free lattices are considered. However simulations show that the measured field errors of the ATF2 magnets preclude to reach the mentioned spot sizes. This paper describes the optimization of high order aberrations of the ATF2 lattices in order to minimize the detrimental effect of the measured multipole components for both ATF2 lattices. Specifically three solutions are studied; the replacement of the last focusing quadrupole (QF1FF); insertion of octupole magnets and optics modification. By applying the mentioned cures the design vertical beam size at the IP is almost recovered for both ATF2 lattices.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tupba25_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tupba25.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tupba25_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUPBA25,574

Since the autumn of 2011; we have begun X-ray imaging test. In the beginning; it had taken two hours to get an X-ray image because of low intensity of X-ray with 104 photons/pulse. To get a clear X-ray image in a shorter period of times; we have upgraded the accelerator; which consists of a 3.6 cell photo-cathode rf-gun; a 12cell standing wave accelerating structure and a 4-mirror planar optical cavity. The target intensity of an electron beam is 500nC/train with 1000 bunches at 30 MeV. The one of laser pulse is also 6mJ/pulse. The expected number of X-ray is 1.7x107 photons/train with 10% bandwidth. We have already started the multi-bunch beam generation and X-ray imaging test after upgrade. The accelerator produces 24 MeV beam with the total charge of 180nC in 150 bunches per pulse. The aging process is also continued to increase energy and intensity.

PAC2013,,TUPMA02,High-Chromaticity Optics for the MAX IV 3 GeV Storage Ring,T. Olsson; S.C. Leemann; MAX-lab; Lund; Sweden; The ultralow emittance lattice of the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring has a large negative natural chromaticity. This has to be corrected to positive values to prevent head-tail instabilities. On the other hand; high linear chromaticity can lead to a large tune footprint which limits Touschek lifetime. Therefore; the linear chromaticity is corrected to +1 in both planes with sextupoles while octupoles are used to further reduce the tune footprint. Studies indicate this design leads to threshold currents for resistive wall and transverse mode coupling instabilities beyond what is expected during regular user operation. However; since these are only preliminary studies based on approximations; the possibility of instability issues during commissioning needs to be considered. A short term solution is to operate the storage ring at a higher chromaticity. This paper describes the developed high-chromaticity optics for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring. It focuses on reduction of chromatic and amplitude-dependent tune shifts to maximize dynamic aperture and Touschek lifetime. A comparison between the performance of the new high-chromaticity optics and the design optics is also presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tupma02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tupma02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tupma02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUPMA02,592

Bunch purity of better than 10-6 is required for +3 and higher bucket numbers for the first two fill patterns during user operations. A PAR bunch cleaning system is used to clean up the satellite bunches. During top-up user operation; beam charge in satellite bunches grows due to the long lifetime of the low charge satellites. Recent storage ring development; including operating with the bunch-by-bunch feedback system; reduction of chromaticity; and lattice correction; has increased the beam dynamic aperture of the storage ring.

The 1.5 cell 1.3 GHz gun uses a Cesium telluride photocathode driven with a 248 nm laser to provide short-pulse; high charge electron beams for the new 75 MeV drive beamline. The high-gradient RF gun (peak field on the cathode > 80MV/m) is a key piece of the facility upgrade (see M. E. Conde; this proceedings). The large Cs2Te photocathode (diameter > 30 mm) is fabricated in-house. The photo-injector generates high-charge; short pulse; single bunches (Q > 100 nC) or bunch-trains (Q > 1000 nC) for wakefield experiments; typically involving dielectric-loaded accelerating structures. Field-emitted dark current from the Cs2Te cathode was measured during RF conditioning. Fowler-Nordheim plots of the data are presented and compared to similar measurements made using a copper cathode in the initial phase of conditioning. Results of quantum efficiency (QE) studies are presented with the cathode operating in both single and bunch-train modes.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tupsm05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tupsm05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tupsm05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUPSM05,637

The PXIE vacuum system faces significant technical challenges; including a large hydrogen flux from the H− ion source and large outgassing from the LEBT absorber. The greatest challenge is probably to minimize the risk of degrading re-bunching RF cavities and the nearby SC cryomodule due to the migration of large gas load and microparticles from MEBT absorber. Therefore; it is important to apply low particulate vacuum practices in the vicinity of cryomodules for preventing contamination of the SC cryomodules.

A temperature control system regulates the RF power transmission between 5MW Klystron and the RF Gun. Its role is to maintain the resonant frequency by exploiting the 16.5ppm/°C thermal expansion of the copper. Temperature is regulated by mixing chilled low conductivity water (LCW) with circulating water between the cavity and gun skid located outside the radiation cave.

The two transport lines merge into a common transport after which both species are injected into the 201.25 MHz DTL. The H+ CW will be replaced with a 4-rod RFQ that is now in fabrication. Because of the complication of accommodating two beam species; the MEBT for the RFQ beam is much longer than usual. The length of the MEBT for the H+ beam; and a requirement to merge it with the existing common transport; present new and unique challenges for the MEBT design. In particular; multiple ¼-wave bunchers in addition to the existing final buncher upstream of the DTL are necessary to minimize phase spread of the RFQ output beam for DTL injection.

The LEBT uses 2 magnetic solenoids with enough drift space between them to accommodate diagnostics and a beam deflector. The LEBT is designed to work over a range of space-charge neutralized currents and emittances. The LEBT is optimized in the sense that it minimizes the beam size in both solenoids for a point design of a given neutralized current and emittance. Special attention has been given to estimating emittance growth due to solenoid aberrations.

PAC2013,,TUPSM30,Modeling the Development and Mitigation of Charge Accumulation for Photo Emission Electron Guns,C. Nieter; Y. Choi; D.A. Dimitrov; Tech-X; Boulder; Colorado; USA,,One potential problem with the operation of photo emission electron guns is the potential for charge to accumulate on the emission surface depending on how the biasing voltage is applied to the gun. If the voltage is applied away from the emission surface there is the potential for charge to accumulate on the emission surface since not all electrons will necessarily be emitted. This charge accumulation may affect the gun operation by reducing the accelerating field in the gun. We report on simulations that demonstrate this potential issue as well as simulations that test a potential solution where a secondary voltage is applied periodically to clear the accumulated charge.,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/tupsm30_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/tupsm30.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/tupsm30_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-TUPSM30,700

All the requirements before operating the SCU0 in the storage ring were satisfied during a short but detailed beam commissioning. The cryogenic system performed very well in the presence of the beam. The total beam-induced heat load on the SCU0 agreed well with the predictions; and the SCU0 is protected from excessive heat loads through a combination of orbit control and SCU0 alignment. When powered; the field integral measured with the beam agreed well with the magnet measurements. An induced quench caused very little beam motion; and did not cause loss of the beam. The device was found to quench during unintentional beam dumps; but quench recovery is transparent to storage ring operation. There were no beam chamber vacuum pressure issues and no negative effect observed on the beam. Finally; the SCU0 was operated well beyond its design requirements; and no significant issues were identified.

Computations have shown that the peak bunch brightness should exceed that from S-Band RF photoinjectors by a factor of four. This improved performance principally comes from the high (200 MV/m) peak fields that can be sustained on the gun cathode. During the first three months of XTA commissioning; 20 pC electron bunches have been routinely generated with the gun cathode operating at greater than 200 MV/m while the dark current levels have been low. The electron bunches are accelerated to 70 MeV in a one-meter long; travelling-wave; X-band structure after the gun (a newer version of this structure should allow acceleration to more than 100 MeV). This paper reviews progress to date including measurements of the bunch properties and the bunch-to-bunch stability. The lengths of the 20 pC bunches have been measured with a transverse X-Band deflection cavity to be 250 fs rms; as expected from simulations. Transverse emittance in the range of 0.9 mm-mrad have been measured.

Such photocathode rf gun can generate low emittance and short bunch electron beam. Generating ultra-short electron bunch (shorter than 1ps) in a compact accelerator system would be meaningful because some applications need to be miniaturized; THz imaging; for example. However a short laser pulse cannot generate the bunch length of less than 1ps due to the space charge effects. So as to generate ultra-short electron bunch in compact system; we have newly designed Energy Chirping Cell attached rf gun (ECC rf gun). ECC is attached subsequently to the 1.6 cell. The role of ECC is to chirp the electron energy so that the electron bunch is compressed by velocity difference as it drifts. Simulation results show ECC rf gun can accelerate100pC electron bunch with the bunch length shorter than 100fs. We have successfully measured the coherent THz light by synchrotron radiation and transition radiation. Therefore; we inferred that the bunch was compressed into shorter than 1ps.

(DTI) designed a modulator which meets the requirements of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) modulators at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and will be less expensive than copies of the current modulators. The SNS modulators; under development for a decade; still do not meet the specifications for voltage; droop; or pulsewidth. The modulators must provide pulses of 85 kV; 165 A; with pulsewidths of 1.5 ms and voltage flatness of 1%. The current modulator switches the full power at high frequency during each pulse; and has a complex output transformer. DTI designed a modulator that meets all specifications and is less expensive. The proposed design is cheaper because there is an HV switch that operates at full current only once per pulse; a corrector that switches only 5% of the power at high frequency; a low-cost transformer-rectifier power supply; and no output transformer. DTI’s patented switch uses IGBTs; allowing the switch to operate at full capacity even if 20% of the devices fail. The modulator will be installed in 2013 at SNS to test klystrons.

An integral part of the upgrade is the addition of ten new cryomodules, each consisting of eight seven-cell superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities. An average performance of 100+MV of acceleration per cryomodule is needed to achieve the 12 GeV beam energy goal. The production methodology was for industry to provide and deliver the major components to Jefferson Lab, where they were tested and assembled into cryomodules. The production process begins with an inspection upon receiving of all major components followed by individual performance qualification testing. The SRF cavities received their final chemical processing and cleaning at Jefferson Lab. The qualified components along with all associated hardware and instrumentation are assembled, tested, installed into CEBAF and run through an integrated system checkout in preparation for beam operations. The production process is complete and one of the first completed cryomodules has successfully produced 108 MV of acceleration with a linac beam current of 465 uA.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/wezaa2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/wezaa2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/wezaa2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-WEZAA2,749

Energetic alpha particles are emitted in kinematic correlation with neutrons in DT fusion reactions; forming a virtual neutron beam. When alphas are detected in a position sensitive detector and their arrival time is also recorded then time tagged neutrons can be used for 3D imaging e. g. of concealed objects in a transmission geometry or through detection of a prompt gamma ray. The imaging resolution in API systems is often limited by the area from which neutron originate. This area is determined by the spot size of a mixed D+ and T+ ion beam. We have adapted microwave driven ion sources (permanent magnets; 2.45 GHz) for the efficient production of hydrogen ions (all isotopes) with high current density (50 to 100 mA/cm2) and high fractions of atomic ions [1]. The high current density allows us to extract ions with small apertures and form beam spots on the neutron production target of less than 1 mm in diameter.

The resolution of the system is 1mK. Hence it’s able to detect small temperature increases when cavities reach at low accelerating gradients e.g. 3MV/m. The surface resistivity of superconductor under radio-frequency electromagnetic field can be calculated from the temperature increases. In this contribution; the surface resistance map of multi-cell SRF cavities is shown. The temperature mapping result is possible to establish a relationship between the surface resistivity and the magnetic field as well. Unlike the RF method which is average value of the surface resistance; the T-map results give local surface resistivity versus magnetic field. BCS theory assumes the surface resistivity is independent to the magnetic field. The T-map results; however; suggest that the surface resistance at high-loss region is field dependent and caused Q-slope.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/wepac10_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/wepac10.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/wepac10_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-WEPAC10,808

This lack of symmetry introduces a transverse field perturbation which affects the beam dynamic; since the particles traveling through the structure are crossing two accelerating gaps separated by the inner electrode. The field asymmetry induces an asymmetric transverse momentum gain which; once expanded in multipoles; appears to be due to a quadrupole perturbation. Depending on the cavity geometry and particle velocity; the influence of electric and magnetic fields may vary quite significantly. A way of having symmetric transverse fields in spoke resonators consists in modifying the inner electrode from a pole to an X or Y shape. The application of these changes symmetrizes both electric and magnetic fields and reduces the multipoles amplitudes to negligible values.

PAC2013,,WEPAC46,Wakefield Computations for a Corrugated Pipe as a  Beam Dechirper for FEL Applications,C.-K. Ng; K.L.F. Bane; SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; A beam “dechirper” based on a corrugated; metallic vacuum chamber has been proposed recently to cancel residual energy chirp in a beam before it enters the undulator in a linac-based X-ray FEL*. Rather than the round geometry that was originally proposed; we consider a pipe composed of two parallel plates with corrugations. The advantage is that the strength of the wake effect can be tuned by adjusting the separation of the plates. The separation of the plates is a few millimeters; and the corrugations are fractions of a millimeter in size. The dechirpers need to be meters long in order to provide sufficient longitudinal wakefield to cancel the beam chirp. Considerable computation resources are required to determine accurately the wakefield for such a long structure with small corrugation gaps. Combining the moving window technique and parallel computing using multiple processors; the parallel finite-element electromagnetic suite ACE3P allows efficient determination of the wakefield through convergence studies. In this paper; we will calculate the longitudinal; dipole and quadrupole wakefields for the dechirper and compare the results with those of analytical approaches.; * K.L.F. Bane; G.

Analyses in the LHC show significantly higher noise levels than for the RHIC case due to a bigger bandwidth of the LHC BPMs. Efforts to reduce the noise level like taking advantage of the thousands of turns provided by the LHC BPM system (in contrast with the few orbits used in RHIC) have been done; but there is still a possibility to reduce it further by using filters. In this work; we describe the design of a band-pass filter on LHC simulated orbits. Normal and skew quadrupole errors (A1 and B1) are introduced in the lattice and recovered after multiple turns of the particles; using the APJ analysis. Gaussian and uniform noise were added to the orbits and the band-pass filter was applied to them. Results show that the band-pass filter around the accelerator tunes reduces significantly the uncertainty on the determination of A1 and B1; when the filter is optimized by changing its bandwidth.

This however proved to be inadequate; as the betatron phase advance between the AC dipoles is non-zero.

We present a novel technique to measure the transverse rms emittance. The method uses the beam divergence; measured; e.g. with optical transition radiation interferometry*; and the beam radius; obtained by imaging the beam; to determine the cross correlation term and thus all the terms in the equation for the rms emittance. The experimental data is obtained with a lens-drift-screen setup similar to what is used in a quadrupole scan. However; the analysis of the scan data is unique. It involves taking the cross-correlation term as a control variable in a procedure which matches the beam envelop radius and its derivative calculated from the envelope equation; with the measured radius and divergences at the screen. A linear space charge model is used in the envelope equations; hence the errors in the measurement relate to the nonuniformity of the beam transverse distribution. The technique is tested using simulated data.; * R. B. Fiorito; et al.; “Interference of diffraction and transition radiation and its application as a beam divergence diagnostic; ” Phys. Rev.

(CCR) is developing an Annular Beam Klystron (ABK) for advanced accelerators. The power and frequency; 10 MW and 1.3 GHz; respectively; are consistent with requirements for the International Linear Collider (ILC); but the primary goal of the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of the configuration. The ABK uses a large diameter annular beam propagated close to the drift tube wall to reduce the plasma density; allowing high efficiency with high beam perveance. This allows the voltage to be less than 120 kV; as required for the ILC. The perveance is similar to that of multiple beam klystrons; but the ABK; with a single beam; is much simpler and is expected to be less expensive than the MBK. The CCR ABK has a calculated efficiency of 67% with a perveance of 3.4. The pulse width and pulse repetition frequency are 1.5 ms and 10 pps; respectively. The ABK has been modeled extensively using multiple codes; including KLSC; TESLA and MAGIC. The mechanical design is complete and assembly of the tube is expected by the fall of 2013.

Each gyrotron requires a power system that must deliver the high-voltage power; modulate cathode voltage; and protect these expensive gyrotrons from arcing damage. It must be highly efficient; to minimize both the power and cooling costs associated with operation and to ensure high facility availability. Diversified Technologies; Inc. (DTI) has bench-tested a table-top scale ‘Buck Matrix’ modulator which uses a single set of IGBT switches for voltage regulation; arc protection; and pulse modulation. Although pulse step modulators represent a one-step solution; their size; and the complexity of their driving transformer make them more expensive than DTI’s two-step approach. DTI’s Buck Matrix modulator; with an efficiency of ~96%; cuts the size of the system in half; using a single layer of solid state switches for both voltage regulation and arc protection/modulation. This cuts the total hardware costs by a~30% or more; and eliminates the need for a separate opening switch or crowbar.

A full 3D model of the structure including vane modulation was developed. The design was heavily optimized using large scale electromagnetic simulations. Following the choice of the vane type and geometry; the shape and dimensions of the undercuts were optimized to produce a flat field along the structure. Simulations of the same structure with different lengths were performed to verify that the design length produced the best separation of the operating mode from neighbouring modes. If built as designed the RFQ should not need dipole rods for mode separation; but their effect were studied in the case of manufacturing errors.

Two approaches can be considered to be useful for the radiation reduction. First; lower gap voltage may decrease a radiation dose and hard X-ray generation. Second; lower electric peak field with smooth gap geometry may help to minimize field emission current. Regarding these considerations; in this paper we propose a double gap buncher cavity for low energy part of H− ion accelerators such as medium energy beam transport (MEBT) section in Spallation Neutron Source. For MEBT application; the cavity may use Transverse Magnetic (TM) mode at about 400MHz as the operating mode. A drift tube supported by a stem in the cavity can form two gaps that can divide the required gap voltage to a half per each gap. Lower peak field can be realized since this double gap cavity can enhance the particle transit time factor. 3D simulation is utilized to address the analysis of non-axisymmetric structure.

From medical synchrotrons to accelerator driven systems; there is a need for fast acceleration of protons and light ions to hundreds of MeV. Conventionally; this is a costly undertaking; requiring specially designed ferrite loaded cavities to be tuned over a wide range of frequencies. Ferromagnetic materials allow for the precise adjustment of cavity resonant frequency; but rapid changes in the frequency and operation outside material specific frequency ranges result in significant Q-loss to the cavity. This leads to a considerable increase in power requirements. We introduce an acceleration scheme known as harmonic ratcheting which can be used to reduce the cavity frequency range when accelerating an ion beam in a synchrotron. This scheme addresses the needs of high rep. rate machines for applications such as radiation therapy in which low beam intensity is needed.

The analysis shows that requirements to electron beam quality and to RF power become more severe with wavelength reduction. In order to satisfy these requirements; we suggest to build an undulator of several separate segments. In accordance with first concept each segment introduces a high-Q cavity fed by its own multi-megawatt RF source. The 30 GHz pulsed gyroklystron or gyrotrons at 30 - 300 GHz; already elaborated and tested in IAP RAS; are appealing candidates. These sources can provide the effective undulator period of 0.5 - 0.05 cm; the undulator parameter up to 1; and the effective field length of 50 cm for each segment. The second concept implies using a high-power short pulse propagating in a long corrugated waveguide where -1st field harmonic is responsible for particle wiggling.

PAC2013,,WEPSM04,Helical Self Focusing and Cooling Accelerating Structure,S.V. Kuzikov; S. Mishakin; A.A. Vikharev; IAP/RAS; Nizhny Novgorod; Russia; A new helical RF accelerating structure; which can provide emittance control of the electron beam; is proposed. This structure combines properties of a linear accelerator and a damping ring simultaneously. It makes acceleration of straight on-axis beam as well as beam cooling due to the synchrotron radiation of particles. These properties are provided by specific slow eigen mode which consists of two partial waves; TM01 and TM11 (near to cut off). The longitudinal field of the first wave is synchronous with electrons; the transverse fields of the second wave are far from synchronous condition and they cause electron wiggling like it occurs in RF undulator.

PAC2013,,WEPSM05,Progress on Pulsed Multipole Injection for the MAX IV Storage Rings,MAX-lab; Lund; Sweden; CLS; Saskatoon; Saskatchewan; Canada; Injection into the MAX IV storage rings will not make use of a conventional local injection bump with four dipole kickers. Instead; pulsed multipole injection will be applied. Previously; it was foreseen to use a pulsed sextupole magnet similar to what KEK had originally designed for the PF ring. But after seeing encouraging results with a prototype nonlinear kicker magnet developed for BESSY II; pulsed multipole injection for the MAX IV storage rings was revisited. A nonlinear kicker magnet similar to the BESSY-type can be realized for both MAX IV storage rings. Such a nonlinear kicker offers a broad zero-field region around the center which does not perturb the stored beam; while offering a high-field region around the location of the injected beam making it ideal for top-up injection. This paper summarizes the proposed kicker magnet design and shows beam dynamics results from multi-particle tracking studies. A comparison with the previous PSM design is also included.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/wepsm05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/wepsm05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/wepsm05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-WEPSM05,

The magnet cores are mounted on but thermally isolated from the beam vacuum chamber. Protecting the SCU0 from high beam-induced heat loads was an important requirement before operating the SCU0 in the storage ring. Precise alignment of the beam vacuum chamber with respect to both the electron beam orbit as well as the synchrotron radiation generated in the upstream dipole magnet was therefore extremely important. The beam vacuum chamber was instrumented with nine thermal sensors. Using the sensors; the chamber alignment was determined with a 100-micron precision. This precision is more than 10 times higher than in a standard aperture scan. Other advantages of the thermal sensor-based alignment method include isolating the SCU0 alignment from other components in the orbit bump and providing good longitudinal spatial resolution.

This device is identified as the Intermediate Energy X-ray (IEX) undulator. The IEX undulator takes its name from the IEX beamline where it is installed. The IEX undulator is able to produce a variety of polarizations: linear vertical; linear horizontal; and right- or left-handed elliptical or circular. Ten pairs of poles; distributed quasi-periodically along the undulator length; are powered separately; allowing the field strength of the quasi-periodic poles to be adjusted. This adjustability allows the user to seek a balance between the suppression of the higher harmonics and the loss of flux in the fundamental that best suits the measurement being made.

The period length was driven by the users’ request for a high flux of photons at 23.7 keV; with minimal tuning range.

As one of the consequences; the dynamic aperture becomes very small; and only on-axis ""swap-out"" beam injection is workable. Another consequence is that the intra-beam scattering (IBS) effect and beam instability are much more severe; which limits the maximum achievable single-bunch intensity. As a result; multiple bunches with tight bunch spacing are required to reach high average beam current; which requires injection to be finished in a very short period; e.g.; during the interval between bunches. Using a multi-bend-achromat (MBA) lattice designed for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring as an example; this paper presents an on-axis injection scheme based on the fast stripline technique together with discussions on how the scheme works with different parameter settings.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/wepsm13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/wepsm13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/wepsm13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-WEPSM13,

At a 1.0-degree grazing incidence angle; the XBPM assembly was designed to withstand two inline Undulator A devices operating at 150-mA beam current; a total power of 16 kW.

In the case of an FEL operating at infrared wavelengths in an amplifier configuration the critical phase space tends to be in the longitudinal direction. Achieving high enough longitudinal phase space density directly from the electron injector system of such an FEL is difficult due to space charge effects; thus one needs to manipulate the longitudinal phase space once the beam energy reaches a sufficiently high value. However; this is fraught with problems. Longitudinal space charge and coherent synchrotron radiation can both disrupt the overall phase space; furthermore; the phase space disruption is exacerbated by the longitudinal phase space manipulation process required to achieve high peak current. To achieve and maintain good FEL performance one needs to investigate the longitudinal emittance and be able to measure it during operation preferably in a non-invasive manner. Using the electro-optical sampling (EOS) method; we plan to measure the bunch longitudinal profile of a high-energy (~120-MeV); high-power (~10kW or more FEL output power) beam.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/wepsm17_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/wepsm17.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/wepsm17_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-WEPSM17,

Emittance spoiling foils were inserted into the beam and the x-ray yield; excess charge; and beam energy loss was measured. The excess charge and x-ray yield are attributed to the beam envelope oscillations where at the minima; the field of the beam is strong enough to create secondary ionization; and at the electron oscillation maxima; the beam electrons spontaneously radiate x-rays. Large amplitude beam oscillations are expected to yield more x-rays and create more excess charge; but the results show beam head erosion strongly limits the wakefield excitation.,Funding: The work at UCLA was supported by DOE grant DE-FG02-92-ER40727 and NSF grant PHY-0936266.

LPA experiments performed to date utilize a single laser that drives the wakefield for injection and acceleration. For applications such as high-energy accelerators; LPA designs will rely on sequencing multiple acceleration stages; each driven by its own laser***. We present recent progress on the experiment staging two LPA modules at the LOASIS Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The experiment utilizes a 40 TW class laser which is split into two laser pulses. The first laser drives the first LPA module to produce an e-beam. The second laser drives the second LPA module and accelerates the e-beam from the first LPA. Excited wakefields in the second LPA module are diagnosed through spectral redshifting of the drive laser; which is an indicator of the efficiency of laser energy transfer into the plasma through the generation of coherent plasma wakefields****.; * E.

PAC2013,,THODA1,Low Energy Fusion for a Safe and Compact Neutron Source,S.C.P. Albright; R. Seviour; University of Huddersfield; Huddersfield; United Kingdom; Lund University; Lund; Sweden; Neutrons are primarily produced at large international facilities using either spallation reactions or nuclear fission. There is a demand for small scale neutron production for use at hospitals and borders for a variety of applications. Isolated fission sources and sealed tube deuterium-tritium fusors are able to provide a reliable neutron flux at small scale but are impractical due to the associated radioactivity. A beam of protons or deuterons accelerated onto a thin target will undergo a fusion reaction resulting in the emission of a quasi-monochromatic neutron beam. The total flux and energy spectrum of the neutrons produced through fusion is primarily dependent on target material; target thickness; beam energy and projectile. The use of neutrons for security screening at border crossings; ports and airports has the potential to drastically improve threat detection and contents verification.

One of the advantages conferred by using a gaseous laser and target is the potential for a fast (several Hz) repetition rate. This requires diagnostics which are not only comprehensive for a single shot; but also capable of repeated use. We consider several scintillators as candidates for an imaging diagnostic for protons accelerated to MeV energies by a CO2 laser focused on a gas jet target. We have measured the response of chromium-doped alumina (Chromox); CsI:Tl; and two polyvinyl toluene (PVT) screens to protons in the 2 – 8 MeV range using a CCD camera. We have calibrated the luminescent yield in terms of photons emitted per incident proton for each scintillator. We also discuss how light scattering and material properties affect detector resolution. Furthermore; we consider material damage and the presence of an afterglow under intense exposures.

The ERL electron beam will be interleaved with the single-pass beam bound for Rare Isotope Beam (RIB) production in the ARIEL facilities; allowing for simultaneous beam delivery to both FEL and RIB users. A superconducting RF separator will separate the beams at the exit of the linac at a frequency of 650MHz in CW mode. After a second pass through the linac; the energy recovered ERL beam will pass through the separator cavity out of phase with the deflecting fields; and at a much lower energy; before continuing to a beam dump. Using the General Particle Tracer software; three-dimensional simulations of the beam dynamics of the passing beams have been performed to determine the requirements on the SRF separator's deflecting field uniformity.

A possible extension of the beam-line will allow recirculation of the beam for an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) to operate in tandem with the RIB user program. A superconducting cavity with RF dipole geometry is being considered for separation of the ERL and RIB beams at the end of the linac to provide simultaneous beams to both the ERL and RIB programs. This contribution describes optimization studies performed on the RF dipole design to determine if this geometry will meet the requirements of the ARIEL e-linac. The resulting 650 MHz structure has compact cavity dimensions; low peak fields; and high transverse shunt impedance. Due to the large aperture beam-line and stringent requirement on preserving beam quality; extensive focus has been placed on transverse uniformity of the deflecting fields.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpba02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpba02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpba02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPBA02,

This technique has proven to be reliable and accurate for measuring the field quality of conventional multipole magnets; however; the design and construction of the rotating coils ultimately determine the accuracy of the measurement system. A different concept and implementation of a simple stretched-wire rotating coil will be described. This system utilizes a single-turn radial coil continuously rotating at a fixed angular velocity. The coil signal and a reference pulse are sampled with a 24-bit ADC. A lock-in technique or an FFT can be used to determine the harmonic content of the signal and thus calculate the main field strength and angle; multipole coefficients; and magnetic center offsets.

Some of the magnetic measurement results will be presented for local and integrated field measurements; integrated field uniformity; and integrated fields during a quench. The measured rms phase errors were typically less than two degrees. The measured change in the integrated field during an intentional quench was less than 35 G-cm.

Most coils are sandwiched inside the main IR quad apertures but a few are located on independent support tubes outside the quad collars or on interconnects between quads. Four complex external field cancel coils; b3-b6; are needed to buck non-linear fields outside the quads closest to the interaction point. In the IR crossing angle geometry the first quads have no magnetic yokes and the cancel coils’ end turn spacings must match the field falloff with increasing beam separation. SuperKEKB IR correctors have tight harmonic tolerances with allowed field deviation at the reference radius of a few gauss at each position along the coil.

Critical elements of FRIB are the dipole magnets which select the desired isotopes. Since conventional NiTi and Nb3Sn superconductors must operate at ~4.5 K; the removal of the high heat load generated in these magnets with these superconductors would be difficult.

The most effective approach to implementing the desired magnetic field is a helical solenoid (HS) channel composed of short solenoid coils arranged in a helical pattern. The HS channel along with an external solenoid allows the Bz and Bphi components along the reference orbit to be set to any desired values. To set dBphi/dr to the desired value for optimum focusing requires an additional variable.

In order to approach lowest possible temperature at S-LSR in an experiment; parameters of laser cooling should be carefully chosen by simulation. This paper mainly concerns on optimization of laser cooling parameters and prediction of possible low limit of beam temperature at S-LSR. Firstly; the adiabatic capture process of ion beam is introduced and studied. Then; different laser profile parameters are compared and an optimized value is chosen. After that; optimized solenoid field strength for 3-D coupling is proposed. At last; by choosing the parameters proposed; the lowest beam temperature achievable for S-LSR is predicted to be 10K in horizontal direction and 0.05K in longitudinal direction.,"Funding: Advanced Compact Accelerator Development project, MEXT, Japan.

An ionization cooling lattice requires a large momentum acceptance; small beta functions; an extremely large dynamic aperture; and a modeset amount of dispersion to have good performance. The latter values are a function of beam momentum. One step in understanding the lattice performance is to determine these quantities for a lattice cell being studied.

PAC2013,,THPHO23,Improvement of Digital Filter for the FNAL Booster Transverse Dampers,"University of Chicago; Chicago; Illinois; USA; N. Eddy; V.A. Lebedev; Fermilab; Batavia; USA; Fermilab Booster has a transverse damping system which independently suppresses beam instabilities in the horizontal and vertical planes. A suppression of the common mode signal is achieved by digital notch filter which is based on subtracting beam positions for two consecutive turns. Such system operates well if the orbit position changes sufficiently slow. Unfortunately it is not the case for Fermilab Booster where the entire accelerating cycle consists of about 20; 000 turns and successful transition crossing requires the orbit drifts up to about 10 um/turn resulting in excessive power; power amplifier saturation and loss of stability. To suppress this effect we suggest an improvement to the digital filter which can take into account fast orbit changes by using bunch positions of a few previous turns. To take into account the orbit change up to N-th order polynomial in time the system requires (N + 3) turns of ""prehistory"". In the case of sufficiently small gain the damping rate and the optimal digital filter coefficients are obtained analytically. Numerical simulations verify analytical theory for the small gain and predict a system performance with gain increase.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpho23_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpho23.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpho23_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPHO23,

The targeted application is the time-delayed; trigger synchronous waveform generation. The method can be implemented on a single FPGA; which drives an ADC. The phase-jitter between a trigger signal fed to the FPGA and the generated single sine waveform is less than 90 ps RMS and 275 ps peak-to-peak. The response time of the wave form generator is 50 ns. The waveform generator was designed for the use in the “Barrier-Bucket” system of the SIS100 synchrotron at the new Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt; Germany. The BB-system will be deployed in the pre-compression stage after the acceleration process to compress the accelerated particles to 1/3 of the synchrotron circumference. This will be done by generating two moving single sine waves synchronously to the revolution trigger of the synchrotron. To compress the beam with a minimal longitudinal emittance blow-up the phase-shifting has to be performed adiabatically. For SIS100 this means that the moving step size should be less than 1 ns. The amplitude and the offset of each sine wave can also be manipulated in real time.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpma01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpma01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpma01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPMA01,

Both the added jitter and the long-term stability criteria need to be in the range of a few femtoseconds. In order to meet these requirements the existing Libera Sync CW transfer system has been redesigned. All of the aspects of the system design have been revisited and improved; from new measuring methods and better evaluation of components to careful pre-design testing and simulation. New fiber link topology; new approaches in thermal stabilization; improved power supply distribution and interconnection of carefully selected electrical and state-of-the-art optical components led to a significant reduction in added jitter and excellent long-term stability of the system. Measurements repeatedly show the jitter performance to be below 6 fs; integrated over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 10 MHz.

Initially; the scraper was meant only to be a diagnostic; high-density; short-radiation-length material used in the device was intended to stop halo; not the full beam. Damage to this device was recently discovered; and as a result; we began an effort to model and improve the scraper. Modeling with elegant provides loss distributions for several scenarios such as muting one or both rf systems in combination with firing injection kickers. The loss distributions are used as input to a MARS model of the scraper. Beam dumps from 100 mA dissipates a total of 2600 J. Most of this energy is not deposited locally; however; depending on the geometry and physical make-up; sufficient power density exists to damage the device on beam-facing surfaces. Testing is currently planned to examine the suitability of different beam-facing materials. Because of non-local energy deposition; we are evaluating the secondary role for this scraper as a spoiler rather than a beam dump.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpma05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpma05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpma05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPMA05,

The optical density of the films was increased linearly with the particle fluence of the beam in a low-fluence region. The linear-response range of the fluence was strongly dependent on ion species as well as on the film type. By analyzing the film response to absorbed dose with linear energy transfer; it was found that the sensitivity of the film was decreased for heavy-ion beams. An approximate formula was given for the practical fluence range of the Gafchromic film HD-810 on an arbitrary ion beam. The present technique with the use of the two types of Gafchromic films enables us to measure the intensity distribution of a large-area ion beam handily in a wide fluence range.

This distribution was sampled and used as a realistic proton source in a simulation through the Gabor lens system published at IPAC’13; scaled down to 4 MeV to fit the radiobiology experiment requirements.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpsm12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpsm12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpsm12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPSM12,

Optimising the mechanism requires tailored gas jet density profiles. Therefore; high density gas profiles have been investigated and characterised using different types of nozzles: sonic; supersonic; slit and supersonic slit. Gas jet profile optimisation was examined using nozzles of different diameters while varying gas pressure between 0 and 100 bar and valve opening duration. Gas jets produced by the nozzles were characterised using an optical probe laser. The gas jet density profile was measured through interferometry which was captured using a CCD camera. A second camera was used to record the Rayleigh scattering from the laser to confirm the presence clustering in nitrogen at high pressures.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpsm13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpsm13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpsm13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPSM13,

The medical CyberKnife is essentially an X-band linac; which is attached to a robotic arm for precise cancer treatment. The X-band linac has considerable advantages in cancer treatment over C-band or other RF linacs; partly due to its compact size and light weight. These qualities make the X-band linac easier to attach to a robotic arm; thus making it more maneuver- able. Other advantages include a higher accelerating gradient and a higher shunt impedance. Since high mobility is necessary for precise cancer treatment; the compact X-band RF linac was selected for the CyberKnife project. This paper describes detailed design processes of the X-band linac structure; which was done with 2D SUPERFISH and 3D CST MICROWAVE STUDIO (CST MWS) electromagnetic simulation programs.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpsm16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpsm16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpsm16_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPSM16,

The simulation results show that such a driver can supply about 300-kA peak current with about 70-ns rise time (10-90%). However; simulations also show that the negative reflective wave is formed; which can cause the destruction of the ISIS ICD’s pulse forming line (PFL). Particular attention was taken to simulate the effect of misfire of one of the PFLs. To reduce the amplitude of this destructive wave; high power damping resistors should be placed after the output of each PFL. This would result in the maximum current achievable by this driver to be limited to about 200-kA peak value.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/talks/thpsm21_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/papers/thpsm21.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/PAC2013/posters/thpsm21_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-PAC2013-THPSM21,

UMER uses scaled electron beams at nonrelativistic energies (10 keV) to inexpensively access the intense space charge dynamics directly relevant to low-energy hadron and ion beams; in both rings and linacs. In UMER; space charge tune depressions at injection are adjustable in the range of 0.14 - 0.8; enabling scaled examination of a wide range of phenomena.

These requirements impose challenges and limits in the design of the feedback channel. We present experimental measurements taken from CERN SPS machine development studies with an intra-bunch feedback channel prototype. The performance of a 3.2 GS/s digital processing system is evaluated; quantifying the effect of noise and limits of the feedback channel in the bunch stability as well as transient and steady state motion of the bunch. The controllers implemented are general purpose 16 tap FIR filters and the impact on the bunch stability of controller parameters are analyzed and quantified.

The effect of momentum dispersion on the laser-cooling process is investigated for efficient transverse cooling through tapered cooling and resonant coupling. The indirect transverse cooling force is dependent on the displacement of the laser axis and laser detuning as well as on dispersion. A string-like crystalline state of the beam can be attained at low line density by means of three-dimensional (3D) cooling.
