        "the complete system includes the liquid helium refrigerator",
        "high power microwave source",
        "radiation shielding and licensing from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This integrated system enables a company or university research group to quickly and inexpensively use the electron beam for a number of applications",
        "including high-power x-ray sources",
        "production of medical radioisotopes",
        "and high-power free-electron lasers. Superconducting technology allows the linac to operate continuously with higher average beam intensity (current) than any other type of accelerator (cyclotron",
        "copper linac",
        "etc.). Linacs with beam energy of 0.5 to 50 MeV and average beam power of 1 W to 1 MW are under development",
        "and two integrated helium refrigerator models have been developed with leading experts in the cryogenic industry. This contribution will discuss these integrated accelerator systems."
