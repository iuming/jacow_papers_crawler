        "0.2 μm RMS normalized transverse emittance",
        "and 0.15% RMS slice energy spread. These requirements place significant constraints upon the use of techniques",
        "such as laser heaters",
        "which have enabled other X-FELs to reach their design goals. In this paper",
        "we present the current baseline design and performance of the MaRIE 1.0 linac",
        "highlight current and anticipated challenges and describe potential alternate approaches for meeting our design performance goals."

        "Many synchrotron radiation facilities are studying lattice upgrades in order to lower the natural emittance and hence increase the radiation brightness. While large circumference rings are favoured in reaching ultra small emittance",
        "recent advances in design and optimisation tools allow also medium size ring to reach emittances down to the 100s pm region with workeable lattices. Diamond is investigating a novel design whereby low emittance is conjugated with doubling of the capacity of the ring",
        "based on a double double bend achromat (DDBA) cell. Plans for the installation of two low emittance cells will be presented. These will serve as prototype for a full phased upgrade of the storage ring."
