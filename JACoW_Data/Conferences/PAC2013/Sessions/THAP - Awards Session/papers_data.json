        "In this presentation I will report the investigation of superconducting properties of niobium samples via application of the muon spin rotation/relaxation (muSR) technique. We employ for the first time the muSR technique to study samples that are cutout from large and small grain 1.3 GHz radio frequency (RF) single cell niobium cavities. The RF test of these cavities was accompanied by full temperature mapping to characterize the RF losses in each of the samples. An interesting correlation is found between high field RF losses and field dependence of the sample magnetic volume fraction measured via muSR",
        "suggesting an important role of magnetic flux motion and surface pinning in the high RF field cavity losses."
