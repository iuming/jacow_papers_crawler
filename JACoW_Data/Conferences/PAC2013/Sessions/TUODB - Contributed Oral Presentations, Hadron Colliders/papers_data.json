The knowledge of the details of the initial 6D phase-space distribution is very important for simulation. We have charactered the beam transversal 4D distribution in the experiment and then used this initial beam parameters to simulate the beam dynamics.",

        "injecting at higher energy (160 MeV) and making use of the modern charge-exchange injection principle. Due to the age of Linac2 and to a delicate vacuum situation the risk of a serious Linac2 breakdown has to be considered. Therefore it is necessary to study if the PSB could produce beams useful for the LHC and other experiments injecting a Linac4 proton beam at 50 MeV with much lower average current compared to Linac2 and without the need for a long installation of the 160 MeV H− injection hardware. Benchmarking of the PSB injection model with the existing injection system with Linac2 using the ORBIT code has been done for a LHC-type beam and then the injection model was used to estimate the brightness for LHC-type beams that could potentially be reached in one PSB ring with the injection of a Linac4 proton beam at 50 MeV."

I will present sensitivity plots that indicated that this approach can provide well over 5 σ confirmation or rejection of the LSND/MinBooNE results and can be used to perform neutrino interaction measurements of unprecedented precision. The unique ν beam available at the nuSTORM facility has the potential to be transformational in our approach to ν interaction physics",
