        "and aims for initial operation at 1.5 MW in 2019 with 5 MW capacity installed for 2023. Design considerations including the work done to find the minimum cost for preserved beam quality at low beam loss will be discussed. This will include a discussions on lessons learnt from SNS regarding e.g. superconducting RF performance and RF power sources. The design and construction plans and status will be described including a description of how in-kind and contingency will be managed."
