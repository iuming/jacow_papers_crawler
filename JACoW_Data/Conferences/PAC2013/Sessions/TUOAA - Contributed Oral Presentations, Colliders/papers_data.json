        "RHIC operations with heavy ion beams at energies below 10 GeV/nucleon are motivated by a search for the QCD Critical Point. An electron cooler is proposed as a means to increase RHIC luminosity for collider operations at these low energies. The electron cooling system should be able to deliver an electron beam of adequate quality over a wide range of electron beam energies (0.9-5 MeV). It also should provide optimum 3-D cooling for both hadron beams in the collider. A method based on bunched electron beam",
        "which is also a natural approach for high-energy electron cooling",
        "is being developed. In this paper",
        "we describe the requirements for this system",
        "its design aspects",
        "as well as the associated challenges."
