The implementation uses existing hardware to periodically excite a single bunch in the beam and leverages off of improved precision and deterministic data delivery from the RHIC beam position monitors operating in turn-by-turn mode. The beam response to the external excitations was observed to decohere on a relatively short time scale so allowing near-simultaneous data acquisition in the horizontal and vertical planes. The excitations and acquisitions are carefully timed to allow coexistence with normal ramp orbit feedback operating at a 1 Hz rate. Respecting the limitations of the data transfer times",

The objectives aimed for are the number of muons captured into a stable bunches and their transverse and longitudinal emittances. These objectives are constrained by the momentum and dynamic acceptance of the subsequent acceleration systems in addition to the overall cost. A multi-objective global evolutionary algorithm is employed to address such a challenge. In this study a statement of optimization strategy is discussed along with preliminary results of the optimization."
