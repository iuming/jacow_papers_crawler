        "In recent studies a metallic pipe with small corrugations has been considered for two applications: as a beam-based method of generating pulses of terahertz radiation",
        "and for simply and cheaply removing unwanted energy chirp in linac-based X-ray FEL's. With a pipe of length ~10 cm and aperture ~1 mm",
        "narrow-band",
        "multi-cycle pulses of radiation can be generated",
        "with frequency ~1 THz and pulse energy of a few mJ. In linac-based FEL's",
        "after the final bunch compressor",
        "the electron bunch typically is left with an energy chirp. An inexpensive way for dechirping is to have the beam pass through ~10 m of corrugated pipe. This report presents and analyzes the performance of the corrugated structure for both mentioned purposes. Experimental tests are also discussed."
