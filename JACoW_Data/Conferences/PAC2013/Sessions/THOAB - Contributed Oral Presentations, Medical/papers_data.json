        "D-Pace has developed a specialized high-power beamline for transporting a 20 mA 2.5 MeV CW proton beam for a BNCT (Boron Neutron Capture Therapy) application. The 2 m horizontal by 4 m vertical layout transports the space-charge dominated beam with less than 1% beam-spill using two sets of 10 T/m quadrupole doublets",

      "abstract": "Carbon cancer radiation therapy has clear advantages with respect to the other radiation therapy treatments. Cost of the ion cancer therapy is dominated by the delivery systems. An new design of the superconducting Non-Scaling FFAG (NS-FFAG) carbon isocentric gantry is presented. The magnet size and weight is dramatically smaller with respect to other gantries in cancer therapy treatment. The weight of the transport elements of the carbon isocentric gantry is estimated to be 1.5 tons to be compared to the 130 tons weight of the top-notch Heidelberg facility gantry.",
