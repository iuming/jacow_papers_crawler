        "With the increased radioactive beam capabilities brought by new CARIBU (Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade) in ATLAS facility",
        "highest charge breeder efficiency of ECR is desired. Experimental study shows that the best efficiency could be achieved when high voltages (up to 50KV) of two platforms (CARIBU and ECR) are only different within less than 1V. We have developed a system with some innovative ideas implemented to measure the required tiny voltage difference ratio (~0.002%) precisely and to protect the system too. High voltage (HV) filter is designed to protect it from severe HV sparks and multiple level of relays with high precision medium HV divider are used to protect it from possible power supply failure. Homemade HV divider is used for rough measurement and control. Measurement results are converted to optical signals and then used to control power supplies to achieve the desired platform voltages. The system has been partially tested and will be used in the future."

        "A new inflight radioactive ion separator (AIRIS) is being designed for the ATLAS facility at Argonne. AIRIS will be used to separate and produce secondary radioactive beams from the interaction of ATLAS primary beams in a production target. AIRIS will be at least 10 times more efficient than the existing radioactive beam capability. We have made significant progress in the design and simulations of AIRIS including full 3D models of all the elements to consider their real dimensions and produce realistic 3D fields. The resolving power of the device has been studied for several reaction cases using realistic cross sections and kinematics. In addition to the magnetic separation of the device",
        "a RF sweeper is being designed to take advantage of the time separation of the different beams and reject the primary beam tail and other potential contaminants in order to produce higher purity secondary beams. The latest AIRIS design and simulation results will be presented and discussed."

        "where H− ions are also accelerated. This dual-species operation of the linac imposes constraints on the injectors",
        "resulting in particular requirements on the transverse and longitudinal emittances and phase-space distributions of the beam from the RFQ proton injector. Good measurements of these quantities are therefore required during the testing phase of the RFQ injector. In this paper we describe the measurements to be made and plans for the systems for carrying out the measurements."

      "abstract": "An overmoded hybrid Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structure used as an accelerator cavity has been theoretically designed. The PBG structure consists of a triangular lattice of dielectric (sapphire) and metallic rods. The birefringence of the sapphire affects the PBG eigenmodes and must be taken into account. The PBG cavity formed by rods in between two copper plates will be operated in a TM02 mode at 17 GHz. Arrangement of the rods for higher-order-mode (HOM) damping demonstrates high frequency selectivity. Comparison with a disk-loaded waveguide (DLW) cavity gives a perspective of the dielectric PBG structure operated at an accelerating gradient of 100 MV/m. Cold test of a single hybrid PBG cell presents a high-Q resonance at 17 GHz. A standing-wave (SW) hybrid PBG structure will be tested in TM02 mode at 17 GHz.",

The facility consists of five main components: an electron­beam ion trap (EBIT) charge breeder",

The final section",
