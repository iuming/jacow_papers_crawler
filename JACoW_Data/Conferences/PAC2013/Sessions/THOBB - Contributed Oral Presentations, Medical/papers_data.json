        "For 50 years patients have been treated with proton therapy. It began in national laboratories and continued to the next generation of hospital based facilities built by commercial vendors. Proton therapy",
        "while becoming more available still has room for growth. Why hasn't it become more widespread? Issues of cost and optimization of beam parameters have led to questions about the cost effectiveness of this modality and the requirements for more clinical trials. This talk will consider some of the issues that are important for the requirements of a 3rd generation of proton therapy systems."

        "and there is constant development of new drugs and isotopes. However the main production method for Tc-99m",
        "is currently in research reactors and is at risk due to scheduled and unscheduled shut downs. Therefore",
        "a low cost an alternative accelerator-based system could provide many advantages. Various compact low energy proton machines are being proposed to enable cheap and accessible production: here we present a discussion of potential new SPECT isotopes and simulations of suitable targets for their manufacture."
