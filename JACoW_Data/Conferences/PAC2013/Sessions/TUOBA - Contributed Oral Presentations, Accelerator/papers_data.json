        "as well as transverse beam profile measurements taken at Cornell's high-brightness ERL photoinjector",
        "for a beam energy of 4 MeV and currents up to 35 mA."

        "a SLAC-led task force was initiated by HEP to develop more fully the information from the original AfAF Symposium. Subsequently",
        "a DOE-HEP concept (coordinated with the other cognizant Office of Science program offices) was developed for accelerator R&D stewardship. Here we describe the evolution of the stewardship task starting from its origins in the ongoing accelerator R&D program",
        "the mission of the new program",
        "and initial steps being taken to implement it. Several initiatives are currently being considered to launch the program",
        "and these will be indicated. Involvement of the accelerator community in developing ideas for future stewardship activities will be crucial to the ultimate success of the program."
