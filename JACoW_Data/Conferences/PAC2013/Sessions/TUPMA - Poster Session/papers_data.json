        "We have developed a compact X-ray source via inverse Compton scattering (ICS) between multi-bunch electron beam and a laser pulse stacked in an optical cavity at Laser Undulator Compact X-ray (LUCX) accelerator in KEK. Since the autumn of 2011",
        "we have begun X-ray imaging test. In the beginning",
        "it had taken two hours to get an X-ray image because of low intensity of X-ray with 104 photons/pulse. To get a clear X-ray image in a shorter period of times",
        "we have upgraded the accelerator",
        "which consists of a 3.6 cell photo-cathode rf-gun",
        "a 12cell standing wave accelerating structure and a 4-mirror planar optical cavity. The target intensity of an electron beam is 500nC/train with 1000 bunches at 30 MeV. The one of laser pulse is also 6mJ/pulse. The expected number of X-ray is 1.7x107 photons/train with 10% bandwidth. We have already started the multi-bunch beam generation and X-ray imaging test after upgrade. The accelerator produces 24 MeV beam with the total charge of 180nC in 150 bunches per pulse. The aging process is also continued to increase energy and intensity. We will report the results of the beam test and future plan of the development of a compact X-ray source at LUCX."

        "The ultralow emittance lattice of the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring has a large negative natural chromaticity. This has to be corrected to positive values to prevent head-tail instabilities. On the other hand",
        "high linear chromaticity can lead to a large tune footprint which limits Touschek lifetime. Therefore",
        "the linear chromaticity is corrected to +1 in both planes with sextupoles while octupoles are used to further reduce the tune footprint. Studies indicate this design leads to threshold currents for resistive wall and transverse mode coupling instabilities beyond what is expected during regular user operation. However",
        "since these are only preliminary studies based on approximations",
        "the possibility of instability issues during commissioning needs to be considered. A short term solution is to operate the storage ring at a higher chromaticity. This paper describes the developed high-chromaticity optics for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring. It focuses on reduction of chromatic and amplitude-dependent tune shifts to maximize dynamic aperture and Touschek lifetime. A comparison between the performance of the new high-chromaticity optics and the design optics is also presented."

        "The University of Wisconsin has completed fabrication and commissioning of a low frequency (199.6 MHz) superconducting electron gun based on a quarter wave resonator (QWR) cavity. Its concept was optimized to be the source for a CW free electron laser facility. The gun design includes active tuning and a high temperature superconducting solenoid. We will report on the status of the Wisconsin SRF electron gun program",

      "abstract": "The performance of the Wisconsin 200-MHz SRF electron gun is simulated for several values of the RF gradient. Bunches with charge of 200 pC are modeled for the case where emittance compensation is completed during post-acceleration to 85 MeV in a TESLA module. We first perform simulations in which the initial bunch radius is optimal for the design gradient of 41 MV/m. We then optimize the radius as a function of RF gradient to improve the performance for low gradients.",
