      "abstract": "This presentation should cover the perspectives of cyclotrons for protons to Carbon 12 hadron therapy. Presently the majority of proton facilities use cyclotrons. However only synchrotrons are used for heavier ions. What is the status of cyclotron development for heavier particles? Isochronous versus synchrocyclotrons? Raster scanning? Comparison with conventional synchrotrons?",
