        "We have been studying on a system to measure ultra-short electron beam bunch length at Waseda University. We adopted the rf-deflector system which can convert the longitudinal distribution to transverse by sweeping the electron bunch. We used HFSS for designing the rf-deflector cavity and GPT for beam tracking. In order to achieve the desired magnitude of magnetic field in the rf-deflector",
        "we decided to use a 2-cells cavity of rectangular structure. Finally we optimized the design for the rf-deflector which is operating on π-mode",

        "which is 100 femt seconds bunch measurement",
        "by GPT simulations. Now we have finished manufacturing with the collaboration of High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). We could adjust resonant frequency to 2856 MHz and combine the waveguide with the rf-deflector precisely. We will integrate the rf-deflector into an S-band Cs-Te photocathode rf electron gun system in Waseda University",
        "and carry out bunch length measurement in this summer. In this conference",
        "we will report the present progresses and future plan."

The ultrashort bunch length is obtained by velocity bunching using a compact dual slot resonantly coupled linac located after an RF photoinjector. Strong focusing with a solenoid is required to enhance the radiation generation. Filters are used to reconstruct coherent transition radiation spectrum. The transverse and longitudinal form factors are also studied with simulation."

Its role is to maintain the resonant frequency by exploiting the 16.5ppm/°C thermal expansion of the copper. Temperature is regulated by mixing chilled low conductivity water (LCW) with circulating water between the cavity and gun skid located outside the radiation cave. A fine pneumatic actuated valve controls the chilled water flow and in turn is controlled by a feedforward/feedback regulation algorithm. This paper will describe the water temperature control system used to stabilize the tuning frequency of the RF Gun."

The LEBT uses 2 magnetic solenoids with enough drift space between them to accommodate diagnostics and a beam deflector. The LEBT is designed to work over a range of space-charge neutralized currents and emittances. The LEBT is optimized in the sense that it minimizes the beam size in both solenoids for a point design of a given neutralized current and emittance. Special attention has been given to estimating emittance growth due to solenoid aberrations. Examples of source-to-RFQ matching and emittance growth (due to both non-linear space charge and solenoid aberrations) are presented over a range of currents and emittances about the design point. A preliminary mechanical layout drawing will also be presented."

The efficiency of positive ion generation in plasma has been improved up to ~90 mA/cm2 per 1 kW of RF power at 13.56 MHz. For first cesiation was used a heating of the cesium chromate cartridges by CW RF discharge. A small oven for cesium compounds and alloys decomposition by heating was developed and tested. After cesiation a current of negative ions to the collector was increased from 0.5 mA to 10 mA with RF power ~ 1.5 kW in the plasma and longitudinal magnetic field Bl~250 Gauss. With increase of a longitudinal magnetic field the collector current can be increased up to 7 times. A stable long time generation of H− beam without degradation was demonstrated in RF discharge with AlN discharge chamber.",

      "abstract": "One potential problem with the operation of photo emission electron guns is the potential for charge to accumulate on the emission surface depending on how the biasing voltage is applied to the gun. If the voltage is applied away from the emission surface there is the potential for charge to accumulate on the emission surface since not all electrons will necessarily be emitted. This charge accumulation may affect the gun operation by reducing the accelerating field in the gun. We report on simulations that demonstrate this potential issue as well as simulations that test a potential solution where a secondary voltage is applied periodically to clear the accumulated charge.",
