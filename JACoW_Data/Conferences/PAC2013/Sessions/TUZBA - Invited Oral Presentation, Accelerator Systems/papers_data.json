        "Over the last 20 years a migration has taken place from analog signal processing to digital signal processing for RF cavity control. The motivation behind the new generation of RF controls is twofold. Some of it can be attributed to the challenging RF control requirements needed for the higher performing cavities and accelerators. Second is the explosive growth of digital communication technology and its applicability to RF cavity control. The flexibility and performance of digital controls has allowed these new accelerators (especially light sources) to meet their requirements. This presentation reviews the historical advances of the technology and the world-wide progress in digital RF system control for linacs",
