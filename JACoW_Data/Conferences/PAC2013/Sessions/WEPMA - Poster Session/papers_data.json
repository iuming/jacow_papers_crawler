Simulations of the same structure with different lengths were performed to verify that the design length produced the best separation of the operating mode from neighbouring modes.

The PPM klystron will require a substantially reduced volume while maintaining the current operating parameters.

The determination of this parameter will dictate the electron beam-interaction circuit and the required electron gun - collector design. Detailed parameters",

A drift tube supported by a stem in the cavity can form two gaps that can divide the required gap voltage to a half per each gap. Lower peak field can be realized since this double gap cavity can enhance the particle transit time factor. 3D simulation is utilized to address the analysis of non-axisymmetric structure. An Aluminum scaled model is built and tested at low power. The measured results are in good agreement with simulations."

This leads to a considerable increase in power requirements. We introduce an acceleration scheme known as harmonic ratcheting which can be used to reduce the cavity frequency range when accelerating an ion beam in a synchrotron. This scheme addresses the needs of high rep. rate machines for applications such as radiation therapy in which low beam intensity is needed. We demonstrate with simulations the type of ramps achievable using this technique and consider its advantages over h=1 acceleration schemes."
