The RF deflector operates in a TM110-like mode",

This short range requires the internal structure to confine water on the wall and high-pressure water flow. Some detailed thermo-mechanical and thermo-fluid analysis has been done using ANSYS and other codes. In addition",

We have calibrated the luminescent yield in terms of photons emitted per incident proton for each scintillator. We also discuss how light scattering and material properties affect detector resolution. Furthermore",

        "the NEA diamond will emit cold electrons into vacuum with a large gain. We had tested and reported the performance of the diamond amplifier in our DC system somewhere else. The best amplification achieved so far was above 170. Next step of the experiment is to test the diamond amplifier in the 112 MHz superconducting RF electron gun. In this report we describe the design and simulations of the diamond amplifier to be tested in our SRF gun",

        "the gun is suitable for testing various types of photocathodes thanks to its specially designed cathode holder. In recent RF tests of the gun at 4 K",
        "the accelerating voltage reached 0.9 MV CW and more than 1 MV in pulsed mode. During this testing",
        "we observed several multipacting barriers at low electromagnetic field levels. Since the final setup of the gun will be different from the cool down test configuration",
        "we want to understand the exact location of the multipacting sites. We used Track3P to simulate multipacting. The results show several resonant trajectories that might be responsible for the observed barriers",
