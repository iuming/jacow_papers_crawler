        "by choosing the parameters proposed",
        "the lowest beam temperature achievable for S-LSR is predicted to be 10K in horizontal direction and 0.05K in longitudinal direction."

The second is a novel linear channel with either wedge or block absorbers for cooling and tilted solenoids for emittance exchange. The latter scheme addresses several of the engineering challenges of a conventional Guggenheim channel. We incorporate both schemes into a new lattice design for a muon collider",

A suppression of the common mode signal is achieved by digital notch filter which is based on subtracting beam positions for two consecutive turns. Such system operates well if the orbit position changes sufficiently slow. Unfortunately it is not the case for Fermilab Booster where the entire accelerating cycle consists of about 20",
        "000 turns and successful transition crossing requires the orbit drifts up to about 10 um/turn resulting in excessive power",
        "power amplifier saturation and loss of stability. To suppress this effect we suggest an improvement to the digital filter which can take into account fast orbit changes by using bunch positions of a few previous turns. To take into account the orbit change up to N-th order polynomial in time the system requires (N + 3) turns of \"prehistory\". In the case of sufficiently small gain the damping rate and the optimal digital filter coefficients are obtained analytically. Numerical simulations verify analytical theory for the small gain and predict a system performance with gain increase."
