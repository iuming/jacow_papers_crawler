        "the ECR sources produce numerous species that must be collimated to one or two target species with minimal degradation to beam quality. The first stage of this collimation is accomplished in a tight 90 degree dipole bend with a wide aperture and slanted pole faces to provide additional focusing. We report on simulations for the high-rigidity U ion operation using linked 2D xy-slice runs in the straight section upstream of the bend and steady-state 3D simulations in the dipole bend comparing simulations with both ideal (sector) and full 3D field maps of the dipole magnet. Issues associated with placing a 3D dipole field with fringe on a bent simulation coordinate system are addressed. Placement of the dipole bend is optimized consistent with the 3D field and is found to closely correspond to the ideal field center. Minimal problems are found (small centroid shift and distribution distortions) due to 3D space-charge effects in the species separation within the bend when using simple fractional neutralization factors."

        "during the so called Phase II until the technical stop of LHC and its injector chain (LS2) in 2019. The external electron beam of 0.1 to 1nC charge per bunch will be generated using an S-band photo injector with a high QE semiconducting cathode. A booster linac was designed to allow variable electron energy for the plasma experiments from 16 to 20 MeV. For an RF gun and booster system",
        "emittance control can be highlighted as a challenging transmission task. Once the beam emittance is compensated at the gun exit and the beam is delivered to the booster with an optimum beam envelope",
        "fringing fields and imperfections in the linac become critical for preserving the injection emittance. This paper summarises the rf design studies in order to preserve the initial beam emittance at the entrance of the linac and alternative mitigation schemes in case of emittance growth."

        "a high power electron beam is used to produce radioactive ion beams via photo-fission. The electron beam is accelerated in a superconducting linac up to 50 MeV. The electron source provides electron bunches with charge up to 16 pC at a repetition frequency of 650 MHz leading to an average current of 10 mA . The kinetic energy of the electrons has been chosen to be 300 keV to allow direct injection into an accelerator cavity. The main components of the source are a gridded dispenser cathode (CPI 'Y845) in an SF6 filled vessel and an in-air HV power supply. The beam is bunched by applying DC and RF fields to the grid. Unique features of the gun are its cathode/anode geometry to reduce field emission",
        "and transmission of RF modulation via a dielectric (ceramic) waveguide through the SF6. The latter obviates the need for an HV platform inside the vessel to carry the RF generator and results in a significantly smaller/simpler vessel. The source has been installed and first tests with accelerated beams have been performed. Measurements of the beam properties and results from the commissioning of the source will be presented."

The high-purity copper cavity was fabricated at KEK with ultraprecision machining and diffusion bonding technique. The low level RF properties of the cavity measured at room temperature have been in good agreement with the predictions based on the CST Studio calculation. Preparations for the 20-K cooling tests of the cavity are underway in KEK and Nihon University. The design of the improved cavity and the results of the cold test at low temperature will be discussed."

The material is robust and the typical operational lifetime is more than several months. It is also vital against the high intensity beam extraction.
