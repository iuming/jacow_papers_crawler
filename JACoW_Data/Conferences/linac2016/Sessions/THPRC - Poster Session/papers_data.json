        "The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) energy upgrade from 6 GeV to 12 GeV includes the installation of four new 748.5 MHz normal conducting deflecting cavities in the 5th pass extraction region. The RF system employs two digital LLRF systems controlling four normal conducting cavities in a vector sum setting. Cavity tune information of the individual cavities is obtained using a multiplexing scheme of the forward and reflected RF signals. Water skids equipped with heaters and valves are used to control resonance. A new FPGA-based hardware and EPICS-based predictive control algorithm has been developed to support reliable operation of the beam extraction process. This paper presents the architecture design of the existing hardware and software as well as a plan to develop a model predictive control system."
