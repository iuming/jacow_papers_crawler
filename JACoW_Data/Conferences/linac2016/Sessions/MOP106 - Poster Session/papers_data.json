      "abstract": "Energy recovery linacs can be seen as a hybrid between a linear and a circular accelerator. It has been shown in the past that an appropriate choice of the longitudinal working point can significantly improve the energy stability of a recirculating linac. In this contribution we will expand the concept of energy recovery linacs and investigate the energy spread of the beam as well as the recovery efficiency stability which can be a more demanding quantity in a high current ERL. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "We present the design of a novel photonic band gap (PBG) accelerating structure with elliptical rods and improved wakefields suppression. It has been long recognized that PBG structures have great potential in reducing long-range wakefields in accelerators. The first ever demonstration of acceleration in room-temperature PBG structures was conducted at MIT in 2005. The experimental characterization of the wakefield spectrum in a beam test was performed at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility in 2015",
        "and the superior wakefield suppression properties of the PBG structure were demonstrated. In 2013 the team from MIT and SLAC demonstrated that the X-band PBG structures with elliptical rods have reduced breakdown rate compared to PBG structures with round rods",
        "presumably due to the reduced surface magnetic fields. However",
        "the structure with elliptical rods designed by MIT confined the dipole higher order mode in addition to the accelerating mode and thus did not have superior wakefield suppression properties. We demonstrate that PBG resonators can be designed with 40% smaller peak surface magnetic fields while preserving and even improving their wakefield suppression properties as compared to the structure with round rods. The design of the new structure is presented. The structure will be fabricated",
        "tuned",
        "and tested for high gradients and for wakefield suppression."

The accelerator is a low energy continuous wave (CW) recirculating electron linac for particle physics experiments. MESA will be operated in two different modes serving mainly two experiments: the first is the external beam (EB) mode",
        "where the beam is dumped after being used with the external fixed target experiment P2",
        "whose goal is the measurement of the weak mixing angle with highest accuracy. The required beam current for P2 is 150 μA with polarized electrons at 155 MeV. In the second operation mode MESA will be run as an energy recovery linac (ERL). The experiment served in this mode is a (pseudo) internal fixed target experiment named MAGIX. It demands an unpolarized beam of 1 mA at 105 MeV. In a later construction stage of MESA the achievable beam current in ERL-mode shall be upgraded to 10 mA. Within this contribution an overview of the MESA project will be given highlighting the latest accelerator layout and the challenges of operation with high density internal gas targets.",

        "and these patterns can change from macropulse to macropulse. Irregular pulse structures create a challenge to optimizing the design of the RF and cryogenic systems. General formulas for cavities with beam loading can overestimate the power required for our irregular beam macropulse. The differing beam energy variations allowed for the XFEL and eRad micropulses produce cavity voltage control requirements that also vary within the macropulse. The RF pulse driving the cavities can be tailored to meet the needs of that particular beam macropulse because the macropulse structure is known before the pulse starts. We will derive a toolkit that can be used to determine the required RF power waveforms for arbitrary macropulse structures. We will also examine how the irregular RF power waveforms can impact RF and cryogenic system cost tradeoffs."
