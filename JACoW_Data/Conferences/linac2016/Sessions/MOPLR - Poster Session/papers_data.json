Its designated design energy of 130 MeV wasn't reached yet due to a lower quality factor of the 3 GHz cavities and thus a higher dissipated power to the helium bath. To increase the maximum achievable energy in cw operation from approx. 85 MeV to the design value of 130 MeV the main accelerator will be passed a fourth time. In this configuration the accelerating gradients of the cavities can be lowered",
        "so that the resulting dissipated power will match the available cooling power of the cryo plant. To realize an additional main linac pass a new recirculation beam line is needed. The most crucial points are the design of the separation dipole and its mirrored version as well as a properly calculated lattice. For the implementation of a new recirculation beam line the existing sections must be adapted to fit the new boundary conditions. This contribution will present some aspects of the design and will report on the actual status of this project."

The 400 Hz gun will be installed in the VELA beamline for detailed high power RF and beam commissioning in the VELA beam diagnostics suite. As the 400 Hz gun is equipped with an interchangeable photocathode it is possible to investigate different metal photocathodes and select the one providing minimal beam emittance at highest quantum efficiency.

The two-step charging system for the pulse forming network (PFN) is upgraded by adding a high impedance resonant charging line in parallel with the main line. The charging step of the PFN voltage is reduced considerably near the setting value by switching the main resonance line off so that the charging current flows only through the high impedance line. The second model of the solid-state switch is developed using 60 static-induction thyristors",

The air-cooling capacity is reinforced so that repetition rate is increased from 10 pps for the first model to 60 pps. The fluctuation and accuracy of the klystron voltage are measured to be 7.8×10-6 or 7.8 ppm for the upgraded klystron modulator using a differential amplifier with much higher sensitivity than one used in the previous measurement."

It has been used for baking out several niobium superconducting RF cavities at 850°C with proven success*. Current research for improving the performance of SRF cavities is focused on nitrogen treatment of such cavities. Nitrogen doping of SRF cavtities results in an up to four times higher quality-factor as compared to untreated cavities**. At higher temperatures between 1300°C and 1700°C the so-called delta-phase of NbN forms",

The UHV-furnace at the S-DALINAC offers the possibility to treat niobium samples at considerably higher temperatures than what has been done up to now in order to study the effect of delta-phase NbN and N-doping on superconducting properties. The furnace has been refurbished and recommissioned to realize research on nitrogen treatment of niobium samples. We will report on our first experiences with operating the upgraded furnace.",

The cathodes were fabricated to have different surface areas and different distances between cathode surface and the equator. The Ninja cathode prepared with an enhanced cathode surface area was covered with a meshed shield to avoid bubble attack on the surface of the cavity cell. It has been turned out that the anode-cathode distance and the cathode area affect surface morphology of the equator. A smooth equator surface was obtained in the cases in which the cathode surface was geometrically close to the equator or instead the cathode surface area was sufficiently larger. Two 1.3 GHz ILC/Tesla type single-cell cavities VEPed with the Ninja cathodes and using optimized conditions showed good performance in vertical tests. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "Increasing energy of proton beam at LANSCE from 800 MeV to 3 GeV improves radiography resolution ~10 times. Using superconducting RF cavities with gradients ~15 MV/m after the existing linac would result in a long and expensive booster. We propose accomplishing the same with a much shorter cost-effective booster based on normal conducting high-gradient (~100 MV/m) RF accelerating structures. Such X-band high-gradient structures have been developed for electron acceleration and operate with typical RF pulse lengths below 1 us. They have never been used for protons because typical wavelengths and apertures are smaller than the proton bunch sizes. However",
        "these limitations do not restrict proton radiography (pRad) applications. A train of very short proton bunches with the same total length and charge as the original long proton bunch will create the same single radiography frame",
        "plus pRad limits contiguous trains of beam micro-pulses to below 60 ns to prevent blur in images. For a compact pRad booster at LANSCE",
        "we explore feasibility of two-stage design: a short S-band section to capture and compress the 800-MeV proton beam followed by the main high-gradient X-band linac."
