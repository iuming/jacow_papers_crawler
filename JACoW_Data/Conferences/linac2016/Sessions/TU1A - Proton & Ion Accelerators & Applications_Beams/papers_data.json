        "In recent years a lot of attention was given to developments in the field of superconducting cavities. While these cavities can save operating costs and shorten the length of linacs",
        "there are many applications and circumstances where normal conducting cavities are superior. This talk reviews some of the normal conducting linacs",
        "which have been either recently commissioned",
        "or which are currently under construction or in the design phase. Focus will be given to the choice between normal and superconducting cavities and to emerging normal conducting technologies and their applications."

        "For the past few decades",
        "nuclear research has been exclusive to large accelerator and reactor facilities. The availability of tabletop particle sources based on high intensity lasers opens venues for new research methods in nuclear physics",
        "both at large facilities and at university-scale laboratories. It has been demonstrated in many experiments that the kinetic energy of a particle radiated by a high intensity laser-plasma interaction is sufficient to induce nuclear reactions. These achievements",
        "however",
        "duplicated experimental results achieved decades ago with conventional accelerator. While often smaller and cheaper",
        "laser systems to-date have shown no technical advantage over conventional accelerators. This talk will review the state-of-the-art in laser-ion acceleration",
        "and discuss how next generation laser systems can go beyond conventional accelerator capabilities. Specifically",
        "the talk will present a novel",
        "ultrashort pulsed laser-driven neutron generator developed at U. Texas (I. Pomerantz et al.",
