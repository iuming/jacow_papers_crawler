        "BNL R&D ERL beam commissioning started in June 2014 [*]. The key components of R&D ERL are the highly damped 5-cell 704 MHz superconducting RF cavity and the high-current superconducting RF gun. The gun is equipped with a multi-alkaline photocathode insertion system. The first photocurrent from ERL SRF gun has been observed in November 2014. In June 2015 a high charge 0.5nC and 20 uA average current were demonstrated. In July 2015 gun to dump beam test started. The beam was successfully transported from the SRF gun through the injection system",
        "then through the linac to the beam dump. All ERL components have been installed. In October 2015",
        "SRF gun cavity has been found contaminated during severe cathode stalk RF conditioning. This cavity has been sent for repair and modification for later use in low-energy RHIC electron cooler (LEReC)[**]. LEReC scheduled to start commissioning in early of 2018. We present our results of BNL ERL beam commissioning",
