The tight geometry of the DBRC together with its strong optics and the high energy-spread of the beam require a careful control of the beam size along the different sections of the DBRC. One of the main contribution to beam size is the dispersion. If uncontrolled",
        "dispersion leads to fast increase of the beam size",
