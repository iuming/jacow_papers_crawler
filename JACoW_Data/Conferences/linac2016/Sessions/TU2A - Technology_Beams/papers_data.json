        "spanning a frequency range from about 100 MHz to X-band",
        "spanning duty factors from about 10-3 to CW",
        "and spanning power levels from a few kW up to hundreds of MW average. Exciting recent trends include new bunching concepts for klystrons promising a significant increase of efficiency and better power combiners paving the way to MW-class solid state power amplifiers."

        "prototyping and validating a klystron modulator compatible with the requirements based on a novel topology named SML (Stacked Multi-Level). This topology is modular and based on the utilization of High Frequency (HF) transformers. The topology allows for the usage of industrial standard power electronic components at the primary stage at full extent which can easily be placed and wired in a conventional electrical cabinet. It requires only few special components like HF transformers",
        "rectifiers and filters (i.e. passive components) to be placed in an oil tank. This arrangement allows scaling up in average and pulse power to the required levels while keeping the size",

        "efficiency and reliability of the different modules under good control. Besides the very good output pulse power quality",
        "the AC grid power quality is also remarkably high with a line current harmonic distortion below 3%",
        "a unitary power factor and an extremely reduced line voltage flicker below 0.3%. A reduced scale modulator prototype has been built and validated experimentally."

        "cavity detuning from microphonics or dynamic Lorentz Force Detuning becomes a significant factor",

In addition to the efforts to passive environmental detuning reduction (microphonics) active resonance control for the SRF cavities for next generation linear machine will be required. State of the art in the field of the SRF Cavity active resonance control and the results from the recent efforts at FNAL will be presented in this talk."

Scientific and technological highlights from the CLIC high-gradient program are presented along with on-going developments and future plans. The talk will also give an overview of the range of applications that potentially benefit from high-frequency and high-gradient accelerating technology.
