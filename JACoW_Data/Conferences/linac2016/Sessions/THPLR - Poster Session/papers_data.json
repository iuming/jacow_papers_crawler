One of such methods is to coat multi-layer thin-film superconductor on the inner surface of RF cavity where the thin film increases the RF critical field on the inner surface of the cavity.

        "Muons have been demonstrated to be great probes for imaging large and dense objects due to their excellent penetrating ability. At present there are no muon accelerators. Development of a compact system that can produce an intense beam of accelerated muons would provide unique imaging options for stockpile stewardship while delivering minimal radiation dose",
        "as well as various homeland-security and industrial applications. Our novel compact accelerator approach allows a single linac to be used to first accelerate an electron beam to 800 MeV to generate muons by interacting with a production target in a high-field solenoid magnet and then to collect and accelerate these low-energy muons to 1 GeV to be used for imaging or active interrogation. The key enabling technology is a high-gradient accelerator with large energy and angular acceptances. Our proposed solution for efficient acceleration of low-energy muons is a 0-mode linac coupled with conventional electron RF accelerating structures to provide a compact system that could deliver a controllable high-flux beam of muons with well-defined energy to allow precise radiographic inspections of complicated objects. The details of the conceptual design will be discussed."

        "Since a laser-driven dielectric accelerator (LDA) is most likely to deliver a nano-beam with a small scale device",
        "a combination of the LDA and a biological cell observation device such as a fluorescence microscope seems to be a powerful tool for radiation biology researches. The LDA consists of single or a pair of binary-blazed transmission grating. In case of normal incidence",
        "a grating constant must be the same with a laser wavelength to synchronize with the electron and an acceleration field. Although demonstration experiments have been published from SLAC and MPQ",
        "there are many problems to be solved",
        "especially in the non-relativistic energy region. A crucial problem is to make it clear whether electrons are accelerated with negligibly small wiggling or lateral shift. We are simulating at various conditions with the aid of CST-code. We also analyze an oblique incidence (OI) scheme for the efficient acceleration of slow electron. The OI-scheme enables to use the grating of larger grating constant. Adoption of the large grating constant makes it easy to fabricate the grating. Besides analytical works",
        "we are making gratings and developing an Yb-doped fiber laser for the acceleration experiment. Gratings of two different materials",
        "a glass silica and crystal silica",
        "were fabricated by the e-beam lithography technique."

It was concluded that this TM011-damping degradation was caused by cavity geometry deviation within the specified mechanical tolerances. The particular influence of different mechanical parameters was analyzed and additional RF measurements were carried out to find the most critical geometry parameters. Stability of the equator welding and regularity of chemical treatment were investigated for different cavity cells. In spite of the high fabrication rate during EXFEL cavity mass production the TM011 suppression was improved to an acceptable level."

The facility will enable multi-user capability in the Isotope Separation and ACceleration (ISAC) facility by delivering three RIBs simultaneously. Two new independent target stations will generate RIBs using a proton driver beam up to 50 kW from the 500 MeV cyclotron and an electron driver beam for photo-fission from the new superconducting e-linac in addition to the existing ISAC RIB production. The multi-user capability is enabled by a complex radioactive ion beam transport switchyard consisting entirely of electrostatic optics. This system includes two separation stages at medium and high resolution with the latter achieved by a mass separator designed for an operational resolving power of 20000 for a 3 micrometer transmitted emittance. Part of the system also includes an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) charge breeder fed by a radio frequency cooler that allows the post-acceleration of heavy masses. Beam selection downstream of the EBIS is achieved by means of a Nier type separator. The facility is in a detailed design stage and some tests",

Different types of external loads on the resonator walls predetermine the main working conditions of the SC cavities. The most important of them are very high electromagnetic fields that result in strong Lorentz forces acting on cavity walls and the pressure on cavity walls from the helium tank that also deforms the cavity shape. For the accelerators operating in pulsed regime the Lorentz forces are the dominant factor. The liquid helium vessel pressure instability even for 2K operations is the source of large microphonics and dominates for cw operation. Here we propose an innovative integrated helium vessel-cavity and stiffener design that will provide an effective passive damping minimizing df/dp ratio. Minimizing df/dp may be accomplished without an enhancement of the structure rigidity",

Since a series of external loads on the resonator walls predetermine the main working conditions of the SC cavities the detailed investigation of their mechanical properties should be conducted in parallel with the main RF design. The effects of very high electromagnetic fields that result in strong Lorentz forces and the pressure on cavity walls from the helium tank that also deforms the cavity shape",

SRF elliptical cavities for the medium energies (β=v/c is around 0.6) inherently have more flexible shape and their ultimate stiffening with a \"standard\" stiffening rings installed between resonator cells becomes problematic. The second row of the rings should enhance the overall cavity rigidity. In the paper we report the basic investigations of the cavity two-row ring stiffening using FNAL 650 MHz β=0.61 as an example. The single-cell investigation results were used as the reference to develop the ultimate scheme of the helium vessel structure to ensure the best resonator stability."

This paper describes an engineering solution with a master-slave structure adopted in FRIB. Details will be covered from system architecture to FPGA hardware platform design and from communication protocols to physical interface definition. The response time of ~9.6μS from OK/NOK inputs to mitigation outputs is reached when query method is used to poll the status. A new approach is outlined to use bi-direction loop structure for the slave chain and use streaming mode for data collection from slave to master",
