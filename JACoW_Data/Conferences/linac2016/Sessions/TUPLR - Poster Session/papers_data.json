The LCLS-II 1.3 GHz cryomodule design is based on the European XFEL pulsed-mode cryomodule design with modifications needed for CW operation. Fermilab and JLab will each assemble and test a prototype 1.3 GHz cryomodule to assess the results of the CW modifications",

Nitrogen-doping has been shown to affect the BCS resistance both by a lowering of Rbcs at low fields and by the introduction of an anti-Q slope which enables the Q to continue increasing as the RF field is increased. The exact strength of this anti-Q slope is heavily dependent on the doping recipe and specifically the mean free path of the RF penetration layer of the doped cavities. In addition to its effect on Rbcs",
        "the mean free path affects the amount of residual resistance obtained due to trapped magnetic flux. We have analyzed nine cavities prepared with different levels of nitrogen-doping to understand how BCS and residual resistance are affected by changes in the mean free path. Here we present a model based on these experimental results to predict the optimal doping level to reach the maximum Q at 16 MV/m based on the ambient magnetic field conditions. We find that if the cavities can be cooled with small amounts of trapped flux",

        "The RF system of the ThomX electron storage ring consists in a 500 MHz single cell copper cavity of the ELETTRA type",
        "powered with a 50 kW CW solid state power amplifier (SSPA)",
        "and the associated Low Level RF feedback and control loops. The low operating energy of 50/70 MeV makes the impedances of the cavity higher order modes (HOMs) particularly critical for the beam stability. Their parasitic effects on the beam can be cured by HOM frequency shifting techniques",
        "based on a fine temperature tuning and a dedicated plunger. A typical cavity temperature stability of ± 0.05°C within a range from 30 up to 70 °C can be achieved by a precise control of its water cooling temperature. On the other hand",
        "the tuning of the cavity fundamental mode is achieved by changing its axial length by means of a motor-driven mechanism. A general description of the system and the state of its progress are reported together with some considerations of the effects of beam cavity interactions."

The field distribution in a long four-vane resonator can be easily perturbed by nearest dipole modes which are excited due to the local geometry errors. This paper describes the electromagnetic properties of a four-vane resonator with an introduced asymmetry between neighboring chambers. The asymmetry provides necessary separation of dipole modes keeping losses and field uniformity of quadrupole mode similar to those in a conventional four-vane resonator. This feature of an asymmetric resonator is confirmed by analytical results from transmission line model as well as by CST Studio simulations. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
