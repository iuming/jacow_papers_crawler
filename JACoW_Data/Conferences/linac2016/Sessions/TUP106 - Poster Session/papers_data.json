        "a normal-conducting quadrupole magnet doublet with an intermediate beam diagnostic devices between two cryomodules is served for collimating the heavy ion beam. Although the fringe field of a magnet at a superconducting cavity position is low enough",
        "differently from a strong superconducting solenoid",
        "it can degrade the acceleration performance in the case of quench of the cavity directly and/or indirectly by contaminating the cryomodule wall and magnetic shields. In this study",
        "we analyze the magnetic measurement results in the cryomodule assembled with the magnet doublet compared to the calculated ones and discuss the future plan."

        "has been carried out taking into account the limitations of SRF cavity performance (field emission). The medium and high-beta parts of the Linac are composed of 36 and 84 elliptical cavities",
        "with geometrical beta values of 0.67 and 0.86 respectively. This work presents the latest vertical test results on ESS medium beta elliptical cavity prototypes. We describe the cavity preparation procedure from buffer chemical polishing to vertical test. Finally magnetic probes (Fluxgate) were installed on the cavity to determine magnetic field background during vertical test. The latest vertical test results showed that our cavity design performance are beyond requirements."
