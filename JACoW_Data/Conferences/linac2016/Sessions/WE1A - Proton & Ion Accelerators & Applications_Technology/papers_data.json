      "abstract": "The European Spallation Source requires a pulsed Linac with an average beam power on the target of 5MW which is about five times higher than the most powerful spallation source in operation today. Over 97% of the acceleration occurs in superconducting cavities. ESS will be the first accelerator to employ double spoke cavities to accelerate beam. Accelerating gradients of 9MV/meter is required in the spoke section. The spoke section will be followed by 36 elliptical 704 MHz cavities with a geometrical beta of 0.67 and elliptical 704 MHz cavities with a geometrical beta of 0.86. Accelerating gradients of 20MV/m is required in the elliptical section. Initial gradient test results will be presented in which results exceed expected requirements.

        "whereby the energy of the radioactive ion beams was increased from 3 to 4.3 MeV per nucleon. The facility will ultimately be equipped with four high-beta cryomodules that will accelerate the beams up to 10 MeV per nucleon for the heaviest isotopes available at ISOLDE. The first cryomodule of the new linac",
        "hosting five superconducting cavities and one solenoid",
        "was commissioned in summer 2015",
        "while the second one was being assembled in clean room. The new high-energy beam transfer lines were installed and commissioned in the same lapse of time. Commissioning with two cryomodules is planned for Summer 2016 to prepare for a physics run at 5.5 MeV/u in the second half of the year. This contribution will focus on the results of the commissioning and operation of the SC linac in 2015. Plans for the second phase of the HIE-ISOLDE project will be highlighted."
