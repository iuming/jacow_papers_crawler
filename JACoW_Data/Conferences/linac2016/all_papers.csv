J. Smith; Cornell University (CLASSE); Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; New York; USA; Electron beams ionize rest gas particles which then accumulate around them; disturbing beam dynamics and causing background radiation. While this effect has been predicted in the past; linacs have hitherto not suffered from it because of their rather small beam current. The effect of ions increases with larger currents and smaller cross sections of the beam; and it has clearly been observed in Cornell's high-brightness ERL injector for the first time. This presentation will show experimental evidence for ions; demonstrate strategies for their elimination; and will compare the experimental data to theories of beam-ion interactions.,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/spwr030_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/spwr030.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/spwr030_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-SPWR030,

linac2016,,SPWR033,Optimizing Cavity Choice for FRIB Energy Upgrade Plan,S. Shanab; K. Saito; Y. Yamazaki; FRIB; East Lansing; USA; Isotope production yield rate is directly proportional to beam power; especially for heavy ions. Higher beam kinetic energy on target drives more isotope yield. FRIB has an energy upgrade plan up to ≥ 400 MeV/u for Uranium and already prepared a vacant space in the design stage and cryogenic capacity that accommodates for the energy upgrade plan[1]. This upgrade requires an optimized linac design and challenging technology for cavity performance improvement. In this paper; we will approach this issue concerning; maximizing final energy; optimum beta; cavity operating frequency; cryogenic power; fabrication and cost in order to develop a cavity that is suitable for the energy upgrade plan.,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/spwr033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/spwr033.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/spwr033_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-SPWR033,

Several RF cavities with individual operating limits are supplied by one RF power source. Within the bunch train; the low-level-RF system is able to restrict the variation of the vector sum voltage and phase of one control line below 3·10-4 and 0.06 degree; respectively. However; individual cavities may have a significant spread of amplitudes and phases. Misaligned cavities in combination with variable RF parameters will cause significant intra-pulse orbit distortions; leading to an increase of the multi-bunch emittance. An efficient model including coupler kicks was developed to describe the effect at low beam energies. Comparison with start-to-end tracking and experimental data will be shown.,,use link to access more material from this paper's primary paper code reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/spwr039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/spwr039.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/spwr039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-SPWR039,

This study plans to map the magnetic connection between the magnetosphere and ionosphere; using a satellite equipped with an electron beam accelerator that can create a spot in the ionosphere; observable by optical and radar detectors on the ground. To date; a number of spacecraft carrying low-power; <50-keV DC electron beam sources have been launched to study the upper ionosphere. The overall instrument weight will likely be dominated by the weight of the energy storage; the RF power amplifiers and the accelerator structure. We present the notional concept of a quasi-CW; C-band electron accelerator with 1-MeV beam energy; 10-mA beam current; and requiring 40 kW of prime power during operation.

linac2016,,MOPRC008,Dispersion Free and Dispersion Target Steering Experience at CTF3,D. Gamba; R. Corsini; T. Persson; P.K. Skowroński; F. Tecker; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Oxford University; Physics Department; Oxford; Oxon; United Kingdom; JAI; Oxford; United Kingdom; One of the goals of the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) at CERN is to demonstrate the feasibility of the CLIC Drive Beam recombination; which takes place in the Drive Beam Recombination Complex (DBRC). The tight geometry of the DBRC together with its strong optics and the high energy-spread of the beam require a careful control of the beam size along the different sections of the DBRC. One of the main contribution to beam size is the dispersion. If uncontrolled; dispersion leads to fast increase of the beam size; hence it may affect the beam current stability of the combined beam. A tool has been implemented at CTF3 to measure and correct dispersion during and after the setup of the machine. Dispersion Free Steering (DFS) has been applied in the upstream drive beam LINAC; while Dispersion Target Steering (DTS) has been used in the rings of the DBRC. In the LINAC the weak optics and the wide dynamic aperture of the beamline allow a straightforward correction. In the DBRC the aperture is tighter; and the strong optics produce non-linear dispersion which one needs to take into account. A general overview of current status and future plans in controlling dispersion at CTF3 will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/moprc008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/moprc008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/moprc008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOPRC008,83
linac2016,,MOPRC009,Simulating Apertures in the Uniform Equivalent Beam Model,G.H. Gillespie Associates; Inc.; Del Mar; California; USA; The uniform equivalent beam model is useful for simulating particle beam envelopes. Beam root-mean-square (rms) sizes; divergences; and emittances of an equivalent uniform beam approximate well the rms properties of more realistic beam distributions; even in the presence of space charge. Envelope simulation codes for high current beams using the model; such as TRACE 3-D; are central to particle optics design. However; the modeling of apertures has required multi-particle simulation codes. Multi-particle codes do not typically have the fitting and optimization capabilities common to envelope codes; so the evaluation of aperture effects is often a secondary study that may result in further design iteration. To incorporate aperture effects into the optics design at the start; a method has been developed for simulating apertures in the context of a uniform equivalent beam. The method is described and its TRACE 3-D implementation is outlined. Comparisons with multi-particle simulations are used to validate the method and examine regions of applicability.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/moprc009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/moprc009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/moprc009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOPRC009,87

linac2016,,MOPRC013,Tracking Based Courant-Snyder Parameter Matching in a Linac with a Strong Space-Charge Force,ESS; Lund; Sweden; During the design of a hadron linac; matching at the interfaces of different structures or lattice periods is often performed with the linear approximation of the space-charge force. When space-charge is extremely strong; like in the low energy part of the proton linac of the European Spallation Source; such a matching method is not always good enough and could lead to a residual mismatch at the design level. To avoid this; a matching scheme based on iterations of tracking; thus including the full effect of the space-charge force; is developed.

The calculated space charge fields are not produced by a point charge but a doughnut which has the volume and whose cross-section is ellipsoid. Since the calculation noise which is usually caused by distributions of positions of point charge can be minimized; high accuracy calculation on emittance is realized with small number of electrons.

This temperature paradigm; however; need not put SRF technology out of the reach of small institutions or even limit SRF operation at large facilities to provide 10-100 MeV beam energy. At the Jefferson Lab CEBAF accelerator there are regularly scheduled maintenance periods during which the liquid helium temperature is raised to 4 K; reducing cryogenic plant power consumption by ~50% and saving megawatts of electrical power. During such a recent period; we accelerated a continuous-wave electron beam at the CEBAF photo-injector to 6.3 MeV/c with current ~80μA using two niobium cavities at helium temperature of 4 K. This contribution describes the SRF and cryogenic performance and uses measured beam quality and energy stability as key metrics. These measurements indicate that 4 K operation of niobium SRF cavities in CEBAF and at small institutions may be a sensible and cost effective mode of operation; provided the cryogenic load associated with lower Q0 is manageable for the number of SRF cavities needed. For Jefferson Lab; this enhances our scientific reach allowing additional low-energy ~10 MeV experiments each year.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/moplr010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/moplr010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/moplr010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOPLR010,155

Although the optimized measured values of the projected transverse emittance are close to those obtained from the beam dynamics simulations; the corresponding experimental machine parameters show certain systematic deviations from the simulated optimized setup. As a source for these deviations; electron beam imperfections were experimentally investigated.

Its designated design energy of 130 MeV wasn't reached yet due to a lower quality factor of the 3 GHz cavities and thus a higher dissipated power to the helium bath. To increase the maximum achievable energy in cw operation from approx. 85 MeV to the design value of 130 MeV the main accelerator will be passed a fourth time. In this configuration the accelerating gradients of the cavities can be lowered; so that the resulting dissipated power will match the available cooling power of the cryo plant. To realize an additional main linac pass a new recirculation beam line is needed. The most crucial points are the design of the separation dipole and its mirrored version as well as a properly calculated lattice. For the implementation of a new recirculation beam line the existing sections must be adapted to fit the new boundary conditions. This contribution will present some aspects of the design and will report on the actual status of this project.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/moplr014_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/moplr014.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/moplr014_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOPLR014,168

At the initial stage of Phase I CLARA will operate with the 10 Hz gun and a 45 MeV 2 m long linac section working as a buncher and/or booster. The beam will be deflected into the existing VELA beamline with an S-bend and directed to the spectrometer line for analysing beam properties or into one of two VELA user areas.

The two-step charging system for the pulse forming network (PFN) is upgraded by adding a high impedance resonant charging line in parallel with the main line. The charging step of the PFN voltage is reduced considerably near the setting value by switching the main resonance line off so that the charging current flows only through the high impedance line.

The cathodes were fabricated to have different surface areas and different distances between cathode surface and the equator. The Ninja cathode prepared with an enhanced cathode surface area was covered with a meshed shield to avoid bubble attack on the surface of the cavity cell. It has been turned out that the anode-cathode distance and the cathode area affect surface morphology of the equator. A smooth equator surface was obtained in the cases in which the cathode surface was geometrically close to the equator or instead the cathode surface area was sufficiently larger. Two 1.3 GHz ILC/Tesla type single-cell cavities VEPed with the Ninja cathodes and using optimized conditions showed good performance in vertical tests. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/moplr037_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/moplr037.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/moplr037_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOPLR037,217

Using superconducting RF cavities with gradients ~15 MV/m after the existing linac would result in a long and expensive booster. We propose accomplishing the same with a much shorter cost-effective booster based on normal conducting high-gradient (~100 MV/m) RF accelerating structures. Such X-band high-gradient structures have been developed for electron acceleration and operate with typical RF pulse lengths below 1 us. They have never been used for protons because typical wavelengths and apertures are smaller than the proton bunch sizes. However; these limitations do not restrict proton radiography (pRad) applications. A train of very short proton bunches with the same total length and charge as the original long proton bunch will create the same single radiography frame; plus pRad limits contiguous trains of beam micro-pulses to below 60 ns to prevent blur in images. For a compact pRad booster at LANSCE; we explore feasibility of two-stage design: a short S-band section to capture and compress the 800-MeV proton beam followed by the main high-gradient X-band linac.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/moplr065_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/moplr065.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/moplr065_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOPLR065,280

Allowing a highly precise tumour irradiation; it is currently limited by range verification. Several imaging modalities can be utilised for treatment planning; but typically X-ray CT is used. CT scans require conversion from Hounsfield units to estimate the proton stopping power (PSP) of the tissue be- ing treated; and this produces inaccuracy. Proton CT (pCT) measures PSP and is thought to allow an improvement of the treatment accuracy.

This linac consists of a H− ion source; a low energy beam transport (LEBT); an radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) linac; and a diagnostics bean line. The beam energy is 3 MeV; the beam current is 30 mA; and the duty factor is 0.6%; which corresponds to 0.5 kW. The accelerator itself has a capacity of at least 1 kW. However; the beam power is limited by radiation dose; because there are no radiation shields between the accessible area during the operation. The source and LEBT are same as the J-PARC linac's. The RFQ is a used one in the J-PARC linac; called RFQ I. At first; we are planning to conduct experiments of the laser charge exchange development for the transmutation facility. Then; this linac will be used for the development accelerator components such as beam scrapers; bunch shape monitors; laser profile monitors; and so on. We will be able to install new devices into the actual J-PARC linac after the full testing. The development of H− ion source can be carried out at this system; and also RFQ in the future.

As part of the LANSCE Risk Mitigation project a new digital low-level radio frequency (LLRF) control system is being deployed across the linac; starting with the DTL. Related to this upgrade; a study was performed where specific cavity field errors were simultaneously introduced in all DTL tanks about the nominal stable; low-spill; production set points to mimic LLRF control errors. The impact of these errors on the resultant beam spill was quantified for the nominal 100 μA; 800-MeV Lujan beam.

It has been long recognized that PBG structures have great potential in reducing long-range wakefields in accelerators. The first ever demonstration of acceleration in room-temperature PBG structures was conducted at MIT in 2005. The experimental characterization of the wakefield spectrum in a beam test was performed at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility in 2015; and the superior wakefield suppression properties of the PBG structure were demonstrated. In 2013 the team from MIT and SLAC demonstrated that the X-band PBG structures with elliptical rods have reduced breakdown rate compared to PBG structures with round rods; presumably due to the reduced surface magnetic fields. However; the structure with elliptical rods designed by MIT confined the dipole higher order mode in addition to the accelerating mode and thus did not have superior wakefield suppression properties. We demonstrate that PBG resonators can be designed with 40% smaller peak surface magnetic fields while preserving and even improving their wakefield suppression properties as compared to the structure with round rods. The design of the new structure is presented. The structure will be fabricated; tuned; and tested for high gradients and for wakefield suppression.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/mop106002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/mop106002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/mop106002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOP106002,307

The accelerator is a low energy continuous wave (CW) recirculating electron linac for particle physics experiments. MESA will be operated in two different modes serving mainly two experiments: the first is the external beam (EB) mode; where the beam is dumped after being used with the external fixed target experiment P2; whose goal is the measurement of the weak mixing angle with highest accuracy. The required beam current for P2 is 150 μA with polarized electrons at 155 MeV. In the second operation mode MESA will be run as an energy recovery linac (ERL). The experiment served in this mode is a (pseudo) internal fixed target experiment named MAGIX. It demands an unpolarized beam of 1 mA at 105 MeV. In a later construction stage of MESA the achievable beam current in ERL-mode shall be upgraded to 10 mA.

The two rings are designed for 1.5 GeV and 3 GeV; respectively; where the former is under construction; and the latter is undergoing beam commissioning. Both rings will be operating with top-up injections delivered by a full-energy injector that consists of 39 traveling-wave S-band LINAC structures. In order to reduce losses of high-energy electrons along the injector and in the rings during injection; only electrons that are within an allowed time structure are accelerated. This time structure depends on several parameters such as the available RF voltage and the radiation losses in the ring that is about to be injected; but also on the momentum acceptance of the transport lines in the injector. The electrons that are outside the allowed time structure are dumped when they have energies below 3 MeV by a chopper system that is located between a thermionic RF gun and the first LINAC structure. Basically; the chopper system consists of two planar striplines and a variable aperture; and the first stripline is fed with a superposed RF signal and the second one with HV pulses. The performance of the chopper system during commissioning of the 3 GeV ring is presented in this article.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/mop106015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/mop106015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/mop106015_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOP106015,316

Dynamic experiments planned for MaRIE require that the linac produce a series of micropulses that can be irregularly spaced within the macropulse; and these patterns can change from macropulse to macropulse. Irregular pulse structures create a challenge to optimizing the design of the RF and cryogenic systems. General formulas for cavities with beam loading can overestimate the power required for our irregular beam macropulse. The differing beam energy variations allowed for the XFEL and eRad micropulses produce cavity voltage control requirements that also vary within the macropulse. The RF pulse driving the cavities can be tailored to meet the needs of that particular beam macropulse because the macropulse structure is known before the pulse starts. We will derive a toolkit that can be used to determine the required RF power waveforms for arbitrary macropulse structures. We will also examine how the irregular RF power waveforms can impact RF and cryogenic system cost tradeoffs.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/mop106016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/mop106016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/mop106016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-MOP106016,320

The availability of tabletop particle sources based on high intensity lasers opens venues for new research methods in nuclear physics; both at large facilities and at university-scale laboratories. It has been demonstrated in many experiments that the kinetic energy of a particle radiated by a high intensity laser-plasma interaction is sufficient to induce nuclear reactions.

This topology is modular and based on the utilization of High Frequency (HF) transformers. The topology allows for the usage of industrial standard power electronic components at the primary stage at full extent which can easily be placed and wired in a conventional electrical cabinet. It requires only few special components like HF transformers; rectifiers and filters (i.e. passive components) to be placed in an oil tank. This arrangement allows scaling up in average and pulse power to the required levels while keeping the size; cost; efficiency and reliability of the different modules under good control. Besides the very good output pulse power quality; the AC grid power quality is also remarkably high with a line current harmonic distortion below 3%; a unitary power factor and an extremely reduced line voltage flicker below 0.3%. A reduced scale modulator prototype has been built and validated experimentally.,,Slides TU2A02 [8.596 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tu2a02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tu2a02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tu2a02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TU2A02,359
linac2016,,TU2A03,Resonance Control for Future Linear Accelerators,Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Many of the next generation of particle accelerators (LCLS II; PIP II) are designed for relatively low beam loading. Low beam loading requirement means the cavities can operate with narrow bandwidths; minimizing capital and base operational costs of the RF power system. With such narrow bandwidths; however; cavity detuning from microphonics or dynamic Lorentz Force Detuning becomes a significant factor; and in some cases can significantly increase both the acquisition cost and the operational cost of the machine. In addition to the efforts to passive environmental detuning reduction (microphonics) active resonance control for the SRF cavities for next generation linear machine will be required. State of the art in the field of the SRF Cavity active resonance control and the results from the recent efforts at FNAL will be presented in this talk.,,Slides TU2A03 [0.897 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tu2a03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tu2a03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tu2a03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TU2A03,363

The key components of R&D ERL are the highly damped 5-cell 704 MHz superconducting RF cavity and the high-current superconducting RF gun. The gun is equipped with a multi-alkaline photocathode insertion system. The first photocurrent from ERL SRF gun has been observed in November 2014. In June 2015 a high charge 0.5nC and 20 uA average current were demonstrated. In July 2015 gun to dump beam test started. The beam was successfully transported from the SRF gun through the injection system; then through the linac to the beam dump. All ERL components have been installed. In October 2015; SRF gun cavity has been found contaminated during severe cathode stalk RF conditioning. This cavity has been sent for repair and modification for later use in low-energy RHIC electron cooler (LEReC)[**]. LEReC scheduled to start commissioning in early of 2018.

linac2016,,TUPRC003,Effect of Number of Macro Particles on Time Evolution of Phase Space Distribution,"KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; In particle tracking simulation with space charge effect; the macro-particle model; which has same mass-to-charge ratio; is widely used; since it does not require any symmetry of beam shape. However; selection of proper number of macro-particles is important; because the accuracy depends on it. Emittance; which is calculated by phase-space distribution; is especially affected by the number of macro-particles. In order to study the relation between the number of macro-particles and the resolution in the phase space; we defined a transformation; which describes reduction process of macro-particle number; and analyzed static phase space distribution. As a next step; we studied the effect of the macro-particle number on the dynamics of the phase space distribution for 1D charged particle distribution in the rest frame. The numerical result shows that the number of macro-particles affected the phase space distribution around the head and the tail of the bunch.; * T.

DONES will be based on the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility IFMIF [**]; being only one accelerator considered. The HEBT will be devoted to the transport; bending and shaping of the 40 MeV; 125 mA CW deuteron beam to the free surface of the rapidly flowing lithium target. To produce a forward peaked source of fusion-like neutrons; which stream through the target into the test cell; a rectangular uniform distribution across the flat top of the beam profile is required; being the footprint tailored in both the vertical and horizontal directions according to the target design. Different methods for beam uniformization in IFMIF accelerator has been proposed in the past [***]. Two main concerns in DONES will be the minimization of particle losses over the whole HEBT and the effect of the different shaping techniques on such strong space charge regime; specially on the beam halo modulation.

ECR sources can generate a high-brightness DC beam with high charge states. However; the ECR sources produce numerous species that must be collimated to one or two target species with minimal degradation to beam quality. The first stage of this collimation is accomplished in a tight 90 degree dipole bend with a wide aperture and slanted pole faces to provide additional focusing. We report on simulations for the high-rigidity U ion operation using linked 2D xy-slice runs in the straight section upstream of the bend and steady-state 3D simulations in the dipole bend comparing simulations with both ideal (sector) and full 3D field maps of the dipole magnet. Issues associated with placing a 3D dipole field with fringe on a bent simulation coordinate system are addressed.

It aims to study the self modulation instability of a proton bunch and the acceleration of an externally injected electron beam in the plasma wakefields; during the so called Phase II until the technical stop of LHC and its injector chain (LS2) in 2019. The external electron beam of 0.1 to 1nC charge per bunch will be generated using an S-band photo injector with a high QE semiconducting cathode. A booster linac was designed to allow variable electron energy for the plasma experiments from 16 to 20 MeV. For an RF gun and booster system; emittance control can be highlighted as a challenging transmission task. Once the beam emittance is compensated at the gun exit and the beam is delivered to the booster with an optimum beam envelope; fringing fields and imperfections in the linac become critical for preserving the injection emittance. This paper summarises the rf design studies in order to preserve the initial beam emittance at the entrance of the linac and alternative mitigation schemes in case of emittance growth.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tuprc016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tuprc016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tuprc016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TUPRC016,449

Due to the high average power in the cavity of 6.8 kW the cavity requires significant cooling; achieved by water channels in the cavity body. These channels prohibit the use of tuning studs to tune the cavity. The cavity was tuned by taking pre-braze clamped low power RF measurements and using the data to trim the cavity cells to the optimum length for both field flatness and frequency. The optimum field flatness is 100% and the design frequency is 2998.5 MHz.

The electron beam is accelerated in a superconducting linac up to 50 MeV. The electron source provides electron bunches with charge up to 16 pC at a repetition frequency of 650 MHz leading to an average current of 10 mA . The kinetic energy of the electrons has been chosen to be 300 keV to allow direct injection into an accelerator cavity. The main components of the source are a gridded dispenser cathode (CPI 'Y845) in an SF6 filled vessel and an in-air HV power supply. The beam is bunched by applying DC and RF fields to the grid. Unique features of the gun are its cathode/anode geometry to reduce field emission; and transmission of RF modulation via a dielectric (ceramic) waveguide through the SF6. The latter obviates the need for an HV platform inside the vessel to carry the RF generator and results in a significantly smaller/simpler vessel. The source has been installed and first tests with accelerated beams have been performed. Measurements of the beam properties and results from the commissioning of the source will be presented.,"Funding: ARIEL is funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Provinces AB, BC, MA, ON, QC, and TRIUMF.

While these types of systems have proven effective at achieving satisfactory levels of cleanliness; large amounts of operator touch-labor are involved; especially in SRF cavities with complex geometries; where several fixture changes and cavity manipulations may be required. With this labor comes the risk of cavity damage or contamination; and the expense of the operator's time. To reduce this operator intervention and maximize cavity cleanliness and process throughput; a new; fully-automated; robotic HPR system has been commissioned in the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) cavity processing facility. This paper summarizes the design and commissioning process of the HPR system; and demonstrates improvements to the FRIB processing facility through the minimization of cavity contamination risk and reduction of technician labor through system automation.

Traditional feedback control systems cannot respond within this time frame; so some form of feedforward control is needed. Even conventional feedforward may not be sufficient due to differences between the required feedforward signal and the actual beam-loading current. For this reason; an adaptive feedforward system using an iterative learning controller was developed for the e-linac LLRF. It can anticipate repetitive beam disturbance patterns by learning from previous iterations. The design and implementation of such a control algorithm is outlined; some simulation results are presented; and some preliminary test results with an actual cavity are illustrated.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tuplr009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tuplr009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tuplr009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TUPLR009,485

Knowing that it is impossible to completely eliminate all particulates in a clean room; efforts have been made to prevent particulates from entering SRF cavities during high pressure rinsing (HPR) and assembly. At Jefferson Lab; one practice to achieve this goal has been clamping covers to cavity open flanges during assembly. Several cover materials that have been used are examined and alternative candidate materials are under development. Clamps as a known particulate generator are carefully examined and cleaning efficiency of different methods is studied. Cover tests were done on different cavity flanges; including an LCLS-II beam pipe flange; which helps the selection of cover materials for prototype and production of the project.; Authored by Jefferson Science Associates; LLC under U.S. DOE Contracts DE-AC05-06OR23177 and DE-AC02-76SF00515 for the LCLS-II Project.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tuplr022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tuplr022.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tuplr022_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TUPLR022,512

In order to achieve this demanding goal; nitrogen-doping of the SRF cavities will be used. Nitrogen-doping has been shown to affect the BCS resistance both by a lowering of Rbcs at low fields and by the introduction of an anti-Q slope which enables the Q to continue increasing as the RF field is increased. The exact strength of this anti-Q slope is heavily dependent on the doping recipe and specifically the mean free path of the RF penetration layer of the doped cavities. In addition to its effect on Rbcs; the mean free path affects the amount of residual resistance obtained due to trapped magnetic flux. We have analyzed nine cavities prepared with different levels of nitrogen-doping to understand how BCS and residual resistance are affected by changes in the mean free path. Here we present a model based on these experimental results to predict the optimal doping level to reach the maximum Q at 16 MV/m based on the ambient magnetic field conditions. We find that if the cavities can be cooled with small amounts of trapped flux; moderate nitrogen-doping is better; while if they will have large amounts of trapped flux; lighter dopings should be used.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tuplr025_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tuplr025.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tuplr025_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TUPLR025,523

The proposed linac design takes advantage of the recent accelerator developments at Argonne; namely the ATLAS upgrades and the Fermilab PIP-II HWR Cryomodule. In particular; the state-of-the-art performance of QWRs and HWRs; the integrated steering correctors and clean BPMs for a compact cryomodule design. To simplify the design and avoid frequency transitions; we used two types of QWRs at 81.25 MHz. The QWRs were optimized for β ~ 0.05 and ~ 0.11 respectively. Nine cryomodules are required to reach the stripping energy of 18.5 MeV/u. Following the lattice design optimization; end-to-end beam dynamics simulations including all sources of machine errors were performed. The results showed that the design is tolerant to errors with no beam losses observed for nominal errors. However; the robustness of the design could be further improved by a modified RFQ design; better optimized with the multi-harmonic buncher located upstream. This could lead to a significant reduction in the longitudinal beam emittance; offering much easier beam tuning and more tolerance to errors.

linac2016,,TUPLR038,The DTL Post Coupler - An Ingenious Invention Turns 50,"CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; IPM; Tehran; Iran; In September 1967; the patent for ""A method and device for stabilization of the field distribution in drift tube linac"" has been filed by Edward A. Knapp; Donald A. Swenson; and James M. Potter of Los Alamos National Laboratory. It is this invention which to a good part led to the success of highly efficient Alvarez drift tube linacs (DTLs) in that it considerably reduces field errors. The explanation for why the post coupler when tuned correctly has such a strong stabilizing effect has been given at the time in an accompanying paper by describing the modal confluence of the accelerating mode band with the post-coupler mode band; turning a comparatively sensitive 0-mode structure into a stable pi/2-mode like structure. As ingenious as the invention of the post-coupler appears; as poor has been the way of finding its optimum length by relying mainly on trial and error. With the design of the Linac4 DTL at CERN; a new technique has been derived by a DTL equivalent circuit model. Understanding stabilization on an almost cell by cell level provides a new way of optimizing post-couplers of an entire structure with few measurements and even without the extraction of the circuit model itself. Previous approaches to post-coupler stabilization are reviewed and the new; straightforward and accurate technique is described and demonstrated in the stabilization of the Linac4 DTL structures.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tuplr038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tuplr038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tuplr038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TUPLR038,547

The low operating energy of 50/70 MeV makes the impedances of the cavity higher order modes (HOMs) particularly critical for the beam stability. Their parasitic effects on the beam can be cured by HOM frequency shifting techniques; based on a fine temperature tuning and a dedicated plunger. A typical cavity temperature stability of ± 0.05°C within a range from 30 up to 70 °C can be achieved by a precise control of its water cooling temperature.

To date; however; such thyristor assemblies have not demonstrated the reliability needed for installation in short pulse; high peak power RF stations used with many pulsed electron accelerators. The fast rising current in a thyristor tends to be carried in a small region; rather than across the whole device; and this localized current concentration can cause a short circuit failure. An alternate solid-state device; the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT); can readily operate at the speed needed for the accelerator; but commercial IGBTs cannot handle the voltage and current required. It is; however; possible to assemble these devices in arrays to reach the required performance levels without sacrificing their inherent speed. Diversified Technologies; Inc.

Diacrodes® now supply RF power to three of the four DTL tanks. These tetrodes reuse the existing infrastructure including water-cooling systems; coaxial transmission lines; high voltage power supplies and capacitor banks. Each final power amplifier system uses a combined pair of LANL-designed cavity amplifiers using the TH628L Diacrode® to produce up to 3.5 MW peak and 420 kW of mean power. A new intermediate power amplifier was developed using a TH781 tetrode. These amplifiers are the first production of new high power 200 MHz RF sources at accelerators in three decades. Design and prototype testing of the high power stages was completed in 2012; with commercialization following in 2013. Each installation was accomplished during a 4 to 5 month beam outage each year staring in 2014. Simultaneously; a new digital low-level RF control system was designed and tested; and placed into operation this year; meeting the stringent field control requirements for the linac.

The third X-band testing facility at CERN (Xbox3) has recently been commissioned and has tripled the number of testing slots available. Xbox3 uses a novel way of combining relatively low peak power (6 MW) but high average power klystron units whose power is steered to feed four testing slots with RF to the required power with a repetition rate of up to 400 Hz. Besides the repetition rate; peak power; pulse length and pulse shape can be customized to fit the test requirements.

The field distribution in a long four-vane resonator can be easily perturbed by nearest dipole modes which are excited due to the local geometry errors. This paper describes the electromagnetic properties of a four-vane resonator with an introduced asymmetry between neighboring chambers. The asymmetry provides necessary separation of dipole modes keeping losses and field uniformity of quadrupole mode similar to those in a conventional four-vane resonator.

DYNAC model was used for ReA3 optics calculation. However it basically can calculate symmetric cavity; not axisymmetric ones such as super-conductive Quarter-Wave Resonators (QWRs); which are installed in ReA3. This means that it is difficult to effectively tune beams at present situation. In order to handle beams at ReA3; a new alternative and more precise model of IMPACT is under development; which would be acceptable to actual beam operation. This paper reports benchmarked results of IMPACT and DYNAC model for ReA3 acceleration line just after RFQ exit to a transport line with symmetric cavity as a first step before more precise simulation including non-axisymmetric cavity and RFQ calculation.,Funding: * Work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY-11-02511 ** Work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science under Cooperative Agreement DE-SC0000661,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tuplr063_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tuplr063.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tuplr063_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TUPLR063,601

The HSC linac adopts a direct plasma injection scheme (DPIS); which can inject a high intensity heavy ion beam produced by a laser ion source (LIS). The input beam current of the HSC is designed to be 20 mA C6+ ions. According to numerical simulations; the HSC linac can accelerate a 6-mA C6+ beam; which meets the requirement of the needed particle number for cancer therapy (108~9 ions/pulse). The HSC injector with the DPIS method makes the existing multi-turn injection system and stripping system unnecessary; and can also bring down the size of the beam pipe in existing synchrotron magnets; which could reduce the whole cost of synchrotron. The radio frequency (RF) measurements show excellent RF properties for the resonator; with a measured Q equal to 91% of the simulated value.

Charge-state transition of accelerating ions occurs in the beam line due to interaction with the residual gas. Since this exchange changes charge to mass ratio of the ions; the ion orbit is distorted especially in an arc section with the ion potentially hitting the vacuum pipe. This will generate outgassing from the beamline pipe. Moreover; they become a seed of further charge-state exchanges. Therefore; a collimation of charge exchanged ions is necessary to prevent this feedback cycle.

In this study; we analyze the magnetic measurement results in the cryomodule assembled with the magnet doublet compared to the calculated ones and discuss the future plan.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/tup106001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/tup106001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/tup106001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TUP106001,625

The medium and high-beta parts of the Linac are composed of 36 and 84 elliptical cavities; with geometrical beta values of 0.67 and 0.86 respectively. This work presents the latest vertical test results on ESS medium beta elliptical cavity prototypes. We describe the cavity preparation procedure from buffer chemical polishing to vertical test.

This is a first stage in the upgrade of the REX post-accelerator; whereby the energy of the radioactive ion beams was increased from 3 to 4.3 MeV per nucleon. The facility will ultimately be equipped with four high-beta cryomodules that will accelerate the beams up to 10 MeV per nucleon for the heaviest isotopes available at ISOLDE. The first cryomodule of the new linac; hosting five superconducting cavities and one solenoid; was commissioned in summer 2015; while the second one was being assembled in clean room. The new high-energy beam transfer lines were installed and commissioned in the same lapse of time. Commissioning with two cryomodules is planned for Summer 2016 to prepare for a physics run at 5.5 MeV/u in the second half of the year.

In this situation; low cryogenic losses are essential. Decrease of the losses or; thus; increase of the cavity unloaded quality factor Q0 allows great savings in capital and operational cost. The new N-doping technique for the SRF cavity processing in order to achieve high Q0 is described; which is now a ready-to-use technology for SRF accelerators. The current implementation of this technique for the LCLS-II cavity production; allow us to present how ultra-high Q-factors can be maintained from the vertical to the horizontal test. In particular; efficient cooling and optimization of shielding design will be discussed to address potential Q degradation from the remnant magnetic fields in the cryomodule.

However; it has not been successful in running CW deuteron beam for long periods. The findings imply that the RF coupler is the bottle neck to reach 250 kW CW dissipated power; equivalent to 65 kV inter-rod voltage; required to run the CW deuteron beam. A new design that splits the RFQ power between two couplers was built and commissioned successfully. A 3dB splitter and two new RF couplers were installed. The RF couplers improved design allows better brazing methods; vacuum properties and RF sealing. This design is innovative from two points of view: (a) implementation of two synchronized couplers located in two separated RF cells in a 4-rod RFQ. (b) The ability to run the RFQ in 200-250 kW to accelerate a 5 mA CW deuteron beam by 2.6 MV required for the new modulation design for 1.3 MeV/u. To our knowledge; SARAF RFQ will be the first 4-rod RFQ capable of running a CW deuteron beam at these power densities. This work may contribute to other 4-rod RFQ projects which intend to run CW beams in high dissipation power; like FRANZ and MYRRHA.,,Slides TH1A04 [6.109 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/th1a04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/th1a04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/th1a04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TH1A04,693

Ideally the kicker field must rise/fall in between the beam bunches. However; in reality; an intentional beam-free time region (aka ""notch"") is created on the beam pulse to assure that the beam can be extracted with minimal losses. In the case of the Fermilab Booster; the notch is created in the ring near injection energy by the use of fast kickers which deposit the beam in a shielded collimation region within the accelerator tunnel. With increasing beam power it is desirable to create this notch at the lowest possible energy to minimize activation. The Fermilab Proton Improvement Plan (PIP) initiated an R&D project to build a laser system to create the notch within a linac beam pulse at 750 keV. This talk will describe the concept for the laser notcher and discuss our current status; commissioning results; and future plans.",,Slides TH2A01 [15.170 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/th2a01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/th2a01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/th2a01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-TH2A01,710

Emittance measurements were performed at beam energies of 3 and 12 MeV with this new device and were found to closely match the results of conventional slit-grid methods. In 2015; the configuration of this laser-wire scanner was substantially modified. In the new setup the electrons liberated by the photo-detachment process are deflected away from the main beam and focused onto a single crystal diamond detector that can be moved in order to follow the laser beam scan. The beam profiles measured with the new laser-wire setup at 50 MeV; 80 MeV and 107 MeV are in good agreement with the measurements of nearby SEM grids and wire-scanners. The design of the final laser-wire scanner for the full 160 MeV beam energy will also be presented.

This is the first time anyone has visualized these ultrafast atomic motions. Ultrafast MeV electrons also made it possible the direct measurement of phonon occupations as energy is transferred from electrons into the lattice in laser-heated gold (APL).

Different than conventional designs; the single LLRF output contains three RF frequencies (f1; f2 = 2*f1; f3 = 3*f1) and is fed to a wide band amplifier driving the MHB. The challenge is while driving f1; due to the non-linearity of the amplifier; the f2 and f3 terms will also be generated and will couple into the control of these two modes. Hence an active cancellation algorithm is used to suppress the nonlinear effect of the amplifier.

The RF system employs two digital LLRF systems controlling four normal conducting cavities in a vector sum setting. Cavity tune information of the individual cavities is obtained using a multiplexing scheme of the forward and reflected RF signals. Water skids equipped with heaters and valves are used to control resonance. A new FPGA-based hardware and EPICS-based predictive control algorithm has been developed to support reliable operation of the beam extraction process.

linac2016,,THPRC032,Towards User Defined Web Applications in Accelerator Labs,FRIB; East Lansing; USA; Most Web application users in accelerator labs understand the basics of data types and data structures. They have in-depth knowledge about accelerator physics and other engineering domains. Some even develop software applications by themselves. In the approach of user-defined web applications; a user defines her/his own web application; test and use it first before sharing it to other users. It saves the communication efforts between developers and users; reduces the time from application design to production. Most importantly; users become the owner of the application and naturally the owner of the data that the application collects and produces. This will largely improve an application's quality and user experience. At FRIB; we have been practicing this approach. One of our applications; the traveler; has been developed and operated for about three years; and used by users from various departments including cryomodule; electrical engineering; controls; and business development. The traveler application allows users to design their data collection interface in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get way; and to release it by sharing with other users and groups in the lab. We are now designing and developing a generic data store that will enable users to define their own data structure; to track structure and instance value changes; and to control the access to the data.; This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science under Cooperative Agreement DE-SC0000661; the State of Michigan and Michigan State University.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/thprc032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/thprc032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/thprc032_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-THPRC032,843

Also; according to the Technical Design Report (TDR) of International Linear Collider (ILC); the higher gradient of 45 MV/m is required in the second stage of ILC. To realize such higher gradient; several methods are proposed. One of such methods is to coat multi-layer thin-film superconductor on the inner surface of RF cavity where the thin film increases the RF critical field on the inner surface of the cavity. To demonstrate the RF performance of thin-film structure on a small coupon sample; we designed the RF mushroom-shaped cavity with which the RF critical magnetic field is measured on a thin-film coupon sample set on the inner surface of the cavity. If the RF cavity is cooled down below the critical temperature of thin-film superconductor with supplying RF power; the heat dissipation might be measured on the coupon sample in the cavity. We designed the shape of the cavity so as to produce a strong RF magnetic field parallel to the sample surface efficiently. We report the design; manufacturing and RF property measurements of the cavity in this presentation.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/thplr006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/thplr006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/thplr006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-THPLR006,852

At present there are no muon accelerators. Development of a compact system that can produce an intense beam of accelerated muons would provide unique imaging options for stockpile stewardship while delivering minimal radiation dose; as well as various homeland-security and industrial applications. Our novel compact accelerator approach allows a single linac to be used to first accelerate an electron beam to 800 MeV to generate muons by interacting with a production target in a high-field solenoid magnet and then to collect and accelerate these low-energy muons to 1 GeV to be used for imaging or active interrogation. The key enabling technology is a high-gradient accelerator with large energy and angular acceptances. Our proposed solution for efficient acceleration of low-energy muons is a 0-mode linac coupled with conventional electron RF accelerating structures to provide a compact system that could deliver a controllable high-flux beam of muons with well-defined energy to allow precise radiographic inspections of complicated objects. The details of the conceptual design will be discussed.,"Funding: This work is supported by the United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Agency, under contract DE-AC52-06NA25396.",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/thplr009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/thplr009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/thplr009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-THPLR009,861

In here; a multi-bunch electron beam is generated by a 3.6cell photo-cathode RF-gun and accelerated to 18-24MeV by a 12cell booster. And then 6-10 keV X-rays are generated by LCS between the beam and a laser pulse stored in a 4-mirror planar optical cavity. Our aim is to take a phase contrast image with Talbot interferometer within a few minutes at present. The target flux of X-ray is 1.7x107 photons/pulse with 10% bandwidth. For an electron beam; the target of the intensity is 500nC/pulse with 1000 bunches at 30 MeV. Presently; we have achieved the generation of 24MeV beam with total charge of 600nC in 1000bunches. The energy difference is within 1.3% peak to peak. The beam-loading is compensated by delta T method and amplitude modulation(AM) of the RF pulse*. However there is the energy difference at the RF-gun. It is assumed that this causes the reduction of the X-ray flux due to change of the focused beam size. To reduce the energy difference; AM is also applied to the RF pulse for the gun. We will show the results of the beam-loading compensation and the generation of X-rays.; * Y.

The LDA consists of single or a pair of binary-blazed transmission grating. In case of normal incidence; a grating constant must be the same with a laser wavelength to synchronize with the electron and an acceleration field. Although demonstration experiments have been published from SLAC and MPQ; there are many problems to be solved; especially in the non-relativistic energy region. A crucial problem is to make it clear whether electrons are accelerated with negligibly small wiggling or lateral shift. We are simulating at various conditions with the aid of CST-code. We also analyze an oblique incidence (OI) scheme for the efficient acceleration of slow electron. The OI-scheme enables to use the grating of larger grating constant. Adoption of the large grating constant makes it easy to fabricate the grating. Besides analytical works; we are making gratings and developing an Yb-doped fiber laser for the acceleration experiment.

We recognized that the higher-order polynomials came from the higher-order moments and that beam position measurement is consequently influenced by a transverse beam shape. To investigate what order was required for adequate correction; we performed a successive iteration for the six-electrode BPM holding an inner radius of 16mm (circular cross-section). The successive iteration is a method to obtain a self-consistent solution for the higher-order correction. An amplitude of static electric field due to a beam charge was calculated by two-dimensional mirror charge method. As a result of the successive iteration; the convergence region was large enough for ordinary measurements (from lower than -5mm to higher than 5mm horizontally and vertically). In the convergence region the root mean square of the differences between the set and calculated vertical position were obtained as 0.487mm (without correction); 0.030mm (with third-order correction) and 0.003mm (with fifth-order correction).,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/thplr015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/thplr015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/thplr015_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-THPLR015,876

It was concluded that this TM011-damping degradation was caused by cavity geometry deviation within the specified mechanical tolerances. The particular influence of different mechanical parameters was analyzed and additional RF measurements were carried out to find the most critical geometry parameters. Stability of the equator welding and regularity of chemical treatment were investigated for different cavity cells.

One pulsed superconducting linac accelerates electron bunches for two undulator beamlines; while a third beamline is under construction. Within each RF-pulse; trains of hundreds of electron bunches are produced in a photo-cathode RF gun; accelerated in the linac and distributed by fast kickers into the undulator beamlines. In order to fulfill the parameter ranges of the multiple user experiments each bunch train can be tuned individually in bunch number from 0 - 800; spacing from 1 μs - 25 μs and intensity from 0.1 nC - 1 nC. To make this possible; three injector laser systems are used and this allows FLASH to vary independently the laser settings for the designated undulator beamlines. A laser controller has been developed to make a multi-users operation mode possible. The controller uses a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to control the time structure of the laser pulses and it provides the interface for the timing and the machine protection system. The controller has been implemented using the MicroTCA.4 technology.

This dark current in the SPring-8 linear accelerator caused satellite bunches unignorable for precise experiments in the downstream electron storage ring. The dark current has been investigated by means of our electron-gun test equipment applying a DC accelerator voltage to the electron gun. The investigations revealed that the dark current was generated from the wehnelt electrode; the gird electrode; and the cathode surface. The dark current from the wehnelt electrode was decreased under the measurement limit 2·10-15 A by replacing the wehnelt and the anode electrodes with new electro-polished ones. The dark current from the cathode surface was reduced by lowering the grid-electrode potential against the cathode down to -160 V.

linac2016,,THPLR035,FZJ SRF TSR with Integrated LHe Vessel,FZJ; Jülich; Germany; Single- or Multi-Spoke SRF cavities are one of the basic accelerating structures for the low and intermediate energy part of many accelerators. Different types of external loads on the resonator walls predetermine the main working conditions of the SC cavities. The most important of them are very high electromagnetic fields that result in strong Lorentz forces acting on cavity walls and the pressure on cavity walls from the helium tank that also deforms the cavity shape. For the accelerators operating in pulsed regime the Lorentz forces are the dominant factor. The liquid helium vessel pressure instability even for 2K operations is the source of large microphonics and dominates for cw operation. Here we propose an innovative integrated helium vessel-cavity and stiffener design that will provide an effective passive damping minimizing df/dp ratio. Minimizing df/dp may be accomplished without an enhancement of the structure rigidity; which in turn minimizes the load on the cavity tuner. A separate stiffening scheme reducing Lorentz force cavity detuning to be added without violation of df/dp optimization. The developed at the Research Center in Jülich; Germany (FZJ) the 352 MHz; β=v/c=0.48 Triple-Spoke Resonator was used as an example to demonstrate the proposed conceptual integrated helium vessel-cavity design.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/thplr035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/thplr035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/thplr035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-THPLR035,926

Since a series of external loads on the resonator walls predetermine the main working conditions of the SC cavities the detailed investigation of their mechanical properties should be conducted in parallel with the main RF design. The effects of very high electromagnetic fields that result in strong Lorentz forces and the pressure on cavity walls from the helium tank that also deforms the cavity shape; the tuning scheme resulting in the change of accelerating field profile and mechanical eigen resonances of cavities which are the main source of the microphonics must be taken into account during integrated design of the resonator and its liquid helium vessel. SRF elliptical cavities for the medium energies (β=v/c is around 0.6) inherently have more flexible shape and their ultimate stiffening with a ""standard"" stiffening rings installed between resonator cells becomes problematic. The second row of the rings should enhance the overall cavity rigidity. In the paper we report the basic investigations of the cavity two-row ring stiffening using FNAL 650 MHz β=0.61 as an example.

In most cases of vertical test; one decay time constant is measured around critical coupling and coupling constants are measured using forward and reflected rf power to get intrinsic quality factor. We use multi decay time constants method to measure the quality factor; which uses three decay time constants. Two more switches before and after the cavity are added to the measurement system. Decay time constants are measured by switching off the rf power switch in front of rf source; the forward power switch in front of input power coupler; and then the pickup power switch behind the pickup coupler; respectively; at the same power of steady state.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/thplr069_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/thplr069.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/thplr069_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-THPLR069,

linac2016,,FR1A06,Staging of Laser-Plasma Electron Accelerators,LBNL; Berkeley; California; USA; We present results of an experiment where two Laser-Plasma-Accelerator stages are coupled at a short distance; as is needed to increase energy while preserving average gradient. Stable electron beams produced by the first stage were focused by a discharge capillary-based active plasma lens; through a plasma mirror which coupled a second independent laser; into the second stage. The electron beam interacted with a dark-current-free; quasi-linear wakefield excited by the second stage laser. Changing the arrival time of the electron beam allowed localized reconstruction of the temporal field structure excited by the wake and determination of the on-axis plasma density. Staged acceleration in the wakefield of the second stage was verified by a momentum gain of the electron beam. The results indicate that limits to plasma accelerator energy gain can be overcome using staged acceleration; which provides a path to collider-relevant energies. Such compact staging is also important to photon sources where it can be used to decelerate electrons after photon production to mitigate shielding needs.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/talks/fr1a06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/papers/fr1a06.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/linac2016/posters/fr1a06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-LINAC2016-FR1A06,
