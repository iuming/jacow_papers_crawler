IPAC2014,,MOYAA01,Innovative Ideas for Single-pass FELs,RIKEN SPring-8 Center; Sayo-cho; Sayo-gun; Hyogo; Japan; SASE FELs are a powerful light source in short wavelengths from VUV to X-ray regions to investigate matters and phenomena. SASE was first experimentally obtained in 2000 at DESY TTF with an output wavelength of 109 nm. Subsequently; FLASH; LCLS and SACLA have achieved lasing in VUV; soft X-rays and hard X-rays. Although SASE has already been widely used for many application experiments in broad scientific fields; its spiky spectrum and time structures due to the lack of longitudinal coherence sometimes become problematic. To improve its longitudinal coherence; various ideas have been proposed and some of them are already demonstrated experimentally; such as a self-seeded scheme; high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) and echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG). There is also another direction of developments to enhance the capability and potentiality of SASE; for example short pulse generation and two-color lasing.

IPAC2014,,MOYBA02,New Design Approaches for High Intensity Superconducting Linacs – The New ESS Linac Design,ESS; Lund; Sweden; The cost of the next generation of high intensity accelerators has become so large that no single institution can solely afford to fund the construction of the project. To fund these large projects; institutions have embarked on forming ambitious collaboration structures with other laboratories. To induce other laboratories to join the collaboration; compromises must be made in the accelerator technical design to offer interesting and challenging projects to partner institutions. The cost of high intensity hadron accelerators is largely driven by RF system. A new design philosophy different from the traditional approach is emerging for the high intensity frontier machines. Emittance preservation is often less of an issue as long as beam losses are kept low. At ESS modifications were introduced to the linac design. One of the major changes is the reduction of final energy and an increase of gradient and beam current. As a result the design now meets the cost objective but for the price of a higher risk. The accelerator system designer must then try to balance the cost and technical risks while also satisfying the interests and external goals of the partner laboratories.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/moyba02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/moyba02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/moyba02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOYBA02,23

The S-LSR storage ring has a high super periodicity of 6; which is preferable from the beam dynamical point of view. At S-LSR one dimensional ordering of proton beam was already realized for the first time**. Active three dimensional laser cooling has been experimentally demonstrated for ions with un-negligible velocity (v/c=0.0019; where c is the light velocity) for the first time. Utilizing the above mentioned characteristics of S-LSR; an approach to realize ultralow emittances has been pursuit. To suppress heating effects; due to intra-beam scattering; the circulating ion beam intensity was reduced by scraping and beam emittances of 1.3·10-11 pi m·rad and 8.5·10-12 pi m·rad (normalized) have been realized for the horizontal and vertical directions; respectively with the 40 keV Mg ion beam at a beam intensity of ~104; which is the lowest emittance ever attained by laser cooling.

We present an interaction region design developed with close integration of the detection and beam dynamical aspects. The dynamical aspect of the design rests on a symmetry-based concept for compensation of non-linear effects. The optics and geometry have been optimized to accommodate the detection requirements and to ensure the interaction region's modularity for ease of integration into the collider ring lattices. As a result; the design offers an excellent detector performance combined with the necessary provisions for non-linear dynamical optimization.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopro005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopro005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopro005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRO005,71

To achieve this goal; a highly vertically-polarized electron beam is injected from the CEBAF. The polarization will be vertical in the arcs to avoid spin diffusion; and longitudinal at the collision points. The polarization rotation will be accomplished by using a total of four spin rotators; each of which consists of a set of solenoids and dipoles; placed at the ends of two arcs. The polarization configuration cancels the 1st order spin perturbation in the solenoids for the off-momentum particles and significantly reduces the synchrotron sideband resonances. In order to compensate the net Sokolov-Ternov depolarization effect; especially at higher energies; a continuous injection of a polarized electron beam from the CEBAF is being considered. We consider to perform a moderate spin matching in some key regions to extend the polarization lifetime so that the continuous injection can work more efficiently; while not imposing a burden on the optics design of the collider ring.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopro006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopro006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopro006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRO006,74

It assumes the nano-beam scheme; in which the emittance of the colliding beams is ε=4.6\mbox{nm}. The emittance of the injected beam is ε=1.46\mbox{nm}. To acheave such a low emittance; it is vitally important to preserve the emittance during the transport of the beam from the linac to the main ring. One of the most difficult sections is the injection system. It has been pointed out that the injected beam has possibility of leading to blowup in the ring; which is caused by a beam-beam interaction with the stored positron beam. To avoid the beam blowup; the synchrotron injection is adopted as a backup option. The orbit of the electron injection beam has been designed and the septum magnet prototype has been constructed.

The CLIC pre-damping rings and damping rings (DRs) will produce ultra-low emittance beam with high bunch charge. To avoid beam emittance increase; the DR kicker systems must provide extremely flat; high-voltage; pulses. The specifications for the DR extraction kickers call for a 160 ns duration flat-top pulses of ±12.5 kV; 250 A; with a combined ripple and droop of not more than ±0.02 % (±2.5 V). An inductive adder is a very promising approach to meeting the specifications because this topology allows the use of both passive and analogue modulation methods to adjust the output waveform. Recently; two five-layer; 3.5 kV; prototype inductive adders have been built at CERN. The first of these has been used to test the passive and active analogue modulation methods to compensate voltage droop and ripple of the output pulses.

Two scenarios were presented earlier in this context; which both preserved all the existing free straight sections for insertions; though the bending magnet positions were not strictly conserved. The purpose of the extended studies is to explore; in particular; the range of horizontal emittance that can be reached by hypothetically removing some of the existing geometric constraints; such as suppressing or shortening partially the straight sections. The emittance range is equally studied by fulfilling rigorously all constraints. The dependence of the nonlinear properties of the magnet lattice on the linear optics is simultaneously investigated.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopro053_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopro053.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopro053_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRO053,203

It will enable to serve several beamlines with 100 fs FWHM long pulses of soft and hard X-rays with reasonable flux and with a 1 kHz repetition rate. It is based on the interaction of a femtosecond Ti:Sa laser with electrons circulating in the magnetic field of a modulator wiggler; that provides the electron beam energy modulation on the length scale of the laser pulse. The optimization of the interaction is performed using two dedicated diagnostics stations. The first one; operating in the Infra-Red (IR) is installed in the tunnel and allows the adjustment of the temporal; spectral and spatial overlap between the laser and the electron beam. The second one; located in the IR-THz AILES beamline; measures the intensity of the terahertz (THz) radiation emitted by the local dip structure produced in the core electron beam after interaction.

IPAC2014,,MOPRO059,Fluka Calculations of Gamma Spectra at BESSY,K. Ott; Y. Bergmann; HZB; Berlin; Germany; Since 22nd October 2012 BESSY is operated in top-up mode. Losses of electrons during injection cause an electromagnetic cascade; that consists of high energetic photons of the bremsstrahlung; and secondary electrons and positrons from the pair creations. The bremsstrahlung spectrum has a maximum at 1.022 MeV owing to pair creations. The spectrum has a high energetic tail; that reaches up to the electron energy of 1.7 GeV at BESSY. The low energy part of the electromagnetic cascade is produced by compton scattering or the photo - effect. Due to the opened beamshutters during top-up injections; the low energetic part of the bremsstrahlung spectrum can reach the experimental hall. We used the particle interaction and transport code FLUKA for the calculations of both the fluence and the dose distribution. We calculated the gamma spectra of the radiation through the shielding walls and through the front-ends. We discuss the question whether additional safety measures are necessary for top-up operation due to the low energy part of the spectrum. From our calculations we determined the correction factors for our ionisation chambers of the ambient dose measurement system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopro059_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopro059.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopro059_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRO059,219

The beam lifetime; which is a critical issue for user operation of a light source; was studied experimentally and by simulation for different operation modes; i.e. single-bunch and multibunch fill patterns and for different beam currents. The electron loss rate is dominated by residual-gas scattering (Coulomb scattering and Bremsstrahlung) and by electron-electron scattering (Touschek effect). Since these processes depend in different ways on the momentum acceptance of the storage ring; a variation of the RF cavity voltage allows to disentangle their respective contributions to the total loss rate. The experimental results lead to a consistent picture for different operation modes with a characteristic dependence of the residual-gas pressure on the beam current.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopro061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopro061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopro061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRO061,222

Currently; we are designing a new ring based on the shape of a (11; 3) torus knot for our future plan ‘HiSOR-II.’ This ring is mid-low energy light source ring with a beam energy of 700 MeV. Recently some light source rings are achieving very low emittance that reaches a diffraction limited light by adopting a multi-bend scheme to the arc section of the ring. It is not difficult for low-mid energy VUV-SX light source ring because the electron beam less than 10 nmrad can provide the diffraction limited light in the energy less than 10eV. However the multi-bend lattice has many families of the magnets; therefore it is not easy to decide the parameters of the lattice. Especially; it is difficult for the torus knot type SR ring because there is a lot of geometric limitation around the cross points of orbits.

During user operation; an interlock system which turns off the RF acceleration signal if the beam orbit at insertion devices exceed a window is in operation. Beam abort events due to the interlock system have occurred as a rare event at SPring-8. Though in most cases we find trouble in accelerator devices as the source of the beam orbit shift; sometimes we cannot find any evidence after the beam abort. In order to identify the sources of such aborts; we have developed a system which observe beam orbit along the storage ring during beam abort. The system was realized by modification of the digital part of the existing COD measurement system. Every 1 ms; the system measures beam position at all BPMs with the position resolution of 1 micron or less. This system enabled us to identify the source when a beam abort due to an orbit shift with a time constant of longer than a few milliseconds. Furthermore; this system is applicable to survey sources of beam orbit fluctuations during stable operation.

USR can generate theoretically minimum synchrotron radiation because emittance of the USR is less than diffraction limit of the radiation. The USR requires high alignment precision of micro-meter order. A vibrating wire method (VWM) has widely been used for such a high precision alignment. An error field of multi-pole magnet is estimated by detecting a vibration of a single wire excited with AC current. The wire position; where no vibration is excited; is defined as the magnetic center. The applied frequency is kept on a resonant frequency; which may drift due to temperature change etc. during the measurement. To trace the resonant frequency at all times; we developed a frequency feedback system. It is necessary to trace the resonance; even when the wire is set in the vicinity of the magnetic center where the magnetic field is nearly zero. Here we propose to install one or two additional wires parallel to the original wire. The additional wires off the center can detect the vibration frequency with enough S/N ratio. We discuss the effectiveness of it for quick and reliable alignment.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopro081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopro081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopro081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRO081,277

In the SPring-8 storage ring; many efforts had been paid to reduce the beam oscillation by adjusting the temporal shape and timing of four bump magnets and by applying a counter kick to the residual oscillation; whose amplitude is as large as 0.4mm and the width is as narrow as 500ns. Now; the averaged oscillation amplitude has successfully been suppressed to the level of less than 0.1mm. To confirm the suppression effect; we observed the turn-by-turn photon beam profile at the diagnostics beamline with the insertion device. We confirmed that the light axis oscillation was significantly suppressed by a factor of 5 comparing by applying a counter kick. We also found that the oscillation shape and the oscillation amplitude; which were caused by the timing shift of firing bump magnets; are drastically changed by only timing shift of one magnet.

Since accelerator-based THz sources are usually driven by relatively low energy electron bunches of a few tens of MeV; space-charge makes bunch compression to sub-ps level very challenging. In the present work we investigate the feasibility of ballistic bunching down to sub-ps duration while preserving the transverse phase-space quality. We found that in order to compensate for the nonlinear dependency of the arrival time on the energy as well as bunch deformations induced by space-charge effects; one needs to apply a nonlinear energy chirp. This chirp permits to maximize the bunch compression and can be realized by exciting a cavity with higher harmonics of the fundamental frequency.

Such a modification effectively replaces each DBA cell with two new DBA cells; hence the term Double-DBA or DDBA has come to be used for the project. Since the tangent point for bending magnet beamlines lies close to the start of the second dipole in the original DBA; this allows unused exit ports and spaces on the experimental hall which are available for future bending magnet beamlines to be used for higher performance ID beamlines.

The position and the modulation of the rods determines the focusing and accelerating properties of the RFQ. The resonating field induces currents; and by that Joule losses; in the stems; rods and tuning plates. The temperature increase causes a mechanical deformation which may lead to a deteriorated performance of the RFQ. The temperature increase is kept small by cooling the rods and stems. A new layout of cooling channels has been proposed. The paper reports about coupled electromagnetic; fluid-dynamic; thermal and structural dynamic field simulations carried out for predicting the mechanical deformation of the stems and the rods.

IPAC2014,,MOPME004,RFQ Solver based on the Method of Moments,C. Raucy; C.V.G. Craeye; UCL; Louvain-la-Neuve; Belgium; SCK•CEN; Mol; Belgium; The aim of this research is to improve the accuracy and the simulation time of solvers devoted to Radio Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQ). The Method of Moments is a full-wave method used to solve scattering problems. Its main advantage over FE or FDTD solvers is that unknowns are limited to the boundaries of the object. The resulting dense system of equations can be solved very rapidly with the help of domain-decomposition approaches (e.g. Macro Basis Functions*); especially when the level of detail is very fine compared to the wavelength; which is definitely the case for RFQ’s. Such a method however needs a first regularization method to overcome the low-frequency breakdown in order to compute the Macro Basis Functions.

IPAC2014,,MOPME005,Simulation of the Extraction and Transport of a Beam from the SILHI Source with the Warp Code,A. Chancé; N. Chauvin; CEA/DSM/IRFU; France; In a low energy beam transfer (LEBT) line; space charge effects are dominant and make the motion of the particles strongly non-linear. So; the beam dynamics is directly dependent on the 6D distribution of the particles after the ion source extraction system. It is thus essential to simulate accurately the source extraction region and the space charge compensation after it to try to reach an agreement between the simulations and the measurements. Generally; the ion source extraction system is simulated with electrostatic codes (often using simple model for space charge) from which the 6D beam distribution is derived. Then; this distribution can be used as an initial condition to simulate the beam transport in the LEBT with a time dependent PIC code that takes into account space charge compensation. We propose here to simulate accurately the SILHI source extraction system with the Warp and AXCEL-INP codes. The SILHI ion source will be quickly presented and some simulations results will be given and discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopme005_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopme005.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopme005_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPME005,385

The optimization of a storage ring lattice is a multi-objective problem that involves a high number of constraints in a multi-dimensional parameter space. In this paper we used Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and the tracking code ELEGANT to optimize the linear and non-linear beam dynamics of the SOLEIL synchrotron light source. The objectives of our optimization are the dynamical aperture and the momentum aperture which are strongly correlated to the injection efficiency and the Touschek lifetime; respectively. This paper will discuss the deployment of this computational approach using the SOLEIL computer cluster.

Although dissipation due to lossy materials is neglected in the current work; in reality; because energy transfer appears due to the design of the superconducting cavities; the numerical eigenmode analysis based on real-valued variables is no longer suitable to describe the dissipative acceleration structure. Dissipation can appear with the help of dedicated higher order mode (HOM) couplers; the power coupler as well as the beam tube once the resonance frequency is above the cutoff frequency of the corresponding waveguide. At the Computational Electromagnetics Laboratory (TEMF) a robust parallel eigenmode solver based on complex-valued finite element analysis is available. The eigenmode solver has been applied to the TESLA 1.3 GHz and the third harmonic 3.9 GHz nine-cell cavities to determine the resonance frequency; the quality factor and the corresponding field distribution of eigenmodes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopme009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopme009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopme009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPME009,394

Since the commissioning of HIT the simulation programme Mirko from GSI Darmstadt has been in use for the simulation of the beamlines and the synchrotron. While Mirko fully complies with the demands and is still in regular use; the long-term support of the HIT-Mirko derivate cannot be guaranteed. We have therefore started to set up a new simulation environment based on the MAD-X programme from CERN. In a first step we built a MAD-X model of the HIT accelerator using the MAD-X export function of Mirko. The resulting sequences were transformed and extended into executable MAD-X files. The simulation results were validated against Mirko and a good agreement of the calculated beam envelopes could be achieved.

A very common way to solve Poisson's equation is to use the convolution of charge density and Green's function; the so-called Green's function method. Additionally; the integrated Green's function method* is being used in order to achieve a higher accuracy. For both methods; the convolutions are done using fast Fourier transform based on the convolution theorem. However; the construction of the integrated Green's function and the further convolution is still very time-consuming. The computation can be accelerated without loosing precision if the calculation of Green’s function values is limited to that part of the computational domain with non-zero grid charge density. In this paper we present a general numerical study of these Green's function methods for computing the potential of different bunches: The results can also be used in other simulation codes to improve efficiency.; * J.

The breakdown and RF sheath potential for the antenna are investigated by a three dimension electromagnetic code in the paper. The plasma is simulated by a slab with high relative permittivity approximating the plasma loading of the antenna. Calculations show that the maximum of electric field is around the end of the coaxial feeds and the strip line and the electric field is strongly dependent on antenna phasing. Especially the maximum of electric field is decreased to 27.5 KV/cm with the (0; π; π; 0) phasing between toroidal straps while the value is 32.8 KV/cm with (0; 0; π; π) phasing. A challenge in ICRF is the impurity contamination which is related to sheath potential. The topology of the radio frequency (RF) sheath is optimized to reduce the potential for EAST ICRF antenna.

The code allows performing numerical experiments with an arbitrary density distribution; beam crossing angle and relative offset. From the mathematical point of view the main problem of the three-dimensional modeling is the presence of the high relativistic factor values (the field gradients are high); the convergence conditions for PIC method and the necessary number of particles in 3D cell.

At Fermilab; electron lenses will be implemented as lattice elements for nonlinear integrable optics. The design of electron lenses requires tools to calculate the kicks and wakefields experienced by the circulating beam. We use the Warp particle-in-cell code to study generation; transport; and evolution of the electron beam.

It can determine high-order transfer maps of combinations of particle optical elements. New features are being developed for inclusion in COSY to follow the distribution of particles through matter. To study in detail the properties of muons passing through material; the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map–Monte-Carlo approach in which transfer map methods describe the average behavior of the particles including energy loss; and Monte-Carlo methods are used to provide small corrections to the predictions of the transfer map accounting for the stochastic nature of scattering and straggling of particles. The advantage of the new approach is that the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects. The gains in speed will aid the optimization of muon cooling channels. Progress on the development of the required algorithms is reported.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopme037_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopme037.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopme037_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPME037,457

It relies on an automatic multigrid-based decomposition of charges in near and far regions and the use of high-order differential algebra methods to obtain decompositions of far fields that lead to an error that scales with a high power of the order. Given an ensemble of N particles; the method allows the computation of the self-fields of all particles on each other with a computational expense that scales as O(N). Furthermore; the method allows the computation of all high-order multipoles of the space charge fields that are necessary for the computation of high-order transfer maps and all resulting aberrations. Space charge effects are crucial in modeling the latter stages of the six-dimensional (6D) cooling channel for the Muon Collider.

In the planned antiproton (pbar) separator scheme a magnetic horn will be used as a device for collection and focusing of highly divergent antiprotons emerging from the target with energies around 3 GeV and within a cone of about 80 mrad .To achieve the desired focusing effect; the horn needs to be powered with a current pulse of 400 kA peak amplitude at the same repetition rate as the primary proton beam; i.e. 0.1 Hz. In future; operation up to 0.2 Hz is planned without major design alterations. Due to civil construction and radiation protection limitations; possible technical realization of this system has some key design issues. The aim is to develop a reliable and efficient magnetic horn system for effective focusing of antiprotons by producing a very strong pulsed magnetic field.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopme066_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopme066.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopme066_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPME066,517

They serve the following three main tasks: Firstly; they can be used to improve the time resolution for the positron beam line by removing certain parts of the bunch. As a second advantage they enable the machine to run two independent experiments at the same; as a chopper may split the beam into two separate parts. Lastly; a well-positioned kicker can reduce the dark current emitted by the SRF injector of the accelerator. Different designs for structures; deflecting the bunch in the beam line; have been simulated using CST Particle Studio. Here; no big difference to well-known strip line structures do exist. The next step is to design the supply electronics driving the kickers. As the ELBE accelerator runs at a high bunch repetition rate; the kicker has to keep up to this frequencies of up to 13 MHz. Hence; the high power levels needed for the operation may cause additional problems for the driver electronics.

A residual field of about 6% of the flat-top exists at the tail of the pulse due to an impedance mismatching. The residual field is required to be suppressed less than 1% to reduce injection losses. For a higher intensity beam operation; the kicker rise-time of less than 300nsec is required to inject longer beam bunches which reduces a space charge effect. During the long shutdown in FY2013; 140Ω resistor and 7nF capacitor were connected to the thyratron to improve the post-pulse shape. In addition; an optimization of a capacitance in the matching circuit was carried out to optimize the waveform. As the result; the rise-time of 195nsec and the residual tail field of 2% were achieved. However; another reflection peak of about 9% is appeared. We plan to compensate the effect of the new peak by using a new small kicker magnet.

For GW level pulse generators; switches and pulse forming units are difficult to implement with solid state components restricted by high power tolerance and high voltage insulation. Under certain pulse power; operation voltage is decided by impedance of the pulse forming unit; which means that pulse modulation with low impedance method should help improve insulation strength of a pulsed power system. Therefore; a high power; low impedance pulse forming network is developed based on solid components of ceramic capacitors in this research. It is designed that the impedance is 1.6 Ω; the pulse width is about 150 ns; and the output power is above 1 GW. Low impedance is accomplished via several pulse forming units connected in parallel with a circumferential structure; which could reduce the stray inductance due to good symmetrical characteristics. Key factors influencing pulse modulation process are investigated; stray parameters are examined by electromagnetic calculations and preliminary experiments are carried out; with results giving reasonable agreement with the theoretical cases.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopme070_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopme070.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopme070_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPME070,529

The SPT; with important features such as auto-resetting of core; high step-up ratio and low saturation inductance; achieves a compact integration of common transformer and magnetic switch. In the SPT; The physical suppression effect caused by reversed magnetic coupling mechanism among primary and secondary windings can reduce the saturation inductance of the SPT windings to a level lower than their structure inductances; which helps to achieve a magnetic switch with low saturation inductance. The proposed SPTs were applied in a high power pulse modulator based on a helical Blumlein pulse forming line (HBPFL). When the SPT played as a pulse transformer; the HBPFL can be charged to 200 kV.

For one kicker magnet the ferrite yoke approached its Curie temperature. As a result of a long thermal time-constant the yoke can require several hours to cool sufficiently to allow re-injection of beam; thus limiting the running efficiency of the LHC. The beam screen; which screens the ferrite yoke from wakefields; has been upgraded to limit ferrite heating. In addition it is important to improve the cooling of the ferrite yoke: one method is to increase the internal emissivity of the cylindrical vacuum tank; in which the kicker magnet is installed. This paper describes a method developed for measuring the emissivity of the inside of the tanks; which has been benchmarked against measurements of the ferrite yoke temperature during heat treatment in an oven and transient thermal simulations.

A reduction of the rise time for lead ions was studied in line with a modification of the whole injection system. This paper briefly describes the different rise time options studied for an initially proposed dedicated ion kicker system MKP-I; focuses however on a cost effective alternative using the presently installed 12 MKPS magnets connected to a new fast pulse forming line. As only 12 out of the 16 injection kicker magnets would be fast enough to be used in an upgraded system; additional deflection has to be provided by the septa.

The basic concept of a Marx modulator is that it charges an array of capacitors in parallel (low voltage); then erects them in series to form a high-voltage discharge. Using DTI’s solid-state switches (instead of traditional spark gaps or SCRs) to construct a Marx modulator enables it to open and close; thus the capacitors serve as storage capacitors rather than fully exhausting during each pulse. The opening capability of the DTI switches also provides for arc protection of the load; exactly as they would in a hard-switch.

After studying candidate lattice designs; development efforts in the last year have concentrated on technology and physics challenges in four main areas: Injection; Vacuum Systems; Magnets and Insertion Devices; as well as main and harmonic RF systems.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopme084_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopme084.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopme084_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPME084,567

The energy deposition is distributed non-uniformly over the target; leading to a mechanical stress. As a result of large thermal gradient; the target could be potentially damaged. To avoid the target destruction; the peak energy deposition density (PEDD) in the target should be well below the critical limit (35J/g) based on the SLAC operational experience. With an expected primary electron spot size on the target of the SuperKEKB positron source; the PEDD will exceeds the limit. We will introduce a beam spoiler to enlarge the spot size by multiple scattering in thin beam screen and aluminum plate. It reduces the PEDD down to half of the limit. This paper describes the design of the spoiler and the beam screen system used in the positron beam commissioning of the SuperKEKB positron source started in 2014.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopri002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopri002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopri002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRI002,573

While a primary electron beam strikes on a target to generate positrons; an injection electron beam passes through a small hole besides the target. Since the injection electron orbit should be on axis to avoid emittance growth; the target and the flux concentrator for positron focusing have a few millimeters offset from the axis. This offset positron generation gives significant degradation in the positron yield. In this paper; we will discuss positron yield improvement by proper orientation of the cut-in slit of the flux concentrator which yields un-symmetric field distribution and primary electron incident point.

There is a strong demand of fully striped carbon ions because the DA is regarded as the second generation of cancer therapy driver; which does not require an injector and electron stripper. We need a novel carbon ion source providing C6+ beams; which are directly injected into the DA and accelerated up to required energy. For this purpose; a laser ablation ion source(LAIS) is promising**. To obtain high yield C6+ ions from ablation plasma; the laser irradiation condition has been evaluated and relationship between beam properties of charge spectrum; intensity; and temperature; and carbon target materials were examined. Two laser systems; long pulse (6 ns) and short pulse (170 ps); were employed to irradiate a graphite and amorphous carbon target. The current densities and profile of the generated plasmas in time were measured and charge state distributions were analyzed.

A new mask is designed to prevent cesium pollution of the cathode body. Instead of Kapton only alumina ceramics are used for isolation; and the cathode plugs are degassed at higher temperature. New evaporators are installed and tested to obtain an accurate deposition rate.

The charge distribution is introduced to the time-domain method based on a modified Fowler-Nordheim field emission model; which accounts for the band-bending of the charge carriers at the emitter surface. This algorithm is capable of considering various effects in the emission process such as space-charge; Coulomb blockade and image charge.

IPAC2014,,MOPRI027,Dark Current Studies at Relativistic Electron Gun for Atomic Exploration – REGAE,H. Delsim-Hashemi; K. Flöttmann; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; Electron diffraction is a tool for exploring structural dynamics of matter. The scattering cross section is orders of magnitude higher for electrons than for X-rays so that only a small number of electrons is required to achieve comparable results. However; the required electron beam quality is extraordinary. To study e. g. proteins a coherence length of 30 nm is required which translates into a transverse emittance of 5 nm at a spot size of 0.4mm. In addition short bunch lengths down to 10 fs and a temporal stability of the same order are required in order to study chemical reactions or phase transitions in pump probe type experiments. These are challenging parameters for an electron source; which demand improvements at many frontiers. Dark current degrades contrast of diffraction patterns in all experiments. Understanding dark-current generation and propagation can lead to better methods to decrease it. In this paper dark current studies that are performed at REGAE will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopri027_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopri027.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopri027_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRI027,649

The electrons emitted from one of the structure’s wall under certain conditions are accelerated by the RF field; thereby they may impact the wall again based on the field pattern in the structure. Accordingly the number of electrons increases exponentially caused by secondary electron emission*. The latter depends on the secondary emission coefficient of the surface material and the electron trajectory in the device under study**. This phenomenon limits the accelerating gradient in the cavity; moreover; it might cause an impair of RF components and distortion of the RF signal. Therefore; there should be an efficient countermeasure to suppress MP in order to boost the performance of the SRF gun. In this paper; three techniques of suppression of MP from the vicinity of the cathode; such as DC-bias; geometric modification and the microstructure of the cathode's surface; in the Rossendorf SRF gun are presented. The simulation has been done using CST Microwave Studio® and CST Particle Studio®***. Eventually; the efficient suppression method would be chosen for this particular case.; * H.Padamsee; J.

In an UHV system the electrons are extracted from a cold cathode by a mesh electrode under pulsed laser illumination (3.5 ns; 10 Hz; 0.5 – 5.9 eV; > 0.3 mJ) and so far analyzed by a CW-spectrometer. Quantum efficiency investigations of flat metal (Au; Ag of different surface orientations) and semiconductor crystals (n- and p-Si**; GaN) yielded the expected work functions and revealed first hints for PFE effects. However; the kinetic energy of the electrons could not be measured with the CW-spectrometer. In addition; the achievable electric field (< 20 MV/m) was limited by parasitic FE. Hence; the system is presently upgraded with a spectrometer (resolution < 3 meV) that can handle electron pulses and a dust reduced environment is installed at the load lock.

NEA-GaAs photo-cathode is a unique technology which is capable for generating highly polarized and extremely low emittance beam. Quantum efficiency (QE) of the cathode is high in near IR region; so it is favor to generate a high current density beam. These advantages are originated to the Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) surface; but it is fragile so the operational lifetime is limited. A study on a robust NEA surface cathode is reported. According to the hetero-junction model; Cs-Te thin film deposited on GaAs forms a robust NEA surface. We performed the Cs-Te evaporation experiment on a clean GaAs cathode and measured QE spectra.

It is necessary to remove oxide layers of GaAs surface for the NEA surface formation; therefore the thermal treatment was carried out prior to the NEA activation. We have discussed the quantum efficiency (QE) with different thermal history. GaAs surfaces cleaned with organic solvents were thermally treated with the temperature sequence of 773K; 823K; and 723K. The NEA activation was carried out at every temperature. The QE less than 1% was obtained with 773K of treatment temperature on the initial surface. Then the QE increased at 10% after treatment at higher 823K. Successive increase of the QE to 13% was observed with a reduced temperature treatment at 723K. The GaAs surfaces after the thermal treatment in the high temperature region with the NEA activation are different from the as-cleaned-GaAs surfaces probably in stoichiometry or morphology due to desorption of As and Ga atoms.

ASTeC have commissioned a Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS – an experimental facility designed to measure these transverse and longitudinal energy distributions) which can be used for III-V semiconductor; alkali antimonide/telluride and metal photocathode research*. GaAs photocathodes were activated in our photocathode preparation facility (PPF)**; then transferred to TESS under XHV conditions and progressively degraded through controlled exposure to oxygen.

Clean surfaces were prepared using Argon ion bombardment and quantum efficiency measured using a 265 nm UV LED light source with a picoammeter for drain current monitoring. Surface composition was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and a Kelvin probe apparatus provided work function measurements. Data was taken both before and after annealing to 200°C; a temperature that is routinely achieved during RF gun vacuum baking. Ion bombardment typically leaves a very rough surface that can have a detrimental effect on beam emittance; so further work will focus on the use of Oxygen plasma cleaning of the best candidate alternative metals. An oxygen plasma treated Copper photocathode has been shown to produce an acceptable level of quantum efficiency in the VELA accelerator at Daresbury Laboratory.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopri047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopri047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopri047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRI047,711

The PDPWA scheme consists of a seeding laser; a drive beam to establish the accelerating wakefields within the plasma cell; and a witness beam to be accelerated. The drive beam protons will be provided by the CERN's SPS. The plasma ionisation will be performed by a seeding laser and the drive beam protons to produce the accelerating wakefields. After establishing the wakefields; witness beam; namely; electron beam from a dedicated source should be injected into the plasma cell.

Most recently; plasmonic nanostructured metal surfaces or flat metal surfaces activated by an ultrathin MgO are under great attention. We report on a photocathode design combining these two approaches. It consists of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized by 3 MgO monolayers (MLs). Ag NPs were synthesized by an aerosol method and MgO was grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The NPs geometry was tuned to obtain broadband >50% absorption in the entire blue range as evidenced by UV-vis. spectroscopy. The WF of 3 MgO MLs/Ag NPs multilayer was reduced by 1 eV compared to bare NPs; from 5 to 4 eV; as evidenced by UPS and Kelvin probe. Reduction by 1 eV is maximal for this pair of materials; and agrees well with experimental and theoretical findings. While the effect on WF is indeed significant; a special handling protocol for Ag before depositing MgO is a must. It would preserve a clean Ag surface with a WF of nearly 4 eV to achieve 3 eV upon ALD of MgO. This and other issues are under study to promote photocathode applications.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/mopri058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/mopri058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/mopri058_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-MOPRI058,739

The neutrons have magnetic moments; hence their potential energy are not cancelled before and after passage of magnetic fields and their kinetic energy change finally when their spins are flipped in the fields. Nowadays most measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) are carried out with ultra cold neutrons (UCN); whose kinetic energies are lower than about 300 neV; and with a small storage bottle to reduce the systematic errors. In such experiments highly dense UCNs are desired. The spallation neutron sources generate high-density neutrons at the target; however; the pulsed neutrons with spread velocities are diffused in guide tubes during long beam transport. It is necessary to concentrate UCN temporally upon the bottle by controlling their velocities for nEDM experiments at those facilities.

Cooling enables high-precision experiments with stored beams; counteracts the heating during internal target operation and controls decelerated beams. New challenges lie ahead within the FAIR project like (i) the ongoing integration downstream of the ESR of the low-energy CRYRING with its electron cooler; (ii) the developments for the demanding CR stochastic cooling system; (iii) the stacking scenarios with RF and stochastic cooling in the HESR/RESR.

The new system enables electron cooling in the whole energy range of COSY. The electron beam is guided by longitudinal magnetic field all the way from the electron gun to the collector. This well-proven optics scheme was chosen because of the wide electron energy range of 0.025-2 MeV. The electrostatic accelerator consists of 33 individual sections of identical design. Electrical power to each section is provided by a cascade transformer. Electron beam commissioning and first studies using proton and deuteron beams were carried out.

A bare uranium beam is injected from the collector ring CR into the HESR at 740 MeV/u*. The simulation studies are now improved to include different injection schemes applying either the barrier cavity or the h = 1 cavity in the HESR. It is outlined how the new 2.5 MeV electron cooler at COSY Jülich or stochastic cooling can support the injection mechanism. The beam preparation for an internal target experiment with cooling is outlined. The acceleration of the ion beam is extended to 5 GeV/u under the mandatory condition of the available cavity voltages and the maximum magnetic field ramp rate in the HESR. The flexibility of the HESR ring lattice is utilized to avoid transition energy crossing during ramping up to 5 GeV/u and to adjust the rings’ frequency slip factor for optimal stochastic cooling. The cooling simulations include the beam-target interaction due to a hydrogen target.; * H.

Measurements and simulations of the previous run at 4 TeV have shown that the system is ready for the next step; running at 7 TeV; but at the same time some sensitive cleaning locations have been identified. In particular the dispersion suppressors downstream of the betatron cleaning region in IR7 are sensitive to single diffractive scattered protons from the collimator jaws. These particles can lead to magnet quenching. The MERLIN C++ library has been developed to exploit the functionality of an object oriented code; with improved collective effects and scattering routines. New single diffractive and elastic scattering routines; based on a fit of existing experimental data with the Regge theory of soft interactions of high energy scattering; is implemented in MERLIN.

DAEδALUS requires three neutrino sources driven by proton beams of ~800 MeV at powers of several megawatts placed at distances of 1.5; 8 and 20 km from the detector. Two cyclotrons working in cascade are chosen to deliver these high power beams. The first cyclotron accelerates the H2+ ions beam up to 60 MeV/amu. The beam is then extracted with an electrostatic deflector and reaccelerated up to 800 MeV/amu through a superconducting ring cyclotron. The acceleration of H2+ has two advantages: it reduces the space charge effect along the injection and acceleration inside the first cyclotron and allows the extraction of the beam from the last accelerator using a stripper foil. The injector cyclotron can be used in stand-alone mode to drive the IsoDAR experiment; which needs the accelerator placed near an underground neutrino detector.

The feasibility of a new slow extraction system for LEIR based on the third integer resonance was studied with two possible resonance driving mechanisms: quadrupole-driven extraction and RF-knockout extraction. The extraction of fully stripped carbon ions (20-440 MeV/u kinetic energies) has been studied in detail.

One of the main problems to be addressed is given by impedance-driven beam instabilities. About 40 % of the total measured SPS impedance is due to the kickers; of which the extraction kickers in two of the SPS straight sections are the largest systems. A potential upgrade is explored which would strongly reduce the number of extraction kickers required in the SPS; by performing non-local extraction.

Over the LHC injection processes; a drift of the beam trajectories has been observed in TI 2 and TI 8; requiring regular correction of the trajectories; in order to ensure clean injection into the LHC. Investigations of the trajectory variations in the transfer lines showed that the main source of short term trajectory drifts are current variations of the SPS extraction septa (MSE). The stability of the power converters has been improved; but the variations are still present and further improvements are being investigated. The stability over a longer period of time cannot be explained by this source alone. The analysis of trajectory variations shows that there are also slow variations in the SPS closed orbit at extraction. A set of SPS orbit measurements has been saved and analysed.

In a design calculation; it is found that the peak current density of 30 % can be reduced by introducing the octupole magnets.

The facility will aim a wide band beam of neutrinos toward a detector placed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota; about 1; 300 km away. The main elements of the facility are a primary proton beamline and a neutrino beamline. The primary proton beam (60-120 GeV) will be extracted from the MI-10 section of Fermilab’s Main Injector. Neutrinos are produced after the protons hit a solid target and produce mesons which are subsequently focused by a set of magnetic horns into a 204 m long decay pipe where they decay into muons and neutrinos. The parameters of the facility were determined taking into account the physics goals; spacial and radiological constraints and the experience gained by operating the NuMI facility at Fermilab.

IPAC2014,,TUZB02,Prospects for the use of HTS in High-field Magnets for Future Accelerator Facilities,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The enthusiasm that followed the discovery of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) and the hope that they could replace Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS) was damped by low current-carrying capacity; short piece lengths; and fragility of the brittle oxide materials. Development of applications was mainly on devices less demanding of conductor performance. However; with continuing development; progress was made with the cuprate superconductors; and long lengths of BSCCO 2223 and REBCO tape conductors are now commercially available. Progress has also been made in the development of BSSCO 2212 round wire; where implementation of a new production process has led to a breakthrough in performance. Though still at the research level; attainments in material synthesis and theoretical understanding of iron-based materials may lead to their development into practical superconductors; featuring high upper critical field and low anisotropy. A review of the potential of HTS as applied to accelerators is presented; with a focus on using the presently available materials and on the perceived needs for further development.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tuzb02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tuzb02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tuzb02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUZB02,974

TLEP and VHE-LHC would be respectively e-ebar and p-p colliders; at the energy frontier in each category; to be installed in a 80-100 km circumference tunnel. The main requirements in terms of operating field range and field quality are discussed. Two dimensional simulations then show how an iron-dominated magnet could fulfil the specifications. The design is a ""transmission-line"" magnet; where the excitation current is provided by a single turn. When operating with leptons; a resistive conductor can be used. To then increase the strength needed to handle hadrons; the use of superconducting technology is needed. Recent results on similar prototypes built for different machines are recalled to point to the developments needed to assess the viability of this design.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tuocb01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tuocb01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tuocb01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUOCB01,980

The beam is much more sensitive to non-linear perturbations in this region; such as those induced by the fringe fields of the low-beta quadrupoles. Analytical evaluations of detuning with amplitude and chromatic effects show that the effect is small; but not negligible. Therefore; the effect on long-term beam dynamics is evaluated via tracking simulations. Different tracking models are compared in order to provide a numerical estimate of this effect due to the proposed inner triplet quadrupoles.

These include the Nb3Sn superconducting (SC) inner triplet quadrupoles; Nb-Ti SC separation dipoles D1 and D2; and SC matching quadrupoles Q4 and Q5. The large aperture is necessary for accommodating the increased beam size caused by significantly higher beta functions in these magnets in the collision optics. The high beta functions also enhance the effects of field errors in these magnets leading to a smaller dynamic aperture (DA). It is; therefore; critical to determine the field quality specifications for these magnets which 1) satisfy an acceptable DA; and 2) are realistically achievable. The estimates of expected field quality obtained from magnetic field calculations and measurements were used as a starting point.

Machine availability is even more important for the future High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [1]. In this paper a Monte Carlo approach has been used to predict integrated luminosity as a function of LHC machine availability. The baseline model assumptions such as fault-time distributions and machine failure rate (number of fills with stable beams dumped after a failure / total number of fills with stable beams) were deduced from the observations during LHC operation in 2012. The predictions focus on operation after LS1 and its evolution towards HL-LHC. The extrapolation of relevant parameters impacting on machine availability is outlined and their corresponding impact on fault time distributions is discussed. Results for possible future operational scenarios are presented.

The energy stored in the beam was progressively increased beyond the 140 MJ range at the end of 2012 at 4 TeV/c. The further increase to 364 MJ expected for 2015 at 6.5 TeV/c should be possible with the existing protection systems. For HL-LHC; additional failure modes are considered. The stored beam energy will increase by another factor of two with respect to nominal and a factor of five more than experienced so far. The maximum beta function will increase. It is planned to install crab cavities in the LHC. With crab cavities; sudden voltage decays within 100 us after e.g. cavity quenches lead to large beam oscillations. Tracking simulations predict trajectory distortions of up to 1.5 σ in the first turn after a sudden drop of the deflecting voltage in a single cavity within 3 turns. The energy of several MJ stored in halo protons that could hit the collimator in case of such events is far above damage level; even if the collimator jaws are made of robust material.

All these issues require more precise and more efficient optics measurements and corrections to guarantee the same optics quality level as in 2012 when a 7% peak beta-beating was achieved. This paper summarizes the on-going efforts for achieving faster and more accurate optics measurements and corrections.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO018,

In this paper; we present two such methods; which are capable of localising sources of beam offset jitter with a combination of correlation studies and so called degree of freedom plots. The methods were applied to the ATF2 beam line at KEK; where one of the major goals is the reduction of the beam offset jitter. Results of this localisation are shown in this paper. A big advantage of the presented method is its high robustness especially to varying optics parameters. Therefore; we believe that the developed beam offset jitter localisation methods can be easily applied to other accelerators.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro019_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro019.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro019_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO019,

The upgraded LHCb foresees a peak luminosity of L = 1-2 . 1033 cm-2 s−1; with a pileup of 5. This represents ten times more luminosity and five times more pile up than in the present LHC. With these conditions; the pp-collisions and beam losses will produce a non-negligeable beam-induced energy deposition in the interaction region. More precisely; studies have shown that the energy deposition will especially increase on the D2 recombination dipole; which could bring them close to their safety thresholds. To avoid this; the placement of a minimal neutral absorber has been proposed. This absorber will have the same role as the TAN in the high luminosity Interaction Regions (IR) 1 and 5. This study shows the possible dimensions and location of this absorber; and how it would reduce both the peak power density and total heat load.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro020_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro020.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro020_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO020,

Because some LHC experiments are limited in the maximum event rates; their luminosity is leveled to a constant value. Various techniques may be used for luminosity leveling; changing the betatron function at the interaction point is one of them. This paper explains the main operational requirements of a betatron function leveling scheme for the upcoming LHC run. Issues concerning the beam optics; orbits and collimator settings are discussed.

We present the current possibilities for doing luminosity levelling for HL-LHC. We explore the merits and drawbacks of each option and briefly discuss the operational implications. The simplest option being levelling with an offset between the two beams. In particular, we look at the possibility of using flat beams in the IPs for all the available options and investigate their benefits and drawbacks, using the code COMBI. Flat beams would allow an additional degree of freedom, with the levelling only required in one of the planes at any given IP.

In the stretcher ring various depolarizing resonances are crossed during the fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s. The high polarization degree of up to 70% can only be conserved by taking several appropriate countermeasures. Concerning integer resonances; additional harmonic horizontal fields are applied by orbit correction magnets around the ring to compensate the resonance driving fields. The correction field has to be adjusted by empirical optimization of polarization. Recent developments enhance this optimization process; especially at high energies: A new magnet system allows for higher correction amplitudes and shorter rising times. Furthermore; a modified correction scheme was implemented. It takes into account the additional fields of the quadrupole magnets; arising from the orbit response of the correction magnets.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro039_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro039.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro039_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO039,

To preserve the initial degree of polarization; the acceleration is performed by a fast energy ramp with a maximum ramping speed of 6 GeV/s. During acceleration especially the vertical orbit needs to be continuously corrected so that the vertical rms deviation does not exceed 50 μm at any time. In order to compensate the so called integer resonances; which occur at certain energies; the orbit correction system further needs to provide additional; empirically determined; harmonic field distributions. A successful application of these combined correction measures requires a considerably high bandwidth of up to some 100 Hz. In our contribution we will have a closer look at the performance and the acquired bandwidth of the correction system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO040,

To meet this requirement low-order machine resonances have to be compensated. The linear coupling resonance Qx+Qy=43 has been identified as the potential source for significant particle losses at the collimator. The resonance compensation scheme has been studied experimentally by using a low intensity beam. To understand this process the simulations have been performed by using the PTC-ORBIT code. The Main Ring model has been developed to reproduce the machine operation including the initial stage of the acceleration. The 6D beam model has been defined to represent the ‘pencil’ beam used for this study.

KG; Hanau; Germany; The gap induction and thus the K-factor of permanent magnet undulators may be increased by cooling them to cryogenic temperatures. The use of NdFeB-magnets in cryogenic undulators; however; is limited to temperatures above 140 K due to the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) which leads to a reduction of the magnetization level. A further increase of the gap induction in undulators may be achieved by use of PrFeB-magnets at even lower temperatures; as this alloy does not show the SRT phenomenon. Although the effects are well known; up to now only a few undulator prototypes were built using this class of material since the coercivity of ternary PrFeB-magnets is not sufficient to minimize the risk of partial demagnetization when the undulator structure is kept at room temperature. This problem can be solved by applying actual technologies like grain-boundary diffusion in order to achieve coercivities exceeding 20 kOe at RT without sacrificing the high remanence Br of about 1.6 T at 77 K. We will provide actual data of the magnet performance achieved and show up the technological limitations in building PrFeB-based CPMU’s.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro085_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro085.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro085_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO085,

A simple; fast; low cost measurement method on small size PMQs (Permanent Magnet Quadrupoles) is described. It is based on the same principle of the familiar ""rotating coil technique""; but in this case; profiting of the small dimensions of the PMQ; it consists in rotating the PMQ itself instead of the coil.

Permanent magnets can be advantageous over electromagnets in terms of reliability; stability and compactness in addition to the small power consumption. No unexpected down of an accelerator due to power supply failure is supposed to happen. There is no cooling water flow that can induce a fluctuation of the magnetic field. These features may become important for future light sources; where a very reliable; stable; and compact ring is required. In addition; the power consumption is now one of the most important issues after the 3.11 disaster in Japan. One of critical issues to realize such a magnet is that a magnetic field has to be tuned. In the future; combined-functioned and longitudinally gradient magnets will play a key role in achieving extremely small emittance. In such a case; changing a gap will not work any more. We have designed and fabricated a permanent dipole magnet of which magnetic field can be tuned without changing the gap. The results of the performance test will be presented and a possibility to apply it for future light sources will be discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro092_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro092.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro092_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO092,

Magnet field ripples are considered as a main origin of the beam ripples among various possible sources. Although magnet power supply ripples are generally treated as the dominating ripple source; the load circuit parameters of the magnets and their interconnections are also playing critical roles in defining the ripple amplitudes and frequencies. In this viewpoint; the magnet power supplies are treated as simplified current sources; and the ripples generated in the circuit systems are investigated both in analytical and numerical ways. One of the findings in this direction of investigation is the existence of intrinsic ripples. The intrinsic ripples occur inevitably in the synchrotron magnets; no matter how the power supplies are producing idealistic current ramp patterns. Their amplitudes are defined by the circuit parameters such as inductance and capacitance; and the ramp parameters such as ramp rates. Some of the analytical mechanisms in generating the magnet field ripples are presented as well as the studied examples.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupro093_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupro093.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupro093_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRO093,

The kicker design task is: impulsive force value is 1 mT*m; pulse edge is 5 ns; and impulse duration is about 200 ns. The unconventional approach to kicker design was offered. The possibility for set of wires using instead of plates using is considered. This approach allows us to reduce the effective plate surface. In this case we can decrease effects related to induced charges and currents. In the result of modelling optimal construction was developed. It includes 6 wires. The magnet aperture is about 5 cm. Calculated field rise time (about 1.5 ns) satisfies the conditions. Induced current effect reducing idea was confirmed. For configuration with 3 wires pair (with cross section of 2 mm) induced current in one wire is about 10% and in the wall is about 40%. However for design with plates current is about 40% and 20% respectively. Obtained magnet construction allows controlling of high field homogeneity by changing currents magnitudes in wires.

KG; Hanau; Germany; A common problem for elliptically polarizing undulators (EPUs) is that the magnetic forces give a mechanical deflection in the magnet holder construction when changing the undulator phase. Gluing horizontally and vertically magnetized blocks together can increase the mechanical stability of the magnet holders. The gluing process of pairs of magnetized magnet blocks is time-consuming; expensive and difficult to carry out with high positional precision. A novel magnet production technique has been developed where un-magnetized pairs of blocks are glued together before magnetization. The large number of parts; the time for assembly; and the cost of the EPU can be reduced with the novel magnet production technique. The novel magnet production method has been used for a 2.6 m long EPU of APPLE-II type; which has been built in-house at the MAX IV Laboratory. The frame for the EPU is made of cast iron in order to get a small mechanical deformation when changing phase in the inclined mode.

Each magnet is equipped with a main current circuit and five auxiliary current-circuits; which allows controlling the linear and non-linear magnetic fields.

The bending in a hybrid synchrotron is created with interleaved cold and warm dipoles; the warm dipoles modulate the average bending field for the different particle momenta. A key challenge for the warm dipole magnets is the ramp rate; which is equivalent to frequencies of 400-1000 Hz. Recently a design has been suggested which employs 6.5 Si steel for the return yoke and FeCo for the poles. In simulations the design has shown a good performance (up to 2T) due to the FeCo and acceptable power losses by employing SiFe with a high Si content.

A polarized positron beam can be produced with a helical undulator passed by the accelerated electron beam to create a high power polarized photon beam. The photon beam penetrates a thin titanium-alloy rotating target wheel of 1m diameter with 500 to 2000 rpm rotation speed and produces polarized positrons. The system should run for 1-2 years without failure. A break down can occur due to the huge heat load in a short time (<1ms). The target design must keep the resulting thermo-mechanical stress below the yield strength and the fatigue limit of the material. FEM ANSYS simulations are used to evaluate the thermo-mechanical stress as well as the vibrations at the bearings of the rotating system.

In the current baseline design; positron generation by gamma rays from undulator radiation is assumed. However; this approach is totally new and it is very difficult to demonstrate the system prior to the construction because it requires more than 100 GeV beam as the driver. A conventional positron generation (e-driven) has been proposed as a technical backup option. In this method; the technology is well established; but the issue is to obtain an enough amount of positron with a manageable energy deposition on target. We present a result of a systematic study of capture efficiency defined by DR (Damping Ring) acceptance where the beam emittance is reduced by radiation damping.

A prototype of this quadrupole is under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory (USA). In CLIC; the Compact Linear Collider under study at CERN; we are studying another conceptual solution for the QD0. This is due to two main reasons: all the magnets of the Beam Delivery System will need to be stabilized in the nano-meter range and extremely tight alignment tolerances are required. The proposed solution; now baseline for CLIC; is a room temperature hybrid quadrupole based on electromagnetic coils and permanent magnet blocks (iron-dominated magnet). In this paper we present a conceptual design for a hybrid solution studied and adapted also to the ILC project. A special super-ferric solution is proposed to make the cross section compatible with the experiments layout. This design matches the compactness requirement with the advantages of stability and alignment precision; aspects critical also for ILC in order to achieve the design luminosity.

In each; a channel first reduces the emittance of a train of 21 muon bunches until it becomes possible to merge them into a single bunch; one of each sign. The single bunches are then sent through a second rectilinear channel for further cooling towards the requirements of a Muon Collider. We adopt this approach for a new cooling lattice design for the Muon Collider; and for the first time present a end-to-end simulation.

Through this process a significant background of protons and electrons are generated; which may result in heat deposition on superconducting materials and activation of the machine.

The key idea of our scheme is a hybrid approach that uses high-pressure gas to avoid cavity breakdown; along with discrete LiH absorbers to provide the majority of the energy loss.

On these occasions; observables such as pressure rise; heat load in the cold sections as well as clear signatures on bunch-by-bunch emittance blow up; particle loss and energy loss indicated the presence of an EC in a large portion of the LHC. The analysis of the recorded data; together with EC build up simulations; has led to a significant improvement of our understanding of the EC effect in the different components of the LHC.

The latter; however; can also be achieved by de-populating the bunch centre. This was demonstrated during the dedicated machine development session in the LHC using RF phase modulation.

After a large campaign of shielding of 800 inter-magnet vacuum ports in 1999 - 2001; the microwave instability threshold was significantly increased and the high-frequency spectrum of the beam became practically flat; apart from a prominent peak at around 1.4 GHz. As corresponding high-frequency impedance could potentially lead to microwave instability of high intensity bunches observed now at high energies in the SPS; a search of the source of this impedance was launched. Using a combination of impedance simulations and measurements; vacuum flanges that are present in a large quantity in the machine have been identified as a main source of impedance at this frequency.

Breakdown of dielectric structure induced by multiphoton ionization can be mitigated by adopting long wavelength driver laser. Since the dielectric structure scales with the laser wavelength; fabrication tolerances for dielectric structure are relaxed as well. The 5-μm laser source is based on two cascaded optical parametric amplifiers (OPA): a 2-μm BBO OPA with a mixed phase matching scheme is used as a pump source; and a type-I phase-matched ZGP OPA is designed to produce sub-mJ; <100 fs 5-μm laser pulses. The two-stage 2-μm OPA is pumped by a Ti:sapphire amplifier and produces pulse energy of ~2.2 mJ with a pulse duration of 42 fs (~6 optical cycles); and excellent pulse stability and beam quality.

Research and development on these topics is presently ongoing at various places at DESY; as add-on experiments at operational facilities.

We study the possibility of injecting a bunch created by a laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerator (LWFA). We consider a first plasma source used for self-modulation of the drive bunch and a gas discharge source for acceleration of the collinearly injected bunch. The LWFA produces an electron bunch very short when compared to the PWFA wavelength and with relatively large current; possibly allowing for loading of the wakefields. Short length and high current lead to a small final energy spread. Co-linear injection preserves the incoming bunch quality and insures trapping and acceleration of the whole bunch. The energy of the LWFA electron bunch can easily exceed the trapping energy and can be produced over only a few millimeters gas-jet plasma driven by a laser of relatively modest power by today’s standards. We explore the parameter space suitable for this injection scheme that is more compact; simpler to implement and more suitable for injection in the mm-size accelerator structure.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupme048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupme048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupme048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPME048,
IPAC2014,,TUPME049,Hosing Suppression in the Self-modulated Wakefield Accelerator,IPFN; Lisbon; Portugal; UCLA; Los Angeles; California; USA; MPI; Muenchen; Germany; The proton driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PDPWFA) uses short LHC proton (p+) bunches (shorter than the plasma wavelength) as drivers for strongly non-linear plasma waves. Simulations showed that the PDPWFA could be used to accelerate electrons to 600 GeVs in 600 m long plasmas*. Currently available p+ bunches are much longer than the plasma wavelength; being ideal to excite intese wakefields through the self-modulation instability (SMI). An experiment is being prepared at CERN to demonstrate SMI of p+ bunches. In addition; lepton SMI experiments are also being prepared at SLAC; DESY-PITZ and RAL. The hosing instability (HI) is a competing instability that may lead to beam breakup; and needs to be controlled over the long propagation distances required for SMI growth and saturation. In this work we show that the HI can be suppressed after SMI saturation in the linear wakefield excitation regime. SMI saturation before beam-break up can be achieved by seeding SMI; and as long as the initial bunch centroid displacements are within the initial bunch transverse size. The HI suppression occurs via a plasma analogue of the BNS damping in conventional accelerators.; * A. Caldwell et al; Nat. Physics Nat.

Self-modulation is the result of the action of focusing/defocusing transverse wakefields on the bunch radius. Self-modulation leads to observables such as overall defocusing of the bunch; periodic modulation of the bunch radius at the wake period and multi-GeV energy gain/loss by drive bunch particles. Defocusing is observed from OTR images; radial self-modulation from CTR spectra and interferometric traces and energy gain/loss from energy spectra with sub-GeV resolution. The plasma density is varied by changing the vapor density ionized by a laser/axicon system. The bunch length; radius and charge can also be varied. The SMI can be seeded using a notch collimator system. Numerical simulations indicate that seeding the SMI mitigates the hose instability. Hose instability can also be seeded; for example by using the RF deflecting cavity to impart a tilt to the incoming bunch axis.

A. Sahai; T.C. Katsouleas; Duke ECE; Durham; North Carolina; USA; MPI-P; München; Germany; We model the trapping of plasma electrons within the density structures excited by a propagating energy source in a rising plasma density gradient. Rising density gradient leads to spatially contiguous coupled up-chirped plasmons (d{ω2pe(x)}/{dx}>0). Therefore phase mixing between plasmons can lead to trapping until the plasmon field is high enough such that e- trajectories returning towards a longer wavelength see a trapping potential. Rising plasma density gradients are ubiquitous for confining the plasma within sources at the vacuum-plasma interfaces. Therefore trapping of plasma-e- in a rising ramp is important for acceleration diagnostics and to understand the energy dissipation from the excited plasmon train [1]. Down-ramp in density [2][3] has been used for plasma-e- trapping within the first bucket behind the driver. Here; in rising density gradient the trapping does not occur in the first plasmon bucket but in subsequent plasmon buckets behind the driver. Trapping reduces the Hamiltonian of each bucket where e- are trapped; so it is a wakefield-decay probe. Preliminary computational results for beam and laser-driven wakefield are shown.; 1.Sahai; A.

In previous works we investigated the case of a single boundary in a waveguide*. Now we study the electromagnetic field of the bunch moving in a dielectric circular waveguide and crossing a vacuum cavity. The main attention is given to the case when wakefield (Cherenkov radiation) is generated in dielectric. The behavior of the total field depending on distance and time is explored numerically. Analytical estimations are made as well. Influence of the vacuum gap on the wakefield is considered for different lengths of the gap. It is clarified conditions when the vacuum gap does not practically influence on the wakefield. It is noted that the quasi monochromatic wave (the Cherenkov transition radiation) generated in the vacuum region can be used for restoration of the field in the area after the gap. This effect can be achieved for some optimal parameters of the problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupme054_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupme054.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupme054_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPME054,

The density of charge carriers; ~ 1024 – 1029 m-3; of crystals is significantly higher than that of a plasma gas; and correspondingly in principle wakefield gradients of up to 0.1 - 10 TV/m are possible. Our simulations (VORPAL and CST-PIC) with Fermilab-ASTA* beam parameters showed that micro-bunched beam gains energy up to ~ 70 MeV along the 100 um long channel under the resonant coupling condition of the plasma wavelength; ~ 10 um. Also; with lowering a charge; electron bunches channeling through a high-density plasma medium have higher energy gain in a hollow channel than in a uniformly filled cylinder; which might be attribute to lower scattering ratios of the tunnel structure. The numerical analysis implied that synthetic crystalline plasma media (e.g. carbon nanotubes) have potential to mitigate constraint of bunch charges required for beam-driven acceleration in high density plasma media.

This can be achieved by external injection of beams into a plasma accelerator. SINBAD is a proposed dedicated accelerator research and development facility at DESY where amongst other topics laser-driven wakefield acceleration with external injection of ultra-short bunches will be exploited. To minimise energy-spread growth the bunch should occupy a small fraction of the plasma wavelength. In addition it has to be longitudinally synchronised with the laser driver to high accuracy. To avoid emittance growth the beam Twiss parameters have to be matched to the intrinsic beta-function of the plasma. To facilitate matching and synchronisation; acceleration at low plasma densities can be advantageous. We present a preparatory feasibility study for future plasma experiments at SINBAD using simulations with the particle-in-cell code OSIRIS. Field-gradient scaling laws are presented together with parameter scans of externally injected bunch; such as its injection phase; charge and length.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupme064_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupme064.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupme064_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPME064,
IPAC2014,,TUPME069,Proton Electron Accelerator at CERN,MPI; Muenchen; Germany; AWAKE is a proton driven plasma-wakefield acceleration at CERN*; that uses long proton bunches ~ 400 ps from the SPS. In a dense plasma; a long proton bunch is subject toμbunching at plasma period due to the self-modulation instability; SMI**. The self-modulated proton bunch generates large amplitude charge separation through resonant wakefield excitation. Numerical simulations show that when seeded the SMI can grow and saturate over ~4 m in a plasma with density in the (1-10) *1014/cc range. Seeding also allows for deterministic injection of witness bunches in the focusing and accelerating phase of the wakefields. The SPS proton bunch carrying kJ of energy is a unique driver for generation of ~ GeV/m wakefields through 10’s of meters of plasma. The side-injected electrons ~15 MeV can reach GeV energies.

Externally injected electrons are accelerated in a large gradient (~GeV/m) wakefield. The large gradient is achieved by resonant formation of the wakefield by a train of micro-bunches. Transverse modulation of a long (~12 cm) proton bunch by the self modulation instability** creates these plasma wavelength size (~1 mm) micro-bunches. This resonant mechanism brings a strict requirement on the plasma density uniformity; namely % 0.2; in order for the injected electron bunch to remain in the accelerating and focusing phase of the wakefields. We describe the plasma source*** that satisfies this requirement during the beam plasma interaction. Rb vapor with ~1015 cm-3 density is confined in a 10 m long 4 cm diameter; stainless-steel tube which is heated to ~200 Co by an oil heat exchanger. The access to the source during interaction is provided by custom built fast valves. The vapor is fully tunnel ionized (first e-) by a laser forming a 2 mm diameter plasma channel.,,* http://awake.web.cern.ch/awake/  ** http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.255003  *** http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2013.10.093 reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupme073_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupme073.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupme073_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPME073,

Instrumental to the experiment is the self-modulation of a proton beam to generate bunches short enough for producing high acceleration fields. As electron bunches are easier to handle and the underlying physics is identical; it is judicious to first gain insight into the experimental conditions of the self-modulation of long particle beams in plasma by using electron bunches before progressing to the experiment with proton bunches. The experimental demonstration of self-modulation of an electron bunch is in preparation at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY; location Zeuthen (PITZ).

The first stage of the experiment will consist in proving the self-modulation; in the plasma; of a long proton bunch into micro-bunches. The success of this experiment requires an almost perfect concentricity of the proton and laser beams; over the full length of the plasma cell. The complexity of integrating the laser into the proton beam line and fulfilling the strict requirements in terms of pointing precision of the proton beam at the plasma cell are described. The second stage of the experiment foresees also the injection of electron bunches to probe the accelerating wakefields driven by the proton beam. Studies were performed to evaluate the possibility of injecting the electron beam parallel and with an offset to the proton beam axis. This option would imply that protons and electrons will have to share the last few meters of a common beam line.

This will be the first experiment to demonstrate electron acceleration by use of a proton driven plasma wakefield. The 400 GeV proton beam from the CERN SPS will excite a wakefield in a plasma cell several metres in length. To observe the plasma wakefield; electrons of a few MeV will be injected into the wakefield following the head of the proton beam. Simulations indicate that electrons will be accelerated to GeV energies by the plasma wakefield. The AWAKE spectrometer is intended to measure both the peak energy and energy spread of these accelerated electrons. The baseline design makes use of a single dipole magnet to separate the electrons from the proton beam. The dispersed electron beam then impacts on a scintillator screen: the resulting scintillation light is collected and recorded by an intensified CCD camera. The design of the spectrometer is detailed with a focus on the scintillator screen.

The role of the radiation monitors will be to protect the particle tracking detectors (Trackers) from dangerous levels of RF dark currents and the as- sociated photon fluxes that could potentially be produced in the RF cavities. If such levels of radiation should occur the radiation monitor will ensure that the radiation shields (shutters) are closed thereby protecting the Tracker modules. The radiation monitor will be positioned on these radiation shields and will monitor x-rays; gamma-rays and electrons up to a few MeV. It is expected that the spectrum will peak at very low energies; since the peak voltage across the cavities is 8 MV/m and so the maximum energy that an electron could gain is 12 MeV (maximally accelerated from all four RF cavities).

Proton and ion applications such as hadron therapy will necessarily have a slower acceleration rate; so their feasibility depends on how harmful resonance crossing is in this regime. A simple and useful tool to answer such fundamental questions is the S-POD linear Paul trap at Hiroshima University; which can be set up to simulate the dynamics of a beam in an FFAG. We report here results of experiments to explore different resonance crossing speeds; quantify beam loss and study nonlinear effects. We also discuss the implications of these experimental results in terms of limits on acceptable acceleration rates and alignment errors.; [1] S.Machida et al; Nature Physics; N8; 243-257 (2012),,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI009,

Along with this new cavity; a new gun cryostat has been introduced. It combines several minor updates to the setup with the installation of a superconducting solenoid right at the exit of the gun; compensating the emittance growth of the electron bunch at an early stage.

The high energetic electrons ionize the residual gas molecules in the beam pipe by collisions or synchrotron radiation. The generated ions in turn accumulate inside the beam potential; causing several undesired effects such as tune shifts and beam instabilities. These effects are studied experimentally at ELSA using its full diagnostic capabilities. Both tune shifts due to beam neutralization and transversal beam-ion instabilities can be determined from the beam spectrum. Additionally the beam's transfer function can be measured using a broadband transversal kicker. In the stretcher ring at a beam energy of 1.2 GeV; a periodic beam blow-up was detected in the horizontal plane. Additional measurements of the transversal beam spectrum and ns-time resolution observations with a streak camera identified this blow-up as a coherent dipole oscillation of the beam. This horizontal instability is presumably caused by trapped ions; as there is a strong correlation with the high voltage-bias of the clearing electrodes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI016,

The artificial collisions generate a stochastic noise spectrum. As a consequence the entropy and the emittance of the particle beam can growth along periodic focusing structures. The growth rates depend on the number of simulation macro-particles and on the space charge tune shifts. For long-term tracking studies the numerical diffusion can lead to incorrect beam loss predictions. In our study we present analytical prediction for the numerical friction and diffusion in 2D and 3D simulations. For simple focusing structures with derive a relation between the friction coefficient and the entropy growth.

Besides the original γt-shift scenario; an alternative RF proton cycle has been recently studied: the transition energy is crossed with possibly a gamma transition jump. The flexibility of the lattice allowing to change the value of γt; a transition crossing has been considered for two possible energies. This challenging scenario is limited by several constraints such as space charge; a small momentum acceptance and by the required RF manipulations aiming to produce the final single bunch beam in the future SIS-100. This paper focuses on how the high intensity beam would suffer of the mismatch in bunch length at transition and new sets of beam parameter are defined for the proton beam.

IPAC2014,,TUPRI025,"Interplay of Touschek Scattering, Intrabeam Scattering, and RF Cavities in Ultralow-emittance Storage Rings",MAX-lab; Lund; Sweden; When it goes into operation in 2016; the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring will be the first ultralow-emittance storage ring based on a multibend achromat lattice. These lattices make use of a large number of weak bending magnets which considerably reduces the amount of power radiated in the dipoles in comparison to power radiated from insertion devices. Therefore parameters such as emittance; energy spread; and radiated power are no longer constant during a typical user shift. Since the charge per bunch is usually high; intrabeam scattering (IBS) becomes very strong creating a dependence of emittance on stored current. Since the bunch length can vary as insertion device gaps change; the emittance blow-up from IBS is not constant either. Therefore; the emittance; bunch length; and hence the resulting Touschek lifetime have to be calculated in a self-consistent fashion taking into account the bare lattice; RF cavity settings; bunch charge; and gap settings. This paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (insertion devices; emittance coupling); longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic Landau cavities); and choice of stored current.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri025_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri025.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri025_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI025,

Scattering of beam particles on rest gas molecules may have a detrimental effect at such low energies and leads to stringent vacuum requirements. Within this contribution scattering of the stored beam on rest gas molecules is discussed for very low beam energies. It is important to carefully distinguish between antiprotons scattered out of the acceptance and lost; and those remaining inside the aperture to avoid overestimation of emittance blow-up. Furthermore; many antiprotons do not interact at all during the time they are stored in ELENA and hence this is not a multiple scattering process,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri028_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI028,

Due to the rather long proton and heavy-ion bunches; the relevant spectrum is below 100MHz. For the computation of beam coupling impedances in the low frequency regime; frequency domain methods are more advantageous than (explicit) time domain methods. We show the setup of a 2D finite element code that allows to compute the impedance for arbitrary longituninally homogeneous beam and structure shapes. Perfectly conducting pipes; a dispersive ferrite tube; and thin resistive beam pipe serve as test cases. The influence of the beam velocity on the coupling impedance is studied.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri045_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri045.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri045_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI045,

Under some bunch filling patterns; residual gas ions created by scattering process between high energy electrons and residual gas molecules can be trapped stably around the electron beam and disturb the original motion of the beam. We have considered the stability of the electron beam due to the ion related phenomenon under several bunch filling patterns by computer simulation.

The instability occurs when chromaticity is fully corrected during acceleration but on the other hand no instabilities are observed for a full chromatic correction only at the injection energy even for a beam power up to 500 kW. However; the situation may change for a beam power of 1 MW and also for the upgraded injection beam energy from the present 181 MeV to the 400 MeV; as space charge effect in the non-relativistic region is believed to suppress the growth rate of beam instability. In order to study the kicker impedance in detail; recently we have introduced measured time dependent impedance source in the ORBIT simulation code in a realistic manner. The ORBIT code itself has also been well upgraded and given realistic features for application to synchrotrons.

Reduction techniques for resistive-wall components entail high electrical-conductivity coatings. This paper proposes the use of metamaterials; having negative values of magnetic permeability or dielectric permittivity (or both); for sensibly reducing or theoretically nearly cancelling the resistive-wall component of beam-coupling impedance. The proposed approach is developed by means of an equivalent transmission-line model; whose results show the potential reduction of both longitudinal and transverse impedance when using metamaterial insertions. The effects on the real and imaginary part have been singled out. The effectiveness of such materials is discussed both for negative-permittivity and for negative-permeability cases; which actually show different impacts and can be then target of proper engineering.

The very low reactive impedance of the LHC; with Im(Z/n) around 0.1 Ohm; is not easy to measure. The most sensitive observation is the loss of Landau damping during acceleration; which shows at which energy bunches become unstable depending on their parameters. In addition; the synchrotron frequency shift due to the reactive impedance was estimated following two methods. Firstly; it was obtained from the peak-detected Schottky spectrum. Secondly; a sine modulation in the RF phase was applied to the bunches with different intensities and the modulation frequency was scanned.

This is expected to be a reasonable assumption for devices whose length is greater than the transverse dimension but may be a less accurate approximation for segmented devices. In this contribution we present the extension of the study of the beam coupling impedance of a finite length device to the transverse plane. In order to take into account the finite length; we decompose the fields in the cavity and in the beam pipe into a set of orthonormal modes and apply the Mode Matching method to obtain the impedance. To validate our method; we will present comparisons between analytical formulas and 3D electromagnetic CST simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri062_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri062.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri062_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI062,

CST 3-D EM simulations are widely used to estimate the impedance contribution of the different devices along the CERN accelerator complex. Unlike the highly relativistic case; in which the reliability of the EM solver has been proved in many specific cases by comparing simulations with analytical results; the nonrelativistic case has been so far not yet benchmarked. In order to use systematically CST 3-D EM simulations for the PS-Booster; or even lower energy machines like the antiproton decelerator ELENA; a validation campaign has been carried out. The main complication to single out the beam coupling impedance; as resulting from the interaction of the beam with the surroundings; consisted of removing reliably the strong contribution of the direct space charge of the source bunch; which is included in the EM calculation. The simulation results were then benchmarked with the analytical results for the case of a PEC cylindrical tube and of a ferrite loaded kicker.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri063_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri063.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri063_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI063,

These experiments are intended to characterize the dependence of beam–EC interactions on various beam parameters; such as bunch spacing and vertical chromaticity. Most experiments were performed with 30 or 45-bunch trains; at a fixed current of 0.75 mA/bunch. Earlier experiments with positrons had varied the bunch spacing between 4 and 56 ns at three different vertical chromaticity settings. More recent measurements have included electron-bunch trains to contrast the build up of EC between electron and positron beams. The dynamics of the stored beam was quantified using: a gated Beam Position Monitor (BPM) and spectrum analyzer to measure the frequency spectrum of bunches in the trains; an x-ray beam size monitor to record the bunch-by-bunch; turn-by-turn vertical size of each bunch within the trains.

In the basic layout; one three-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter will be used for each single bunch and oscillation mode.

The digital filter is completely described by two parameters; the feedback gain and the passband center frequency; which have to be defined depending on the longitudinal beam dynamics.

Complementary control systems downstream the collision (Interaction Point FeedBack (IPFB); Orbit FeedBack(OFB)) allow low frequency vibration rejection. This paper focus on a dedicated AVI table designed for the last focusing quadrupole QD0 where the specifications are the most stringent. Combining FeedForward (FF) and FeedBack (FB) techniques; the prototype is able to reduce GM down to 0.6 nm RMS(4Hz) experimentally without load. These performances couldn’t be achieved without cutting edge-technology such as sub-nanometer piezo actuator; ultra-low noise accelerometer and seismometers and an accurate guidance system. The whole AVI system is described in detail.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/tupri088_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/tupri088.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/tupri088_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-TUPRI088,

The limited effort toward improving such big misalignments has long been pursued but could not finish especially after the earthquake in March 2011. This linac is now under upgrade to the SuperKEKB; where the required alignment is 0.1mm in σ for the short distance in 100m span; while 0.3mm through the whole linac for the emittance preservation. The straight line as a reference for the alignment was defined by laser beam over 500m. The actual hardwares are set with respect to this reference line by using a laser tracker. The alignment present status is reported in this paper. On the other hand; we noticed; through the alignment measurements over months; that the tunnel floor moved in the range of 0.1mm or maybe more. The evaluation of this movement is on-going to discuss about how to achieve the required emittance and how to keep the situation.

The linac consists of two straight sections connected by a 180 degree ARC. Precise alignment of the ARC magnets is one of the key issues for the emittance preservation of the electron beam. The ARC beam line was defined by measuring these two straight lines. Then; the misalignment of the ARC magnets were reduced from 3 mm maximum down to 0.1mm in the errors perpendicular to the beam direction.

A solution based on laser beam in vacuum as straight line reference is proposed. The positions of the accelerator’s components are measured with respect to the laser beam by sensors made of camera/shutter assemblies. To validate these sensors; laser pointing stability has to be studied over 200m. We perform experiments in air and in vacuum in order to know how laser pointing stability varies with the distance of propagation and with the environment. The experiments show that the standard deviations of the laser spot coordinates increase with the distance of propagation. They also show that the standard deviations are much smaller in vacuum (8 μm at 35m) than in air (2000 μm at 200m). Our experiment validates the concept of laser beam in vacuum with camera/shutter assembly for micrometric positioning over 35m.

The X-ray Free-Electron Laser facility in SPring-8; SACLA; has delivered X-ray laser beams to users since March 2012 [1]. For the user experiments at SACLA; a dedicated DAQ system has been developed. The DAQ system is currently capable to operate with maximum ten sensors of multiport Charge-Coupled Device (MPCCD) for X-ray detection. The data of ten sensors are read out with individual readout modules. We implement a new tag supply system to ensure the reconstruction of the diffraction image of the user experiments. The tag data are used to synchronize the data. One master server receives a signal given by accelerator and the delivery of the tag data follows to five experimental halls at SACLA and some of monitors at SACLA accelerator.

The new functions are developed in this system to perform the injection control of positrons with the newly constructed damping ring. Besides; we integrate the capability to adjust the trigger timing just 20 ms before injection so that the injection RF-bucket of the ring can be decided at the last minute. Now; both the new system and the current working system are operational at Main Trigger Station. This is important for the smooth taking over of Event Timing System.

IPAC2014,,WEOAA02,Development of the Very Short Period Undulators,KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; We have been exploring a method to fabricate very short period undulators; a period length of which is one order-of-magnitude shorter than the ordinary period of several cm. We are developing a plate-type magnet some 100mm long with a period length of 4mm. We selected this period length since we can generate 12-keV radiation with the first harmonic of this undulator in the 2.5-GeV storage ring. A multi-pole magnetizing method was applied to magnetizing this plate: a periodic undulator field (of 4-mm period in this case) was generated by pulsed electro-magnets; and was transcribed into the plate. The magnetization procedure allows the undulator field to be obtained in a very short gap between the pair of opposing plates; which is also one order-of-magnitude shorter than a gap in the ordinary undulators. We report the magnetization method to obtain a very short period and present the test results. The calculated spectrum of the radiation from the measured field compares well with that from an ideal magnetic field in the region of the fundamental radiation in case of 2.5-GeV energy of the electron beam.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/weoaa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/weoaa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/weoaa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEOAA02,

The LIS provides intense low charge state ions from any solid state material; with low emittance and narrow pulse length. These features make it suitable as an external source of 1+ ions that can be injected into the EBIS trap for charge breeding. In addition; a LIS is the only type ion source which can allow rapid switching among many ion species; even on pulse-by-pulse basis; by changing either laser path or target position; to strike the material of choice. The EBIS works as a charge breeder; with the extracted high charge state ions used in the following accelerators.

An average beam power of MWs is considered for such applications. Such machines will be required to operate simultaneously with high beam power and peak brightness comparable to the brightest electron beams generated in pulsed LINACs. Combining the high current advantages of storage rings and high peak brightness of LINACs will require such understanding and control of the beam dynamics that 10-6 fraction of the beam current is taken in to account and controlled during the beam tuning.

Although a stable timing distribution system with optical fiber cables was constructed*; a timing drift of more than 100 fs has been observed after the transmission of about 100 m**. In order to suppress optical fiber length drift; we developed and installed an optical fiber length stabilization system with a Michelson interferometer. A frequency-stabilized laser with a wavelength of 1.5 um is transmitted together with a timing signal and it is reflected back to the interferometer. The length signal from the interferometer is fed back to a fiber stretcher for fiber length control. A prototype system showed that the length of a 1km-long optical fiber in a feedback loop was stabilized within 0.1 um corresponding to 0.5 fs. From this result; a timing accuracy improvement of pump-and-probe experiments can be expected. In this presentation; the design and basic performance of the optical fiber length stabilization system and the operational experience at SACLA will be reported.; * H.

The method of electro-optical spectral decoding (EOSD) uses the Pockels effect to modulate the longitudinal electron bunch profile onto a long; chirped laser pulse passing through an EO crystal. The laser pulse is then analyzed with a single-shot spectrometer and from the spectral modulation; the temporal modulation can be extracted. The setup has a sub-ps resolution (granularity) and can measure down to bunch lengths of 1.5 ps RMS for bunch charges as low as 30 pC. With this setup it is possible to study longitudinal beam dynamics (e. g. microbunching) occurring during ANKA's low-alpha-operation; an operation mode with compressed bunches to generate coherent synchrotron radiation in the THz range.

Different techniques are known allowing generating these frequencies. However; a current trend of physics and industry is to fill this gap with more powerful and efficient sources. For example; recent experiments have shown promising THz generation in dielectric loaded structures*. Developing this area; we consider the THz emitting scheme where an ultrarelativistic charge exits the open end of a cylindrical waveguide with a dielectric layer and produces THz waves in a form of Cherenkov radiation. The end of the waveguide is supposed to be either orthogonal to the structure axis or skewed. To obtain THz frequencies from waveguides with centimeter or millimeter radii; we consider high order modes. We present typical field patterns (in the Fraunhofer zone) and show that the aperture of the vacuum channel gives; as a rule; the main contribution.

It was determined that for the commissioning purposes energy range of the beam reaching the SR is allowed to be 2 GeV - 3.15 GeV. While the upper limit of the beam energy is defined by the maximum possible settings of Booster dipoles at the top of the ramp; the lower energy limit has to be provided by magnet interlocks. The constraints of time and resources do not allow providing dynamic interlocks of the Booster dipoles for commissioning stage of NSLS-II.

Two issues arise from implementing such a device. First; a long-period EPU can cause significant loss of dynamic aperture due to strong dynamic focusing. Second; to compensate for polarization effects due to beamline optics; the EPU must be able to produce light with an arbitrary polarization at the source point; which is referred to as universal mode.

The insertion device requires simultaneously reaching low resonant energy (1.55 eV) and high critical energy of photons (above 10 keV); leading to the choice of high field and large periods. The 3.28 m long wiggler is composed of 20 periods of 164 mm made of NdFeB magnets and vanadium permendur poles. The required effective field for the FEMTOSLICING is 1.53 T and the maximum total field reaches 1.8T at the minimum gap of 14.5 mm.

In a planar undulator; the electron radiates at odd harmonics on axis however the harmonic gain of the FEL is much less than that of fundamental. It has been shown in earlier works that it is possible to enhance the harmonic radiation by increasing the harmonic wiggler field to the fundamental by putting high permeability shims inside the undulator. The common material is the vanadium permendur (μ ~800); which has been used effectively to design the harmonic undulator. In this paper; we report the design and fabrication of seventh and ninth harmonic undulator for free electron laser applications. We use CRGO shims with μ ~ 2-3. The permanent magnet undulator is a four block per period design. The undulator is a variable gap type and consists of NdFeB magnets with six periods; each period is of 5cm length.

Visible corrosion at the magnet structures of some permanent magnet undulators setting in after a few years and a high dose rate measured regularly by thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) gave reason to inspect the magnetic field of all insertion devices in the PETRA tunnel. This paper presents details of the magnetic field degradation caused by radiation damage to the undulator magnets.

These are cooled by using either GM cryocoolers or circulating sub-cooled liquid nitrogen. Due to the heat load from radiation and wakefield heating from the electron beam; temperature gradients can develop along the length of the magnet girders which could be as large as several degrees for the Diamond Light Source (DLS) storage ring operating parameters. Some grades of the magnetic material (NdxPr1-x)2Fe14B have remanence curves versus temperature which increase significantly for temperatures below 150K with peaks below 80K**. This means that the operating temperature of a CPMU using this material can be close to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. The proposed cooling system for the new DLS CPMU is based on a thermosiphon allowing nitrogen to boil inside the cooling channels without a circulating pump. This has the advantage of absorbing large amounts (>250W) of heat with very small temperature gradients. We report here the results of a prototype magnet beam cooled with a thermosiphon producing a temperature gradient of less than 0.05K along a 2m beam at ~77K.; * T. Hara et al.; Phys Rev Spec Top.

Two fs lasers are currently in operation on TEMPO and CRISTAL for pump-probe experiments on the ps time scale enabling time resolved photoemission and photodiffraction studies. The Femto-Slicing project is based on the fs laser of the CRISTAL beamline; which can be adjusted to deliver 5 to 3 mJ pulses of 30 fs duration at 1 to 2.5 kHz respectively. The laser beam is separated in three branches: one delivering about 2 mJ to the modulator Wiggler and the other ones delivering the remaining energy to the TEMPO and CRISTAL experiments.

In order to satisfy the intensity requirements for FAIR; SIS18 has to be operated routinely at the space charge limit. Particularly demanding requirements arise from the operation with medium charge state heavy ions due to the dynamic vacuum created by ions lost through charge exchange reactions. It is therefore crucial to avoid losses in SIS18 as much as possible while confining unavoidable losses onto low desorption surfaces. In this contribution we report on the ongoing activities related to minimizing the losses by means of a better quantitative understanding and control of the beam. This includes the development of more accurate theoretical models; benchmarked with machine experiments; as well as the practical integration of the models into the control system; using beam instrumentation data in the calculation of set values whenever possible.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepro061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepro061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepro061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRO061,

A synchrotron provides pencil beams in therapy quality for 255 energy steps per ion type allowing to vary the penetration depth and thus to irradiate tumors slice-by-slice. So far; changing the beam energy necessitates a new synchrotron cycle; including all phases without beam extraction. As the no. of ions that can be accelerated in the synchrotron usually exceeds the required no. of ions for one energy slice; treatment time could be significantly reduced by reaccelerating or decelerating the remaining ions to the next energy level. By alternating acceleration and extraction phases several slices could be irradiated with only short interruptions. Therefore the reacceleration of a transversally blown up beam – due to RF-knockout extraction – must be investigated; beam losses have to be minimized.

Due to the postponed RESR in the first stage; both RF-cavities of the HESR have to operate in different modes to achieve the required beam quantity and quality. The RF-system of the HESR will now consists of two identical cavities with a common low-level RF control (LLRF). Both cavities will be driven by low noise solid state amplifiers. Each cavity contains of one gap and two tanks operating in push-pull mode and each tank will house 6 ring cores wound of modern magnetic nano-alloy ribbon. Meanwhile all ring cores were delivered and first results at low power and at high power will be presented.

But there are still problems in the existing injection system that affects the daily operation. In order to realize the MR beam power to the design limit; a high performance injection system is crucial. The remaining problems may have severe effects on high intensity beam; and become a big block to the realization of high beam power operation. Thus; upgrade the present injection system to satisfy the demands of high beam power operation is extremely important. The upgrade will redesign injection septa to obtain high performance; which will reduce the leakage field greatly. The kicker rise time will be reduced greatly by optimizing the configuration and using speed-up circuit. A compensation kicker magnet is being studied for reflection tail field cancelation. Careful 3D electromagnetic field simulations and 3D particle tracking are performed to ensure the accuracy of magnets design.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepro065_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepro065.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepro065_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRO065,

The Booster is going to send 2.25·1017 protons/hour which is almost double the present flux; 1.4·1017 protons/hour to the Main Injector (MI) and Recycler (RR). The extraction kicker gap has to synchronize to the MI and RR injection bucket in order to avoid a beam loss at the rising edge of the extraction and injection kickers. Magnetic cogging is able to control the revolution frequency and the position of the gap using the magnetic field from dipole correctors while radial position feedback keeps the beam at the central orbit. The new cogging is expected to reduce beam loss due to the orbit changes and reduce beam energy loss when the gap is created.

Almost all facilities are running Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Sources (ECRIS) to produce carbon ions and protons as well. In the 1990’s the idea of using a Electron Beam Ion Source was proposed (EBIS) [1]. Some proof of principle measurements were carried out [2] but the application of EBIS ion sources in radiation facilities has not been established. We present results from the implementation of a superconducting EBIS; the Dresden EBIS-SC; at an RFQ accelerator at the testbench of the Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center (HIT). First results from C 4+ ions produced by the Dresden EBIS-SC [3] and injection in an RFQ accelerator at the HIT testbench are shown. Furthermore; emittance measurements as well as investigations of the ion energy and the transmission through the RFQ were done. The emittance of the EBIS source is lower by a factor of nine compared to an ECRIS; which improves the transmission through the RFQ. With the current setup the ion output from the EBIS-SC is lower by a factor of 7 compared to an ECRIS to fulfill the requirements of the highest irradiation level.

This rotating gantry can transport heavy ions having 430 MeV/nucleon to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over 0-360 degrees; and enable advanced radiation-therapy. The three-dimensional scanning-irradiation method is performed in this rotating gantry. Therefore; uniformity of magnetic field is quite important since scanned beams traverse through these superconducting magnets before reaching to the isocenter. In the present work; we precisely measured the magnetic-field distributions of the superconducting magnets for the rotating gantry. We used Hall probes to measure the magnetic field. The magnetic-field distributions were determined by measuring Hall voltage; while moving the Hall probes on a rail; which has the same curvature as a center trajectory of beams. The measured-field distributions were compared with calculated distributions with a three-dimensional electromagnetic-field solver; the OPERA-3D code. Furthermore; beam-tracking simulations were performed by using the measured magnetic-field distributions to verify the design of the superconducting magnets.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepro087_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepro087.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepro087_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRO087,

The design of such an accelerator can nowadays be based on using of a powerful high-voltage high-frequency gyrotron which can provide now in pulsed regime a peak power up to 15 MW at the frequency about of 30 GHz. Taking into account this possibility; the paper presents the results of design and numerical simulations for the electron beam dynamics in a linac with the operating frequency of 27 GHz. Designed linac consists of two parts: gentle buncher and main accelerating section. The beam bunching is complicated at 1 cm wavelength because high energy about 2 MeV is necessary for beam injection into the main stage with v/c=1. Beam dynamics simulations are held using BEAMDULAC-BL code*. The electrodynamics of accelerating structure based on biperiodic structure is presented. The electron gun simulation is also discussed.

Such tumours; for example of the brain and lung; provide some of the most challenging problems in oncology. The first element of the therapy is boron-10 which is preferentially introduced into the cancerous cells using a carrier compound. Boron-10 has a very high capture cross-section with the other element of the therapy; thermal neutrons; resulting in the production of a lithium nucleus and an alpha particle which destroy the cell they are created in. However; a large flux of neutrons is required and until recently the only source used was a nuclear reactor. In Birmingham; studies of an existing BNCT facility using a 2.8 MeV proton beam and a solid lithium target have found a way to increase the beam power to a sufficient level to allow clinical trials; while maintaining the target solid.

This can be further enhanced by imaging the target volume and surrounding tissues using proton Computed Tomography (pCT); which directly measures the energy loss from individual protons to infer the tissue density. Proton energies up to 330 MeV are required for pCT. We describe a superconducting gantry design which can deliver protons for both therapy and pCT with a similar size to existing treatment gantries. The use of ten identical combined-function superconducting dipole magnets minimizes the weight and technical development required. Based on experience with superconducting magnets for carbon gantries it should be possible to change the magnetic field sufficiently quickly to perform spot-scanning over successive layers without inducing quenching. It is envisaged that a combination of cryogenic cooling and cryogen-free cooling will be used to achieve the required operating temperature for the magnet windings.,Funding: Work supported by STFC Cockcroft Institute Grant No. ST/G008248/1,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepro101_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepro101.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepro101_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRO101,

Today it is developed into two directions. The first one is getting orthopositronium flux in flight. Slow positrons from 22Na source are accumulated in Surko trap and then are injected into the ring where they should overlap with electrons from the single-pass electron beam. In this way the flux of orthopositronium atoms will appear and will be observed in the process of registration of gamma quanta from annihilation process. The second group of works focuses on using the positron injector for Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS) applications. This method is dedicated to detection of structural defects as vacancies in the solid body lattice. The latest progress of this technique is strictly connected with measurements of PAS characteristics using positron beams. The progress in the LEPTA development; the first results obtained in the PAS; idea and actual state of works concerning the construction of the pulsed positron beam will be presented.

There are a range of neutron based security techniques which have the potential to dramatically improve national security. Neutron techniques can be broadly grouped into neutron in/neutron out and neutron in/photon out techniques. The use of accelerator based fusion devices will potentially enable to wide spread application of neutron security techniques due to the potential for much safer operation than that offered by fission or sealed tube sources.

The high current in the horns of the target system for the neutrino production requires proton pulses far shorter than the linac pulse. Therefore an accumulator ring is required after the linac to produce the shorter pulses. Charge exchange injection of an H− beam from the linac would be used. The Linac would deliver 1.1 1015 protons per pulse. Due to space charge limits; several rings or one ring re-filled several times during the neutrino cycle are necessary.

In order to reduce EFE; we have installed a commercial dry ice cleaning (DIC) system in a clean room environment (class iso 5). Accordingly; the number density of emitters (N) was significantly decreased by DIC from N = 52 /cm² to N = 12 /cm² at Es = 190 MV/m. Furthermore we have tested two diamond-turned and chemically etched (SLAC treatment; Ra = 150 nm) Cu samples after DIC resulting in EFE onset at 230 MV/m. Locally measured I(V) curves of the strongest emitters yielded field enhancement factors b = 10 – 90 (10 – 85) on the diamond-turned (chemically etched); respectively.

Two pulsed klystrons are used to feed the Linac cavities. Klystron 1 feeds the bunching section and also the first accelerating structure. Klystron 2 feeds exclusively the second accelerating structure. Recently; a S-band switching system installed in the waveguide system allows us to use also Klystron 2 to power the low-energy section and operate the Linac at lower energy; around 65 MeV. So that injection into the Booster is still possible while; in the meantime; Klystron 1 can be connected to a dummy load for reparation. Therefore; the time response after a klystron failure is improved. Details of the waveguide upgrade and the results of the ALBA Linac operated with only one klystron are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepme010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepme010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepme010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPME010,

Such interaction may produce a number of photoelectrons; that can either seed electron cloud related instabilities and/or interact anyway with the beam itself; potentially causing its deterioration.

For example; in the early 1970’s in CERN’s Intersecting Storage Ring (ISR); the ion-induced pressure bump produced the fall-off of the beam current. 3GeV synchrotron (RCS) in J-PARC is no exception. RCS is one of the most high power beam accelerators in the world. It aims the 1 MW beam power; which corresponds to the average and peak beam current of 333 uA and about 10 A; respectively. In the present stage; the injection line called L3BT line (Linac to 3GeV Beam Transport line); is the section; where the pressure notably produces the beam loss. In this line; H− beam from Linac was converted to H0 by charge stripping due to the interaction between H− beam and the residual gas molecules. Such H0 was not bended by the injection septum magnets and directly hit the vacuum wall. We decided to add the vacuum pumps in this line to reduce the residual gas molecules. We will present the effectivity of the additional pumps on the basis of the measured results of the pressure improvement and the beam loss suppression.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepme035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepme035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepme035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPME035,

Protection of the linac vacuum against air-inrush from the three experimental stations through the HEBT lines relies on fast valves; triggered by fast cold cathode gauges. To evaluate the leak propagation velocity as a function of leak size and geometry of the lines; a computational and experimental investigation is being carried out at CERN. A 28 m long tube is equipped with strain gauges installed on thin-walled flanges; as well as fast reacting glow discharge and cold-cathode gauges. A leak is opened by the effect of a cutting pendulum; equipped with an accelerometer for data acquisition triggering; on a thin aluminium window followed by a calibrated orifice.

For the High Luminosity LHC; the activation of such vacuum chambers will increase. It is therefore necessary to use a vacuum chamber material which interacts less with the circulating beam. While beryllium is reserved for the collision point; a good compromise between cost; availability and transparency is obtained with aluminium alloys; such materials are a preferred choice with respect to austenitic stainless steel. Manufacturing a thin-wall aluminium vacuum chamber presents several challenges as the material grade needs to be machinable; weldable; leak-tight for small thicknesses; and able to withstand heating to 250°C for extended periods of time.

This paper focus on two innovative accelerator devices to be installed in the LSS during the long shutdown 1 (LS1): the beam gas vertex (BGV) and a beam bending experiment using crystal collimator (LUA9). The BGV necessitates a dedicated pressure bump; generated by local gas injection; in order to create the required rate of inelastic beam-gas interactions.

Energy up to 10MeV/amu will be reached by a new post-accelerating; superconducting (SC) linac. Beam will be delivered via a HEBT to three experimental stations for nuclear physics. To keep the SC linac compact and avoid cold-warm transitions; the cryomodules feature a common beam and insulation vacuum. Radioactive ion beams require a hermetically sealed vacuum; with transfer of the effluents to the nuclear ventilation chimney. Hermetically sealed; dry; gas transfer vacuum pumps are preferred to gas binding pumps; for an optimized management of radioactive contamination risk during maintenance and intervention. The vacuum system of the SC-linac is isolated by two fast valves; triggered by fast reacting cold cathode gauges installed on the warm linac; the HEBT and the experimental stations.

The design; manufacture; cleaning; welding and assembly of the vacuum components were undertaken by the NSRRC vacuum group. The ultimate objective is to attain a leak-tight; ultra-high vacuum and a vacuum system with a small rate of outgassing. In this work; we used a residual-gas analyzer (RGA) to analyze the variation of residual gas during proceeding toward ultra-high vacuum. This process; which led the pressure down to ~10-11 torr; includes baking; operation of ion pumps; degassing of hot cathode gauges and activation of NEG pumps. When a sufficiently small low pressure is attained; the ion pumps are turned off to test the building up of pressure. The outgassing property and the variation of the residual gas of the aluminium chamber and the ion pumps can be measured.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepme055_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepme055.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepme055_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPME055,

The main advantages of using NEG coatings are evenly distributed pumping speed; low thermal outgassing rates and low photon and electron stimulated gas desorption. The only downside of the NEG is its selective pumping: it pumps H2; CO; CO2 and some other gas species; but does not pump noble gases and hydrocarbons. However; in the accelerators where NEG coating could be beneficial; there is synchrotron radiation and photoelectrons that bombard vacuum chamber walls; it was found in our study that hydrocarbons can be pumped by NEG coating under electron and; most likely; photon bombardment. The detail and the results of this study are reported in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepme056_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepme056.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepme056_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPME056,

In this study, the secondary electron yield (SEY) of bulk Ti, Zr, V and Hf have been investigated as a function of electron conditioning. The maximum SEYs of as-received Ti, Zr, V and Hf, are respectively 1.96, 2.34, 1.72 and 2.32, these reduce to 1.14, 1.13, 1.44 and 1.18 after electron conditioning. Surface chemical composition was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy which revealed that surface conditioning by electron bombardment promotes the growth of a thin carbon layer on the surface and consequently reduces the SEY of the surface as a function of electron dose. Heating a vanadium sample to 250°C resulted in diffusion of oxygen into the bulk and induced formation of metal carbide at the surface. However, the SEY stays the same even after heat-induced surface chemistry modification. Prolonged electron conditioning increases the surface oxygen but the surface is still predominantly covered with a thin graphitic layer and hence the SEY stays approximately constant. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepme057_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepme057.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepme057_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPME057,

The storage ring operates applying a fast energy ramp of 6 GeV/s from 1.2 GeV to 3.5 GeV and a slow extraction afterwards over a few seconds to the hadron physics experiments. The intended upgrade is mainly limited by the coupled-bunch instabilities and the ability of bunch-by-bunch feedback systems to suppress such instabilities. In order to achieve optimum bunch-by-bunch feedback performance; the beam phase with respect to the master oscillator and the synchrotron frequency have to stay constant. This paper reports on a new high performance low level RF (LLRF) system. The system stabilizes the cavity field and is capable of executing fast voltage and phase ramps.

High gradient electromagnetic field inside cavities causes detuning due to the Lorentz force. In addition the quality factor of cavities can change during the RF field pulse. Currently used method for estimation of those parameters is based on the post-processing of the data recorded during operation of the RF. External servers calculate cavity parameters using cavity equation; forward power and probe signals collected during previous pulse. A novel approach* based on the component implemented in FPGA is presented. In the new method loaded quality factor and detuning are estimated in real-time during the RF pulse for increased reliability and better exception handling. Modified firmware of the LLRF control system based on the Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (MTCA) platform has been used for the method verification.; *”Development of Control System for Fast Frequency Tuners of Superconducting Resonant Cavities for FLASH and XFEL Experiments”; K.

To avoid particle contamination of the RF cavities; the strings are assembled in an ISO4 cleanroom by following strict cleaning and high-vacuum procedures. The major technical challenge of the string integration thus lies in the capacity to realize 25 connections in two weeks while protecting the cavity and coupler RF surfaces and to check their leak-tightness up to 10-10 hPA.l/s. The partial demonstration was made by the CEA team with the first pre-series module XM-3 which achieves a total accelerating voltage of 232 MV preserving the individual performances of cavities.

For this high current operation; coaxial RF power couplers capable of handling 130 kW of power; c.w. at 1.3 GHz are required for both the SRF gun and booster cavities. In order to achieve this power level a coupler has been designed based on the high power coupler currently in use at the KEK-cERL. A key improvement that was made to the coupler was the modification of the coupler tip; termed a golf-tee. This modification is incorporated so as to achieve the desired coupling; Qext ~105; with minimal coupler penetration into the beampipe.

The high power injector system needs to deliver this beam at 6.5MeV by combining the energy gain of a 1.4 cell SRF photo-injector and three Cornell style 2-cell booster cavities. One booster cavity will be operated at zero-crossing for bunch energy chirping. Thus two booster cavities have to deliver 2MV each requiring a strong coupling with a loaded Q of 105. To house the two envisaged KEK fundamental power couplers (FPC) with the cavity; the geometry was slightly modified. Further; to increase coupling and reduce transverse kick effects to the beam; a ”golf-tee” antenna tip was designed.

For this scheme to work superconducting higher harmonic cavities of the fundamental 500 MHz at two frequencies need to be installed in the BESSY II storage ring. Given an appropiate choice of the higher harmonics the resulting gradient leads to a beating effect of the effective longitudinal focussing voltage at the stable fix points resulting in different bunch lengths in subsequent buckets. This project places stringent requirements on the cavity performance; as high accelerating fields; excellent HOM damping capabilities and high reliability as they will operate in a 300 mA 24/7 user facility.

Caused by strong beam-cavity interaction and due to high quality factors of superconducting RF-structures special care of lower order (LOM) and higher order (HOM) modes must be taken. Various numerical studies were performed to numerically calculate the dependence of different figures of merit (e.g. external quality factors Qext) with respect to the geometry parameters and cell number of the RF-structure; focused on the propagation and damping of low and higher order modes. To ease the numerical effort an optimization routine has been developed which automatically optimizes the geometry based on goal functions. In this context it turned out that cell geometries defined by spline functions have advantages compared to the standard elliptical parametrization regularly used. The number of free parameters is substantially reduced which facilitates the search for optimum solutions.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepri009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepri009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepri009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRI009,

Gurevich in 2006 are actively discussed these years; because of their great possibility in reducing power consumptions and in enhancing RF breakdown field of the Sc RF cavity. On Apr. 2013; we submitted general formulae for the vortex penetration field of the Sc layer and the shielded magnetic field on the bulk Sc for a structure with a single Sc layer and a single insulator layer formed on a bulk Sc; by which a combination of the thicknesses of Sc and insulator layers that can realize the enhanced RF breakdown field can be found for any given materials.

In principle; thanks to the mechanism of energy recovery; the input power of main linac of cERL is very small even if the beam current will be higher than 100mA. Therefore; the coupling is very weak. However; this coupling is perfectly not matched to the unloaded Q-value of the superconducting cavity like 1x1010. The minimum input power will be restricted by the cavity detuning due to the microphonics from the cryomodule itself. We designed the lower loaded Q-valued of (1-4)x107 to reduce the effect of the michrophonics from the expected outer disturbance At present; we successfully suppressed the michrophonics to meet our requirement. However we found the enhancement of the detuning angle when we did not optimize the feedback loop of LLRF. This enhancement will be expected coming from the mechanical resonance frequencies of cavity and/or cryomodule. In this paper; we reported the correlation between the measured microphincs spectrum with LLRF in a beam operation and the results of the measured resonance frequencies spectrum at the test bench.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepri026_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepri026.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepri026_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRI026,

The main linac cryomodule is operated by a 2K refrigerator system; whose cooling ability is 80W. RF power is fed to each cavity from an IOT or a solid state amplifier. Amplitude and phase of RF stabilization is done by using a digital LLRF system. Cavity resonant frequency is controlled by using mechanical and piezo tuners. Before beam operation; performance test of the cryomodule has been carried out. Generally the cryomodule works well; but heavy field emission is rather problem.

Dipole modes have been monitored; since their magnitude is proportional to beam offsets from their electrical centers. Detection of cavity alignment is important for the ILC to confirm alignment accuracy and furthermore possible source of emittance growth. We are particularly interested in beam pipe modes because they are localized in both ends of the cavity. We measured beam-induced HOM in the STF accelerator at KEK in 2012 – 2013. From the results of the measurement; we found some modes whose behaviors are like dipole mode at around 2.1 GHz instead of 2.28 GHz as calculated by R. Wanzenberg for an ideal cavity [TESLA 2001-33; September 2001]. We also measured beam induced HOM in the TESLA superconducting cavities in FLASH at DESY. In order to identify beam pipe modes and to compare the measurement with the calculation; we calculate beam pipe modes of 9-cell superconducting cavity by CST MICROWAVE STUDIO 2012 and HFSS 12.

These cavities have a fixed coupling resulting in fixed Qext which is considerably higher than the optimum. We use 3 stub tuners to match the cavities under these non-optimum conditions. Diamond Cavity-1 will soon be refurbished. This opportunity could be used to lower the Qext on the cavity. One of the options is to modify the coupling tongue geometry along with a matching section. This may require cutting off the beam tube with the coupler for rework or it may need to be newly fabricated. We investigated another option to lower the Qext of the cavity by optimising the location of the window with respect to the cavity; maintaining the same coupling tongue geometry. The height of the waveguide on the vacuum side of the window differs from that of the coupling waveguide on the cavity resulting in a step. The location of window with respect to the cavity makes a significant difference to the ultimate Qext obtained after putting the window in place.

The waveguide structure of this cavity allows for the free propagation of all higher order modes (HOMs) out of the cavity via the beam ports; eliminating the need for HOM dampers inside the cavity when operated with high beam current. The absence of HOM dampers greatly simplifies the cavity fabrication and operation at cryogenic temperatures. This cavity with its high shunt impedance is ideal for the spatial rotation of short bunches in a small physical space; a requirement for the generation of sub-picosecond short pulse x-rays in electron storage rings or luminosity upgrades of colliders.

The TESLA 9-cell superconducting cavity is adopted as the baseline design for the linac. The design gradient is approximately 16 MV/m. The highest operating current is 300 μA. Assuming that the RF power is matched at the highest current; the optimal loaded QL of the cavity is found to be around 4·107. Because of the high QL; the cavity bandwidth approaches the background microphonic detuning; and the performance of the cavity is tightly coupled to the mechanical perturbations of the cavity/cryomodule system. The resulting large phase and amplitude variations in the cavity require active feedback to achieve the 0.01% amplitude and phase stability requirements. To understand the cavity RF response and feedback requirements to the microphonics and Lorentz Force detuning; we have developed a simulation model of the RF-mechanical coupled system using parameters obtained with the multi-physics solver ACE3P.

This coupler has a very simplified mechanical structure and is equipped with a novel vacuum window structure that allows the coupler to be divided into two parts. These two parts are fully thermally isolated; only coupled by thermal radiation. The rf power on the other hand get coupled perfectly from one part to the other. This is truly novel approach which is quite different than the conventional approach to this problem such as chock structure. The structure in general is slightly overmoded. We show that this structure can also be adopted to change the coupling coefficient and thus be tuned for an external Q. This could be of great utility for CW operation. We show the analytical and numerical calculation for a two window variable coupler.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepri068_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepri068.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepri068_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRI068,

A detachable coupler will reduce conditioning time (can be conditioned separately); reduce cost and improve reliability. The problem with placing an extra flange in the superconducting cavity is creating a possible quench spot. Euclid Techlabs LLC designed a coupler and optimized its geometry that yielding an area on the surface with zero magnetic field (hence zero surface current). By placing a flange in that area we are able to avoid disturbing surface currents that typically lead to a quench. The coupler is optimized to preserve the axial symmetry of the cavity and rf field.

SuperConducting Multipole Wigglers (SCMWs) represent sign-alternating sequence of magnets with lateral magnetic field. Relativistic electrons; passing through such set of magnetic elements; create radiation with properties of synchrotron radiations depending on maximum field its period and poles number. The first superconducting wiggler has been made and installed on the VEPP-3 electron storage ring as generator of synchrotron radiation in 1979. Nowadays tens of wigglers are successfully working in the various synchrotron radiation centers and more than 10 of them were developed and made in Budker INP. These wigglers may be divided into 3 groups: 1- Short period 3-3.5 cm with field ~2-2.5 Tesla 2- Medium period 4.8-6 cm with field ~ 3.5-4.5 Tesla 3- Long period 14.5-20 cm with field 7-7.5Tesla.

A first measurement was performed to assess the quench level of a quadrupole located in the LHC injection region in case of fast (ns) losses. It consisted in dumping single bunches onto an injection protection collimator located right upstream of the quadrupole; varying the bunch intensity up to 3·1010 protons and ramping the quadrupole current up to 2200 A. No quench was recorded at that time. The test was repeated in 2013 with increased bunch intensity (6·1010 protons); a quench occurred when powering the magnet at 2500 A. The comparison between measurements during beam induced and quench heaters induced quenches is shown.

Access to the splices requires the opening of welded sleeves by machining. After consolidation; the sleeves are re-welded using a TIG orbital welding. The welding process has been modified from the original “as-new” installation in order to better adapt to the “as repaired” situation. The intervention has been thoroughly prepared through qualifications; organisation of teams; their training and follow-up. Quality control is based on the qualification of equipment; process and operators; the recording of production parameters; regular process audits and production witness samples; visual inspection through an official certifying body. The paper also describes welding and quality control of special intervention cases; with issues of difficult access requiring innovative solutions.

The magnetic field generated by a system of solenoids is crucial for Mu2e and requires accurate characterization to detect any flaws and to produce a detailed field map. Stringent physics goals are driving magnetic field specifications for the Mu2e solenoids. A field mapper is being designed; which will produce detailed magnetic field maps. The uniform field region of the spectrometer volume requires the highest level of precision (1 Gauss per 1 Tesla). During commissioning; multiple magnetic field maps will be generated to verify proper alignment of all magnet coils; and to create the final magnetic field map. In order to design and build a precise field mapping system consisting of Hall and NRM probes; tolerances and precision for such a system need to be evaluated.

The technique is based on placing iron shims of variable stack thicknesses; variable width and/or variable length on the outer surface of the stainless steel shell at strategic locations. Since the shims are placed outside the helium vessel; adjustments can be made without involving major operations such as opening the helium vessel. It is a simple and economical technique which is suitable for long magnets with a fast turn-around. This allows one to reduce field errors well beyond the normal construction errors. The technique has recently been successfully applied in two 3.8 T; 80 mm aperture; 9.45 m long dipoles. These magnets were built at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) for the APUL project (Accelerator Project to Upgrade the LHC) as a part of US contribution to LHC.

As a part of this proposal; the aperture of twin aperture D2 dipole is increased from the present 80 mm to 105 mm without increasing the size of cryostat. This creates a significant challenge in managing saturation induced harmonics and the leakage field; particularly since the field in the two apertures is in the same direction. In addition; small spacing between the two apertures creates significant cross-talk harmonics as well. The expected harmonics based on an initial design were rather large and limited the beam dynamics performance of the machine.

The plant was installed and successfully commissioned in the year 2009. During the past three years since commissioning; the cryogenic system had been in operation to perform helium liquefaction without a superconducting magnet. Since the installation of a 6.5 T SWLS in September 2013; the cryogenic system has begun its operation with a full-time load. In this work; the first operation of the cryogenic system with a superconducting insertion device is presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepri113_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepri113.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepri113_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRI113,

In order to achieve high energy stability and low arrival time jitter of the electron beam; the accelerator requires an accurate low-level RF (LLRF) field regulation and a sophisticated synchronization scheme for various devices along the facility. The REFM-OPT is a 19” module which is responsible for resynchronizing the 1.3 GHz reference signal for the LLRF distributed by coaxial cables to a phase-stable signal of the optical synchronization system. The module provides a 1.3 GHz output signal with low phase noise and high long-term stability. Several sub-components of the REFM-OPT designed specifically for this module are described in detail. The readout electronics of the high-precision Laser-to-RF phase detector are presented as well as the integration of this key component into the 19” module. Additionally; we focus on design solutions which assure phase stability and synchronization of the 1.3 GHz signal at several high power outputs of the module.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepri115_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepri115.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepri115_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRI115,

Therefore; the Master Oscillator (MO) for the European XFEL has to be redundant; in order to achieve extremely high reliability. The redundancy concept; which provides no interruption in the reference signal; requires phase coherence; fast RF switching and sustaining the RF power with a high-Q filter. These features allow to keep possible signal transitions smooth. Furthermore; the MO has to generate a 1.3 GHz signal of exceptionally good phase noise performance – jitter < 35 fs RMS integrated from 10 Hz to1 MHz. One of the problems in the way are vibrations; which have to be properly isolated to avoid microphonics effects in oscillators. The proposed MO architecture and connection with the RF distribution system is described. A basic prototype is tested and results are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/wepri116_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/wepri116.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/wepri116_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-WEPRI116,

IPAC2014,,THYA01,Control and Application of Beam Microbunching in High Brightness Linac-driven Free Electron Lasers,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; The remarkable properties of coherent radiation from free-electron lasers (FELs) are due to the current modulation in the beam with the modulation period equal to the radiation wavelength. This modulation is developed as a result of a beam instability when the beam propagates in a long FEL undulator; and requires a beam with a high-peak current; small emittance and a small energy spread. Unfortunately the same beam qualities make it a subject to a so-called microbunching instability at a much longer scale than the radiation wavelength. It is driven by the space charge and CSR impedances in the machine and develops during the beam acceleration in the linac; compression; and transport to the undulator. If not controlled; the microbunching instability influences dramatically the FEL performance and in the worst case can even ruin the lasing. In the presentation we will review the mechanism behind the microbunching instability; the suppression methods used in existing facilities as well as possible future developments and concepts.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thya01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thya01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thya01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THYA01,

However; the involved fast time-scales hampered the possibility to make direct real-time recordings of theses structures. When the structures occur at a cm scale; recent works at UVSOR*; revealed that direct recording of the CSR electric field with ultra-high speed electronics (17 ps) provides extremely precious informations on the microbunching dynamics. However; when CSR occurs at THz frequencies (and is thus out of reach of electronics); the problem remained largely open. Here we present a new opto-electronic strategy that enabled to record series of successive electric field pulses shapes with picosecond resolution (including carrier and envelope); every 12 ns; over a total duration of several milliseconds. We also present the first experimental results obtained with this method at Synchrotron SOLEIL; above the microbunching instability threshold; and we present direct tests of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck and macroparticle models.

Systematic measurements are conducted with respect to the magnetic shielding effects of the double-layer shields and the magnetic properties of various components within the inner shield. This resulted in the new discovery of strongly magnetized strut springs as a major source of remnant magnetic flux near a cavity inside of all magnetic shielding.

IPAC2014,,THPPA03,The MAX-lab Story; From Microtron to MAX IV,MAX-lab; Lund; Sweden; The MAX story started with the design and construction of a small Race-Track Microtron 1973-1979. This microtron was later followed by the synchrotron radiation storage rings MAX I; MAX II; MAX III and the MAX IV facility; the latter consisting of two storage rings operated at 1.5 and 3 Gev respectively and also including a full energy injector linac. It was quite clear from the very beginning that conventional accelerator technology not was matching the boundary conditions in terms of the staff size and limited economical resources at MAX. We had to find new technical solutions based on mass-produced industrial components and an extensive usage of CNC machining to match the turbulent development of synchrotron radiation sources. This article describes some of the most important features of the accelerators developed at MAX-lab and covers also the design philosophy behind the early ideas for designing a close to Diffraction Limited Storage Ring. Finally; the author and MAX staff wants to thank the prize committee for the prestigious Wideröe prize and thank all our international colleagues world-wide.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thppa03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thppa03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thppa03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPPA03,
IPAC2014,,THEA01,Why is Women's Football Less Popular?,DELTA; Dortmund; Germany; It will be shown that the final table of the German (men’s!) football Bundesliga and the distribution of the results may be explained by simple statistical distributions. From this observation; one may conclude that the differences in the performance of the teams are not very large although certain teams from the southern part of Germany perform significantly better than others over the years. With such an analysis large-scale manipulations in the German Bundesliga; the English Premier League; and the Italian Serie A may be ruled out. The same analysis reveals a completely different picture for the German women's football Bundesliga and the Word Cup women's football teams. The respective goal distributions can not be explained with simple statistical models because the difference in the performance of the teams is too large.

The main limitation comes from the diffraction of the optical beam due to the finite size of the vacuum chamber of the undulator. A solution is to use this chamber as a waveguide by adaptating the radius of curvature of the cavity mirrors to this regime. Then; as has been shown before* a minimum appears in the spectrum that can be produced by the FEL. We discuss the physical mechanism of this particular regime and compare it to experiments using vacuum chambers of different tranverse sizes. A good agreement is found with results of simulations and with a simple analytical formula.; * Analysis of the periodic power gaps observed in the tuning range of FELs with a partial waveguide; R.

For this; assembly procedures have to be well-defined and repeatable; and the punctual supply of parts from the contributing institutes has to be assured. Configuration management (CM) has been introduced for clarification of responsibilities and establishing procedures. CM provides unique identification of parts; part status and location tracking; versioning of documentation; and procedures for change control; auditing and handling non-conformities. The configuration database; which is based on DESY’s Engineering Data Management System; contains the entire information which is necessary for assembling the accelerator modules. The content ranges from work instructions how to build a cryomodule up to individual records of all produced parts. Workflow and reports help tracking production progress and establishing production quality. The presentation gives an overview of the CM solution which is in place for the assembly of the XFEL accelerator modules; and reports experience and lessons learned from series production of the first modules.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO006,

IPAC2014,,THPRO008,Obtaining High Degree of Circular Polarization at X-ray FELs via a Reverse Undulator Taper,E. Schneidmiller; M.V. Yurkov; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; Baseline design of a typical X-ray FEL undulator assumes a planar configuration which results in a linear polarization of the FEL radiation. However; many experiments at X-ray FEL user facilities would profit from using a circularly polarized radiation. As a cheap upgrade one can consider an installation of a short helical (or cross-planar) afterburner; but then one should have an efficient method to suppress powerful linearly polarized background from the main undulator. In this paper we propose a new method for such a suppression: an application of the reverse taper in the main undulator. We discover that in a certain range of the taper strength; the density modulation (bunching) at saturation is practically the same as in the case of non-tapered undulator while the power of linearly polarized radiation is suppressed by orders of magnitude. Then strongly modulated electron beam radiates at full power in the afterburner.

IPAC2014,,THPRO009,Harmonic Lasing in X-ray FELs,E. Schneidmiller; M.V. Yurkov; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation; harmonic lasing in a high-gain FEL can provide much more intense; stable; and narrow-band FEL beam which is easier to handle if the fundamental is suppressed. We perform a parametrization of the solution of eigenvalue equation for lasing at odd harmonics; and present explicit expression for FEL gain length; taking into account all essential effects. We propose and discuss methods for suppression of the fundamental. We also suggest a combined use of harmonic lasing and lasing at the retuned fundamental wavelength in order to reduce bandwidth and to increase brilliance of X-ray beam. We discover that in a part of the parameter space; corresponding to the operating range of soft X-ray beamlines of X-ray FEL facilities; harmonics can grow faster than the fundamental. We suggest that harmonic lasing can be widely used in the existing or planned X-ray FEL facilities. LCLS after a minor modification can lase at the 3rd harmonic up to the photon energy of 25-30 keV providing multi-gigawatt power level. At the European XFEL the harmonic lasing would allow to extend operating range up to 100 keV; to reduce bandwidth and increase brilliance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO009,

A gap-tunable undulator is divided into two parts by setting two different undulator parameters such that the first part is tuned to a sub-harmonic of the second part. Harmonic lasing occurs in the exponential gain regime in the first part of the undulator; also the fundamental stays well below saturation. In the second part of the undulator the fundamental mode is resonant to the wavelength; previously amplified as the harmonic. The amplification process proceeds in the fundamental mode up to saturation. In this case the bandwidth is defined by the harmonic lasing (i.e. it is reduced by a significant factor depending on harmonic number) but the saturation power is still as high as in the reference case of lasing at the fundamental in the whole undulator; i.e. the spectral brightness increases. Application of the undulator tapering in the deep nonlinear regime would allow to generate higher peak powers approaching TW level. The scheme is illustrated with the parameters of the European XFEL.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO010,

At the radiation source ELBE in Dresden Rossendorf short pulses are required for coherent THz generation and laser-electron beam interaction experiments such as X-ray Thomson scattering. Energy dechirping can be carried out passively by wakefields generated when the electron beam passes through suitable structures; namely corrugated and dielectrically lined cylindrical pipes or dielectrically lined rectangular waveguides (*; **; ***). All structures offer the possibility to tune the resulting wakefield and therefore the resulting energy chirp through a variation of purely geometrical or material parameters.

Recently; it has been proposed to use the CLIC structure to drive an FEL linac. In contrast to CLIC the linac would be powered by klystrons not by a drive beam. The main advantage of this proposal is achieving the required energies in a very short distance; thus the facility would be rather compact. In this study; we present the conceptual design parameters of a facility which could generate laser photon pulses covering the range of 1-75 Angstrom.

Single sources which are identified by various means contribute to only about 10 to 20% of the whole jitter power; meaning that their elimination gives only a small improvement of 5 to 10%. New sources need to be identified fast. Especially slow variations of a few seconds to minutes time scale are often hidden and partially corrected by feedback systems.

Operation at high field strength is required to obtain a low emittance beam; thus increasing the probability of field emission (FE) from the cathode surface. Usually; substrates are heated in situ before alkali de- position to remove oxide layers from the surface. FE on Mo substrates was measured by means of a field emission scanning microscope (FESM).

During high intensity operation; ions become trapped inside of the electric potential generated by the electron beam and oscillate transversely with a characteristic frequency. At high beam currents; electron beam-ion interactions result in excessive radiation; primarily due to beam losses and bremsstrahlung. However; by shaking the beam at the trapped ion's oscillation frequency; we are able to drive a resonance that severely reduces or eliminates this radiation. This both confirms the viability of beam shaking as an ion mitigation strategy inside high intensity injectors; and allows us to measure the trapped ion oscillation frequencies indirectly. Experimental data for a beam energy of 5 MeV; a bunch repetition rate of 1.3 GHz; and beam currents up to 20 mA; as well as simulations to describe our data and the beam shaking principle are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro053_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro053.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro053_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO053,

A telescope system consisting of four permanent magnet based quadrupoles was found to have significantly less chromatic aberrations than a quadrupole triplet. This allows sub-ps electron beam focusing to match the laser spot size at the interaction point. Focusing properties like the position of the focal plane and the spot size are retained for electron beam energies between 20 and 30 MeV by adjusting the position of the quadrupoles individually on a motorized stage. Since the electron beam is chirped for bunch compression upstream; the rms energy spread is increased to one or two percent and second order chromatic effects must be taken into account. For an emittance of 13 pi mm mrad; we predict rms spot sizes of about 40 um and divergences of about 15 mrad. We also present the design of the permanent magnet quadrupoles to be used for the FFS.

EDMs can be observed by their small influence on spin motion. The only possible way to perform a direct measurement is to use a storage ring. For this purpose it was decided to carry out the first precursor experiment at the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY). Since the EDM of a particle violates CP invariance and is expected to be tiny; treatment of all various sources of systematic errors should be done with a great level of precision. One should clearly understand how misalignments of the magnets affects the beam and the spin motion. In reality; one of the methods to investigate spin behavior in the presence of misalignments in a storage ring is to mimic their influence on the beam parameters using small orbit kicks with different amplitudes. In this talk the first simulations of orbit excitations will be discussed. The corresponding spin tune shifts will be considered. The influence of the distorted orbit on the polarization build-up caused by the EDM will be examined.; * A. Lehrach; F. Rathmann; J.

It is well known that for detection of the electric dipole moment one needs to create such conditions where the particle's spin oscillations can be caused only by the EDM. Really; there are two possible methods for EDM search using a storage ring: resonant spin buildup in a magnetostatic ring and “frozen” spin method in an electrostatic ring with “magic” energy. Both methods have common limitations caused by spin decoherence.

The magnetic field reduces the radius of the laser beam and enhances the self focusing of the laser beam. The self-sustained plasma channel can affect the efficiency of harmonic generation of the interacting laser beam. The radial density gradient of the channel beats with the oscillatory electron velocity to produce density perturbation at laser frequency. The ponderomotive force at second-harmonic frequency produces electrons density oscillations that beat with the oscillatory velocity to create a non-linear current; driving the third harmonic radiation. The velocity and density perturbation associated with the self-focused laser beam generates a nonlinear current at triple fold frequency of the fundamental laser. Our results show that the efficiency of third-harmonic generation of the laser beam is affected significantly due to the self-sustained plasma channel.

At NewSUBARU; 1.5 GeV storage ring; we kicked the beam using a vertical fast kicker and investigated the de-coherence of betetron oscillation using mainly a dual-sweep streak camera. The largest is the Landau damping by a well-known chromatic tune spread; although the phase spread comes back to zero at after a synchrotron oscillation period.

Because of small axial focusing of the beam in a center of the cyclotron the radial component of magnetic field imperfections leads to additional proton losses. Measured maps of the axial and radial components of magnetic field were used in the simulations. It was found that the radial component with value 5-10 G in the center and approximately 2 G in the main region of acceleration leads to decrease of the resulting beam intensity by about two times and to increase the beam axial width by 25% as well. Simulations define the requirements to the experimental radial component shaping for the next cyclotrons of this series. Providing these requirements will ensure an absence of the additional proton losses due to the axial motion perturbations. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro070_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro070.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro070_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO070,
IPAC2014,,THPRO071,Control of Calculations in the Beam Dynamics using Approximate Invariants,St. Petersburg State University; St. Petersburg; Russia; FZJ; Jülich; Germany; One of the important problems in the theory of dynamical systems is to find corresponding (invariants). In this article we are discussing some problems of computing of invariant functions (invariants) for dynamical systems. These invariants can be used for describing of particle beams systems. The suggested method is constructive and based on the matrix formalism for Lie algebraic tools. We discuss two types of invariants: kinematic and dynamic. All calculations can be realized in symbolic forms; in particular; kinematic invariants are based on the theory of representations of Lie algebras (in particular; using the Casimir’s operators). For the case of nonlinear kinematic invariants we propose a recursive scheme; which can be implemented in symbolic forms using instruments of computer algebra (for example; such packages as Maple or Mathematica). The corresponding expressions for invariants can be used to control the correctness of computational experiments; first of all for long time beam dynamics.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro071_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro071.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro071_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO071,

The parametrization is done by replicating the electric field from measured data using trigonometric and exponential functions. The field generated by the parameters exhibits a mean error of 0.28% ( maximum error of 3.8% and s.t.d. error 1.1%); with the advantage of only taking up a fraction of the required data. The field in the entire cavity is extrapolated by combining the Maxwell equations with the parametrized form of the field.

IPAC2014,,THPRO073,Longitudinal Acceptance Evaluation from Hamiltonian,ESS; Lund; Sweden; An RF cavity is designed around a reference particle; if the energy or the phase of a real particle are too far from the reference; the particle is lost. The widest area of energy-phase that allows a particle to be transported by the cavity is called acceptance of the cavity. In simulations the acceptance is evaluated tracking several particles with different energies and phases and marking when a particle is transmitted or lost. This process can be time consuming because of the large amount of tracked particles requested to characterise the cavity acceptance. In this paper we propose an alternative method to evaluate the acceptance studying directly the Hamiltonian associated to the cavity.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro073_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro073.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro073_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO073,

Transverse integer tune crossing in a linear non-scaling FFAG is inevitable due to finite chromaticity. In EMMA (Electron Machine with Many Applications); as many as 6 integers may be crossed is as little as 6 turns at maximum acceleration over the 10 – 20 MeV energy range. This fast integer tune crossing; of the order 1 integer per turn; was shown to have little effect on the coherent amplitude growth and charge loss rate. Slower acceleration inside an RF bucket in EMMA allowed the experimental exploration of slower integer tune crossing speeds; of the order of a factor ten slower. The effect on the coherent oscillation amplitude was observed and the charge loss at integer tune crossings indicated resonant effects on the bunch. Simulations in Zgoubi allowed a more detailed analysis and the mechanism of slower resonance crossing in a non-scaling FFAG is discussed; including the importance of coupled longitudinal-transverse decoherence on the effective emittance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro084_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro084.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro084_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO084,

In addition to the complex; highly non-linear field featured by the two snakes; multiple non-linear coupling resonance lines are crossed by the beam in this region. Hence; the use of realistic models for the Siberian snakes is critical for the simulation of the early part of the AGS acceleration cycle. The AGS Zgoubi model uses direct tracking through OPERA field maps of the two snakes. While many processes may be obnoxious to both beam and spin dynamics in this region; it is critical to use a realistic model of the AGS at low energy.

Recent multiparticle trackings using the Zgoubi code show that the spin resonances around Gg=5 could cause as much as 5% loss of polarization. The slow acceleration rate; the two vertical and two horizontal intrinsic spin resonances can contribute to the depolarization in the region. While in the current scheme only the two horizontal intrinsic resonances are jumped; it was proposed to use the tune jumps system to also accelerate the crossing of the two weak vertical intrinsic resonances and improve the polarization transmission through this region.

The oscillations are described by means of Duffing equation. The equilibrium state is shown to exist. The solutions near the equilibrium state are analyzed. The asymptotic character of the solutions is found. Nonlinear beam transverse oscillations lead to filamentation and effective emittance growth. If particle energy dissipation is absent in the beam transportation channel the physical reason of the effective emittance growth is transfer of the part of the beam potential energy to kinetic energy of the particle transverse oscillations. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro096_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro096.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro096_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO096,

A series of experiments were performed to determine the level of beam space charge neutralization; and time required for neutralization. Measurements performed at different places along the structure indicate significant variation of neutralized space charge beam dynamics along the beamline. Results of measurements were compared with numerical simulations using macroparticle method and envelope equations to determine values of the effective beam current after neutralization; and effective beam emittance; required for beam tuning.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro097_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro097.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro097_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO097,

There are recent examples when this approach fails to predict the RFQ performance accurately: for 4-rod RFQs 3D effects near the vane ends can noticeably influence the beam dynamics. The same applies to any RFQ where the quadrupole symmetry is broken; e.g.; 4-vane RFQ with windows. We analyzed two 201.25-MHz 4-rod RFQs – one recently commissioned at FNAL and a new design for LANL – using 3D modeling with CST Studio. In both cases the manufacturer CAD RFQ model was imported into CST. The EM analysis with MicroWave Studio (MWS) was followed by beam dynamics modeling with Particle Studio (PS). For the LANL RFQ with duty factor up to 15%; a thermal-stress analysis with ANSYS was also performed. The simulation results for FNAL RFQ helped our Fermilab colleagues fix the low output beam energy. The LANL RFQ design was modified after CST simulations indicated insufficient tuning range and incorrect output energy; the modified version satisfies the design requirements. Our PS results were confirmed by multi-particle beam-dynamics codes that used the MWS-calculated RF fields.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpro098_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpro098.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpro098_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRO098,

These references are used to control the phase of the accelerator cavities to altering harmonics of the bunch revolution frequency. Delay or phase shifts from the FAIR-Center to references at the BuTiS endpoints are already compensated by the BuTiS receivers. Phase shifts from the RF reference generators to LLRF electronics can be compensated by controlling the output phases of the DDS modules of the RF references. However phase shift delays of multiple harmonics at the same interconnecting electrical path are not identical at the same time. Configurable electronics** manage phase calibration of the RF references to their endpoints. Calibration may depend on frequency and harmonic of the RF reference; aging as well as on thermal effects. The electrical length and impedance of interconnecting cables for phase control loops can be compensated.

A high power continuous wave ACC is required for ADS applications. An essential aspect of ACC is beam availability. It must be an order of magnitude better than current best systems. High availability is achieved by fault tolerance and redundancy of the ACC. Three factors play a key role here: use of components in a high MTBF regime; parallel and serial redundancy of components; ability to repair failing elements. In terms of ACC controls system (CS) EPICS and Linux is chosen as proven technology. High availability will be achieved through making parts of the CS redundant. Subsystems shall be redundant by design. If failure of a subsystem is detected; pre-defined scenarios should kick-in. System model or ""virtual accelerator"" can be implemented to predict effects of parameter change; determine required configuration of set points for optimal performance or re-configuration in case of sub-system failure.

ReA was integrated in 2013 into the Coupled Cyclotron Facility providing unique low-energy rare isotope beams. After the fast rare isotopes are stopped in a gas stopping system; mass separated and their charge state boosted in an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT); the ions are reaccelerated in a compact superconducting (SC) LINAC. For rare isotope operations; the LINAC is pre-tuned using stable pilot beams with a similar mass to charge ratio as the rare isotope beams and consequently the system is scaled. Scaling steps of up to 5\% are needed to change to the radioactive beams. To preserve the stringent beam characteristic on the experimental end station a precise online model is required.

Relations between core emittance growth and halo generation are often studied; halo scraping often experienced and halo re-formation observed. For all that; a clear distinction between the core and the halo parts does not exist. This paper proposes a new method for precisely determining the core-halo limit applicable to any particle distribution type. Once this limit is known; the importance of the halo relative to the core can be precisely quantified.

In preparation an advanced R&D program is defined: The first linac section (financed by HIM and partly by HGF-ARD-initiative) comprising a sc CH-cavity embedded by two sc solenoids will be tested in 2014/15 as a demonstrator. After successful testing the construction of an advanced cryomodule comprising four rf cavities is foreseen. As an intermediate step towards an entire cw-linac the use of a double of two CH-cavities is planned: Ashort 5 cell cavity should be mounted directly behind the demonstrator cavity inside a short cryostat. The design of the cw linac based on shorter sc CH-cavities would minimize the overall technical risk and costs.

The tank performance depends on a set of physical (beam characteristics) and geometrical parameters (radius and lengths of accelerating and coupling cavities; radius and thickness of the coupling holes among accelerating cells; the radius and the thickness of the coupling holes between off-axis coupling cells and accelerating ones). PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) have been used as approaches for the electromagnetic optimization. The model used for the fitness calculation takes into account all the most important effects occurring in the tank coupled cavities loaded by the proton beam. The codes based on PSO and ACO have enabled the global and stochastic identification of about ten optimized parameters. The design goodness has been tested via Particle and Microwave CST Studio © simulation. The optimized tank accelerates the proton beam input energy from Ein=7 MeV to about Eout= 8.2 MeV.

Periodic phase advance less than 90 degrees and equipartitioning design are considered very important principles in linac design. Due to the very high construction and operation costs; it is very important in optimizing the design to lower the costs. In usual; the longitudinal emittance is larger from the front-end; thus the transverse phase advance is designed to have a larger value. However; with the technical advancement; higher accelerating field can be obtained. In order to take this advantage; it is of much interest in increasing the longitudinal phase advance to shorten the linac or reduce the cost. In this paper; we present the design method that keeping the longitudinal phase advance as large as possible but smaller than 90 degree to maximize the use of the available accelerating gradient. Even though this method does not observe the equipartitioning condition; we can also obtain very good beam dynamics results by placing the tunes in resonant-free regions. In this paper; the design and simulation results by applying this method to the SPL and China-ADS linac will be present.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme021_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme021.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme021_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME021,

In the linac domain; the elements of primary interest are cavities and cryomodules; instead of the magnets (of all sorts) that are routinely sorted in circular accelerators. Multiple cavities can be sorted to optimise individual cryomodules; and cryomodules can be sorted into optimised locations within the tunnel. Different sorting strategies are discussed and preliminarily evaluated in this paper. Central to the evaluation is the identification of goal (or penalty) functions that are maximised (or minimised); and which can be rapidly quantified by simulation. Also crucial is the availability of a modeling system that is realistic in its complex representation of the linac; and which can easily be modified and developed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME047,

IPAC2014,,THPME056,"A Space-charge Compatible ""Tomography"" of Beam Phase-space Distributions",CEA/DSM/IRFU; France; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The well-known 3-gradient method allows accessing to a beam RMS emittance and Twiss parameters at a position A by measuring its rms size at a downstream position B with at least 3 different transport conditions from A to B. We suggest extending this method to access to a beam phase-space distribution model at A from beam profiles measured at B. We propose to use an iterative method which consists in: - defining a parametric model describing the beam distribution in 4D transverse phase-space at a position A; - adjusting iteratively the model parameters by minimizing the difference between beam profiles measured at B and these obtained by transporting the beam generated according to the model with TraceWIN code from A to B. This method allows taking into account space-charge and other transport non-linearities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme056_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme056.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme056_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME056,

The neutrons will be produced using the 7Li(p; n)7Be reaction induced by a proton beam. The 175 MHz IH-type drift tube linac with 8 gaps succeeds a 4-rod-RFQ. Together they form a coupled linac combination with a length of 2.3 m and accelerate the protons from 120 keV to 2.03 MeV. As the RF losses add up to 200 kW; the cooling of both accelerators is a central challenge. The RFQ-IH combination is powered by a radio frequency amplifier; which couples the RF power into the RFQ. The two structures are connected via inductive coupling. The initial beam operation of the accelerators is configured for 50 mA in cw mode. The IH-components were fabricated; RF tuning measurements are underway. The RFQ and the IH-DTL will be conditioned separately and then be connected; aiming for a beam operation at the end of 2014.

Since realignment of main magnet and other components was essential to realize higher beam power and stable operation; this work has been done last maintenance period. To minimize amount of realignment work; we decided that not all components moved to designed regular potions but also minimum components moved to the position which was secured design acceptance 486 π mm mrad. Almost all components which are main magnets; rf cavities; and extraction magnets had to be moved in the range of 10 mm for horizontal; 3 mm for vertical and 9 mm for longitudinal; respectively. It was not necessary for the components installed in injection straight line to move because displacement of these components was less than ± 0.2 mm.

The lifetime problem of carbon-foil strippers due to the high energy loss of beams was a principal bottleneck for the intensity upgrade. We have already developed and successfully operated a re-circulating He-gas stripper for 10-MeV/u uranium beams as an alternative to carbon foils. Recently; the 2nd gas stripper with air dedicated for 50-MeV/u 124Xe beams was developed. The differential pumping techniques similar to that used in the He gas stripper was applied. We confined a very thick gas target; up to 20~mg/cm2 of air; in a 0.5-m target chamber. One good feature of using air is that it can be inexhaustible for our use. The stripper was stably operated in user runs performed in June 2013. The service rate reached 91\%. The maximum beam intensity reached 38~pnA and the average intensity provided to users becomes approximately four times higher than it was in 2012. The down-time free gas strippers greatly contributed to these improvements.

The design is based around a 6 GeV x-band linac from the CLIC Project. One of the motivations for the design is to have an XFEL co-located on the site with existing storage ring based synchrotron light source. The desire and ability of the Australian photon science community to win beamtime on existing XFELs has lead to this design study to plan for a future machine in Australia. The technology choice is also driven by the Australian participation in the CLIC Collaboration and the local HEP community.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME081,

Nevertheless; this optimization is done to the detriment of the response linearity when the beam is off-centered for dedicated machine physic studies. To correct for the geometric non-linearity of the BPM; we have applied an algorithm using boundary element method. Moreover the BPM electronics is able to provide position data at a turn-by-turn rate. Unfortunately the filtering process in this electronics mixes the information from one turn to the neighboring turns. An additional demixing algorithm has been set-up to correct for this artefact.

A way to simply measure lower charge would be to use the linear relation; existing before saturation regime; between the incident charge and the total light intensity emitted by a YAG screen. Measurement has been performed on PHIL accelerator at LAL; with charge lower than 50pC; with a YAG screen located just in front of a Faraday Cup. It shows a very good linear response of the YAG screen up to the Faraday Cup resolution limit (2pC) and therefore allows calibrating the YAG screen for lower charge measurement with an estimated precision of 4%. A noise analysis allows estimating the YAG screen resolution limit around 40fC. Results of low charge measurement on PHIL will be shown and compared to those coming from a diamond detector installed on PHIL; in order to validate the measurement principle and to determine its precision and resolution limit. Such simple measurement may thereafter be used as single-shot charge diagnostic for electron beam generated and accelerated by laser-plasma interaction.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme094_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme094.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme094_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME094,

Among available direct THz detectors only superconducting microbolometers and Schottky diodes are capable to resolve single CSR pulses. Here we present recent photoresponse measurements of CSR with a quasioptical zero-bias Schottky diode detector which was produced at ACST GmbH. The rise-time of the recorded real-time transient was limited to approximately 20 ps by the 18-GHz bandwidth of interconnecting cables. Non-saturated responsivity of the detector; that is the amplitude of the voltage transient referred to the total CSR pulse energy in the detector quasioptical mode; was approximately 1.5 mV/fJ. The dynamic range of the detector spans almost three orders of magnitude from 3 fJ to 1 pJ. The intrinsic jitter of the detector was less than 2 ps thus not affecting the effective time resolution and allowing us to measure the arrival-time jitter of CSR pulses for different settings of the storage ring parameters.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme097_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme097.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme097_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME097,

This potentially low-cost and compact solution based on Schottky diode detectors; integrated on-chip THz antennas and filters fabricated in a commercial GaAs process will not exceed 5 mm in size replacing current single element THz detectors in the bunch compression monitors in the ELBE accelerator at HZDR. Covering the frequency range from 0.1 to 1.5 THz (and more in the future) with a resolution of 5 to 20 points; it could also be of interest for the longitudinal electron bunch diagnostic at other electron linacs such as FLUTE; BERLinPro; FLASH or the European X-FEL. Furthermore; the detector bandwidth in the GHz range supports the high repetition rates of superconducting radio frequency accelerators.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme106_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme106.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme106_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME106,

Besides other important diagnostics for setting up the machine for user beam time and further improvement of the machine – a THz source is momentary under commissioning – a EOS measuring station for bunch length measurements is locate right behind the second super conducting Linac. Measuring with a crystal in the vicinity of an up to 2 mA cw beam implies higher beam loss and also higher radiation exposure of the crystal and hence also a safety risk for the UHV conditions of the super conducting cavities in the case of crystal damage. Therefore the EOS measuring principle is adapted to larger measuring distances and also for beam requirements with lower bunch charge at ELBE.

So far; the method of resonant depolarization was used to accurately determine the energy at 2.5 GeV of the ANKA electron storage ring; which; however; becomes cumbersome for lower energies. A good alternative is the detection of Compton backscattered photons; generated by laser light scattered off the relativistic electron beam. To achieve compactness and integration into the storage ring; the setup of transverse scattering is proposed instead of conventional head-on collision. The feasibility has been studied by comparison between simulations of Compton backscattered photons by AT and CAIN 2.35 and actual measurement of background radiation with an HPGe (High Purity Germanium) spectrometer.

In order to overcome the problem it was proposed to use transition radiation (TR) in the EUV region*. For a reliable beam diagnostics however; an increase of the light output in the EUV region is required. One possibility to increase the radiation yield in the geometry of interest (target tilt angles 22.5 or 45 degrees) is to exchange the conventional monolayer target by a multilayer structure which acts as a multilayer X-ray mirror for EUV radiation. In this case; two radiation components are expected to contribute to the measured signal; diffracted transition radiation (DTR) and parametric radiation (PR)**. In this report we present results of an experimental investigation of EUV TR generated by a 5.7 MeV electron beam at monolayer and multilayer targets.

In laser plasma interactions; the resonance between betatron motion of electrons and ultraintense laser pulses is an interesting phenomenon in both electron acceleration and gamma photon production. Even though the gamma-ray synchrotron is micron scale; the energy ranges from ~1 MeV to ~102MeV. To detect the energy of the gamma-ray accurately is particularly significant. Owing to a lot of various energy of gamma-ray are emitted in femtosecond scale; which are impossible distinguished from each other on the time. A small freon-filled bubble chamber is being built to measure the energy spectrum of high-energy photons. After that; we can calculate the electron’s energy and then offer the data for various of electron acceleration theories.

We adopted the rf-deflector system which can convert the longitudinal distribution to transverse by sweeping the electron bunch. By using HFSS; we optimized the design of the 2 cell rf-deflector which is operating on π-mode; dipole (TM110-like) mode at 2856 MHz. The fabrication and the tuning of the rf deflector have successfully processed. We have installed the rf-deflector in the accelerator system of Waseda University; and performed the measurement of the bunch length. It is confirmed that this rf-deflector has the temporal resolution of 167fs with 700kW supply when the beam energy is 4.8MeV. This means that our rf-deflector system has possibility to measure the ultra-short bunch length. In this conference; the rf-deflector system in Waseda University; the result of the bunch length measurement; the performance of the rf-deflector and the future plan will be reported.,,Work supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) 10001690 and the Quantum Beam Technology Program of MEXT. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme133_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme133.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme133_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME133,

It is designed to measure the transverse profile of a beam by crossing it with a neutral supersonic gas-jet. An array of high voltage electrodes is used to extract ions from the region where the beam and gas-jet interact. These ions first hit a micro-channel plate (MCP) and are then imaged through a phosphor screen and a CCD camera. It is important to understand and characterise the measured ion distribution in order to extract the beam profile. Therefore; numerical investigations using the commercial COMSOL and OPERA codes were carried out benchmarking profile measurements obtained from a low energy electron beam. This paper presents results from these studies. It compares measurements based on the interaction of the primary beam with the residual gas or the ultra-cold gas curtain; and discusses the comparisons of simulated profiles and extraction field configurations on the measured profile.,"Funding: Work supported by the EU under grant agreement 215080 and 289485, HGF and GSI under contract VH-HG-328, the STFC Cockcroft Institute Core Grant No. ST/G008248/1, and a RIKEN-Liverpool studentship.",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme135_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme135.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme135_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME135,

The measurement of the bunch length is important technique for future electron machine. In general; the bunch length was measured by using deflecting cavity which has the time dependent transverse electromagnetic field. However; the transverse electric field of 2-cell superconducting RF (SRF) cavity can also provide the correlation between the bunch length and beam size as like the role of the deflecting cavity in bunch length measurement. The deflection strength was calibrated by changing the RF phase and the beam offset because the strength of transverse electric field of RF cavity depends on the phase of RF field and the beam offset in the cavity.

However; due to the complexity of real radiator geometry; different approximate techniques are elaborated for investigation of excited radiation*. Here we develop recently reported** approximate method for calculating Cherenkov radiation of a charge flying near a dielectric target having two main boundaries (the first interacts with a charge field and the second mainly refracts a generated radiation). We focus on cases where the radiation outside the target is convergent and use two methods for field investigation: ray optical technique and aperture integration technique. First; we deal with the case of a conical target with a vacuum channel. Under certain conditions; this radiation is concentrated near the line being the symmetry axis of the target. Second; we find the specific shape of the target that concentrates radiation in a small vicinity of given point (focus).

The origin and properties of radiation in fibers were investigated for different geometries of fiber position in respect to the electron beam. The spectral characteristics and dependence on the orientation angle of fibers relative to the electron beam were investigated. One of the useful properties of fibers is the fiber flexibility. The characteristics of radiation accepted by flexible fiber with diameter D=11 mm and length L=600 mm were investigated as a function of curvature radius of the fiber R.

This model is used to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the propagation of the accelerated beam and the losses in the MARS code system. Preliminary simulations utilizing the uniform beam loss distribution were done. More detailed simulations based on the various different loss patterns focused around hot spots in magnets were also performed and their results compared. This confirmed the limit of 0.5 W/m average heat load on accelerating cavities foreseen by the cooling requirements. Additional studies investigated the dose absorbed by fragile cooling system’s elements during the normal operation of the facility defining their radiation resistance to the levels of few kGy/y.

Besides imaging the monitor provides interferometric methods using vertically or horizontally polarized SR. With these complementary methods the consistency of beam size measurements is verified. An intermediate configuration of the monitor beamline using a lens as the focusing element has been commissioned in 2013. With this setup a vertical beam size of 4.8±0.5 μm; corresponding to a vertical emittance of 1.7±0.4 pmrad has been measured.

To achieve this task expensive and rather complicated setups (like transverse deflecting cavities) are usually implemented. The MAX IV 3 GeV linac will be used to inject into two rings and to drive a short pulse facility. Nevertheless; a more deep understanding of the beam quality would be useful especially in view of an upgrade as FEL driver. Another interesting aspect is to evaluate how the double-achromat bunch compressors are performing. We are studying how to implement off-phase acceleration: last part of the linac will be set at zero-crossing phase and the transfer line to the 3 GeV ring could be used as energy spectrometer to retrieve the bunch profile. In the present configuration of the MAX IV linac this procedure will allow to check the bunch length after the first bunch compressor. Since it is work in progress; in this contribution we present a sketch of the measurement and the feasibility of the method will be explored by means of simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpme170_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpme170.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpme170_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPME170,

Resolution must be sufficient to allow single-turn measurements of vertical beam sizes of order 10um by imaging synchrotron radiation photons onto a one-dimensional photodiode array. Measurements with beam energies above 2.1GeV and current above 0.1mA can be performed with a single-slit (pinhole) optic. At lower energy or current; small beam size measurements are limited by the diffractive width of a pinhole image and counting statistics. A coded aperture is a multi-slit mask that can improve on the resolution of a pinhole in two ways: higher average transparency improves counting statistics; and the slit pattern and masking transparency can be designed to obtain a diffractive image with narrower features. We have previously implemented coded apertures that are uniform redundant arrays (URA). A new coded aperture design is optimized for imaging with 1.8 GeV beam energy (1.9keV average x-ray energy) and with beam sizes below 20um. Resolution measurements were made in December 2013.

The target luminosity is 1035 cm-2 ses−1 at 4.6 GeV in the center of mass. This design is a natural evolution of the SuperB B-Factory; that was aimed to be built in the Rome Tor Vergata University campus as an Italian Flagship Project. The Tau/Charm design keeps all the features that made SuperB a state-of-the art accelerator; such as the “large Piwinski angle and crab waist sextupoles” collision scheme; the super squeezed beams; and the polarized electron beam. As a plus; it will be possible to collect data at high luminosity in a large energy range (2 to 4.6 GeV c. m.); with a peak luminosity target of 1034 cm-2 ses−1 at 2 GeV. The possibility to extend the Linac for a SASE-FEL facility is also taken into account. A Conceptual Design Report* was published in September 2013.

The link represents a diverse redundancy to the current implementation; which should neither significantly increase the risk for so-called asynchronous beam dumps nor compromise machine availability. This paper describes the implementation choices of this link. Furthermore the results of a reliability analysis to quantify its impact on LHC machine availability are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpri021_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpri021.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpri021_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRI021,

The biennial Accelerator Reliability Workshop covers topics related to the design and operation of particle accelerators with a high reliability. In order to optimize the over-all reliability of an accelerator one needs to gather information on the reliability of many different subsystems. While a biennial workshop can serve as a platform for the exchange of such information; the authors aimed to provide a further channel to allow for a more timely communication: the Particle Accelerator Reliability Forum (http://reliability.forumotion.com).

If we are talking about accelerator reliability then we have to know what the required functions are. Many accelerator facilities restrict their analysis to the beam availability: how reliable is beam provided to the users? We will show that this metrics is often not fully adequate. Specific metrics can be much more useful to allow you to optimize your facility to the needs of your users.

They are placed at the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) line to longitudinally focus a 5 MeV CW deuteron beam. Due to the strong space charge and the compactness of the beamline; the cavity has several space restrictions. In order to minimize the power loss; an IH-type cavity with 5 gaps was selected. It provides an effective voltage of 350 kV at 175 MHz with a power loss of 6.6 kW. First; electromagnetic calculations have been done with HFSS to compute the resonant frequency; the S-parameters; the electric and magnetic field maps; the power losses and the proper geometry for a magnetic input coupler and a pickup probe. Then; a mechanical Ansys model has been used to analyze the stresses and deformations due to vacuum; the cooling circuit and the temperature distribution; taking into account the power losses imported from the electromagnetic model.

The important feature of the upgrade is substantial enhancement of the requirements for the accelerating cavities. The new requirements include enlargement of the cavity beam pipe aperture; increase of the cavity voltage and increase in the repetition rate. The modification of the present traditional parallel biased ferrite cavities is rather challenging. An alternative to rebuilding the present Fermilab Booster RF cavities is to design and construct new perpendicular biased RF cavities; which potentially offer a number of advantages. An evaluation and a preliminary design of the perpendicular biased ferrite tuned cavities for the Fermilab Booster upgrade is described in the paper. Also it is desirable for better Booster performance to improve the capture of beam in the Booster during injection and at the start of the ramp. One possible way to do that is to flatten the bucket by introducing second harmonic cavities into the Booster. This paper also looks into the option of using perpendicularly biased ferrite tuners for the second harmonic cavities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpri061_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpri061.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpri061_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRI061,

It is found that a large enhancement occurs when the field is perpendicular to the gap between the protrusions. This mechanism could help explain the melting that has been observed on cavity surfaces subjected to pulsed heating that would nominally be well below the melting temperature of the surface material. To test this possibility; an experiment was carried out in which a pair of copper “pins” was attached to the base plate of an X-band cavity normally used to study pulsed heating. Melting was observed between the pins when the predicted peak temperature was near or exceeded the copper melting temperature.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpri078_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpri078.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpri078_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRI078,

Using a sheet beam of free electrons in a crossed beam geometry promises a high energy resolution and gives access to the interaction region for spectroscopy. The produced electron beam has a length of 10 cm in ion beam direction and a width of 5 mm in the interaction region with electron densities of up to 109 electrons/cm3. The target allows the adjustment of the electron beam current and energy in the region of several 10 eV and a few keV. Simulations have been performed regarding the energy resolution for electron-ion collisions. Also the ion optical behaviour of the target was investigated numerically. The target is integrated in a test bench to study the performance of the electron gun and the electron beam optics. The installed volume ion source delivers light ions and molecules for characterization of the target performance by measuring charge changing processes. Subsequently the target will be installed temporarily at the Frankfurt Low-Energy Storage Ring (FLSR) for further test measurements.

It has hence been considered as candidate material for the development of higher performance beam intercepting devices at CERN. Its brazing with a metal counterpart has been tested and characterized by means of microstructural and ultrasound techniques. Despite the very positive results; its use has to be evaluated with care; due to the strong evidence in literature of large and permanent volumetric expansion; called swelling; under the effect of neutron and ion irradiation. This may cause premature and sudden failure of components; and can be mitigated to some extent by operating at high temperature. For this reason limited information is available for irradiation below 100°C; which is the typical temperature reached in intercepting devices like dumps or collimators.

The accelerating cavities are operated in a liquid helium bath at 2 K. To achieve this temperature the cryostat has to be pumped down to a pressure of 35 mbar which was done by a system of pumping units connected in series; when the accelerator started its operation in 1991. In 2005 this system was replaced by four parallel switched pumping stations. In the first three years of their operation; the reliability of the accelerator was very poor due to repeated breakdowns of the pumping stations caused by overheating. In addition the high temperatures lead to an early decay of the gaskets used. The problem was solved by installing oil cooling systems and more appropriate shaft sleeves at the pumping stations. We will report on the technical efforts we made and thereby further increased the availability of the accelerator significantly. Also we will give a review on our experiences in maintenance procedures.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpri103_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpri103.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpri103_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRI103,

The method is based on measuring the three components of the magnetic field on a cylindrical surface parallel to the longitudinal axis of the magnet. Such a measurement is accomplished by carrying out a series of on-the-fly scans for a series of straight lines whose transversal coordinates lay on a circle. The Fourier decomposition of the magnetic field along a circle at a given longitudinal position yields the harmonic terms of the field at a reference radius equal to the circle’s radius. As a result the method provides the longitudinal dependence of the harmonic terms; and in particular it allows analyzing their behavior in the fringe field region. We present an example of the application of this method to the measurement of a quadrupole of the Storage Ring of ALBA. A comparison with the integrated results provided by a rotating coil bench is also shown.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/talks/thpri105_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/papers/thpri105.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IPAC2014/posters/thpri105_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2014-THPRI105,

Room temperature RF resistivity of 10 μm Cu coated stainless steel RHIC beam tube has conductivity close to copper tubing.
