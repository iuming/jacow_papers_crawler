        "FFAGs with vertical orbit excursion (VFFAGs) provide a promising alternative design for rings with fixed-field (e.g. superconducting) magnets. They have a vertical magnetic field component that increases with height in the vertical aperture",
        "yielding a skew quadrupole focussing structure. Scaling type VFFAGs have fixed tunes and no intrinsic limitation on momentum range; they are also isochronous in the ultra-relativistic limit. Extending isochronism to lower velocities requires a slanted orbit excursion: a three-dimensional analogue of a spiral sector cyclotron from 40 to 1500MeV is developed",
        "which is flat at low energies and acquires a slope as the protons become relativistic. This provides more stable tunes than a comparable planar cyclotron. Such machines are promising future candidates for nuclear transmutation using high average power CW beams at ~GeV energies."
