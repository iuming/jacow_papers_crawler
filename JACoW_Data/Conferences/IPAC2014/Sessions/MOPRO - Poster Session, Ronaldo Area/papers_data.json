The injector LINAC should provide high-intensity and low-emittance beams of 7-GeV electron and 4-GeV positron for SuperKEKB based on a nano-beam scheme. A photocathode RF-gun for low emittance electron beam has been already installed and the commissioning has started. The construction of positron capture section using a flux-concentrator and the dumping ring for low emittance positron beam is in progress. The simultaneous top-up injections to four storage-rings including photon factories is also required. In the upstream of dumping ring",

        "The Medium-energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) proposed by Jefferson Lab is designed to provide high polarization of both colliding beams. One of the unique features of JLab’s MEIC is figure-8 shape of its rings. It allows preservation and control of polarization of all ion species including small-anomalous-magnetic-moment deuterons during their acceleration and storage. The figure-8 design conceptually expands the capability of obtaining polarized high-energy beams in comparison to conventional designs because of its property of having no preferred periodic spin direction. This allows one to control effectively the beam polarization by means of magnetic insertions with small field integrals. We present a complete scheme for preserving the ion polarization during all stages of acceleration and its control in the collider’s experimental straights."

Five filling patterns are available for the users in Top-up injection mode. The storage ring is running with an upgraded optics less sensitive to insertion device (ID) configurations and giving both better beam lifetime and injection efficiency. The beam position stability remains excellent with a focus on electron vertical beam-size stability for the new very long beamlines. A gating system during Top-up injection improves significantly the quality of the spectrum on an infrared beamline.

USR can generate theoretically minimum synchrotron radiation because emittance of the USR is less than diffraction limit of the radiation.

An error field of multi-pole magnet is estimated by detecting a vibration of a single wire excited with AC current. The wire position",

Using particle tracking simulation code FLUKA the European XFEL electron beam interaction with the titanium collimator and copper absorber of the undulator intersections as well as FLASH beam interaction with the tapered collimator were simulated. Absorbed dose spatial distribution in the material of the collimators was simulated for the total secondary radiation and its important photon and neutron components. Residual dose rate after irritation of the collimator material by the electron beam was calculated. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
