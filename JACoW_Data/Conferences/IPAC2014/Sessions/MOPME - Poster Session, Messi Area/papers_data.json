The Method of Moments is a full-wave method used to solve scattering problems. Its main advantage over FE or FDTD solvers is that unknowns are limited to the boundaries of the object. The resulting dense system of equations can be solved very rapidly with the help of domain-decomposition approaches (e.g. Macro Basis Functions*)",
        "especially when the level of detail is very fine compared to the wavelength",
        "which is definitely the case for RFQ’s. Such a method however needs a first regularization method to overcome the low-frequency breakdown in order to compute the Macro Basis Functions. The respective field contributions of different parts of the global structure (e.g. rods vs. stems) can also easily be finely investigated. Numerical results will be presented based on the Myrrha RFQ. The low-frequency breakdown issue due to the very fine mesh will be discussed and a solution based on the so-called Loop-Tree** decomposition will be detailed.",

Generally",

We propose here to simulate accurately the SILHI source extraction system with the Warp and AXCEL-INP codes. The SILHI ion source will be quickly presented and some simulations results will be given and discussed."

In this paper we used Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and the tracking code ELEGANT to optimize the linear and non-linear beam dynamics of the SOLEIL synchrotron light source. The objectives of our optimization are the dynamical aperture and the momentum aperture which are strongly correlated to the injection efficiency and the Touschek lifetime",

While Mirko fully complies with the demands and is still in regular use",

The simulation results were validated against Mirko and a good agreement of the calculated beam envelopes could be achieved. Works on the graphical user interface (GUI) for visualisation of and interaction with the beam envelopes and the link to the control system are in progress."

In order to effectively process all the information gathered from eigenmode simulations a new algorithm was developed to automatically recognize modes’ field patterns. In this paper we present the principles of the algorithm and investigate its applicability by means of different single and multi cell cavities. The highest achievable order of correctly recognized modes is of particular interest. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

New features are being developed for inclusion in COSY to follow the distribution of particles through matter. To study in detail the properties of muons passing through material",
        "the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map–Monte-Carlo approach in which transfer map methods describe the average behavior of the particles including energy loss",
        "and Monte-Carlo methods are used to provide small corrections to the predictions of the transfer map accounting for the stochastic nature of scattering and straggling of particles. The advantage of the new approach is that the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects. The gains in speed will aid the optimization of muon cooling channels. Progress on the development of the required algorithms is reported."

LINAC has recently received an upgrade in terms of new secondary radiation sources and beam lines, while advancing the accelerator infrastructure towards 1.6 mA C.W. operation (1.0 mA before). Therefore, the machine interlock system (MIS) was redesigned in parts to meet the new timing requirements resulting from the increased overall beam power. It comprises fast beam loss detection and a PLC based beam line equipment protection system (EPS), both tripping the key components of the electron sources. The former tripping system using PLC interrupts was replaced by an in-house developed staggered CPLD based system with optical transmission and a PROFINET IO interface for control system integration. The EPS is distributed on several PLCs and has been improved in terms of M2M communication. Further, the vacuum inrush protection was completely renewed using brought-in equipment. This contribution depicts the technical features and performance of the MIS subsystems, as well as the actual status within the upgrade project. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

A residual field of about 6% of the flat-top exists at the tail of the pulse due to an impedance mismatching. The residual field is required to be suppressed less than 1% to reduce injection losses. For a higher intensity beam operation",

        "A terminated power cable is typically applied not only for terminated ends but also to connect two or more cables. The electric field inside the insulation layer becomes disturbed when a coaxial cable structure is broken and the electric stress increases near the ground edge. A structure of cone type is a major method to alter the lines of equi- potential and to relieve the electric stress around the ground. The dimensions of the cone depend on the cable structure. In this paper we introduce a way to calculate the displacement of equi-potential lines when a cone is brought into a coaxial cable",
        "RG220",
        "and then determine a suitable angle and length of the cone",
        "which are important factors to withstand tens of kV and even greater. The corresponding high-voltage tests are also presented here."

One injection and two extraction in vacuum kicker magnets in the booster ring are designed and noticed to minimize driving voltage. The HV insulation for magnet itself and vacuum feedthrough need to be tested. A DC withstand voltage tester MUSASHI 3802 (Model: IP-701G) is used to test the DC breakdown voltage",

Thicker than 10 mm ceramic plate could effectively avoid the breakdown occurred with 37 kV DC charging. Thus HV withstand voltage will be higher in vacuum chamber and the insulation with HV will not be the problem."
