The previous positron production target and capture section have been removed and the new system is constructed at a location forty meters upstream to have sufficient energy margin for beam injection to the newly introduced damping ring. A flux concentrator is introduced in the new capture section to make an adiabatic matching system. Large aperture (30mm in diameter) S-band accelerating structures are introduced in the capture section and in the subsequent accelerator module to enlarge the transverse phase space acceptance. The beam focusing system of quadrupoles is also upgraded for a comparable beam acceptance to that of the capture section. This paper reports on the status of the SuperKEKB positron source construction and the preliminary positron beam commissioning."

This facility creates and heats up the plasma by 37.5 GHz gyrotron radiation with power up to 100 kW in a simple mirror trap meeting the ECR condition. High microwave power and frequency allow sustaining plasma of significantly higher density (Ne up to 2·1013 cm-3) in comparison to conventional ECRISes or other microwave ion sources. The low ion temperature",

The simulations were targeted at optimizing magnetic confinement of the hot electrons through an iterative design of three solenoids and a dodecapole. In addition a plasma production model has been implemented in order to study ion species yield from neutral gases and their drift towards the cold plasma regions. Eventually",

        "Electron diffraction is a tool for exploring structural dynamics of matter. The scattering cross section is orders of magnitude higher for electrons than for X-rays so that only a small number of electrons is required to achieve comparable results. However",
        "the required electron beam quality is extraordinary. To study e. g. proteins a coherence length of 30 nm is required which translates into a transverse emittance of 5 nm at a spot size of 0.4mm. In addition short bunch lengths down to 10 fs and a temporal stability of the same order are required in order to study chemical reactions or phase transitions in pump probe type experiments. These are challenging parameters for an electron source",
        "which demand improvements at many frontiers. Dark current degrades contrast of diffraction patterns in all experiments. Understanding dark-current generation and propagation can lead to better methods to decrease it. In this paper dark current studies that are performed at REGAE will be presented."

Then the QE increased at 10% after treatment at higher 823K. Successive increase of the QE to 13% was observed with a reduced temperature treatment at 723K. The GaAs surfaces after the thermal treatment in the high temperature region with the NEA activation are different from the as-cleaned-GaAs surfaces probably in stoichiometry or morphology due to desorption of As and Ga atoms. The role of thermal treatment with NEA activation is the modification of surface properties important for elevating the QE."

      "abstract": "The 2 MeV electron cooler was installed in the COSY ring in the spring 2013. The new system enables electron cooling in the whole energy range of COSY. The electron beam is guided by longitudinal magnetic field all the way from the electron gun to the collector. This well-proven optics scheme was chosen because of the wide electron energy range of 0.025-2 MeV. The electrostatic accelerator consists of 33 individual sections of identical design. Electrical power to each section is provided by a cascade transformer. Electron beam commissioning and first studies using proton and deuteron beams were carried out. Electron cooling of proton beam up to 1662 MeV kinetic energy was demonstrated. Maximum electron beam energy achieved so far amounted to 1.25 MeV. Voltage up to 1.4 MV was demonstrated. The cooler was operated with electron current up to 0.5 A. The paper provides insights into the recent progress in high energy electron cooling at COSY and perspectives for the HESR ring at FAIR. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

A bare uranium beam is injected from the collector ring CR into the HESR at 740 MeV/u*. The simulation studies are now improved to include different injection schemes applying either the barrier cavity or the h = 1 cavity in the HESR. It is outlined how the new 2.5 MeV electron cooler at COSY Jülich or stochastic cooling can support the injection mechanism. The beam preparation for an internal target experiment with cooling is outlined. The acceleration of the ion beam is extended to 5 GeV/u under the mandatory condition of the available cavity voltages and the maximum magnetic field ramp rate in the HESR. The flexibility of the HESR ring lattice is utilized to avoid transition energy crossing during ramping up to 5 GeV/u and to adjust the rings’ frequency slip factor for optimal stochastic cooling.

The beam is then extracted with an electrostatic deflector and reaccelerated up to 800 MeV/amu through a superconducting ring cyclotron. The acceleration of H2+ has two advantages: it reduces the space charge effect along the injection and acceleration inside the first cyclotron and allows the extraction of the beam from the last accelerator using a stripper foil. The injector cyclotron can be used in stand-alone mode to drive the IsoDAR experiment",

The idea was to create and guide a milliampere beam of low charged metal ions so that targets with a width of 20 cm and more can be irradiated homogeneously with minimal differences in intensity and entrance angle of the incoming beam over the entire surface. In this poster",
        "we outline the solutions which had to be found during the realization of the project. This concerns the production of a milliampere metal ion current in a newly designed electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source combined with an internal sputter magnetron device. Stable operation of the sputter magnetron under ECR magnetic mirror conditions has been proven by optical spectroscopy and Langmuir probe measurements. Furthermore",
        "electrostatic and magnetic beamline elements developed for precision guiding of a low energy but high intensity beam as well as high intensity ion beam diagnostics are presented and ion beam transportation simulations are shown."

        "A routine has been implemented to simulate interactions of protons with bent crystals in the collimation version of \\texttt{SixTrack}. This routine is optimized in view of producing high-statistics tracking simulations of collimation cleaning assisted by bent crystals. Fine tuning and comparisons with experimental data of coherent effects which a particle can experience in a bent crystal have been carried out. The data taken with 400 GeV beams at the CERN-SPS North Area in the framework of the UA9 experiment are used to benchmark the routine. Further checks on low probability interactions have been made",
        "leading to significant improvements in the description of interactions with crystals. Comparisons with other simulations tools are used to increase our confidence in the scaling to higher energies."

Two different simulation approaches using the Monte Carlo programs MCNPX and FLUKA are applied to estimate the equivalent remanent dose rate after the irradiation of the collimator.
