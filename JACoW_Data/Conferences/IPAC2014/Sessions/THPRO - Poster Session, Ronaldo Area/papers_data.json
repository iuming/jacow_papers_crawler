        "The infrared free-electron laser offers a large tunability since the FEL gain remains high throughout the infrared spectral range",
        "and the reflectivity of metal mirrors remains also close to unity. The main limitation comes from the diffraction of the optical beam due to the finite size of the vacuum chamber of the undulator. A solution is to use this chamber as a waveguide by adaptating the radius of curvature of the cavity mirrors to this regime. Then",
        "as has been shown before* a minimum appears in the spectrum that can be produced by the FEL. We discuss the physical mechanism of this particular regime and compare it to experiments using vacuum chambers of different tranverse sizes. A good agreement is found with results of simulations and with a simple analytical formula.",

Harmonic lasing occurs in the exponential gain regime in the first part of the undulator",

Beam dynamics simulations using a 3D ellipsoidal cathode laser shape yielded to a significant improvement of the electron beam quality compared to the traditionally used cylindrically shaped beams. The 3D ellipsoidal laser system is under development at the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) and will be used at PITZ soon",

The recent studies of electron beam simulations at PITZ have been devoted to the position optimization of the second accelerating cavity for the 3D ellipsoidal laser profile.

Beam tolerance studies revealed much better injector performance for the 3D ellipsoidal laser profile case with the optimized booster position.

All three cavities had been dry-ice-cleaned prior their conditioning and hence showed low dark current levels. The lowest dark current level – as low as 60μA at 65MV/m field amplitude – has been observed for the gun 3.1. This paper reports in details about the conditioning process of the most recent gun 4.4. It informs about experience gained at PITZ during establishing of the RF conditioning procedure and provides a comparison with the other gun cavities in terms of the dark currents. It also summarizes the major setup upgrades",
        "which have affected the conditioning processes of the cavities."

Design emphasizes versatility of operation and beam quality control and compensation of nonlinearities",

        "The design of an electron beam Final Focus System (FFS) aiming for high-flux laser-Thomson backscattering x-ray sources at ELBE* is presented. A telescope system consisting of four permanent magnet based quadrupoles was found to have significantly less chromatic aberrations than a quadrupole triplet. This allows sub-ps electron beam focusing to match the laser spot size at the interaction point. Focusing properties like the position of the focal plane and the spot size are retained for electron beam energies between 20 and 30 MeV by adjusting the position of the quadrupoles individually on a motorized stage. Since the electron beam is chirped for bunch compression upstream",
        "the rms energy spread is increased to one or two percent and second order chromatic effects must be taken into account. For an emittance of 13 pi mm mrad",
        "we predict rms spot sizes of about 40 um and divergences of about 15 mrad. We also present the design of the permanent magnet quadrupoles to be used for the FFS. Ferromagnetic poles ensure a high field quality and adjustable shunts allow for fine adjustment of the field strength and compensation of deviations in the permanent magnet material.",

For this purpose it was decided to carry out the first precursor experiment at the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY). Since the EDM of a particle violates CP invariance and is expected to be tiny",

Because of small axial focusing of the beam in a center of the cyclotron the radial component of magnetic field imperfections leads to additional proton losses. Measured maps of the axial and radial components of magnetic field were used in the simulations. It was found that the radial component with value 5-10 G in the center and approximately 2 G in the main region of acceleration leads to decrease of the resulting beam intensity by about two times and to increase the beam axial width by 25% as well. Simulations define the requirements to the experimental radial component shaping for the next cyclotrons of this series. Providing these requirements will ensure an absence of the additional proton losses due to the axial motion perturbations. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

In simulations the acceptance is evaluated tracking several particles with different energies and phases and marking when a particle is transmitted or lost.

Nonlinear oscillations of the beam radius appear due to self-consistent nonlinear forces. To study these oscillations the model is used that automatically satisfy to Vlasov equation. The oscillations are described by means of Duffing equation. The equilibrium state is shown to exist. The solutions near the equilibrium state are analyzed. The asymptotic character of the solutions is found. Nonlinear beam transverse oscillations lead to filamentation and effective emittance growth. If particle energy dissipation is absent in the beam transportation channel the physical reason of the effective emittance growth is transfer of the part of the beam potential energy to kinetic energy of the particle transverse oscillations. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The same applies to any RFQ where the quadrupole symmetry is broken",

        "4-vane RFQ with windows. We analyzed two 201.25-MHz 4-rod RFQs – one recently commissioned at FNAL and a new design for LANL – using 3D modeling with CST Studio. In both cases the manufacturer CAD RFQ model was imported into CST. The EM analysis with MicroWave Studio (MWS) was followed by beam dynamics modeling with Particle Studio (PS). For the LANL RFQ with duty factor up to 15%",
        "a thermal-stress analysis with ANSYS was also performed. The simulation results for FNAL RFQ helped our Fermilab colleagues fix the low output beam energy. The LANL RFQ design was modified after CST simulations indicated insufficient tuning range and incorrect output energy; the modified version satisfies the design requirements. Our PS results were confirmed by multi-particle beam-dynamics codes that used the MWS-calculated RF fields."

At its core a new 42 keV XFEL will be coupled with a MW class proton accelerator. While the larger MaRIE project is working on a pre-conceptual design a smaller LANL team is working on an injector test-stand to be constructed at LANL in the course of preparation for MaRIE. The test stand will consist of a photo injector and an initial accelerating section with a bunch compression section. The goal of this facility will be to carry out studies that will determine optimal design parameters for the prototype injector",
        "and to facilitate a direct demonstration of the required beam characteristics for MaRIE. This paper will give a brief overview of the proposed MaRIE facility and present the conceptual design for the injector test stand with the focus on the instrumentation and control system."
