The modulation is initially imparted in the transverse dimension of the electron bunch with a nano-patterned photo-emitter in a X-band RF gun with 2 MeV exit energy. The electron bunch passes through a 1 m standing wave X-band LINAC which can raise the beam energy up to 20 MeV. The transverse modulation is exchanged into the longitudinal dimension using a double dog-leg emittance exchange setup with a 5 cell RF deflector cavity. The modulation pitch can be tuned by adjusting the spacing of the nano-patterned photo-emitter or magnification of the transverse pitch with electron optics. The electron beam parameters are optimized to produce coherent XFEL radiation upon interacting with a “laser undulator”. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Intensive work has been done on the recently proposed design that operates at the HE11 hybrid mode of a corrugated waveguide; successful experimental results have been reported recently [S.Tantawi Talk at POSIPOL 2012]. In this presentation we propose a beam driven design for an undulator based on an electron bunch train powering a microwave or mm waveguide. The drive bunch train propagates towards the undulating beam inside a dielectric loaded structure or corrugated waveguide generating high power RF. The “smart” waveguide design and a proper bunch spacing of the electron drive beam train provide single mode generation of the high magnitude undulating field that gives an undulator parameter in the range of K~1 for a high frequency device.* reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The Siberia-2 injection system was initially consisted of two high voltage rectangular pulses generators connected to the two in-vacuum strip – line kickers of traveling wave (wave impedance 50 Ohm) – a pre-inflector and an inflector. The amplitude voltage was 25-35 kV with 20 ns pulse duration and 2-3 ns pulse front/fall. Recently the new injection generators were proposed. Injection system now includes the same kickers and the new 1 microsecond pulse duration and 10 kV voltage amplitude generators.

This paper presents details of the magnetic field degradation caused by radiation damage to the undulator magnets. For some undulators changes in the spectral properties of the generated light were observed. It was measured with different taper settings in order to partly compensate the nonuniform demagnetization along the structure. The results are compared with the data from the sFLASH undulators and measurements of special 3 pole \"sacrificial\" undulator",

        "Cryocooled permanent magnet undulators (CPMUs) using NdFeB magnets around 150K were first proposed by Hara*. These are cooled by using either GM cryocoolers or circulating sub-cooled liquid nitrogen. Due to the heat load from radiation and wakefield heating from the electron beam",
        "temperature gradients can develop along the length of the magnet girders which could be as large as several degrees for the Diamond Light Source (DLS) storage ring operating parameters. Some grades of the magnetic material (NdxPr1-x)2Fe14B have remanence curves versus temperature which increase significantly for temperatures below 150K with peaks below 80K**. This means that the operating temperature of a CPMU using this material can be close to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. The proposed cooling system for the new DLS CPMU is based on a thermosiphon allowing nitrogen to boil inside the cooling channels without a circulating pump. This has the advantage of absorbing large amounts (>250W) of heat with very small temperature gradients. We report here the results of a prototype magnet beam cooled with a thermosiphon producing a temperature gradient of less than 0.05K along a 2m beam at ~77K.",

It has been understood for a while that a coaxial pair of double-helical windings can generate helical as well as planar magnetic fields*. Such a coil structure can potentially be realized with superconducting windings thus forming the concept of a universal superconducting undulator (Universal SCU). An example of a possible universal SCU for the recently suggested Advanced Photon Source multi-bend achromat storage ring is given in this paper. The results of the magnetic simulation together with initial cryogenic considerations are presented. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The extraction kicker gap has to synchronize to the MI and RR injection bucket in order to avoid a beam loss at the rising edge of the extraction and injection kickers. Magnetic cogging is able to control the revolution frequency and the position of the gap using the magnetic field from dipole correctors while radial position feedback keeps the beam at the central orbit. The new cogging is expected to reduce beam loss due to the orbit changes and reduce beam energy loss when the gap is created. The progress of the magnetic cogging system development is going to be discussed in this paper."

The relatively weak but numerous horizontal resonances are the main source of polarization loss in the AGS. A pair of horizontal quads have been used to overcome these weak resonances. This technique needs very accurate jump timing. Fast roll-over magnet cycle has been used and it improves the polarization transmission efficiency near extraction when acceleration usually is slowing down. Emittance preservation is also important to mitigate polarization loss. Recent experimental results including jump quad timing and emittance preservation are presented in this paper. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "The X-band RF linear accelerators (LINAC’s) are popular for medical application due to its compactness. To increase the precision of treatment accuracy under circumstance in which the LINAC is mounted on an apparatus such as gantry frame or robot-arm; this is an advantage as the weight and size are more reduced. It is a 9.3 GHz magnetron with the most readily available RF generator in the X-band frequencies from 8 GHz to 12 GHz and the magnetron is mainly used for the source of the RF power in a compact LINAC. The average power of the magnetron at 9.3~GHz is generally a few MW and this amount could provide a sufficient radiation dose-rate for tumour therapy. KAERI has been developing a new compact 9.3 GHz X-band electron LINAC for a cancer treatment system. The maximum energy of the electron beam is 6 MeV and the average beam power at the tungsten target is about 1 kW. In this paper",

Scattering and collimation were used to distribute irradiation dose to the target volume. New beam lines are developed for transport of slow extracted proton (E<230MeV) or carbon (E<400MeV/n) beams from synchrotron UK to the same three treatment rooms and to experimental building. They will be equipped with scanning magnets. The fixed horizontal directions will be used in two rooms for treatment of special localizations in eye or head. To treat any targets from different directions compact “planar system” is developed covering irradiation directions of ±45 degrees to horizontal plane. Planar system can be used in two rooms.

        "The primary advantage of proton beam therapy as a cancer treatment is its ability to maximize the radiation dose delivered to the target volume and minimize the dose to surrounding healthy tissue",
        "due to the inherently narrow Bragg peak at the end of the proton range. This can be further enhanced by imaging the target volume and surrounding tissues using proton Computed Tomography (pCT)",
        "which directly measures the energy loss from individual protons to infer the tissue density. Proton energies up to 330 MeV are required for pCT. We describe a superconducting gantry design which can deliver protons for both therapy and pCT with a similar size to existing treatment gantries. The use of ten identical combined-function superconducting dipole magnets minimizes the weight and technical development required. Based on experience with superconducting magnets for carbon gantries it should be possible to change the magnetic field sufficiently quickly to perform spot-scanning over successive layers without inducing quenching. It is envisaged that a combination of cryogenic cooling and cryogen-free cooling will be used to achieve the required operating temperature for the magnet windings."

The first one is getting orthopositronium flux in flight. Slow positrons from 22Na source are accumulated in Surko trap and then are injected into the ring where they should overlap with electrons from the single-pass electron beam. In this way the flux of orthopositronium atoms will appear and will be observed in the process of registration of gamma quanta from annihilation process. The second group of works focuses on using the positron injector for Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS) applications. This method is dedicated to detection of structural defects as vacancies in the solid body lattice. The latest progress of this technique is strictly connected with measurements of PAS characteristics using positron beams. The progress in the LEPTA development",

Neutron techniques can be broadly grouped into neutron in/neutron out and neutron in/photon out techniques. The use of accelerator based fusion devices will potentially enable to wide spread application of neutron security techniques due to the potential for much safer operation than that offered by fission or sealed tube sources.
