        "This paper presents a conceptual design of bending magnets to be used first in a full energy booster for a lepton machine (TLEP) and later in a low energy ring for a hadron machine (VHE-LHC). TLEP and VHE-LHC would be respectively e-ebar and p-p colliders",
        "at the energy frontier in each category",
        "to be installed in a 80-100 km circumference tunnel. The main requirements in terms of operating field range and field quality are discussed. Two dimensional simulations then show how an iron-dominated magnet could fulfil the specifications. The design is a \"transmission-line\" magnet",
        "where the excitation current is provided by a single turn. When operating with leptons",
        "a resistive conductor can be used. To then increase the strength needed to handle hadrons",
        "the use of superconducting technology is needed. Recent results on similar prototypes built for different machines are recalled to point to the developments needed to assess the viability of this design."
