      "abstract": "High energy physics projects have been important drivers of accelerator R&D for several decades. The resulting accelerator technology was used to construct frontier accelerators for HEP but was also very successfully applied in accelerators for other science fields, in particular photon science, nuclear physics, medical applications, â€¦ Fewer HEP projects and at the same time a growing number of projects in other areas require a modified approach to accelerator R&D. Efforts and progress to perform accelerator R&D as an independent research program with its own, independent funding are described for the example of the Helmholtz ARD program in Germany. Links to efforts in other countries are discussed and an outlook to future accelerator research is given.",
