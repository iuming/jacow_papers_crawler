        "the first x-ray free-electron laser (xFEL) in the world",
        "has opened a new era for x-ray photon science. The unprecedented intensity and coherence of the LCLS photon pulses have enabled groundbreaking experiments in a wide variety of fields ranging from coherent x-ray imaging to molecular and atomic physics. Despite the success of x-ray free-electron lasers",
        "there is a steady push to extend and improve their capabilities fueled by the users' demands for new modes of operation and more precise photon and electron diagnostics. In my talk I will present several R&D initiatives at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory geared towards improving the performance and extending the capabilities of x-ray FELs. In particular I will focus on the spectral manipulation of FELs and our recent development of the multibunch and multicolor x-ray FEL modes at LCLS as well as our demonstration of the longitudinal space-charge amplifier as a broadband coherent light source at the NLCTA test accelerator."

Looking back upon 20 years R&D on C-band accelerator, I would like to give some advises to young scientists on doing research. The developed C-band accelerator is now providing 8 GeV electron beams at SACLA X-ray FEL in daily operation with the world best energy stability among these large scale machines.",

        "The MAX story started with the design and construction of a small Race-Track Microtron 1973-1979. This microtron was later followed by the synchrotron radiation storage rings MAX I",
        "MAX II",
        "MAX III and the MAX IV facility",
        "the latter consisting of two storage rings operated at 1.5 and 3 Gev respectively and also including a full energy injector linac. It was quite clear from the very beginning that conventional accelerator technology not was matching the boundary conditions in terms of the staff size and limited economical resources at MAX. We had to find new technical solutions based on mass-produced industrial components and an extensive usage of CNC machining to match the turbulent development of synchrotron radiation sources. This article describes some of the most important features of the accelerators developed at MAX-lab and covers also the design philosophy behind the early ideas for designing a close to Diffraction Limited Storage Ring. Finally",
        "the author and MAX staff wants to thank the prize committee for the prestigious Wider√∂e prize and thank all our international colleagues world-wide."
