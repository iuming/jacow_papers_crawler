        ". The S-LSR storage ring has a high super periodicity of 6",
        "which is preferable from the beam dynamical point of view. At S-LSR one dimensional ordering of proton beam was already realized for the first time**. Active three dimensional laser cooling has been experimentally demonstrated for ions with un-negligible velocity (v/c=0.0019",
        "where c is the light velocity) for the first time. Utilizing the above mentioned characteristics of S-LSR",
        "an approach to realize ultralow emittances has been pursuit. To suppress heating effects",
        "due to intra-beam scattering",
        "the circulating ion beam intensity was reduced by scraping and beam emittances of 1.3·10-11 pi m·rad and 8.5·10-12 pi m·rad (normalized) have been realized for the horizontal and vertical directions",

        "which is the lowest emittance ever attained by laser cooling. From MD computer simulations",
        "it is predicted that reduction of the ion number to about 103 is needed to realize a crystalline string.",
