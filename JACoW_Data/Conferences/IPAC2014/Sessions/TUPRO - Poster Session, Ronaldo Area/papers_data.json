Machine availability is even more important for the future High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [1]. In this paper a Monte Carlo approach has been used to predict integrated luminosity as a function of LHC machine availability. The baseline model assumptions such as fault-time distributions and machine failure rate (number of fills with stable beams dumped after a failure / total number of fills with stable beams) were deduced from the observations during LHC operation in 2012. The predictions focus on operation after LS1 and its evolution towards HL-LHC. The extrapolation of relevant parameters impacting on machine availability is outlined and their corresponding impact on fault time distributions is discussed. Results for possible future operational scenarios are presented. Finally",

      "abstract": "The upgrade of the LHC from the current set-up to high luminosity performances will provide new challenges from the point of view of beam-beam as well as other collective effects and luminosity levelling. We present the current possibilities for doing luminosity levelling for HL-LHC. We explore the merits and drawbacks of each option and briefly discuss the operational implications. The simplest option being levelling with an offset between the two beams. In particular, we look at the possibility of using flat beams in the IPs for all the available options and investigate their benefits and drawbacks, using the code COMBI. Flat beams would allow an additional degree of freedom, with the levelling only required in one of the planes at any given IP. To this end, various scenarios are looked at, both with and without crab cavities. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The linear coupling resonance Qx+Qy=43 has been identified as the potential source for significant particle losses at the collimator. The resonance compensation scheme has been studied experimentally by using a low intensity beam. To understand this process the simulations have been performed by using the PTC-ORBIT code. The Main Ring model has been developed to reproduce the machine operation including the initial stage of the acceleration. The 6D beam model has been defined to represent the ‘pencil’ beam used for this study. In frame of this report the single and multi particle dynamics will be discussed to understand the results of measurements",
        "performed during RUN44 (November 2012). The results of the long-term tracking for this case will be presented. The obtained results can be used to benchmark the computer modeling the ‘sum’ linear coupling resonance with the experimental results."

This study focuses on the development of the of beam transport system extending from cathode to beam dump.

Preliminary experiments into the feasibility of such a system are analyzed."

With two combined function dipoles and 11 multipole magnets integrated into 4.5 m long iron yokes these magnet systems are significantly larger. The ±0.02 mm mechanical tolerance requirement is a significant challenge but is possible with special attention to the minimization of tolerance build-up effects on the inserted multipole magnets by functional machining.

This approach allows us to reduce the effective plate surface. In this case we can decrease effects related to induced charges and currents. In the result of modelling optimal construction was developed. It includes 6 wires. The magnet aperture is about 5 cm. Calculated field rise time (about 1.5 ns) satisfies the conditions. Induced current effect reducing idea was confirmed. For configuration with 3 wires pair (with cross section of 2 mm) induced current in one wire is about 10% and in the wall is about 40%. However for design with plates current is about 40% and 20% respectively. Obtained magnet construction allows controlling of high field homogeneity by changing currents magnitudes in wires. In general we demonstrated the method of field optimization. Summary. Optimal kicker design was obtained. Wires using idea was substantiated."

The mechanical and magnet field performance of these magnets were fully inspected in NSRRC. The standard deviation of the integral field strength of 48 SR-dipole magnets is better than 0.1%. The integral multipoles and offsets of the magnetic center of the 240 SR quadrupole and 168 SR sextupole magnets conform to strict specifications. The field characteristics of the BR combined-function dipole magnet were analyzed with an average of processing raw data. The standard deviation of the field strength of 54 BR dipole-magnets is better than 0.2%. The field quality of 36 BR pure quadrupole and 48 BR combined-function quadrupole magnets are accepted to meet the requirement of the booster ring. The field strength and multipole errors of 24 BR sextupole magnets were also examined.

        "helical dipole and helical quadrupole fields has been shown to provide six-dimensional phase space reduction for muon beams. Such a channel can be implemented by a helical solenoid (HS) composed of short solenoid coils arranged in a helical pattern. The magnetic channel will provide the desired Bphi",
        "Bz",
        "and dBphi/dr along the reference path. The channel must allow enough space for RF cavities which replace energy lost in the absorber material present for the cooling process. The study will describe how to achieve the desired field while allowing sufficient space for the cavities. The limits to this design imposed by the achievable current density in the coils will be discussed."

      "abstract": "The first step in the three-step laser assisted H− beam stripping for charge exchange injection is to remove one electron in a strong magnetic field. In order to preserve the beam emittance for the subsequent laser induced stripping of the second electron the magnetic field has to have large gradient of about 40 T/m along the beam trajectory. The required magnetic field strength for stripping 1GeV H− beam is 1.2 T in 29 mm aperture. In order to allow for undisturbed passage of high power beam during the nominal SNS operation the stripping magnet made of permanent magnet material resides in vacuum chamber and can move in and out of the beam line. This presentation describes requirements and design and the magnetic field calculation results for a stripping magnet for the Laser Stripping Experiment at SNS. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
