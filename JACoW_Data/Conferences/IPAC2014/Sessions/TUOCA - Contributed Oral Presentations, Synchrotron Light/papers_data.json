      "abstract": "Backward Compton scattering (BCS) of X-ray photons emitted by undulator and reflected back by a single crystal from the electron beam can produce a quasi-monochromatic gamma-ray beam up to an energy very close to the electron beam energy. The SPring-8 beam diagnostics beamline (BL05SS) is used to inject a reflected undulator X-ray radiation against 8 GeV stored electron beam and to extract a quasi-monochromatic 8 GeV gamma-ray produced by BCS. BL05SS has conditions to do a pilot experiment to obtain the gamma-ray beam using BCS of X-ray photons from existing undulator. Experimental setup including a Bragg mirror system is now under construction. Preliminary reflectivity measurement of a silicon Bragg mirror using around 10keV photons has been done. Status of the experimental preparation and the future outlook is presented.",
