        "with a circular lepton collider (FCC-ee/TLEP) as potential intermediate step",
        "and a lepton-hadron collider (FCC-he) as additional option. FCC-ee",

        "and Higgs boson and the top quark",
        "represents a significant push in terms of technology and design parameters. Pertinent R&D efforts include the RF system",

        "such as high-field magnet design",
        "machine protection and effective handling of large synchrotron radiation power in a superconducting machine. All these issues are being addressed by a global FCC collaboration. A parallel design study in China prepares for a similar",
