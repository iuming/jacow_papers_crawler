        "This talk describes how the latest imaging technologies coupled with advanced computer modelling methods can tell a therapist precisely where to aim radiation beams to destroy diseased tissue. A major challenge for treating many common cancers is the movement of the body due to breathing",
        "motion of the gut and changes in the position of the patient. This presentation will describe techniques for compensating for these movements",
        "and show how new technologies are being brought to bear on the treatment of range of different cancers."
