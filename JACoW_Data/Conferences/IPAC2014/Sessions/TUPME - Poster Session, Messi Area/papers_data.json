      "abstract": "The International Linear Collider requires an intense polarized positron beam with yields of about 1014 positrons per second. A polarized positron beam can be produced with a helical undulator passed by the accelerated electron beam to create a high power polarized photon beam. The photon beam penetrates a thin titanium-alloy rotating target wheel of 1m diameter with 500 to 2000 rpm rotation speed and produces polarized positrons. The system should run for 1-2 years without failure. A break down can occur due to the huge heat load in a short time (<1ms). The target design must keep the resulting thermo-mechanical stress below the yield strength and the fatigue limit of the material. FEM ANSYS simulations are used to evaluate the thermo-mechanical stress as well as the vibrations at the bearings of the rotating system. Results are presented with the goal to optimize the target wheel design parameters for a long lifetime. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "this approach is totally new and it is very difficult to demonstrate the system prior to the construction because it requires more than 100 GeV beam as the driver. A conventional positron generation (e-driven) has been proposed as a technical backup option. In this method",
        "the technology is well established",
        "but the issue is to obtain an enough amount of positron with a manageable energy deposition on target. We present a result of a systematic study of capture efficiency defined by DR (Damping Ring) acceptance where the beam emittance is reduced by radiation damping. We performed a start-to-end simulation of the positron source of ILC and found that an enough amount of the positron per bunch is obtained with a manageable energy deposition on the production target."

We demonstrate via numerical simulations the possibility to produce axial electric field with peak amplitude close to 0.5 GV/m.

        "The AWAKE experiment recently approved at CERN will study the acceleration of an externally injected electron bunch in a plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) driven by a self-modulated proton bunch. We study the possibility of injecting a bunch created by a laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerator (LWFA). We consider a first plasma source used for self-modulation of the drive bunch and a gas discharge source for acceleration of the collinearly injected bunch. The LWFA produces an electron bunch very short when compared to the PWFA wavelength and with relatively large current",
        "possibly allowing for loading of the wakefields. Short length and high current lead to a small final energy spread. Co-linear injection preserves the incoming bunch quality and insures trapping and acceleration of the whole bunch. The energy of the LWFA electron bunch can easily exceed the trapping energy and can be produced over only a few millimeters gas-jet plasma driven by a laser of relatively modest power by today’s standards. We explore the parameter space suitable for this injection scheme that is more compact",
        "simpler to implement and more suitable for injection in the mm-size accelerator structure."

Rising density gradient leads to spatially contiguous coupled up-chirped plasmons (d{ω2pe(x)}/{dx}>0). Therefore phase mixing between plasmons can lead to trapping until the plasmon field is high enough such that e- trajectories returning towards a longer wavelength see a trapping potential. Rising plasma density gradients are ubiquitous for confining the plasma within sources at the vacuum-plasma interfaces. Therefore trapping of plasma-e- in a rising ramp is important for acceleration diagnostics and to understand the energy dissipation from the excited plasmon train [1]. Down-ramp in density [2][3] has been used for plasma-e- trapping within the first bucket behind the driver. Here",

In previous works we investigated the case of a single boundary in a waveguide*. Now we study the electromagnetic field of the bunch moving in a dielectric circular waveguide and crossing a vacuum cavity. The main attention is given to the case when wakefield (Cherenkov radiation) is generated in dielectric. The behavior of the total field depending on distance and time is explored numerically. Analytical estimations are made as well. Influence of the vacuum gap on the wakefield is considered for different lengths of the gap. It is clarified conditions when the vacuum gap does not practically influence on the wakefield. It is noted that the quasi monochromatic wave (the Cherenkov transition radiation) generated in the vacuum region can be used for restoration of the field in the area after the gap. This effect can be achieved for some optimal parameters of the problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

This can be achieved by external injection of beams into a plasma accelerator. SINBAD is a proposed dedicated accelerator research and development facility at DESY where amongst other topics laser-driven wakefield acceleration with external injection of ultra-short bunches will be exploited. To minimise energy-spread growth the bunch should occupy a small fraction of the plasma wavelength. In addition it has to be longitudinally synchronised with the laser driver to high accuracy. To avoid emittance growth the beam Twiss parameters have to be matched to the intrinsic beta-function of the plasma. To facilitate matching and synchronisation",

        "The AWAKE experiment recently approved at CERN will use the self-modulation instability (SMI) of long (12 cm)",
        "relativistic (400 GeV/c) proton bunches in dense plasmas to drive wakefields with accelerating gradients at the GV/m level. These accelerating gradients will be probed by externally injected electrons. In order to preserve the plasma uniformity required for the SMI the first experiments will use on-axis injection of a low energy 10-20 MeV electron beam collinearly with the proton beam. In this article we describe the physics of electron injection into the proton driven SMI wakefields. Requirements on the injected electron beam are determined and the final accelerated beam parameters are obtained via numerical simulations."

        "The AWAKE experiment is to be constructed at the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso facility (CNGS). This will be the first experiment to demonstrate electron acceleration by use of a proton driven plasma wakefield. The 400 GeV proton beam from the CERN SPS will excite a wakefield in a plasma cell several metres in length. To observe the plasma wakefield",
        "electrons of a few MeV will be injected into the wakefield following the head of the proton beam. Simulations indicate that electrons will be accelerated to GeV energies by the plasma wakefield. The AWAKE spectrometer is intended to measure both the peak energy and energy spread of these accelerated electrons. The baseline design makes use of a single dipole magnet to separate the electrons from the proton beam. The dispersed electron beam then impacts on a scintillator screen: the resulting scintillation light is collected and recorded by an intensified CCD camera. The design of the spectrometer is detailed with a focus on the scintillator screen. Results of simulations to optimise the scintillator are presented",
        "including studies of the standard GadOx scintillators commonly used for imaging electrons in plasma wakefield experiments."

        "eRHIC is a future electron-hadron collider proposed at BNL. It will collide high-intensity hadron beams from one of the existing rings of RHIC with a 50-mA electron beam from a multi-pass 10-GeV superconducting RF (SRF) Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). A novel approach to the multi-pass ERL utilizing a non-scaling FFAG was recently proposed. It has many advantages over the previous designs including significant cost savings. The current design has 11 passes in two FFAG rings. To mitigate various beam dynamics effects",
        "it was proposed to lower RF frequency of the SRF linac from 704 MHz used in the previous design. In this paper we consider different effects driving the frequency choice of the SRF ERL and present our arguments for choosing lower RF frequency."
