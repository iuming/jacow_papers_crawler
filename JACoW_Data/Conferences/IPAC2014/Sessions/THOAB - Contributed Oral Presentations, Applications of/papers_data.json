        "The first clinical trial with a carbon-ion beam generated from HIMAC was conducted in June 1994. Based on more than ten years of experience with HIMAC",
        "a pilot facility of a standard carbon-ion radiotherapy facility in Japan",
        "was constructed at Gunma University. Owing to the successfully operation of the pilot facility",
        "Saga-HIMAT and i-ROCK in Kanagawa have been progressed. In addition",
        "NIRS has developed the new treatment research project for the further development of radiotherapy with",
        "based on the pencil-beam 3D scanning for both the static and moving targets. This treatment procedure has been successfully carried out with a pencil-beam 3D scanning since May 2011. Owing to the development of NIRS 3D scanning",
        "the i-ROCK project decided to employ the NIRS 3D scanning. As a future plan",
        "further",
        "NIRS has developed a superconducting rotating gantry",
        "and we are going to just start a study of a superconducting accelerator for the ion radiotherapy. The recent progress and the future plan of HIMAC for the heavy-ion cancer radiotherapy will be reported."

        "Recent and ongoing shortages in reactor-based supplies of Molybdenum-99 for hospital production of the important medical radioisotope Technetium-99m have prompted the re-examination of the alternative production methods using conventional and laser-based particle accelerators. At present the UK has no domestic Technetium-99m production and relies exclusively on Technetium-99m generators manufactured overseas; the National Health Service",
        "with professional partners",
        "is therefore examining the options for domestic production to increase security of supply. In this paper we review the accelerator-based methods from a UK perspective",
        "and outline the most promising methods for short- and medium-term supply",
        "which include low-energy cyclotron and photonuclear reaction routes using enriched Molybdenum-100 targets."

        "We present a scheme that uses a high energy electron beam as a probe for time resolved (~ pico – nano seconds) imaging measurements of high energy density processes in materials with spatial resolution of < 1 μm. The device uses an electron bunch train with a flexible time structure penetrating a time varying high density target. By imaging the scattered electron beam",
        "the detailed target profile and its density evolution can be accurately determined. In this paper",
        "we discuss the viability of the concept and show that for densities in the range up to 400 gram/cm3",
        "an electron beam consisting of a train of ~800 MeV bunchlets",
        "each a few ps long and with charges ~nC is suitable. Successful demonstration of this concept will have a major impact for both future fusion science and HEDP physics research."
