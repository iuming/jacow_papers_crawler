      "abstract": "A low energy beam line (1.4 MeV/u) behind the GSI High Charge State Injecor will provide cw-heavy ion beams with high beam intensity. It is foreseen to build a new cw-heavy ion-linac for post acceleration up to 7.3 MeV/u. In preparation an advanced R&D program is defined: The first linac section (financed by HIM and partly by HGF-ARD-initiative) comprising a sc CH-cavity embedded by two sc solenoids will be tested in 2014/15 as a demonstrator. After successful testing the construction of an advanced cryomodule comprising four rf cavities is foreseen. As an intermediate step towards an entire cw-linac the use of a double of two CH-cavities is planned: Ashort 5 cell cavity should be mounted directly behind the demonstrator cavity inside a short cryostat. The design of the cw linac based on shorter sc CH-cavities would minimize the overall technical risk and costs. Besides with this cavity an optimized operation of the whole linac especially with respect to beam quality could be achieved. Last but not least the concept of continuous energy variation applying phase variation between the two cavities with constant beta profile could be tested. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

      "abstract": "The performance of an RFQ in case of its beam quality and transmission is in the basis dependent on the conformity of the field distribution of the manufactured structure with the one of its particle dynamic design. In the last years studies have been performed on the influence of various elements of the 4-rod RFQ on its field distribution. In particular the tuning process of the 4-rod RFQ with its tuning plates has been optimized. These studies have been complemented with detailed simulations on the fringe fields at the end of the electrodes and the conformity of the fields along the structure as well as the influence of other tuning elements like the piston tuner. Based on the findings of this research a proposal for a field optimized 4-rod RFQ model has been developed and will be presented in this paper. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

      "abstract": "The two Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) sections of the accelerator-driven neutron source FRANZ* consist of four solenoids. The first section with two solenoids will match the 120 keV proton beam into a chopper system**. Downstream from the chopper system a second section with two more solenoids will match the beam into the acceptance of the following RFQ. The accelerator will be operated using either a 2 mA dc beam or a pulsed beam with intensities from 50 mA to 200 mA at 250 kHz repetition rate. The high intensity of these ion beams requires the consideration of space-charge effects. Particle simulations with varying parameter sets have been performed in order to determine the settings providing best transmission and beam quality. Loss profiles along the transport channel were computed to identify hotspots. Simulation results for best transmission at lowest emittance growth will be presented.",

The lifetime problem of carbon-foil strippers due to the high energy loss of beams was a principal bottleneck for the intensity upgrade. We have already developed and successfully operated a re-circulating He-gas stripper for 10-MeV/u uranium beams as an alternative to carbon foils. Recently",
        "the 2nd gas stripper with air dedicated for 50-MeV/u 124Xe beams was developed. The differential pumping techniques similar to that used in the He gas stripper was applied. We confined a very thick gas target",
        "up to 20~mg/cm2 of air",
        "in a 0.5-m target chamber. One good feature of using air is that it can be inexhaustible for our use. The stripper was stably operated in user runs performed in June 2013. The service rate reached 91\\%. The maximum beam intensity reached 38~pnA and the average intensity provided to users becomes approximately four times higher than it was in 2012. The down-time free gas strippers greatly contributed to these improvements. We also discuss the applicability of the air stripper to 50-MeV/u 238U beams."

Among available direct THz detectors only superconducting microbolometers and Schottky diodes are capable to resolve single CSR pulses. Here we present recent photoresponse measurements of CSR with a quasioptical zero-bias Schottky diode detector which was produced at ACST GmbH. The rise-time of the recorded real-time transient was limited to approximately 20 ps by the 18-GHz bandwidth of interconnecting cables. Non-saturated responsivity of the detector",
        "that is the amplitude of the voltage transient referred to the total CSR pulse energy in the detector quasioptical mode",
        "was approximately 1.5 mV/fJ. The dynamic range of the detector spans almost three orders of magnitude from 3 fJ to 1 pJ. The intrinsic jitter of the detector was less than 2 ps thus not affecting the effective time resolution and allowing us to measure the arrival-time jitter of CSR pulses for different settings of the storage ring parameters."

      "abstract": "We have developed an accurate and efficient analysis method with a multi-conductor transmission line model for beam position monitors (BPMs). This method combines the two-dimensional electrostatic analysis including beams in the transverse plane and the transmission line analysis in the longitudinal direction. The loads are also included in the boundary condition of the transmission line analysis. Calculation of 2D electrostatic fields can be easily performed with the boundary element method. The BPM response to a beam is compared with that to a stretched wire. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

In the cited work the properties of different types of radiation, such as diffraction and Cherenkov radiation in the visible region, induced in fibers by relativistic electron were considered. In our report we present the results of experimental investigation of such a phenomenon for millimeter wavelength radiation. The origin and properties of radiation in fibers were investigated for different geometries of fiber position in respect to the electron beam. The spectral characteristics and dependence on the orientation angle of fibers relative to the electron beam were investigated. One of the useful properties of fibers is the fiber flexibility. The characteristics of radiation accepted by flexible fiber with diameter D=11 mm and length L=600 mm were investigated as a function of curvature radius of the fiber R. The experimental results show the allowable transport factor of radiation for the condition L>R>>D. We believe that fibers for mm and submm range can be used for beam diagnostics also. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

This model is used to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the propagation of the accelerated beam and the losses in the MARS code system. Preliminary simulations utilizing the uniform beam loss distribution were done. More detailed simulations based on the various different loss patterns focused around hot spots in magnets were also performed and their results compared. This confirmed the limit of 0.5 W/m average heat load on accelerating cavities foreseen by the cooling requirements. Additional studies investigated the dose absorbed by fragile cooling system’s elements during the normal operation of the facility defining their radiation resistance to the levels of few kGy/y. Further simulations will also give the information about the expected beam loss detectors signal at possible locations. These data will be further analysed using custom algorithms."

        "The Swiss Light Source (SLS) campaign on vertical emittance minimization and measurement required a beam size monitor with the ability to verify a sub-pmrad vertical emittance. This corresponds to a beam height of less than 4 μm. Within the TIARA Work Package ‘SLS Vertical Emittance Tuning’ a new beam size monitor was designed and built. The monitor is based on the imaging of the pi-polarized synchrotron radiation (SR) in the visible and UV spectral ranges. Besides imaging the monitor provides interferometric methods using vertically or horizontally polarized SR. With these complementary methods the consistency of beam size measurements is verified. An intermediate configuration of the monitor beamline using a lens as the focusing element has been commissioned in 2013. With this setup a vertical beam size of 4.8±0.5 μm",
        "corresponding to a vertical emittance of 1.7±0.4 pmrad has been measured. During 2014 the monitor was commissioned in its final configuration with a toroidal mirror. The use of reflective optics allows wider bandwidth imaging and thus higher intensity. We report on challenges during commissioning and present first images of SR taken with the toroidal mirror."

To achieve this task expensive and rather complicated setups (like transverse deflecting cavities) are usually implemented. The MAX IV 3 GeV linac will be used to inject into two rings and to drive a short pulse facility. Nevertheless",
        "a more deep understanding of the beam quality would be useful especially in view of an upgrade as FEL driver. Another interesting aspect is to evaluate how the double-achromat bunch compressors are performing. We are studying how to implement off-phase acceleration: last part of the linac will be set at zero-crossing phase and the transfer line to the 3 GeV ring could be used as energy spectrometer to retrieve the bunch profile. In the present configuration of the MAX IV linac this procedure will allow to check the bunch length after the first bunch compressor. Since it is work in progress",
        "in this contribution we present a sketch of the measurement and the feasibility of the method will be explored by means of simulations."

At such high power beam machine a non-invasive diagnostics is required. To measure the emittance of the ion beam a laserwire scanner is being developed. A high power laser will scan across the H− ion beam. The H− particles will be neutralized via a photo-detachment process producing a stream of fast neutral hydrogen atoms bearing information about the phase space distribution of the initial H− beam. To design an effective detection system and optimize its parameters a simulation of the processes at the interaction point is required. We present recent simulation results of theц FETS laserwire system. Simulations were performed using measured data of the laser propagation and ion beam distribution",

Resolution must be sufficient to allow single-turn measurements of vertical beam sizes of order 10um by imaging synchrotron radiation photons onto a one-dimensional photodiode array. Measurements with beam energies above 2.1GeV and current above 0.1mA can be performed with a single-slit (pinhole) optic. At lower energy or current",
        "small beam size measurements are limited by the diffractive width of a pinhole image and counting statistics. A coded aperture is a multi-slit mask that can improve on the resolution of a pinhole in two ways: higher average transparency improves counting statistics; and the slit pattern and masking transparency can be designed to obtain a diffractive image with narrower features. We have previously implemented coded apertures that are uniform redundant arrays (URA). A new coded aperture design is optimized for imaging with 1.8 GeV beam energy (1.9keV average x-ray energy) and with beam sizes below 20um. Resolution measurements were made in December 2013. Performance of the new coded aperture is compared to the pinhole and the URA."
