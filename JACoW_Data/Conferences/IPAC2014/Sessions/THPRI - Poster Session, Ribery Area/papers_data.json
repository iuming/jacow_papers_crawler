      "abstract": "Current designs for muon cooling channels require high-gradient RF cavities to be placed in solenoidal magnetic fields in order to contain muons with large transverse emittances. It has been found that doing so reduces the threshold at which RF cavity breakdown occurs. To aid the effort to study RF cavity breakdown in magnetic fields it would be helpful to have a diagnostic tool which can detect breakdown and localize the source of the breakdown inside the cavity. We report here on the experiment setup for localizing sparks in an RF cavity by using piezoelectric transducers and on preparation for data collection on a 201.25 MHz vacuum cavity. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "a 1.3-GHz buncher cavity is used to compress the electron bunches which are produced at a 500-kV photocathode DC electron gun. An rf voltage required is about 130 kV. To elongate the lifetime of the photocathode of the DC gun which is located beside the buncher cavity",
        "an extremely-low pressure of about 10-9 Pa is required in the buncher cavity under operating conditions. In order to achieve such low pressures",
        "we have developed a normal-conducting cavity which included several measures to reduce the outgas from the cavity components",
        "together with careful rf designs to avoid any problems due to multipactor discharges or to other problems. With the developed cavity",
        "we achieved a vacuum pressure of about 2·10-9 Pa under rf operations at an rf voltage of about 100 kV. The buncher cavity was installed in the cERL",
        "and it worked very well; we could demonstrate to compress the bunch length from 10 ps (FWHM) to 0.5 ps (rms) using the buncher cavity."

        "increase of the cavity voltage and increase in the repetition rate. The modification of the present traditional parallel biased ferrite cavities is rather challenging. An alternative to rebuilding the present Fermilab Booster RF cavities is to design and construct new perpendicular biased RF cavities",

An evaluation and a preliminary design of the perpendicular biased ferrite tuned cavities for the Fermilab Booster upgrade is described in the paper. Also it is desirable for better Booster performance to improve the capture of beam in the Booster during injection and at the start of the ramp. One possible way to do that is to flatten the bucket by introducing second harmonic cavities into the Booster. This paper also looks into the option of using perpendicularly biased ferrite tuners for the second harmonic cavities."

      "abstract": "A transverse electron target already constructed is under investigation for the application in storage rings at the FAIR facility. Using a sheet beam of free electrons in a crossed beam geometry promises a high energy resolution and gives access to the interaction region for spectroscopy. The produced electron beam has a length of 10 cm in ion beam direction and a width of 5 mm in the interaction region with electron densities of up to 109 electrons/cm3. The target allows the adjustment of the electron beam current and energy in the region of several 10 eV and a few keV. Simulations have been performed regarding the energy resolution for electron-ion collisions. Also the ion optical behaviour of the target was investigated numerically. The target is integrated in a test bench to study the performance of the electron gun and the electron beam optics. The installed volume ion source delivers light ions and molecules for characterization of the target performance by measuring charge changing processes. Subsequently the target will be installed temporarily at the Frankfurt Low-Energy Storage Ring (FLSR) for further test measurements. An overview of the project status will be presented. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Each of these components has to be thoroughly commissioned following interventions and machine shutdown periods to assure their protection function in case of powering failures. As well as a dependable tracking of test executions it is vital that the executed commissioning steps and applied analysis criteria adequately represent the operational state of each component. The Accelerator Testing (AccTesting) framework in combination with a domain specific analysis language provides the means to quantify and improve the quality of analysis for future campaigns. Dedicated tools were developed to analyse in detail the reasons for failures and success of commissioning steps in past campaigns and to compare the results with newly developed quality metrics. Observed shortcomings and discrepancies are used to propose additional verification and mitigation for future campaigns in an effort to improve the testing quality and hence assure the overall dependability of subsequent operational periods. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Within the network EnEfficient we address topics around energy efficiency of research accelerators. The ambitious scientific research goals of modern accelerator facilities lead to high requirements in beam power and beam quality for those research accelerators. In conjunction with the user’s needs the power consumption and environmental impact of the research facilities becomes a major factor in the perception of both funding agencies and the general public. In this Network we combine and focus the R&D done individually at different research centers into a series of workshops. We cover the topics “Energy recovery from cooling circuits “, “Higher electronic efficiency RF power generation“, “Short term energy storage systems”, “Virtual power plants” and “Beam transfer channels with low power consumption”. Our network activities are naturally open to external participants. With this work we will introduce our energy efficiency topics to interested participants and contributors from the whole community. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The accelerating cavities are operated in a liquid helium bath at 2 K. To achieve this temperature the cryostat has to be pumped down to a pressure of 35 mbar which was done by a system of pumping units connected in series",
        "when the accelerator started its operation in 1991. In 2005 this system was replaced by four parallel switched pumping stations. In the first three years of their operation",
        "the reliability of the accelerator was very poor due to repeated breakdowns of the pumping stations caused by overheating. In addition the high temperatures lead to an early decay of the gaskets used. The problem was solved by installing oil cooling systems and more appropriate shaft sleeves at the pumping stations. We will report on the technical efforts we made and thereby further increased the availability of the accelerator significantly. Also we will give a review on our experiences in maintenance procedures."

The method is based on measuring the three components of the magnetic field on a cylindrical surface parallel to the longitudinal axis of the magnet. Such a measurement is accomplished by carrying out a series of on-the-fly scans for a series of straight lines whose transversal coordinates lay on a circle. The Fourier decomposition of the magnetic field along a circle at a given longitudinal position yields the harmonic terms of the field at a reference radius equal to the circle’s radius. As a result the method provides the longitudinal dependence of the harmonic terms",
        "and in particular it allows analyzing their behavior in the fringe field region. We present an example of the application of this method to the measurement of a quadrupole of the Storage Ring of ALBA. A comparison with the integrated results provided by a rotating coil bench is also shown."

Alfred University and Cornell University have recently partnered in developing a dedicated absorber ceramic material that tries to overcome these limitations. We will report on results from small samples of different compositions we produced based on SiC",

        "An in-situ technique for coating stainless steel vacuum tubes with Cu was developed to mitigate the problems of wall resistivity that leads to unacceptable ohmic heating of superconducting magnets cold bore and electron cloud generation in RHIC that can limit future machine luminosity enhancement. Room temperature RF resistivity of 10 μm Cu coated stainless steel RHIC beam tube has conductivity close to copper tubing. Before coating the RHIC beam pipe with copper",
        "it is imperative to test the Cu coating’s conductivity at cryogenic. A folded quarter wave resonator structure has been designed and built for insertion in a cryogenic system to measure RF resistivity of copper coated RHIC tubing at liquid helium temperatures. The design is based on making the resonator structure out of a superconducting material such that the copper coating is the most lossy material. RHIC tubing samples prepared with different magnetron sputtering deposition modes are to be optimized by iterative processes. Additionally",
        "this device can also be used for the development of better",
        "cheaper SRF cavities and electron guns. The apparatus and its design details will be presented."
