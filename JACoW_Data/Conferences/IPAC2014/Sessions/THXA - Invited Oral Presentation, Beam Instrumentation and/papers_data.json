        "Beam Position Monitors (BPM) are an essential tool for the operation of an accelerator. Therefore BPM systems have to be already included from the beginning in the design of a new machine. This contribution describes the development of a new BPM system up to the operation with a focus on the mechanical design. It includes the collection of the requirements and boundary conditions which defines the kind of BPM system. Following the mechanical designing process is described where simulations are used to predict the signals. These results are input parameters for the design and optimization of the electronics. Several contributions are considered which can modify the BPM signal like feedhroughs",
        "heating due to wake losses",
        "holders",
        "cables and so on. The steps from the design",
        "the prototypes and series production including laboratory and test accelerator measurements up to the commissioning are described as well."
