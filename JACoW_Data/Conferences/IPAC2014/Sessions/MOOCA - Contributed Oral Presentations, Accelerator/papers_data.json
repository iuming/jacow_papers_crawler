        "The energy upgrade of the SPARC photo-injector at LNF-INFN (Italy) from 150 to more than 240 MeV will be done by replacing a low gradient S-Band accelerating structure with two C-band structures. The structures are Traveling Wave (TW) and Constant Impedance (CI)",
        "have symmetric axial input couplers and have been optimized to work with a SLED RF input pulse. In the paper we present the results of the low and high power RF tests on the two final fabricated structures that shown the feasibility of the operation at accelerating gradients larger than 35 MV/m."

        "strong magnetic fields have been shown in some cases to limit the maximum achievable gradient in RF cavities. This gradient limit is characterized by RF breakdown and damage to the cavity surface. To study this issue",
        "we have developed an experimental program at Fermilab's MuCool Test Area (MTA) based on a modular pillbox cavity operating at 805 MHz. The modular cavity design allows for the evaluation of different cavity geometries and materials – such as beryllium – which may ameliorate or circumvent RF breakdown triggers. We present a summary of recent results and plans for the future of the MTA normal conducting RF cavity program."
