        "This paper describes the current situation concerning industrial accelerators for medical hadron therapy facilities. Starting from high level requirements and considerations for a therapy facility more specific requirements for the accelerator will be deduced. The Varian ProBeam cyclotron is shown as an example of a medical accelerator and a statistical overview on other accelerators in us is given. The focus is strictly on industrially available equipment. As hadron facilities are extremely complex systems",
        "in the confined space of this paper some simplifications are unavoidable."

        "typically used for hand baggage or mail screening. There is a smaller but high value niche market servicing the requirements for border security",
        "and cargo and vehicle inspection (CVI). This latter application requires higher X-ray energies of up to 10 MeV using an electron linear accelerator (linac) source to penetrate fully loaded shipping containers. Increasingly",
        "methods are required to improve throughput and provide a higher level of material discrimination during inspection. This paper will briefly review the elements required to make an effective X-ray source",
        "whilst outlining the RF technology required to drive a linac-based X-ray security system. Following this",
        "potential new developments in radiofrequency (RF) sub-systems will be discussed in the context of user benefits."
