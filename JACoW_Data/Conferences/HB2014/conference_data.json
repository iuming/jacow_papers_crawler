The Proton Improvement Plan II intensity upgrades require a reduction in slip-stacking losses by approximately a factor of 2. We study the single-particle dynamics that determine the stability of slip-stacking particles. We introduce universal area factors to calculate the available phase space area for any set of beam parameters without individual simulation. We show the particle loss as a function of time. We calculate the injection efficiency as a function of longitudinal emittance and aspect-ratio. We demonstrate that the losses from RF single particle dynamics can be reduced by a factor of 4-10 (depending on beam parameters) by upgrading the Fermilab Booster from a 15-Hz cycle-rate to a 20-Hz cycle-rate. We recommend a change in injection scheme to eliminate the need for a greater momentum aperture in the Fermilab Recycler.",

The effort is motivated by the plans to increase currents in the Super Proton Synchrotron as part of the HL-LHC upgrade where feedback methods could control instabilities and allow greater freedom in machine lattice parameters. Identification algorithms use subspace methods to compute a discrete multi-input multi-output (MIMO) representation of the nonlinear dynamics. We use macro particle simulation data (CMAD and HEADTAIL) and SPS machine measurements as the source of dynamics information for the identification of beam dynamics. Reduced models capture the essential dynamics of the beam motion or instability at a particular operating point",

            "Non-axisymmetric RF cavities, such as quarter-wave resonators (QWRs), can produce axially asymmetric multipole field components that can influence beam dynamics. For example, dipole components can cause beam steering, an effect that has been well known to the community since 2001. However, higher order multipole field components, such as quadrupole components, which have potential influence on beam dynamics, have never received enough attention yet. In this paper, we choose FRIB QWRs as an example and quadrupole components are extracted by multipole expansion. Then, influence of quadrupole components on a single cavity is studied using thin lens model. After that, the influence of quadrupole components on a whole FRIB linac segment one is studied, and effects such as transverse profile ovalization and blow up of beam size are witnessed. Lastly, a possible way of quadrupole components compensation for FRIB driving linac is discussed."

Following the recent upgrade of the longitudinal beam control system in the PS Booster (PSB)",
            "tests with Finemet cavities are being performed in view of a complete replacement of the existing RF systems in the PSB by ones based on this technology. In the PS a similar wide-band Finemet cavity has been installed as a longitudinal damper. New 1-turn delay feedbacks on the main accelerating cavities to reduce their impedance have also been commissioned. Additional feedback and beam control improvements are foreseen. A major upgrade of the main RF system in the SPS by regrouping sections of its travelling wave cavities",

          "abstract": "Thanks to sustained advances in hardware and software technologies, computer modeling is playing an increasingly important role in the design of particle accelerators. This rise in importance is further fueled by the economic pressure for reducing uncertainties and costs of development, construction and commissioning, thus pushing the field toward an increased use of “virtual prototyping”. Until now, the development of accelerator codes has been left to projects without mandate and programmatic funding for coordination, distribution and user support. While this is adequate for the development of relatively small-scale codes on targeted applications, a more coordinated approach is needed to enable general codes with user bases that extend beyond individual projects, as well as cross-cutting activities. In light of this, it is desirable to strengthen and coordinate programmatic activities of particle accelerator modeling within the accelerator community. This increased focus on computational activities is all the more timely as computer architectures are transitioning to new technologies that require the adaptation of existing - and emergence of new - algorithms and codes.

Besides the obvious remedies of increasing the injection energy we are obliged to better understand the space charge force to optimize our machines. To this end it has become clear that we need computer models that faithfully represent the linear but also the non-linear features of our machines.

The existing theory of stability diagrams for Landau damping is applied to the case of an RFQ. As an example",

            "Longitudinal instability in the CERN SPS is a serious limitation for the future increase of bunch intensity required by HiLumi LHC project. The impedance driving this instability is not known precisely and a lot of effort goes into creating an accurate impedance model. The reactive impedance of the machine can be probed by measuring the bunch length oscillations of a mismatched bunch at injection. The frequency of these oscillations as a function of intensity has a slope that depends on the reactive impedance and the emittance. Measurements were done for three values of longitudinal emittances and then compared with particle simulations based on the impedance model using particle distribution close to the measured one. Comparison of measured and calculated frequency shifts gives an estimation of the missing impedance in the model. In addition",
            "scanning of initial emittance for diverse particle distributions in simulations shows that the frequency shift greatly depends on emittance and initial distribution.

This paper describes the feasibility of electron cloud as the mechanism for this instability and presents the first measurements of the electron cloud in the Fermilab Recycler. Direct measurements of the electron cloud are made using a retarding field analyzer (RFA) newly installed in the Fermilab Recycler. Indirect measurements of the electron cloud are made by propagating a microwave carrier signal through the beampipe and analyzing the phase modulation of the signal. The maximum betatron amplitude growth and the maximum electron cloud signal occur during minimums of the bunch length oscillation.",

            "Longitudinal instability in the CERN SPS is a serious limitation for the future increase of bunch intensity required by HiLumi LHC project. The impedance driving this instability is not known precisely and a lot of effort goes into creating an accurate impedance model. The reactive impedance of the machine can be probed by measuring the bunch length oscillations of a mismatched bunch at injection. The frequency of these oscillations as a function of intensity has a slope that depends on the reactive impedance and the emittance. Measurements were done for three values of longitudinal emittances and then compared with particle simulations based on the impedance model using particle distribution close to the measured one. Comparison of measured and calculated frequency shifts gives an estimation of the missing impedance in the model. In addition",
            "scanning of initial emittance for diverse particle distributions in simulations shows that the frequency shift greatly depends on emittance and initial distribution. Small variations of these parameters can lead to very different results and explain partially the discrepancy between measured and calculated values of frequency shifts.",

We introduce universal area factors to calculate the available phase space area for any set of beam parameters without individual simulation. We show the particle loss as a function of time. We calculate the injection efficiency as a function of longitudinal emittance and aspect-ratio. We demonstrate that the losses from RF single particle dynamics can be reduced by a factor of 4-10 (depending on beam parameters) by upgrading the Fermilab Booster from a 15-Hz cycle-rate to a 20-Hz cycle-rate.

        "in Gabor lenses space-charge effects can be studied in detail. The influence of the electron distribution on emittance and space-charge dominated ion beams was investigated in beam transport experiments*. In this contribution we want to emphasize one result of these experiments. The measurements indicated a strong contribution of secondary electrons on beam dynamics. Secondary electrons are produced within the transport channel",

This might lead to an increase of the filling degree and to an improved focusing performance of the lens. Assuming that the loss and production rates within the lens volume and the transport channel determine the equilibrium state of the nonneutral plasma column",

These models are useful in beam monitoring and in the design of feedback controllers to stabilize intra-bunch transverse instabilities. The effort is motivated by the plans to increase currents in the Super Proton Synchrotron as part of the HL-LHC upgrade where feedback methods could control instabilities and allow greater freedom in machine lattice parameters. Identification algorithms use subspace methods to compute a discrete multi-input multi-output (MIMO) representation of the nonlinear dynamics. We use macro particle simulation data (CMAD and HEADTAIL) and SPS machine measurements as the source of dynamics information for the identification of beam dynamics. Reduced models capture the essential dynamics of the beam motion or instability at a particular operating point",

For example, dipole components can cause beam steering, an effect that has been well known to the community since 2001. However, higher order multipole field components, such as quadrupole components, which have potential influence on beam dynamics, have never received enough attention yet. In this paper, we choose FRIB QWRs as an example and quadrupole components are extracted by multipole expansion. Then, influence of quadrupole components on a single cavity is studied using thin lens model. After that, the influence of quadrupole components on a whole FRIB linac segment one is studied, and effects such as transverse profile ovalization and blow up of beam size are witnessed. Lastly, a possible way of quadrupole components compensation for FRIB driving linac is discussed."

This novel experiment is based on an isomorphism between the basic equations governing the collective motion of a non-neutral plasma in a trap and that of a charged-particle beam in an alternating-gradient (AG) focusing channel. The system is particularly useful in exploring space-charge-induced collective phenomena whose accurate study is often troublesome in practice or quite time-consuming even with high-performance computers. The present talk addresses recent experimental results on the stability of intense hadron beams traveling through long periodic AG transport channels.

      "abstract": "Thanks to sustained advances in hardware and software technologies, computer modeling is playing an increasingly important role in the design of particle accelerators. This rise in importance is further fueled by the economic pressure for reducing uncertainties and costs of development, construction and commissioning, thus pushing the field toward an increased use of “virtual prototyping”. Until now, the development of accelerator codes has been left to projects without mandate and programmatic funding for coordination, distribution and user support. While this is adequate for the development of relatively small-scale codes on targeted applications, a more coordinated approach is needed to enable general codes with user bases that extend beyond individual projects, as well as cross-cutting activities. In light of this, it is desirable to strengthen and coordinate programmatic activities of particle accelerator modeling within the accelerator community. This increased focus on computational activities is all the more timely as computer architectures are transitioning to new technologies that require the adaptation of existing - and emergence of new - algorithms and codes.

The goal is to operate these machines with basically twice the number of particles per bunch which will further increase the space charge tune shifts which are large already now in present operation. Besides the obvious remedies of increasing the injection energy we are obliged to better understand the space charge force to optimize our machines. To this end it has become clear that we need computer models that faithfully represent the linear but also the non-linear features of our machines. We have started close collaborations with several laboratories around the world to upgrade existing self-consistent Space Charge Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes for our CERN needs. In parallel",

        "Longitudinal instability in the CERN SPS is a serious limitation for the future increase of bunch intensity required by HiLumi LHC project. The impedance driving this instability is not known precisely and a lot of effort goes into creating an accurate impedance model. The reactive impedance of the machine can be probed by measuring the bunch length oscillations of a mismatched bunch at injection. The frequency of these oscillations as a function of intensity has a slope that depends on the reactive impedance and the emittance. Measurements were done for three values of longitudinal emittances and then compared with particle simulations based on the impedance model using particle distribution close to the measured one. Comparison of measured and calculated frequency shifts gives an estimation of the missing impedance in the model. In addition",
        "scanning of initial emittance for diverse particle distributions in simulations shows that the frequency shift greatly depends on emittance and initial distribution. Small variations of these parameters can lead to very different results and explain partially the discrepancy between measured and calculated values of frequency shifts.",
