        "At LNL INFN is under construction a Rare Isotope Facility (SPES)",
        "based on a 35-70 MeV proton cyclotron",
        "able to deliver two beams with a total current up to 0.5 mA",
        "an ISOL fission target station and the existing ALPI superconducting accelerator as post accelerator (up to 10 MeV/u for A/q=7). In this talk the elements between the production target and the experiments will be described: in particular the selection system",
        "the ECR charge breeder",
        "the second separation system and the new CW RFQ (80 MHz",
        "727 keV/u",
        "internal bunching). The problems that have been solved during the design phase are partly common to all RIB facilities",
        "like the necessity to have high selectivity and high transmission for a beam of very low intensity",
        "plus the specific challenges related to the use of ALPI (with a reduced longitudinal acceptance) and related to the specific lay out. At present the design phase is concluded",
        "and the procurement procedure for the charge breeder",
        "the transfer lines and the RFQ are advanced or will be launched in the next months. The main beam dynamics aspects of the transfer lines (including magnetic selections) and RFQ will be discussed in detail.",

        "RFQ",
        "superconducting cavities",
