        "The UNIversal Linear Accelerator (UNILAC) at GSI has served as injector for all ion species from protons for uranium for the past four decades. Especially its 108 MHz Alvarez type DTL providing acceleration from 1.4 MeV/u to 11.4 MeV/u has suffered from material fatigue. The DTL will be replaced by a completely new section with almost the same design parameters",
        "i.e. pulsed current of up to 15 mA of 238U28+ at 11.4 MeV/u. However",
        "operation will be restricted to low beam duty cycles as 200 μs at 10 Hz. Since preservation of beam quality is mandatory",
        "a regular focusing lattice",
        "as along an Alvarez section for instance",
        "is aimed for. A new source terminal & LEBT dedicated to operation with 238U4+ is under design. The uranium sources need to be upgraded in order to provide increased beam brilliances and for operation at 3 Hz. Revision of the subsequent 36 MHz RFQ electrode design has started as well as the layout activities of the section providing transition from the 36 MHz section to the 108 MHz DTL.",
