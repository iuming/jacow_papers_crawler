        "and repetition rate of 20 Hz has been delivered to the Beryllium target to produce the neutron beam from the year of 2013. We present in this paper the development and application of the high current linac",
        "together with the measurement of the proton and neutron beams. The beam energy of the CPHS linac will be enhanced to 13 MeV after the DTL is ready in 2015.",

Beam commissioning investigations showed an improvement of 15% – 20% in transmission efficiencies and an increase of up to 50% in maximum beam intensities. The details of the upgraded facility and the commissioning results will be presented."
