        "regular orbits with extremely large tune spreads. Off-momentum effects such as dispersion and chromaticity",

UMER offers 3 advantages for this type of research: (1) the ability to assess the effects of intermediate space charge strength relevant to conventional Hadron rings on the performance on nonlinear lattices; (2) its low-cost printed-circuit magnets (enabled by the 10 keV electron beam energy) can be easily replaced to test different lattice concepts; and (3) the detailed diagnostics already in place facilitate benchmarking of simulation codes in this new regime."
