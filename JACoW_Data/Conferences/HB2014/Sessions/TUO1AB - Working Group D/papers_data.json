        "Magnetic alloy cavities are successfully used for J-PARC synchrotrons. These cavities generate much higher RF voltage than ordinary ferrite-loaded cavities. The MR (Main Ring) upgrade project aims to deliver the beam power of 750 kW to the neutrino experiment. It includes replacements of all RF cavities for high repetition rate of about 1 Hz. By the replacements",
        "the total acceleration voltage will be doubled",
        "while power supplies and amplifiers remain the same. The key issue is the development of a high gradient RF system using high impedance magnetic alloy",
        "FT3L. A dedicated production system for the FT3L cores with 80 cm diameter was assembled in the J-PARC and demonstrated that we can produce material with two times higher muQf product compared to the cores used for present cavities. The first 5-cell FT3L cavity was assembled and the status of high power test is reported.",

Following the recent upgrade of the longitudinal beam control system in the PS Booster (PSB)",
        "tests with Finemet cavities are being performed in view of a complete replacement of the existing RF systems in the PSB by ones based on this technology. In the PS a similar wide-band Finemet cavity has been installed as a longitudinal damper. New 1-turn delay feedbacks on the main accelerating cavities to reduce their impedance have also been commissioned. Additional feedback and beam control improvements are foreseen. A major upgrade of the main RF system in the SPS by regrouping sections of its travelling wave cavities",
        "increasing the number of cavities from four to six",
