        "The coherent stability problem for proton and heavy ion beams is reviewed. For all but the highest energies space charge is the dominant coherent force. While space charge alone appears benign",
        "its interaction with other impedances is less clear. The main assumptions used in calculations and their justifications will be reviewed. Transverse beam transfer function data from RHIC will be used to compare theory and experiment and some pitfalls will be discussed.",

        "and relate the observations to the classical single-rf",
