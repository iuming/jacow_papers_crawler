        "based on Linnecar’s exponential coupler stripline type",
        "for a flatter and wider frequency response. The design and performance of the new BPM as well as preparation of a newly installed exciter and power amplifier is presented. We also report beam test results of suppression of horizontal intra-bunch oscillations at 3 GeV with the bunch length of 150-200 ns.",

        "The 3-GeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) of J-PARC is designed for a high-intensity output beam power of 1MW. The RCS is extracted two bunches by using eight pulsed kicker and three DC septum magnets with 25Hz repetition. The extracted beam is simultaneously delivered to the material and life science experimental facility (MLF) as well as the 50-GeV main ring synchrotron (MR). The kicker magnets have the ringing of flat-top field and the ringing causes the position displacement. The displacement is big issue because it causes an emittance growth of the extracted beam directly. In the beam tuning",
        "we performed a timing scan of each kicker magnet by using a shorter pulse beam in order to understand the characteristics of ringing field. We then carefully optimized the trigger timings of each kicker for the ringing compensation. We have successfully compensated the extracted beam displacements to (min.",

The extracted beam profile for the MR is measured to be sufficiently narrower than that for the MLF and is also shown to be consistent with ORBIT beam simulations.
