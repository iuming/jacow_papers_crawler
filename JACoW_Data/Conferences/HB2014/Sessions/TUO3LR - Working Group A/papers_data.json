        "high-intensity proton accumulator rings such as the Los Alamos Proton Storage Ring (PSR). Several beam loss mechanisms contribute including beam scattering (nuclear and large angle Coulomb scattering) in the injection foil",

        "halo growth from space charge effects",
        "beam instabilities and losses from the fast extraction process. This talk will cover progress in the diagnosis",
