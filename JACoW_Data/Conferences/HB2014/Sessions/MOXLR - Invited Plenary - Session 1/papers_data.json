        "by taking into account the expected intensity and brightness reach of the LHC and its injector chain and the capabilities of the detectors for the next run and foreseen upgrade scenarios."

        "in this summer shutdown of 2014",
        "the maximum peak current of the injection beam will be increased from 30 mA to the design value of 50 mA. In October 2014 after completing these series of linac upgrades",
        "we are to start the final stage of beam tuning toward the design output beam power of 1 MW. The most important issues in realizing such a high power 1 MW beam operation are control and minimization of beam loss. This talk will present 1 MW beam tuning results with particular emphasis on our approach to beam loss issues."

Achieving the extremely demanding beam intensities and beam powers of tomorrow’s frontier proton accelerators requires extending the state-of-the-art in accelerator technology and in our understanding of the fundamental physics of beams. The landscape of high intensity proton accelerators in the past",
