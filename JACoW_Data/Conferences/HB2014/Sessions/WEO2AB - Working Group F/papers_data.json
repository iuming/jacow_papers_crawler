        "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) requires a drive linac to produce ion species from protons to uranium which will extend the heavy ion high intensity frontier. The unique design of the twice-folded linac coupled with the functional dynamic range of beam intensities over more than 5 orders of magnitude present new challenges to beam detection and measurement",
        "instrumentation",
        "and machine protection systems. Additional challenges to longitudinal tuning and transverse orbit optimization of multi-charge state beams drive the design of measurement systems and techniques in the low energy linac and dispersive arc regions. Finally",
        "beam loss monitoring and detection systems must respond within 10 microseconds to prevent catastrophic damage to beamline components from high power",
        "heavy ion beams. We present an overview of beam diagnostic systems and detection networks that enable tuning of FRIB over the operating intensity range",
        "while ensuring adequate machine protection. Comparisons to other proposed and existing hadron facilities will be made.",
        "Beam Loss Mechanisms",
        "Measurements and Simulations at the LHC (Quench Tests)",
        "CERN",
        "Geneva",
        "Switzerland",
        "Monitoring and minimization of beam losses is increasingly important for high-intensity and superconducting machines. In the case of the LHC",
        "the collimation system is designed to absorb the energy of lost particles and confine the main multi-turn losses to regions without sensitive equipment. However many loss mechanisms produce local loss events which can be located elsewhere in the machine. A beam loss monitoring system",
        "covering the whole machine circumference is therefore essential",
        "and is used for both machine protection and diagnostics. In order to fully understand the measured signals and set-up the beam abort thresholds",
        "extensive simulation work is required",
        "covering particle tracking in the accelerator and the generation of the particle showers created by the lost particles. In order to benchmark these simulations and verify beam-abort thresholds",
        "special tests have been performed where beam losses are provoked in a controlled manner over a wide range of durations. This work summarizes the experience in understanding beam losses in the LHC during Run 1.",

        "a new ion source was installed to increase output power to 1 MW. In order to achieve reliable operation of 1 MW",
