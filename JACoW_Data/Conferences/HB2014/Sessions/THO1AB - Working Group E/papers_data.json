        "ATLAS is now the only US DOE National User Facility for low-energy heavy-ion stable beams. With the recent commissioning of the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU)",
        "ATLAS is now also used to accelerate radioactive beams. The demand for both stable and radioactive beam time is already exceeding two to three times the 5500 hours delivered by ATLAS every year. The time structure of the EBIS charge breeder to be installed next year for CARIBU beams is such that only 3% of the ATLAS duty cycle will be used for radioactive beams. Being a CW machine",
        "97% of the ATLAS cycle will be available for the injection and acceleration of stable beams without retuning. This simultaneous acceleration is possible for stable and radioactive beams with charge-to-mass ratios within 3%. We have developed a strategic plan to upgrade ATLAS for this purpose over the next few years",
        "where two to three beams could be delivered simultaneously to different experimental areas. The upgrade concept will be presented and discussed along with the recent studies and developments done in this direction.",

        "Charge strippers play a critical role in many high intensity heavy ion accelerators. The recent progress on accelerator technology makes its role so critical that traditional carbon foils easily reach the limit of application due to their short lifetime. In fact the major heavy ion accelerator facilities such as GSI",
        "MSU/ANL and RIKEN have made elaborating efforts to develop the alternatives to the carbon foils",
        "in order to realize acceleration of very heavy ions such as uranium with high intensity. For example liquid lithium stripper has been developed at MSU/ANL and helium gas stripper and rotating Be disk stripper have been developed at RIKEN RIBF. The two strippers for RIBF greatly contributed to increase of the uranium beam intensity. However we are sure that Be disk stripper used for the second stripper will reach the limit in near future due to its large deformation",
        "which require further developments for our intensity upgrade program.",
