        "To meet the increasing needs of modern heavy ion accelerators",
        "a ECR ion source must be developed to deliver high intensity high brightness high charge state ion beams",
        "in terms of accelerator output power and beam transmission efficiency. With the success in several laboratories on fully superconducting ECR ion source development",
        "the performance of highly charged heavy ion beams have been greatly enhanced. For instance",
        "U33+ intensity had been doubled in 2011 by VENUS source at LBNL. This paper will present the development work at IMP towards a high performance ECR ion source. Recent high intensity bismuth results will be given",
        "such as 710 eμA Bi30+ with SECRAL source. The first room temperature ECR ion source using evaporative cooling technique will also be reviewed. And the discussion of ECRIS extraction and transmission beam line on ion beam quality will also be presented in this paper.",

        "it is essential to take advantage of tune manipulations and the space charge damping effect. A reduction scheme of the kicker impedance is proposed to pursue the ultimate goal at the RCS.",
