This ion source is aiming to extract intense highly charged heavy ion beams in the order of emA from the dense plasma heated with 45 GHz microwave power. To provide effective magnetic confinement to the 45 GHz ECR plasma; a state of the art Nb3Sn magnet with min-B configuration is a straightforward technical path. As there is no much precedent references; it has to be designed; prototyped at IMP through in-house development. Meanwhile; other physics and technical challenges to a 4th generation ECR ion source are also tackled at IMP to find feasible solutions. This paper will give a brief review of the critical issues in the development of FECR ion source. A detailed report on the status of FECR prototype magnet development will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/mowzo01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/mowzo01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/mowzo01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-MOWZO01,1

The R&D performed by the INFN-LNS team during the 2019/2020 has allowed the improvement of the AISHa performances up to 20% for some of the extracted beams: both injection and extraction flanges has been improved and a movable electrode has been installed. The low energy beam transport has been equipped of an Emittance Measurement Unit (EMU); working through the beam wire scanners principle; for the measurement of the vertical and horizontal emittance of the beams of interest for hadrontherapy applications. Beam emittance has been characterized as a function of q/m and of the beam intensity to highlight space charge effects. If necessary; the beam wire scanners can be used for the characterization of the beam shape. The perspectives for further developments and plasma diagnostics will be also highlighted.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/mowzo03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/mowzo03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/mowzo03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-MOWZO03,10

The quasi-gasdynamic confinement regime; featuring high plasma density (up to 1014 cm-3) and moderate electron temperature (~100 eV); allowed to extract pulsed beams of H+ and D+ ions with current of 450 mA and RMS emittance <0.07 pi mm mrad*. It has been already demonstrated that major benefits of quasi-gasdynamic confinement; previously tested in pulsed mode; are scalable to the CW operational mode. In first experiments at GISMO facility; the ion beams were extracted in pulsed mode from the CW plasma of ECR discharge due to technical limitations of cooling circuits. Proton beams with current up to 70 mA were achieved at extraction voltage of 40 kV. A new unique extraction system especially effective for the formation of high current density ion beams was developed.,,"* V. Skalyga, I. Izotov, S. Razin, A. Sidorov, S. Golubev, T. Kalvas, H.

The required 5-20 MeV energies for heavy ion time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis* (ToF-ERDA) can be achieved with a high charge state ion source and RFQ accelerator. We present a conceptual design of a ToF-ERDA facility based on a permanent magnet ECRIS and variable frequency RFQ accelerating 1-10 pnA of 40Ar8+; 84Kr17+ and 129Xe24+ ions to 4-7; 10-15 and 13-20 MeV. We present the PM ECRIS requirements focusing on the CUBE-ECRIS** with a quadrupole min-B field topology. Beam dynamics studies demonstrating good transmission of the heavy ion beams from the ion source to the RFQ entrance through the electrostatic low energy beam transport (LEBT) and a permanent magnet dipole are presented. The predicted LEBT transmissions of the CUBE-ECRIS (rectangular extraction slit) and a conventional ECRIS (circular extraction aperture) are compared. The conceptual design of the RFQ is described and the implications of the energy spread on the high energy beam transport are discussed. It is demonstrated that an energy spread below 0.2 % is necessary for appropriate resolution of the heavy ion ToF-ERDA.; * J. Julin and T. Sajavaara; Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res.

In a 14 GHz ECRIS (Atomki; Debrecen); the effect on the plasma instabilities in an Argon plasma at Two Close Frequencies heating scheme (the frequency gap is smaller than 1 GHz) has been explored. A special multi-diagnostic setup [1; 2] has been designed and implemented consisting of detectors for the simultaneous collection of plasma radio-self-emission and of high spatial resolution X-ray images in the 500 eV - 20 keV energy domain (using an X-ray pin-hole camera setup). We present the comparison of plasma structural changes as observed from X-ray images in single and double-frequency operations.

Results coming by a new algorithm for analyzing Integrated (multi-events detection) and Photon-Counted images (single-event detection) to perform energy-resolved investigation will be described. The analysis permits to investigate High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) and spectrally resolved images; to study the effect of the axial and radial confinement (even separately); the plasma radius; the fluxes of deconfined electrons distinguishing fluorescence lines of the materials of the plasma chamber (Ti; Ta) from plasma (Ar) fluorescence lines.

In particular, quasi-periodic losses of electrons from confinement due to kinetic cyclotron instabilities hinder ion source performance. Empirical scaling laws help guide the development of sources away from the most unstable operating points but are poorly understood. Further advancement of ECR ion source technologies requires a deeper understanding of instabilities, scaling laws, and internal processes of the ion source plasma itself. We present here results of an experimental study into these instabilities and scaling laws, and measurements of hot electron diffusion (E > 10 keV) from the 18 GHz SUSI ECRIS at the NSCL. Measurements of the average argon current and the standard deviation of their variations across multiple unstable operating points are shown. These measurements are compared to measurements of electrons that diffuse axially from the plasma chamber. In doing so it will be shown how controlling the diffusion of electrons control the stability of the plasma and optimize the ion source’s performance. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/moyzo03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/moyzo03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/moyzo03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-MOYZO03,38

ECR discharge in a solenoidal magnetic field (i.e. with no magnetic mirrors for plasma confinement); sustained by a powerful radiation of modern gyrotrons is under consideration at IAP RAS as a possible alternative to widely used vacuum arc; RF and helicon discharges. The use of a high frequency radiation (37.5 GHz) allows to obtain a discharge at lower pressure; sustain almost fully ionized plasma with density more than 1013 cm-3; whereas the power on the level of several hundreds of kW allows one to create such a plasma in considerably large volume.

A high demand of metal ions comes from the nuclear physics; material re-search; and Super Heavy Element group (SHE); and the most requested element; besides 50Ti; is 48Ca. When this chemical reactive material is deposited inside the plasma chamber at internal components the stability can be com-promised. Furthermore; it is difficult to find a working point to guarantee a long-term stability as the oven re-sponse time and the reaction of the ECRIS are relatively slow. The monitoring by using an Optical Emission Spectrometer (OES) facilitates immediate reactions when-ever plasma instabilities occur. For this reason; a real-time diagnostic system based on an OES has been in-stalled at the ECRIS at HLI for routine operation during the beam-time 2020. The measured spectra revealed a parasitic oven heating by coupled microwaves often com-promising the ion source performance. Therefore; a tung-sten grid has been installed to shield the oven orifice from the coupled microwaves.

Constant progress has been made in terms of intensity; stability and reliability. The intensity for some stable metallic beams now exceeds or approaches the pµA level at an energy up to 95 MeV/u: 1.14 pµA for 36S (65% enriched) at 77 MeV/u; 0.35 pµA for 58Ni (63%) at 74 MeV/u. The presentation highlights recent results obtained for 28Si; 184W and 130Te using the GANIL ‘s LCO (Large Capacity Oven) on the ECR4 ion source. To produce the tungsten beam; two injection methods were compared. For the first one; we evaporated some tungsten trioxide (WO3) with GANIL ‘s LCO. For the second one; the injection in the plasma chamber was made by using MIVOC (Metallic Ions from VOlatile compounds) with a tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)6) compound. It was the first time that we used metal carbonyl compounds and the result is promising. All the tests have been qualified to obtain the level of intensity and beam stability.

First requested beams are 58Ni; 48Ca; 50Cr; 50Ti or 50V with an intensity about 1; 2.1013 pps. The metallic ion beams will be produced by the Phoenix V3 ECR ion source combined with a resistive oven newly designed to cope with the beam specifications. The evaporation of low vapor pressure metallic elements (Ti; V…) requires temperature within a range of 1900°C to 2000°C. A new design of a resistive oven has been developed for this purpose. The oven reached 2000°C in a test vacuum chamber during 8 days. It has worked out in the Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source ECR4 at GANIL for Titanium beam production. Further tests using this ion source are under preparation for Ti and V beam production.

ECRIS bremsstrahlung measurements that are both time- and energy-resolved are often challenging to perform due to the 10’s; 100’s ms timescale that the plasma evolves over. However; the advancement of low-cost microcontrollers over the last decade makes timing and gating photon spectrometers easier. We present a proof of principle measurement which uses an Arduino microcontroller as a gate-and-delay generator for a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector.

Recently; we have focused on waves propagations in plasma and conducted the Upper-hybrid Resonance (UHR) experiments. [1] We have also conducted experiments heating by the coaxial semi-dipole antenna to enhance the right-hand polarization wave; which contributes to ECR. [2] Multicharged ion beams have been improved using various means; e.g.; the increase of the magnetic field and the microwave frequency; the DC biased plate-tuner; mixing low z gases; and the multiplex frequencies heating. However; the microwave launching position has been empirically determined on conventional ECRIS’s. There is still some room for improvement with the respect to more efficient excitation of the wave propagation. In this research; we estimate the wave propagation near the ECR zone; and in the opposite peripheral region beyond it. We measure plasma parameters in those regions by two Langmuir probes inserted into each location at the same time. In near future; we optimize the microwave-launching in the case of the fundamental frequency for ECR and the second frequency for UHR in order to enhance their incidence to the vacuum chamber.; [1]Y.

With the increase of rf power; more plasma energy will be dumped to tiny areas and result in a very high localized power density; which is estimated to be up to 1 kW/cm2. Few existing ECR plasma chamber cooling designs can withstand such high heat fluxes. In this paper; we report a new plasma chamber cooling design with so-called Micro-channel cooling technology; which can not only realize efficient heat transfer; but also retains a small radial thickness that is beneficial for the radial magnetic field. In order to evaluate the performance of the cooling structure with micro-channel design; experimental cooling loop for high heat flux has been designed and built at IMP. Initial experiments demonstrate that optimized configuration can achieve high heat flux cooling in the range of 1 kW/cm2 and beyond. Based on these results; a plasma chamber with micro-channel design for SECRAL has been designed and tested.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/tuwzo02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/tuwzo02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/tuwzo02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-TUWZO02,

The experimental results show that when Bmin/Becr is less than ~0.8; the spectral temperature Ts increases linearly with the Bmin/Becr-ratio when the injection; extraction and radial mirror fields are kept constant. Above this threshold Ts saturates and the electron cyclotron instability appears simultaneously. This study has also demonstrated that Ts decreases linearly with the increase of the average gradient over the ECR surface when the on-axis gradient and hexapole field strengths are constant. In addition; it is found that Ts decreases with the increase of the gradient at the resonance zone at relatively low mirror ratio and is insensitive to the gradient at high mirror ratio when Bmin is constant.

Results suggest that the trapped waves consist of waves propagating across the magnetic field and storing large part of the E.M. power.

It is shown that the GC approximation reproduces accurately the trajectory drifts and periodic behaviour of electrons in the minimum-B field. A typical electron orbit far enough from the source’s axis is well reproduced for 1 µs of propagation time; with the GC time-step constrained below 100 ps; giving one order of magnitude gain in computation time with respect to Boris. For an electron orbit close to the axis a disphasement of the electron’s trajectory is observed; but the spatial envelope is conserved. A comparative study analyses electron trajectories in a flatter B-field; that in a microwave discharge ion source; where this method’s drawbacks may be avoided given a smaller magnetic field gradient and a shorter electron lifetime in the plasma chamber. In this regime electron trajectories were very well reproduced by the GC approximation. The time-step was constrained below 10 ns; providing up to 30 times faster integration compared to Boris.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/tuyzo02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/tuyzo02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/tuyzo02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-TUYZO02,84

Since the constraints are solely a consequence of the rotational symmetry of external fields; they hold for a multi-species beam with arbitrary composition and space charge intensity. These constraints provide a new tool to analyze phase space properties of ECR beams and their impact on low-energy transport. We prove that; regardless of their triangulated spatial density profile; beams with 3-fold rotational symmetry have the same RMS emittance and Twiss parameters along any transverse direction.

To overcome the small production cross section of vanadium (V) beam on the curium target; the project requires a very powerful V beam. In order to optimize the beam intensity of V with the charge state of 13+; we have investigated the effects of the amount of V vapor; the power of 18- and 28-GHz microwaves; and the strength of the mirror field. While no significant effect was seen by changing the mirror field Bext from 1.4 T to 1.6 T; the amount of V vapor and the microwave power strongly affected. Based on the correlation between the V-vapor and the microwave power; we obtained a 600-euA V(13+) beam with the V consumption rate of 24 mg/h and the microwave power of 2.9 kW in order to execute about 1-month SHE experiment. Furthermore; because such strong mirror field enhances the transverse beam emittance; it is important to control the emittance with small reduction of the intensity. We have successfully controlled the beam emittance by using three pairs of slits (triplet slits) in LEBT by eliminating the peripheral beam components in both of the x-x’ and y-y’ phase spaces.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/wewzo03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/wewzo03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/wewzo03_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-WEWZO03,118

In the case of producing multicharged ion beams; we try to enhance loss channel of low Z ions by means of adding pulse modulated microwaves to conventional gas mixing method.* Through these experiments; we explore the feasibility of selectively heating specific ions with pulse modulated microwaves and launching another low frequency RF waves. In gas mixing experiment; we use Helium as low Z gas for production of multicharged Ar and Xenon ion beams. These experiments are conducted by keeping the total pressure constant and changing the mixing ratio of Helium. The time scale of pulsed microwave is typically several to several hundreds of microseconds. We optimize the pulse period and duty ratio for producing multicharged ion beams. These effects are investigated to measure Charge State Distributions (CSDs). Also; we can measure the emittance using wire probe and multi slit attached to Ion Beam Irradiation System (IBIS). ** We estimate the normalized emittance from this measurement to determine index of ion temperature in the ECRIS.

There are problems of accumulated damages at irradiation and sputtering by low energy Xe ion from the engine. It is required to construct experimentally sputtering yield databases of ion beams in the low energy region from several hundred eV to 1keV; since there are not enough data of satellite component materials. Therefore; we are trying to investigate experimentally sputtering yield on materials by irradiating the low energy single species Xeq+ ion beams. However; there is a problem that if the low extraction voltage; the amount of beam currents is not enough to obtain ion beam flux for precise evaluation of sputtering yield data. Thus; we conduct to decelerate Xeq+ ion beams required low energy region after extracting at high voltage; e.g.; 10kV. We measured the decelerated beam profile with x and y direction wire probes. As a result; we were able to estimate the dose of ion fluxes. We are going to conduct irradiation experiments on various materials.; *Y. Kato; et al.; RSI; 2014; 85; 02A950-1-3. **Y.

It also presents charge-capacity measurements conducted with the ReA EBIT that demonstrate that the HCEBIS will be able to handle beam rates of more than 10<sup>10</sup> pps.,Funding: work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY-1565546,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/nacb02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/nacb02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/nacb02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-NACB02,172
ecris2020,,NACB03,Determining the Fraction of Extracted 3He in the 3He²⁺ Charge State,M.K. Gronert; E.N. Beebe; BNL; Upton; New York; USA; Drew University; Madison; New Jersey; USA,Funding: Work supported by the US Department of Energy under contract number DE-SC0012704 and by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,The parameter space of the TOF was explored using analytic methods as well as computer simulation to improve the design and functionality of a similar device that was constructed as a prototype for the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) in 2019. A simulation of the beam line optics was produced in Opera-2D CAD software to show that other optical elements would not materially affect the operation of the TOF. This will allow for true measurements of the charge state ratios of helium for EBIS and extended EBIS operation in support of the Electron Ion Collider. EBIS operators will use the device to maximize the fraction of 3He ions in the 3He2+ state. Different geometries were explored as well to maximize the effectiveness of the device and to meet the performance criterion and physical constraints of the EBIS beam line. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/nacb03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/nacb03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/nacb03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-NACB03,177

EBITs can charge breed exotic isotopes; making them highly charged; thereby improving the precision of atomic mass measurement as the precision scales linearly with the charge state. However; ion bunches charge bred in the EBIT can have larger energy spread; which poses challenges for mass measurements. A cooler Penning trap (CPET) is currently being developed off-line at TITAN to sympathetically cool the highly charged ions (HCI) with a co-trapped electron plasma; prior to their transport to the MPET. To evaluate the integration of the CPET into the TITAN beamline and to optimize the beam transport; ion trajectory simulations were performed. Hardware upgrades motivated by these simulations and previous test measurements were applied to the off-line CPET setup. Ions and electrons were co-trapped for the first time with the CPET. Progress and challenges on the path towards HCI cooling and integration with the on-line beam facility are presented,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/talks/nacb04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/papers/nacb04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ecris2020/posters/nacb04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2020-NACB04,181
