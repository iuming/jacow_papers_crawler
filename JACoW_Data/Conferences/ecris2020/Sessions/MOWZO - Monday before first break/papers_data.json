        "FECR or the First 4th generation ECR ion source is under development at Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) since 2015. This ion source is aiming to extract intense highly charged heavy ion beams in the order of emA from the dense plasma heated with 45 GHz microwave power. To provide effective magnetic confinement to the 45 GHz ECR plasma",
        "a state of the art Nb3Sn magnet with min-B configuration is a straightforward technical path. As there is no much precedent references",
        "it has to be designed",
        "prototyped at IMP through in-house development. Meanwhile",
        "other physics and technical challenges to a 4th generation ECR ion source are also tackled at IMP to find feasible solutions. This paper will give a brief review of the critical issues in the development of FECR ion source. A detailed report on the status of FECR prototype magnet development will be presented."

The R&D performed by the INFN-LNS team during the 2019/2020 has allowed the improvement of the AISHa performances up to 20% for some of the extracted beams: both injection and extraction flanges has been improved and a movable electrode has been installed. The low energy beam transport has been equipped of an Emittance Measurement Unit (EMU)",
        "working through the beam wire scanners principle",
        "for the measurement of the vertical and horizontal emittance of the beams of interest for hadrontherapy applications. Beam emittance has been characterized as a function of q/m and of the beam intensity to highlight space charge effects. If necessary",
        "the beam wire scanners can be used for the characterization of the beam shape. The perspectives for further developments and plasma diagnostics will be also highlighted."

        "the ion beams were extracted in pulsed mode from the CW plasma of ECR discharge due to technical limitations of cooling circuits. Proton beams with current up to 70 mA were achieved at extraction voltage of 40 kV. A new unique extraction system especially effective for the formation of high current density ion beams was developed."
