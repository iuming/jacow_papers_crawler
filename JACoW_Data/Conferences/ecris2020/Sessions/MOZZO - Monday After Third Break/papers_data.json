        "it is difficult to find a working point to guarantee a long-term stability as the oven re-sponse time and the reaction of the ECRIS are relatively slow. The monitoring by using an Optical Emission Spectrometer (OES) facilitates immediate reactions when-ever plasma instabilities occur. For this reason",
        "a real-time diagnostic system based on an OES has been in-stalled at the ECRIS at HLI for routine operation during the beam-time 2020. The measured spectra revealed a parasitic oven heating by coupled microwaves often com-promising the ion source performance. Therefore",
        "a tung-sten grid has been installed to shield the oven orifice from the coupled microwaves. The results in terms of 48Ca beam intensity and stability are reported here."

It was the first time that we used metal carbonyl compounds and the result is promising. All the tests have been qualified to obtain the level of intensity and beam stability. Theses good results led us to propose them for Physics experiments."
