        "the extended EBIS",
        "is presently under development at Brookhaven National Laboratory to increase the intensity of the Au32+ ion beams by 40%’50% to 2.1 ’ 109 Au32+ ions/pulse at the booster ring entrance. Generation of intense beams of polarized 3He2+ ions with up to ~ 5 ’ 1011 ions/pulse for the RHIC and the future electron’ion collider is a goal of the EBIS upgrade project as well. Ultra-high vacuum is extremely important for stable and reliable operation of EBIS/T devices. We have developed a linear pumping module based on the ZAO NEG unit commercially available from SAES Getters. This pumping system will be used for the Extended EBIS Upgrade which is presently under development at BNL. A ZAO NEG module has been modified to be heated up to 600 °C by passing up to 120 A of DC current through a stainless-steel cage for required NEG activation and reactivation temperature cycles. A method of pumping speed measurements using pulsed gas injection into the vacuum chamber has been developed and used for characterization of the ZAO NEG-based linear pumping system."

      "abstract": "The parameter space of the TOF was explored using analytic methods as well as computer simulation to improve the design and functionality of a similar device that was constructed as a prototype for the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) in 2019. A simulation of the beam line optics was produced in Opera-2D CAD software to show that other optical elements would not materially affect the operation of the TOF. This will allow for true measurements of the charge state ratios of helium for EBIS and extended EBIS operation in support of the Electron Ion Collider. EBIS operators will use the device to maximize the fraction of 3He ions in the 3He2+ state. Different geometries were explored as well to maximize the effectiveness of the device and to meet the performance criterion and physical constraints of the EBIS beam line. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
