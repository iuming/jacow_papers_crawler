medsi2020,,MOIO01,Superconducting Undulators - A Novel Source of Radiation for Synchrotron and FEL Light Sources,ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; Superconducting (SC) magnets have been used at many accelerators for several decades. In the last several years noticeable progress in the use of SC undulators (SCUs) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) has taken place. SCUs outperform most advanced permanent magnet-based undulators. This motivated APS to significantly invest in the development of SCU technology. More than a decade of effort by the APS SCU team has culminated in several engineering advances in cryogenic; magnet; and magnet measurement designs applied to SCUs. Successful SCU prototypes led to construction of three SCUs that are currently quite reliably operated at the APS. Two of them are planar SCUs; and one is a helical SCU. Currently as part of the APS-U project; the APS SCU team builds new SCU systems; each comprising two long SC undulators housed in a 5-m-long cryostat. It also works on a quite challenging device; an arbitrary polarizing SCU called SCAPE. At the same time; the APS team; in collaboration with FNAL and LBNL; is working on the development and construction of a planar Nb3Sn SCU and will be collaborating with SLAC on the development of an SCU FEL module.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/moio01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/moio01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/moio01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOIO01,
medsi2020,,MOIO02,"BM18, the New ESRF-EBS Beamline for Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography",F. Cianciosi; A.-L. Buisson; P. Tafforeau; P. Van Vaerenbergh; ESRF; Grenoble; France; BM18 is an ESRF-EBS beamline for hierarchical tomography; it will combine sub-micron precision and the possibility to scan very large samples. The applications will include biomedical imaging; material sciences and cultural heritage. It will allow the complete scanning of a post-mortem human body at 25 µm; with the ability to zoom-in in any location to 0.7 µm. BM18 is exploiting the high-energy-coherence beam of the new EBS storage ring. The X-ray source is a short tripole wiggler that gives a 300mm-wide beam at the sample position placed 172m away from the source. Due to this beam size; nearly all of the instruments are devel-oped in-house. A new building was constructed to ac-commodate the largest synchrotron white-beam Experi-mental Hutch worldwide (42x5-6m). The main optical components are refractive lenses; slits; filters and a chop-per. There is no crystal monochromator present but the combination of the optical elements will provide high quality filtered white beams; as well as an inline mono-chromator system. The energy will span from 25 to 350 keV. The Experimental Hutch is connected by a 120m long UHV pipe with a large window at the end; followed by a last set of slits. The sample stage can position; rotate and monitor with sub-micron precision samples up to 2; 5x0.6m (H x Diam.) and 300kg. The resulting machine is 4x3x5m and weighs 50 tons. The girder for detectors carries up to 9 detectors on individual 2-axis stages. It moves on air-pads on a precision marble floor up to 38m behind the sample stage to perform phase contrast imag-ing at a very high energy on large objects. The commissioning is scheduled for the beginning of 2022; the first ’friendly users’ are expected in March 2022 and the full operation will start in September 2022.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/moio02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/moio02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/moio02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOIO02,1
medsi2020,,MOOA01,Overcoming Challenges during the Insertion Device Straight Section Component Production and Tuning Phase of the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade,ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APSU) scope for insertion devices (IDs) and ID vacuum systems is extensive. Thirty-five of the 40 straight sections in the storage ring will be retrofitted with new 4.8-meter-long Superconducting Undulators (SCUs) or a mix of new and reused Hybrid-Permanent Magnet Undulators (HPMUs). All 35 ID straight sections will require new vacuum systems and new HPMU control systems. Production is well underway at multiple manufacturing sites around the world for these components. Simultaneously; ID assembly and HPMU tuning is occurring onsite at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). In addition to component production and assembly/tuning activities; our team also started the ID swap out program at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) in late 2020. This program allows us to remove HPMUs intended for reuse from the APS storage ring and retune them to meet the APSU magnetic specifications to reduce the tuning workload during dark time. These activities have presented technical and logistical challenges that are as unique as the components themselves. Additionally; the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic presented unforeseen challenges that required new work processes to be created to sustain pace and quality of work while maintaining the high workplace safety standards required at Argonne. This paper will summarize the many challenges we encountered during the course of the project and how they were overcome.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/mooa01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/mooa01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/mooa01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOOA01,6

This concept implies challenges during the whole project phase from design into operation. The fast conditioning of the vacuum system and over five years of reliable accelerator operation have demonstrated that the chosen design proved to be good and does not impose limits on the operation. A summary of the vacuum system design; production; installation and performance is presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/mooa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/mooa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/mooa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOOA02,10

To reach concomitant beam positioning accuracy and stability; particular attention has been paid to mechanical and thermal stability; which has imposed the implementation of several innovative design concepts. To meet the extremely challenging specifications of the ESRF DCM implies not only high precision mechanical design; but also a mechatronic system enabling the active correction of the parallelism between crystals. Online metrology; associated with a controller capable of real-time signal processing have been implemented. A prototype has been partially validated and production of the first batch (two ESRF DCMs) is in progress. This presentation will give an overview of the DCM design principles and operating modes; then show how the calibration process is performed in situ on the beamline; using x-rays and associated instrumentation; and will explain the working principle of the active correction mode. To conclude; some characterisations of the DCM performances with x-rays will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/moob01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/moob01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/moob01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOOB01,

Optical design has been developed in-house so as most of beamline core opto-mechanics like Monochromator. The design made for LOREA is based on a Hettrick-Underwood grating type that operates without entrance slit. Experience cumulated over years allowed to face the challenge of designing and building UHV Monochromator. The large energy range of LOREA (10-100 eV) requires a device with 3 mirrors and 4 gratings with variable line spacing to reduce aberrations. Monochromator most important part; gratings system; has been carefully designed to be isolated from external disturbances as cooling water; and at the same time having high performances. Deep analytical calculations and FEA simulations have been carried out; as well as testing prototypes. The most innovative part of Monochromator is gratings cooling with no vacuum guards or double piping that are well-known source of troubles. Heat load is removed by copper straps in contact with a temperature controller device connected to fixed water lines. In addition; motion mechanics and services (cabling; cooling) are independent systems. Designs involved give high stability (resonance modes over 60Hz) and angular resolution below 0.1 µrad over 11° range. On mirrors side; it has been used gonio mechanics from MIRAS* plus an eutectic InGa interface between cooling and optics to decouple them. Grating and mirror holders are fully removable from main mechanics to be able to assembled at lab measuring to achieve the best fit. Instrument has been already assembled and motions characterization or stability measurements are giving expected results matching with specifications.,,"* L.

The new beamline optical design is following the structure of the existed TLS IR beamline. However; the focusing mirrors has to be re-deign according to different situation. These KB type mirrors (HFM and VFM) are same thickness flat stain-less plates assembled with bending arms and bended with single motor each to fit quintic polynomial surface pro-files for focusing and also modifying arc source effect of bending section. For a same thickness plate in addition with the bending arms effect to form a desired polynomi-al surface profile; it demands specific width distribution. With the drawing method and FEM iteration simulation; the optimized surface polynomial equation and width distribution design of the mirror plates were defined.

In this context; it is imperative that many silicon optical elements* be effectively cooled; such that temperatures and their control-related parameters can be precisely handled to the point in which thermal effects are acceptable concerning figure distortions and drifts at different timescales. For this class of precision equipment; the required performance can only be achieved with robust thermal management.** For this; relevant aspects related to the implementation of liquid nitrogen cooling systems need to be emphasized. Currently; two solutions are present at the first-phase beamlines; according to the component thermal load: (1) an in-house low-cost system for components under moderate loads (< 50 W); such as the mirror systems and the four-bounce monochromators; comprising a commercial cryostat connected to an instrumented vessel; whose level and pressure are controlled by the standard beamline automation system that can automatically feed it from a secondary service unit or a dedicated transfer line; (2) a commercial cryocooler for high-heat-load applications (50 - 3000 W); such as the double-crystal monochromators. This work presents the in-house solution: requirements; design aspects; operation range; as well as several discoveries and improvements deployed during the commissioning of the CATERETÊ and the CARNAÚBA beamlines; such as the prevention of ice formation; stabilization of both thermal load and flow-rate; and auto-filling parameters; among others.,,*TOLENTINO.

Aiming at unmatching scanning possibilities and positioning stability in vertical-bounce DCMs; it has been developed since 2015 for hard X-ray beamlines at Sirius Light Source at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). Two units are currently operational at the MANACA (macromolecular crystallography) and the EMA (extreme conditions) undulator beamlines; whereas a model for extended scanning capabilities in the energy range between 3.1 to 43 keV; the so-called HD-DCM-Lite; is in advanced development stage for two new beamlines; namely: QUATI (quick absorption spectroscopy); with a bending-magnet source; and SAPUCAIA (small-angle scattering); with an undulator source. In this work; online commissioning and operating results of the HD-DCMs are presented with emphasis on: the 10 nrad RMS (1 Hz - 2.5 kHz) pitch-parallelism performance; energy calibration; energy-dependent beam motion at sample; and flyscan with monochromator-undulator synchronization; which is a well-known control challenge at beamlines.

It brings about numerous efforts to cope with engineering challenges comprehending high thermal load; cooling strategy; crystal manufacturing; vibration sources; alignment and coupled motion control. This contribution presents the design and performance of a four-bounce silicon-crystal monochromator for the Sirius beamlines at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Source (LNLS); which is basically composed of two channel-cut crystals mounted on two goniometers that counter-rotate synchronously. The mechanical design ascertained the demands for the nanoprobe and coherent scattering beamlines - namely; CARNAÚBA and CATERETÊ - focusing on solutions to minimize misalignments among the parts; to grant high stiffness and to ensure that the thermal performance would not impair beam characteristics. Hence; all parts were carefully simulated; machined; and measured before assembling.

medsi2020,,MOPB05,Stability Performance of the Cryocooled Horizontal Double Crystal Monochromator for DanMAX,FMB Oxford; Oxford; United Kingdom; The new 4th generation storage rings beamlines with improved smaller emittance require an increasingly vibrational stability on every beamline component to maintain a high beam quality. The horizontal double crystal monochromators (H-DCM) are specially well suited for these; providing an outstanding beam energy and position stability while coping with high power loads and maintaining UHV conditions. FMB Oxford has recently delivered a new generation cryocooled H-DCM for DanMAX beamline at MAX IV; this is an evolved version of the previous designs already installed at MAX IV and other facilities*. The redesign features have improved the excellent stability performance of the system and its usability. Particularly; it includes an axial cooling feedthrough which allow the cooling lines to the optics to remain short and they don’t need to accommodate the scanning motion of the crystal cage. After the system was installed in the optics hutch of DanMAX; onsite measurements at operating conditions were performed achieving a relative pitch stability of 22nrad RMS and a vertical stability as low as 3.30nrad RMS. We are awaiting beam stability results to correlate with our findings.; *P. Kristiansen et al.; J. Synchrotron Rad.

These SCUs require new undulator magnets to achieve the required performance of the new machine. The magnets are fabricated from low carbon steel and wound with NbTi superconductor. To meet the needs of the users of the new machine these magnets will be manufactured in different lengths and magnetic periods to accommodate SCUs in both inline and canted configurations. Because the magnets for the SCUs cannot be shimmed like permanent magnet undulators; they need to have very tight tolerances for the poles and the winding grooves. This poses unique manufacturing and fabrication challenges. This paper will cover the design of the 1.9 m long magnets for the inline SCUs; their measurement data; lessons learned from manufacturing; and an overview of design changes that were made for the magnets to be used in the canted SCU configurations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/mopb09_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/mopb09.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/mopb09_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOPB09,41

It serves two major functions: (1) a centralized location to link all data relating to field-replaceable upgrade components; and (2) a way to track the components throughout the machine’s 25-year lifetime. There are four (4) Superconducting Undulators (SCUs): two (2) Inline 16.5mm period devices; one (1) Canted 16.5mm period device; and one (1) Canted 18.5mm period device. Throughout the production process for these devices; tracking components between the different designs of SCU’s has proven to be a logistical issue; as there are uniform components among all 4 devices; but many unique components as well. As the scope evolved from a Research and Development (R&D) activity to a production scope; the CDB has been critical in communicating with a growing team; allowing anyone to identify a part or assembly and access all its design and manufacturing data. The 4.8-meter long SCUs are the first of their kind; requiring thorough onsite inspections; intricate assembly procedurals; and approved safety protocols. This is ideal information to document in an electronic traveler (e-traveler); which can then be attached to an item within the CDB. By providing a straightforward process for technicians to follow; the risk of miscommunication and unsafe practices are minimized. The CDB plays a vital role in simplifying and optimizing the transition of the SCU from an R&D unit to a production scope; from procurement to inspection; assembly and installation; and throughout the lifespan of machine maintenance.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/mopb10_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/mopb10.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/mopb10_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOPB10,44

While such measurement techniques exist for hard x-ray beamlines; they have yet to be achieved for soft x-ray beamlines. A new soft X-ray beam position monitor (SXBPM) design based on GaAs detector arrays is being developed and will be installed in the first optical enclosure of the Coherent Soft X-ray Scattering (CSX) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). The SXBPM assembly contains four water-cooled blade assemblies; each of which will have a GaAs detector assembly mounted within it; that can be inserted into the outer edges of the CSX undulator beam with sub-micron accuracy and resolution. The primary challenges in design of the SXBPM include: 1) mechanical stability of the assembly; 2) management of the heat load from the undulator x-ray beam to protect GaAs detector assemblies from unwanted illumination; 3) assembly compactness to fit within the first optical enclosure (FOE) of the CSX beamline; and 4) accessibility for modifications. Balancing the unique design requirements of the SXBPM along with their associated constraints has resulted in the design of a non-invasive beam position monitor which will be installed in the CSX FOE as a prototype for testing and iterative improvement. The ultimate goal is development of a widely useful SXBPM instrument for soft X-ray beamlines at high brightness synchrotron storage ring facilities worldwide.

The expected two orders of magnitude increase in brightness along with the increased power density due to the circular aspect ratio of the X-ray beam produced by the Multi-bend Achromat (MBA) magnetic lattice in the upgraded storage ring will set new demanding performance requirements on optical components. The upgrade offers a coherent source that many beamlines will utilize for proposed experimental studies; and it is essential that the chosen optics preserve the coherence of the X-ray beam from undulator to sample. The scientific goal of the IDEA Beamline is to obtain performance metrics for proposed beamline optics and components for the APS-U to ensure the best performance of both the planned featured beamlines and the enhanced beamlines. Questions being explored at the IDEA beamline are wavefront and coherence preservation; monochromator stability; optics surface quality; and effects of high heat loads on optical components. One of the objectives is to directly map monochromator vibration and crystal surface roughness to wavefront degradation. Currently the APS-U does not have a suitable testing location for X-ray optics and components that provides the necessary flux or brightness to simulate the planned APS-U source. The IDEA beamline fills this gap. Measurements will simulate the expected MBA upgraded operating conditions for the tested systems and the data obtained will be used to validate; optimize; or re-engineer for best possible performance.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,"Funding: Used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.",reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/mopc04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/mopc04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/mopc04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOPC04,
medsi2020,,MOPC05,Beamline Alignment and Characterization with an Autocollimator,M.V. Fisher; A.A. Khan; J.J. Knopp; ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; An electronic autocollimator is a valuable tool that can assist in the alignment of optical beamline components such as mirrors and monochromators. It is also a powerful tool for in situ diagnoses of the mechanical behavior of such components. This can include the repeatability of crystals; gratings; and mirrors as they are rotated; the parasitic errors of these same optical elements as they are rotated and/or translated; and the repeatability and parasitic errors as bendable mirrors are actuated. The autocollimator can even be used to establish a secondary reference if such components require servicing. This paper will provide examples of such alignments; diagnoses; and references that have been made with an autocollimator on existing and recently commissioned beam-lines at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). In addition; this paper will discuss how this experience influenced the specifications and subsequent designs of the new primary high-heat-load mirror systems (PHHLMS) that are currently under fabrication for six of the APS Up-grade (APS-U) feature beamlines. Each mirror was specified to provide in situ line-of-sight access for an autocollimator to either the center of the mirror’s optical surface or to a smaller polished surface centered on the backside of each mirror substrate. This line of sight will be used for initial alignment of the mirror and will be available for in situ diagnoses if required in the future.,"Funding: Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility, operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/mopc05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/mopc05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/mopc05_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOPC05,62

The high density of optics and beam transport components needed to steer the beam to multiple beam lines places a premium on compact collimator design. This presentation discusses a compact collimator consisting of an X-ray beam power collimator; a burn through monitor (BTM) designed to detect failure of the X-ray beam collimator; and a Bremsstrahlung collimator. The collimator body is a monolith machined from CuCrZr (C18150) that eliminates costly braze operations and reduces assembly time and complexity. Sintered high thermal conductivity SiC is employed as the X-ray absorber with design provisions incorporated to permit the inclusion of additional absorbers (e.g. diamond). The allowed FEL beam power is limited to 100W. Finite element analyses ensure that the power absorber remains in safe temperature and stress regimes under the maximum power loading and smallest expected beam dimensions. The beam power will be limited via credited controls placed on the electron beam. Beam containment requirements stipulate the inclusion of a monitor to detect burn through events owing to absorber failure. The BTM is a gas-filled; thin wall vessel which; if illuminated by the beam; will burn through and release the contained gas and trip pressure switches that initiate beam shutdown. The beam absorber and BTM shadow the Bremsstrahlung collimator shielding after appropriate propagation of manufacturing; assembly; and installation tolerances. Tooling is developed to minimize assembly complexity and ensure minimal alignment errors.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/mopc08_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/mopc08.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/mopc08_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-MOPC08,68

To achieve long working distance at high spatial resolution; the ISN instrument will be positioned 210 m downstream of the x-ray source; in a dedicated satellite building; currently under construction***. The ISN instrument will use a nano-focusing Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirror system; which will focus hard x-rays to a focal spot as small as 20 nm; with a large working distance of 61 mm. The large working distance provides space for various in situ sample cells for x-ray fluorescence tomography and ptychographic 3D imaging; allows the use of a separate; independent vacuum chambers for the optics and sample; and provides the flexibility to run experiments in vacuum or at ambient pressure. A consequence of the small spot size and large working distance is the requirement for high angular stability of the KB mirrors (5 nrad V-mirror and 16 nrad H-mirror) and high relative stability between focus spot and sample (4 nmRMS). Additional features include fly-scanning a maximum of a 2 kg sample plus in situ cell at 1 mm/s in vertical and/or horizontal directions over an area of 10 mm x 10 mm. Environmental capabilities will include heating and cooling; flow of fluids and applied fields; as required for electrochemistry and flow of gases at high temperature for catalysis.

The discrete photon absorbers; typically fabricated from electron beam-welded GlidCop AL-15; are subject to heat loads ranging from approximately 170 to 3400 watts; with a peak power density up to approximately 610 W/mm2 at normal incidence. Four of the five photon absorber designs are housed in vacuum chambers; including three that are mounted to the antechambers of curved aluminum extrusion-based L-bend vacuum chambers and one that is mounted to a stainless steel vacuum-pumping cross. Furthermore; two of the photon absorbers that are mounted to L-bend vacuum chambers are equipped with position-adjustment mechanisms; which are necessitated by the challenging design and fabrication of the curved vacuum chambers. The fifth photon absorber; unlike the rest; is a brazed design that is integral in sealing the vacuum system and intercepts approximately 170 watts. Each photon absorber design was optimized with thermal-structural finite element analyses while ensuring functional and spatial requirements were met. Some of these requirements include meeting internal high-heat-load component design criteria; respecting challenging component interfaces and alignment requirements; and minimizing impedance effects. Furthermore; photon beam scattering effects called for the use of scattering shields on three designs to minimize potential heating of vacuum chambers.

Each design balances functionality; manufacturability; and installation needs. The design process was aided by a flexible CAD skeleton model which allowed for easier adjustments. Synchrotron radiation heat loads applied to inline chamber photon absorbers and photon extraction beam envelopes were determined via a 3D ray tracing CAD model. The inline photon absorber and the key-hole shapes were optimized using iterative thermal-structural FEA. Focus was put on mesh quality to mod-el the <0.5 mm tall synchrotron radiation heat load absorbed across the length of the chamber to verify cooling parameters.

Recently; assembly and free-boundary vibration tests have been done on the first article of the upstream quadrupole Doublet; Longitudinal gradient dipole and Multipole module (DLM-A). The top surface flatness of the girder and the magnet alignment measurement results demonstrate the static positioning requirement of magnet-to-magnet is met.

This validation then confirms the predicted performance of the magnet support system design.

Such systems are usually including dedicated control strategies; and many factors may limit their performances. In order to design such complex systems in a predictive way; a mechatronic design approach also known as ""model based design""; may be utilized. In this paper; we present how this mechatronic design approach was used for the development of a nano-hexapod for the ESRF ID31 beamline. The chosen design approach consists of using models of the mechatronic system (including sensors; actuators and control strategies) to predict its behavior. Based on this behavior and closed-loop simulations; the elements that are limiting the performances can be identified and re-designed accordingly. This allows to make adequate choices concerning the design of the nano-hexapod and the overall mechatronic architecture early in the project and save precious time and resources. Several test benches were used to validate the models and to gain confidence on the predictability of the final system’s performances. Measured nano-hexapod’s dynamics was shown to be in very good agreement with the models. Further tests should be done in order to confirm that the performances of the system match the predicted one. The presented development approach is foreseen to be applied more frequently to future mechatronic system design at the ESRF.",,Your browser cannot play the video.

Existing mechanical bender technology often suffers from poor repeatability and does not include twist compensation. We recently developed an elliptically bent mirror based on a laminar flexure bending mechanism that yielded promising results*; **. In this work; the mirror surface twist was characterized using a Fizeau interferometer under different bending conditions. By applying a shimming correction; the surface twist was successfully reduced from 50 urad to 1.5 urad. The twist angle variation from no bending to the maximum bending is less than 0.5 urad. Our simulation results show that these numbers are significantly lower than the required values to ensure optimum optical performance. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the twist compensation procedures and validates the mirror bender design parameters.; *Shu; D. et al.; AIP Conference Proceedings. Vol. 2054.

Storing and recirculating the output of an amplifier in an X- ray cavity so that the X-ray pulse can interact with following fresh electron bunches over many passes enables the development of full temporal coherence. One of the key challenges to forming the X-ray cavity is the precision of the cavity mechanical system design and construction.

After baking at 150 degrees centigrade for 12 h; the pumping speeds of the NEG pump for H2 and CO were 2350~800 L/s and 1560~20 L/s; respectively; in the pumped-quantity range 0.01~30 Pa L. The morphologies of oxygen-free Pd/Ti films on the partition plates and the base plate were examined by scanning electron microscopy; scanning transmission electron microscopy; and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The Ti was completely coated with Pd on the bottom; whereas the partition plates were covered by Pd/Ti nanostructures. Our new NEG pump is ideal for maintaining ultrahigh vacuums in the range 10-8 to 10-9 Pa; because (a) its pumping speeds for H2 and CO are quite large; (b) it can evacuate H2O and CO2 when an ionization gauge is used in the vacuum system; (3) it can be activated by baking at 150 degrees centigrade for 12 h; (c) its pumping speed does not decrease even after 9 cycles of pumping; baking; cooling to room temperature; and exposure to air**; (5) it requires neither a dedicated power supply nor electric feedthroughs; and (6) it is space saving and lightweight.; *T.

For the focusing optics; this means assuring a small and non-astigmatic probe; high flux density; and remarkably high position stability; while also preserving beam wavefront. At stations further dedicated to spectromicroscopy and in-situ experiments; these requirements add up to having achromatic design and suitable working distance; respectively. In this way; Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors have been chosen as the most appropriate solution for Sirius focusing optics. At TARUMÃ*; the first delivered nanoprobe at Sirius; the KB focuses the beam down to a 120 nm spot size (>8 keV) with a 440 mm working distance. This brought the requirements on the mirror’s angular stability to less than 10 nrad RMS; surface quality to single-digit nanometers; and alignment tolerances to the range of hundreds of nrad; which can be even tighter for other nanoprobes. Such specifications are particularly challenging regarding clamping; vibration; and thermal expansion budgets; even testing optical metrology limits during alignment and validation phases. The resulting KB mechanism is an opto-mechanical system with an exactly-constrained; deterministic design**; and suspension modes well above 250 Hz; sufficiently coupling optics to sample in the same 6-DoF base. It provides low-order aberration corrections by single degree-of-freedom alignment with piezo actuators; while higher order aberrations from clamping and thermal deformations are mitigated by gluing each mirror to flexure-based mounting frames. This contribution presents the design; assembly; and commissioning of the KB system at TARUMÃ as a reference case.; *Tolentino; H.C.N.; et al.

medsi2020,,TUOB02,Development of a Passive Tuned Mass Damper for Ultra-High Vacuum Beamline Optics,F. Khan; D. Crivelli; J.H. Kelly; A. Male; DLS; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom; Vibration in beamline optics can degrade the quality of experiments: the resulting movement of a mirror increases the x-ray beam position uncertainty; and introduces flux variations at the sample. This is normally dealt with by averaging data collection over longer periods of time; by slowing down the data acquisition rates; or by accepting lower quality / blurred images. With the development of faster camera technology and smaller beam sizes in next generation synchrotron upgrades; older optics designs can become less suitable; but still very expensive to redesign. Mechanically; mirror actuation systems need to be a balance between repeatability of motion and stability. This normally leads to designs that are ’soft’ and have resonant modes at a relatively low frequency; which can be easily excited by external disturbances such as ground vibration and local noise. In ultra-high vacuum applications the damping is naturally very low; and the amplification of vibration at resonance tends to be very high. At Diamond we designed a process for passively damping beamline mirror optics. First; we analyse the mirror’s vibration modes using experimental modal analysis; we then determine the tuned mass damper parameters using mathematical and dynamic models. Finally; we design a flexure-based metal tuned mass damper which relies on eddy current damping through magnets and a conductor plate. The tuned mass damper can be retrofitted to existing optics using a clamping system that requires no modification to the existing system. In this conference paper we show a case study on a mirror optic on Diamond Light Source’s small molecule single crystal diffraction beamline; I19.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

These extremely brilliant x-ray sources enable; among other things with new focusing optics; focal sizes in the nanometer range with the highest intensity and thus allow for highly dynamic experiments also on this scale. In order to guarantee the required beam quality all the way down to the experiment; optimal conditions must be generated for the end stations and for the beamline optics. An optimum of stability and precision can unfortunately only be achieved if; on the one hand; the infrastructure that shields the experiments and enables undisrupted operation is planned very carefully. On the other hand; the scientific instruments must also be optimized and improved. Our strategy for the construction of the PETRA IV experiments is based on five pillars (low vibration; stable environment; rigid construction; optimized design and fast feedback). In this contribution; we describe these concepts in more detail.

Recently Miyazawa et al. found that high-purity Ti deposited under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) followed by N2 introduction works as a NEG with an activation temperature of 185 °C**; ***. Since the concentration of impurities such as O; C; and N in the Ti thin film prepared by this method is 0.05% or less; we named this as oxygen-free Ti. In this study; we evaluated the pumping properties of oxygen-free Ti thin films after high-purity N2 introduction by total and partial pressure measurements. A vacuum vessel with oxygen-free Ti deposited on the inner walls was found to pump H2; H2O; O2; CO and CO2 even after 30 cycles of high purity N2 introduction; air exposure; pumping; and baking at 185 °C. Furthermore; we analyzed the oxygen-free Ti thin films after high-purity N2 or air introduction by synchrotron radiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that more TiN was formed when high-purity N2 was introduced after oxygen-free Ti deposition. High purity of the Ti thin film and TiN formation on the surface seem to be responsible for the reduced activation temperature as low as 185 °C.; *C. Benvenuti et al.; J. Vac. Sci. Technol.

It consists of 14 DTBA cell; where each cell requires 6 magnet girders. For the new storage ring of SPS II we developed a magnet girder system which uses wedgemounts for the precision alignment. The girder alignment uses a 3-2-1 alignment method and requires 3 wedgemounts to control Z direction; 2 wedgemounts to control Y-direction and 1 wedgemount for the X-direction. The magnet alignment is based on mechanical tolerances. Therefore; the girders top plate is prepared with precision surfaces with a flatness tolerance of 30 µm. During the development process of the girder system deformation and vibration FEA analysis were carried out and the results were used to improve the design regarding low deformation and high natural frequencies. In this paper FEA analysis results are presented as well as the design of the girder; pedestal and its wedgemount based alignment system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupa10_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupa10.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupa10_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPA10,138

To fulfil the 25 nm ground motion restriction on the storage ring tunnel slab; two prototype slabs with different design schemes were constructed on the HEPS site. The first scheme adopted a 1 m reinforced concrete with replace-ment layer of a 1 m sand & stone underneath. The second scheme employed an extra 5 m grouting layer below the previously mentioned two layers. A series of tests had been carried out. The prototype slab with grouting layer is testified to have comparable vibration level with the bare ground; which is under 25 nm without traffic inside the HEPS campus; while the vibration level is amplified a lot on the other prototype slab. However; it is hard to make the grouting layer homogeneously under the kilo-metre-scale tunnel and besides the cost is unacceptable for 5 m grouting with such a large scale. The finalized design is fixed to be a 1 m reinforced concrete slab and 3 m replacement layer underneath using plain concrete.

ADS-1 will have tunable collimating optics that will combine with a fixed exit double crystal Laue monochromator (DCLM) to provide white; pink and monochromatic beam (50-150 keV) to a large end-station located outside the main synchrotron building. ADS-1 will accommodate experiments using a variety of sample stages capable of positioning large and heavy samples (up to 300 kg). The second ADS beamline; ADS-2; will take a deflected beam from the main beam using a side-bounce monochromator (SBM) that produces three monochromatic energies from 45 keV - 90 keV. The SCMPW source for the beamline produces a beam of 45 kW at 4.5 T. The major optics of the beamline include a cryogenic SBM and a cryogenic DCLM; a transfocator and multilayer VFM. The high heat load on the front end and upstream monochromator represented key challenges for the beamline design. Innovative approaches to thermal management have been developed. The high radiation environment required additional safety protocols to be implemented for beamline operation. The primary beamline endstation utilises a large gantry robot to independently position up to 4 detectors in an envelope of up to 8x3x0.3 m with a positional repeatability of ± 0.01 mm. The large motion envelope gives users access to large Q-range and allows flexibility for users to utilise large bespoke sample environments. The ADS beamlines project encompasses design; procurement; build/installation and commissioning phases. The beamline will commence user operations in July 2023.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupa16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupa16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupa16_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPA16,150
medsi2020,,TUPA17,Development of a Pair of Medium Energy X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Beamlines at Australian Synchrotron,AS - ANSTO; Clayton; Australia; C. Glover; B. Mountford; ASCo; Clayton; Victoria; Australia; The Medium Energy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (MEX) beamlines are designed to perform routine; high throughput XAS experiments in the energy range 1.7 to 13.6 keV; split over two beamlines. This energy range is often overlooked but allows access to useful absorption K-edges of Si; P; S; Cl and Ca. Individual components of this system are relatively common; however the large number of components and broad functionality makes for a difficult integration challenge. Both beamlines are supplied by a single bending magnet; with the MEX2 beam being separated away by a pair of side bounce; cylindrically bent mirrors. MEX1 utilises a pair of multi stripe mirrors (Si; B4C and Rh) to access the desired energy range. Energy selection is performed by Double Crystal Monochromators (DCM); which are designed for both step and slew scanning. The end stations of both beamlines have Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) and multiple ion chambers to facilitate fluorescence and transmission measurements. Sample temperatures can be controlled with any of the three helium recirculating cryostats or heaters. High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD) experiments can be performed using either the single crystal spectrometer (MEX2) or the five crystal spectrometer (MEX1). MEX1 also includes a microprobe which uses a Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirror to focus to a several micron spot. Given the energy range; attenuation of the photons is a particular challenge. These end stations are designed to minimise beam attenuation and maximise experiment versatility by selectively allowing high vacuum or helium environments in different regions. Removable windows and custom designed interfaces between components minimises the number of windows in the beam path which would have further attenuated photons.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupa17_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupa17.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupa17_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPA17,

The Nanoprobe will host a suite of x-ray mapping capabilities at spatial resolutions down to 60 nanometres. This extreme resolution target requires an overall length of over 100 m entailing high stability for optical components. The first part of the beamline will be sitting on the main building floor and will include two mirrors; two monochromators (DMM and DCM); a Secondary Source Aperture; plus all ancillary components. The end station will be situated in a satellite building; connected to the main building by a tunnel hosting the 50m UHV beam transfer pipe. The end station will host a pair of KB mirrors; the sample stages; multiple detectors and several beam inspection devices. There are several mechanical challenges that need to be overcome in the realisation of the beamline. Within the main building; we need to ensure the mechanical stability of the mirrors; the monochromators and the secondary source aperture. To reduce the vibration impact on the vertical displacement; we have opted for an all-horizontally deflecting optical scheme. Separated and isolated slabs are required; as well as mechanical isolation of vibration sources from the optical components. Thermal stability requirements are also challenging. Fundamental height above floor level requires thermal stability better than 0.05 C under the mirrors. Careful attention to materials selection and design is required for the end station to contain thermal drifts. Achieving these stabilities requires a careful approach as conventional HVAC systems bring vibration and air turbulence.

medsi2020,,TUPB03,The Use of Vibration to Achieve Precision,DLS; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom; The work here describes how vibration and the acoustics it produces have been embraced to achieve precision in the macro; micro; nano and pico regime. On the macro scale it has been harnessed to develop smart structures that use resonance and its subsequently high Q to accurately determine positioning and preloads on assemblies. These structures can be machined into support assemblies to ensure consistency in the results they produce as they are integral and never removed. This ensures the data they give is directly comparable pre and post service. The high Q they offer promises new levels of accuracy in assembly and a potential for an audit trail. The other application this work describes is the use of vibration to generate acoustic levitation for room temperature and time resolved sample delivery encompassing the micro; nano and pico regimes. Our methodology moves away from traditional Langevin horn cavities used by previous workers for levitation experiments to low power tractor beam ones specifically designed for light source applications. This has been complimented with the exciting technology of Poly Pico who can use acoustics to eject sample droplets in the order of 10 picolitres and at a rate of 50 kHz and on demand. These two technologies compliment each other beautifully for mixing experiments facilitating ’watching’ reactions taking place within a protein.

During these periods of instabilities; which occur for a few hours every week of operation; there are deviations up to +1.5 °C; concerning the nominal temperature of 23 ± 0.2 °C in the four rings of ALBA: Service Area; Booster; Storage and Experimental Hall. This problem has a direct impact on the quality of the beam of the Accelerator. Previous studies have preliminarily concluded that the causes of this problem are due to (1) thermohydraulic anomalies in the operation of the external cogeneration plant; which supplies cold water to ALBA; and (2) cavitation problems in the pumping system (the water mass flow has been reduced to 67% of its nominal value to temporarily mitigate the cavitation). In order to confirm these hypotheses and propose solutions to the problem; an investigation has been developed making use of one-dimensional thermohydraulic simulations; performing Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) studies; statistical evaluations of data taken from our control system; and systematic flow measurements in critical areas; with ultrasonic flowmeters. As a result of this research; a set of solutions and recommendations are finally proposed to solve this problem.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupb05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupb05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupb05_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPB05,153

Currently under development at Argonne is a corrugated wakefield accelerator (CWA) that will operate at mmWave frequencies; with its fundamental mode of operation at 180 GHz; and relatively high power levels; up to 600 W. The fundamental mode needs to be extracted from the accelerator at approximately every 0.5 m to prevent the unwanted heating of the accelerator structure. Therefore; the structure is intentionally designed so this fundamental mode does not propagate further; instead it is transmitted through the waveguide assembly under vacuum and out via the vacuum window. As a result of the relatively high mmWave power densities; CVD diamond was chosen as the vacuum window material; due to its low electromagnetic losses; mechanical strength; and for its superior thermo-physical properties. Mechanically it is necessary to be able to hold the tight tolerances necessary for windows performance at millimeter wavelengths. Other mechanical difficulties involve assembly of the window due to CVD diamond material and preservation of ultra high vacuum even if the integrity of the CVD diamond window is somehow compromised.,Funding: This manuscript is based upon work supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from Argonne National Laboratory,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupb06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupb06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupb06_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPB06,156

Fourier analysis of the encoder data allowed to determine the accuracy for different angle ranges and shows a better accuracy for the case of the new angle encoder. Furthermore; we will introduce two different methods to increase the system accuracy by plane grating monochromators in collimated light employing the newly developed encoder.

The studies have been carried out using a variety of techniques: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM); Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Representative samples of the Accelerator Facility were examined: Storage Ring Absorbers; Front End Masks; Radio Frequency Cavity Pipes; Experimental Line Mask; Radio Frequency Plant Pipes at Service Area and Booster Quadrupole. The studies show the presence of intergranular; pitting and generalized corrosion. The presence of copper oxide is confirmed; as well as other elements such as Aluminum; Carbon; Sulfur; Silver; Calcium; Silicon; Titanium and Iron in some regions of the samples. Likewise; other elements from circulating water such as Potassium and Chlorine have also been detected. The depth of pitting corrosion is less than 119.4 um for the samples studied; after 10 years of operation. To minimize the corrosion problem; an upgrade of the ALBA cooling system is under study. The objective is to reduce the current corrosion rate by a conservative factor of 5. This change is possible by modifying the characteristics of the cooling water; reducing the dissolved oxygen content to values below 10 ppb and increasing the pH above 7.5. Technical aspects of this upgrade are discussed in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupb12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupb12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupb12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPB12,171

Solid-state power amplifiers (SSPA) offer the advantage of a good modularity and scalability to address these needs. However; the design; development; and production of such a complex SSPA system with sufficient reliability is challenging and expensive; due to the customized requirements. We are addressing this issue by offering a high flexibility with our modular design in combination with our in-house developed control software. Based on our experience we are eliminating potential downsides by industrialization and still offering a high grade of flexibility to meet the individual needs.

The accelerating structure consists of several copper-based 50-cm long sections of internally corrugated tubes with 2-mm inner-diameter. These sections are coupled together using transition sections; which are also copper-based. The transition section has a main body diameter ranging from 2mm to 3.2mm and its length is about 14mm. Two sets of four orthogonal waveguides radiate from the central body. Beside their mechanical coupling function; these transition sections provide for periodic monitoring of the centering of the electron bunch; and for removal of unwanted higher-order EM modes. The fabrication of these transition sections is presented. The fabrication process is based on the use of a sacrificial fused silica glass mandrel; whose body corresponds to the inner volume of the copper element. This fused silica mandrel is subsequently electroplated. The micro-fabrication of a prototype of the transition section is underway. Modelling of various fabrication errors was undertaken to understand their effect and to determine tolerances. Source of machining imperfections are reviewed and their impact compared to the modelling results.; *A.

The corrugated waveguide with 2 mm inner diameter will be produced by electroplating copper on the aluminum mandrel as proposed in the reference*. A thin seed layer is usually applied to achieve uniform wetting to plate copper on the aluminum mandrel. The copper waveguide is retrieved by removing aluminum and the seed layer. Therefore; uniform copper plating and etching of the seed layer and the Aluminum mandrel is a crucial step to keep the surface free of impurities that are especially necessary for the RF application. Previous studies suggest that electroplated copper has variations in both electrical and mechanical properties compared with those of bulk copper from the batches of production. In this paper; we discuss the copper microstructure produced by the electroforming method and literature study on the variations; which can be attributed to the disparity of the crystallinity of grains structure in plated material.; *A.

medsi2020,,TUPC02,Bringing the Ground Up (When Is Two Less Than One?),A.A. Khan; C.A. Preissner; ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade project has employed the use of high heat load dual mirror systems in the new feature beamlines being built. Due to the shallow operating angles of the mirrors at a particular beamline; XPCS; the two mirrors needed to be approximately 2.5 m apart to create a distinct offset. Two separate mirror tanks are used for this system. However; it is unclear if the vibrational performance of these tanks would be better if they were both mounted on one large plinth or each mounted on a small plinth. Using accelerometers at the installation location; the floor vibrations were measured. The resulting frequency response function was then imported into a Finite Element Analysis software to generate a harmonic response analysis. The two different plinth schemes were modeled and the floor vibration was introduced as an excitation to the analysis. The relative pitch angle (THETA Y) between the mirrors was evaluated as well as the relative gap between the mirrors (XMAG). Results showed that a single plinth reduces the relative XMAG (RMS) compared to two plinths by approximately 25%. However; the relative THETA Y (RMS); which is arguably more critical; is significantly lower by approximately 99.7% in two plinths when compared to a single plinth. Therefore; it is more effective to use two separate plinths over a longer distance as opposed to a single longer granite plinth.,"Funding: Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility, operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupc02_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupc02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupc02_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPC02,182

Achieving high accelerating gradients in these devices requires the use of mm-wave RF structures which present a range of fabrication challenges due to their small size and tight dimensional tolerances. One promising technique for manufacturing these structures involves electroplating a mandrel with copper and subsequently dissolving the mandrel to leave behind the desired metal cavity. Because the resulting copper shell is electroplated; its purity; grain structure; and surface finish will be different from that of conventionally machined copper. Understanding the electrical and thermal performance of the electroformed components requires experimental measurement of the plated copper material properties. In this paper; an experiment for measuring the conductivity of electroplated copper at 170 GHz-200 GHz using a WR-5 waveguide meander is presented and the results are applied to the design of a corrugated waveguide wakefield accelerator.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,"Funding: This work is supported by LDRD funding from Argonne National Laboratory, provided by the Director, Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357",reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupc05_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupc05.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupc05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPC05,
medsi2020,,TUPC06,A Review of Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing for Particle Accelerator Applications,Enrico Fermi Institute; University of Chicago; Chicago; Illinois; USA; Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have been used for prototyping and production parts in many industries. However; due to process limitations and the unknown material properties of AM parts; there has been limited adoption of the technology in accelerator and light-source facilities. Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) is a hybrid additive-subtractive manufacturing process that uses a solid-state ultrasonic bonding mechanism attached to a CNC mill to join and machine metal parts in a layer-by-layer manner. The solid-state and hybrid nature of UAM ensures base material properties are retained and mitigates process limitations which traditionally inhibit integration of parts produced by other AM processes. This paper presents a review of the UAM process and its potential application to accelerator and beamline needs. Several specific areas are discussed including: replacement of traditional manufacturing approaches; such as explosion bonding to join dissimilar metals; improved internal cooling channel fabrication for thermal management; and imbedding of electronics and materials for more accurate remote sensing and radiation shielding.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/tupc06_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/tupc06.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/tupc06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-TUPC06,185

Many times; this involves iterating the design to address unknown or new variables which were not present at the beginning of the project planning task. Through the use of additive manufacturing; I have been able to support the user programs of various (APS) Advanced Photon Source beamlines* across multiple scientific disciplines. I will provide a few detailed examples of Items that were created for specific beamline applications and discuss what benefits they provided to the pertinent project. I will also talk about why choosing consumer-level printer options to produce the parts has been the direction I went and the pros and cons of this decision. Primarily; this choice allowed for quicker turnaround times and the ability to make more frequent changes in an efficient manner. Currently; we are utilizing only the fused deposition modeling (FDM) type printers but I am exploring the addition of UV-activated resin printing; exotic materials that can be utilized using the current toolset; and the possibility of commercial metal printing systems.

One of the most important components of the CSSI instrument at the 9-ID beamline of the APS-U; the Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirror system; will focus hard X-rays to a diffrac-tion-limited size of 500 nanometers at a working distance of 550 mm. High angular stability (19 nrad for the hori-zontal mirror and 14 nrad for the vertical mirror) is speci-fied no just for the focused beamsize but; more important-ly; to ensure the beam stability at the detector position that is up to 24 m from the K-B mirrors. A large sample-to-detector distance (up to 23 m); one of the beamline’s unique features for achieving a sufficient coherent-imaging spatial oversampling; requires sample angular stability of 50 nrad. In CSSI scattering geometry; the vertically placed sample reflects X-rays in the horizontal direction at an extremely shallow angle. The design in-cludes two high-precision rotary stages for sample pitch (vertical axis) and yaw (horizontal axis).

Since they demand only a smaller energy range (5 to 35 keV); the total gap stroke of the new instruments can be significantly reduced; creating an opportunity to adapt the existing design towards the so-called HD-DCM-Lite. Removing the large gap adjustment mechanism allows a reduction of the main inertia by a factor of 5; enabling the HD-DCM-Lite to deliver energy flyscans of hundreds of eV reaching 20 cycles per second while keeping fixed exit and the pitch stability in the range of 10 nrad RMS (1 Hz - 2.5 kHz).

This challenges the design of such systems since the introduction of thermal stresses may lead to optical surface deformation and beam degradation. Thus; to keep the systems within acceptable deformations some of the optical elements are cryogenically cooled. However; this poses the requirements of decoupling the thermal sinks (cryostats) from the optics and the mechanisms to maintain their desired degrees of freedom for alignment and dynamic operation.

The n-CT will take advantage of the APS-U source and provide new capabilities to the imaging program at 32-ID. A Kirkpatrick and Baez (KB) mirror-based nanofocusing optics [1; 2] will be implemented in this design. To meet the n-CT imaging goals; it is the desire to have sub 10 nanometer vibrational and thermal drift stability over 10-minute measurement durations between the optic and the sample. In addition to the stability requirements; it is desired to have a variable length sample projection axis of up to 450 mm. Such stability and motion requirements are challenging to accomplish simultaneously due to performance limitations of traditional motion mechanics and present a significant engineering challenge. To overcome these limitations; the proposed n-CT design incorporates granite air bearing concepts initially used in the Velociprobe [3]. These types of granite stages have been incorporated into many designs at APS [4] and at other synchrotron facilities [5].

Waveguides have garnered increasing interest due to their integral function in the transmission; amplification; and/or manipulation of electromagnetic waves. Waveguides operating in higher than conventional frequency ranges; e.g.; 30 to 300 GHz; are of particular interest given the scaling of gradient and shunt impedance with frequency. These higher frequencies necessitate features; such as corrugations; with significantly smaller dimensions. However; traditional manufacturing approaches are inadequate; in terms of manufacturing precision and cost; to meet these requirements - thus; novel fabrication strategies are required. Herein; an economic fabrication approach for electroforming high-purity 26 GHz cylindrical copper waveguides with internal corrugations is presented. A custom; low-additive electrolyte was employed to mitigate impurity inclusion within the copper electroform; ensuring high-purity copper waveguides. Pulse-modulated waveforms employed during copper electrodeposition selectively controlled ionic transport as well as the subsequent deposit morphology and thus facilitate complete copper filling of the corrugations.

A cold test of the ~2-inch copper waveguide using a vector network analyzer (VNA) was conducted.

medsi2020,,WEIO01,The Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS) Project,ESRF; Grenoble; France; The EBS project required the shutdown and dismantling of the existing storage ring; and the design; construction; and installation of a new synchrotron source in a limited period with minimal disruption to the ongoing user program. From 2015 to 2018; in addition to keeping the existing accelerator operational more than 1; 000 magnets; 900 m of vacuum chambers; and several thousand other components were designed; procured; and pre-assembled. On December 10; 2018; ESRF stopped the beam of the original accelerator for just 17 months to dismantle the existing accelerator; install and commission the new one; before the start of beamlines program at the end of August 2020. The EBS produced its first stored beam as scheduled; thanks to ESRF staff and international teams who have worked tirelessly to make this possible. One of the major challenges of this upgrade program was to replace these 32 cells; within the existing infrastructure; by new ones whose magnet density made engineering much more complicated. The new ring comprises over 10 000 components; each precision-aligned to within 50 microns over the storage ring length. The timing of different activities and the coordination of teams during all phases was another challenge; but the expertise; team spirit; commitment and responsiveness of teams and management to deal with unforeseen situations or technical problems greatly contributed to the success of the project. After such a project; several lessons are to be learned; first it is necessary to capitalize on all the positive aspects; then technical issues needs to be analyzed; in order to keep the knowledge and expertise. This presentation will cover the different phases of the project by highlighting the difficulties encountered and the lessons to be learned.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

Recently; LCLS has developed a new type of liquid jet; known as ""sheet""-jet; with tunable thickness from little over than 1µm to 20nm. This new type jet greatly reduces the x-ray absorbed by the liquid solutions; especially for soft x-ray and tender x-ray applications. In the first part of presentation; the author will describe the optimization processes of such jets using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool. The second part will describe the development of the liquid jet sample delivery system for chemRIXS in LCLS. The chemRIXS endstation has been designed in a way it can take both solid and liquid samples. Because solid sample experiments require a UHV environment; to be able to deliver the liquid sample jets to the same vacuum chamber; a special loadlock chamber and sample transport system have been developed to isolate the liquid system from the main vacuum chamber. When solid sample system is extracted; a fully automated system can then drive the liquid jet to the sample/beam interaction point. A recirculation catcher will collect the liquid waste; so the chamber can remain at high vacuum.",,Your browser cannot play the video. Consider download from Link Address.

The Technical Design Report is due to be completed by the end of 2022. A CAD integration model has been set up for the complete accelerator and photon science complex. It combines the contributions of all relevant trades; the accelerator components; supply infrastructure; installations; frames; tunnels and buildings; and the design of the campus. The CAD model structure is aligned with the project’s part breakdown structure (PBS) and the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to facilitate integration with systems engineering and reflect responsibility within the project organization. Within the model; it is possible to switch between different levels of detail for space allocation (DG1 - ""black box""); interface definition (DG2 - ""grey box"") and detailed design (DG3 - ""white box""); separating layout from design; while ensuring their consistency. Placement of accelerator components is directly governed by the lattice through direct access to spreadsheet data; allowing fast design changes after a lattice update and ensuring consistency between mechanical and lattice design. The resulting model will support the complete facility lifecycle; from layout and design to fabrication; installation and operation. The presentation explains the tasks and requirements of the CAD integration process and uses examples to explain the structure and the modeling methodology of the CAD integration model.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/weoa01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/weoa01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/weoa01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-WEOA01,215

The smaller size of magnets used for the present version of the SOLEIL upgrade allows a dramatic size and weight reduction of the magnet-girder assemblies. On the other hand; the number of magnets and girders has increased by a factor of 3; implying longer alignment and installation operations. Another constraint is due to the high compactness of the new lattice causing some limitations and access restrictions in the area between girders and tunnel wall. Several setups involving a number of girders from 116 to 212; various magnet layouts and binding systems have been studied. Dynamic and thermal performances have been evaluated by FEA analysis. This approach gives to accelerator physicists the performance of each solution; and thus a great versatility in the choice of the best setup in terms of dynamic and thermal stability.

This upgrade will have a significant impact on the existing front-ends. Due to the proven reliability and good concept; we plan a refurbishment strategy for all front-end (FE) components where possible. New source points for all beam-lines – resulting in shifts both lateral and tangential; newly developed insertion devices and bending magnets as well as spatial restrictions due to the multi bend achromat (MBA) design challenges this strategy. We demonstrate how we plan to deal with these challenges for the case of high heat load FEs. We will address how the acceptance of the FE was chosen due flux and power calculations of the insertion device and the design and thermal analysis of a novel primary aperture. The adaptions that will be made to the tungsten blade X-Ray beam positioning monitors (W-XBPM) and modifications on the photon shutter will be discussed.

The BioSAXS beamline will allow highly radiation sensitive samples to be studied at high flux. The beamline will offer increased efficiency; and data quality; for all liquid phase scattering experiments; allowing measurement of new and novel samples; and experiments; that otherwise would not be possible. The BioSAXS beamline will accommodate a wide range of experiments by offering a q-range of ~ 0.001 - 4 Å-1 and an optical design optimized for high flux (~5x1014 ph/s) x-rays. At this flux rate; BioSAXS will offer users one of the highest flux beamlines in the world. To achieve this; the beamline will use a superconducting undulator insertion device; double multilayer monochromator; and vertical and horizontal bending mirrors; providing flexibility in optical configurations. The beamline will primarily collect data in a fully unfocussed mode. BioSAXS will also be able to achieve a fully focused and a vertically focussed beam. This subsequent variation in the beam position at sample is accommodated through fully automated motion in 5 axes at the in-vacuum detector stage and 4 axes in the sample table. The design of these components allows smooth transition in camera lengths and improved signal to noise ratio.

A prototype will be assembled and tested at the BM05 beamline at ESRF; and another unit will be installed in the future BEATS beamline at SESAME. The application of the shutter in X-ray diffraction topography allows performance of long exposure cycles of monochromatic beam on crystal samples while preventing irradiation of the detector during readout. It can be also used during sample alignment and acquisition of X-ray tomography scans. Particularly for white-beam tomography; which uses a very high photon flux; minimizing exposure is critical to protect the sample and detector from radiation damage. This highlights the importance of obtaining a short and uniform exposure time over the beam aperture. To fulfill this objective; a new shutter based on the synchronization of two tantalum blades driven by linear brushless DC motors is under development. This versatile design can be used with both monochromatic and white-beam; and it can achieve exposure times ranging from 50 ms to 60 s for a beam size of H 80 mm x V 20 mm. The linear motors allow for a much smoother operation; preventing vibration issues reported with the old shutter. In addition; the use of linear motors rather than solenoids allows an unlimited exposure time; where the previous version used solenoids that could overheat if kept open for too long. A test bench has been constructed for the characterization of the sequence produced by the linear motors; and exposure times of 50 ms with a maximum error of 1 ms have been measured. This article describes the main features of the shutter prototype and its associated motion control system; and the results of the measurements with the motor test bench are discussed as well.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

To operate the facility at full performance; an upgrade of the radiation safety system is needed. For this purpose nine Frontends and three Shutters have to be modified. This upgrade includes several mechanical changes like the replacement of the B4C absorber with a diamond and B4C absorber. Since also a new burn through monitor with a graphite block inside has to be installed in the absorber chamber the holder of the B4C has to be changed because of the space constraints in the chamber. This holder consists also of a special flexure plate fixed with springs and screws to allow a certain flexibility of the B4C.

The beamline design is originally based on the monochromatic pencil beam XPBF 2.0 from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); at BESSY II already in use at this effect. MINERVA will host the necessary metrology equipment to integrate the stacks produced by the cosine company in a mirror module (MM) and characterize their optical performances. From the opto-mechanical point of view; the beamline is made up of three main subsystems. First of all; a water-cooled multilayer toroidal mirror based on a high precision mechanical goniometer; then a sample manipulator constituted by a combination of linear stages and in-vacuum hexapod and finally an X-ray detector which trajectory follows a cylinder of about 12 m radius away from the MM.

medsi2020,,WEPA13,Design of a High-Precision Lifting System for the HL-LHC Heavy Components in the Interaction Region,F. Micolon; M. Sosin; CERN; Meyrin; Switzerland; Given the high radiation level and the tight alignment tolerances; the HL-LHC interaction region components are designed to be realigned remotely using motorized supporting jacks; as human interventions in these zones must be limited to the strict minimum. A position adjustment system will allow a vertical and horizontal displacement of each jack support by at least ±2.5 mm with a resolution of less than 10 µm. The weight of the supported elements; up to 170 kN and transverse loads reaching 30 kN; will have to be remotely moved by means of mechanical actuators. The system will be exposed to a cumulated radiation dose of up to 2 MGy during the 15 years of lifetime. To comply with these requirements; an extensive de-sign effort has been initiated at CERN to study the possible system layouts. This includes the prototyping of various solutions; studying subsystems through dedicated test setups and using simulations to obtain a clear under-standing of the mechanical principles at play. This paper reports on the work undertaken to design the high-precision lifting system; the various mechanical analysis carried out; and their main outcome. It reviews the proposed solutions and their expected alignment performance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/wepa13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/wepa13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/wepa13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-WEPA13,255

The major part of these designs was at the end station where the necessity of customization is always much higher. The most relevant of these instruments was the beam conditioning elements table [1]. This accurate stage; which supports the diffractometer as well; includes the four movements required to align the components to the nominal beam as well as position the diffractometer. This design compacts; especially the vertical and pitch movements; both in a single stage; with a couple of stages for all four excursions. The solution maximise the stiffness and preserves at the same time the resolution close to 0.1µm while being able to withstand a half tone of payload. Thanks this compactness and performances this design concept; the vertical and pitch combined stage; was not only applied at XALOC for its diffractometer and detector table; but it has been widely adapted at several ALBA beamlines: at NCD-SWEET [2] as a detector table; a beam conditioning elements table [3] and sample table; at MSPD beamline as the KB table; at NOTOS beamline as metrology table; and also at the new ESA MINERVA beamline [4] for their sample mirror modules positioning. Beamlines have not been the only beneficiaries of this design; also different kind of instrumentation like an hall probe measuring bench [5]; and even a stitching platform for the ALBA optics laboratory [6].

The samples are carried by a standardized sample frame system developed in the EUCALL project (2015-2018; WP6 HIREP) and can be transferred without breaking the vacuum conditions of the interaction chamber. All electronic devices inside the chamber; where the high-power laser shot and the FEL’s X-ray pulses hit the sample; can be disconnected with 10 Hz. To ensure a continuous monitoring of the sample’s position; the role of the encoder is taken over by an interferometer with only optical components inside the chamber.

With this design; the new storage ring will require over 1320 new magnets that are being produced under build-to-print contracts to several vendors across the globe. Magnetic measurements are needed to characterize and fiducialize all these magnets to ensure field quality and alignment requirements are met. Seven specialized test benches were designed and built to meet the measurement requirements. These measurement benches may be classified into two groups. The first group is the field quality measurement that includes the strength of the main field and higher harmonics. The multipole magnets are measured using four rotating coil benches; whereas the longitudinal gradient dipoles are mapped using a Hall probe system. The second group is fiducialization that locates the magnetic center of the magnet using a rotating wire and relates it to magnet fiducials and reference surfaces using a laser tracker. This information accompanies each magnet through the module assembly and final installation in the ring to ensure that the magnet is aligned within the allowable tolerance. To date; about 65% of all magnets needed for the storage ring have been measured and fiducialized.

This includes actively controlled systems that need to be properly designed. The new Nano Active Stabilization System (NASS) for the ESRF beamline ID31 was designed with such an approach. We chose a multi-body design modelling approach for the development of the NASS end-station. Significance of such models depend strongly on its input and consideration of the right stiffness of the system’s components and subsystems. For that matter; we considered sub-components in the multi-body model as reduced order flexible bodies representing the component’s modal behaviour with reduced mass and stiffness matrices obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) models. These matrices were created from FEA models via modal reduction techniques; more specifically the component mode synthesis (CMS). This makes this design approach a combined multibody-FEA technique. We validated the technique with a test bench that confirmed the good modelling capabilities using reduced order flexible body models obtained from FEA for an amplified piezoelectric actuator (APA).,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/wepb08_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/wepb08.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/wepb08_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-WEPB08,286

It is important to design the optical and experimental equipment of a beamline in a way to minimize the effect of the vibrations. This project investigates the design of the detector stage in SESAME’s tomography beamline BEATS by using random vibration analysis to determine the rigidity of the structure. The design analysis of the detector stage takes the approach of using an existing installation at beamline ID28 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility by measuring the power spectrum density of the floor on which the structure is mounted on as well as the response of the structure stage as it is subjected to an excitation from ambient floor noise. A finite element analysis numerical model was established and validated against the experimental data. Once the model is validated within acceptable range; the technique will be applied to the BEATS detector stage design by applying the floor power spectrum density of the SESAME synchrotron and calculating the response of the structure. It is assumed that the random vibration process in this case follows a Gaussian normal distribution. The response power spectrum density Root Mean Square value at the location of interest should be at least 6 times less than the pixel size of the camera that will be used in detector. For the ID28 case; the model was validated by comparing the natural frequency measured and the experimental output RMS value against the model output RMS value. The model natural frequencies deviated from the experimental results by 4.53% and the model RMS values deviated from the experimental results by 1.91%.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/wepb09_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/wepb09.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/wepb09_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-WEPB09,

The beam conditioning units include a diamond vacuum window; an attenuator system; a fast shutter; a slit collimation system; two sets of compound refractive lenses; three X-ray beam intensity monitors; a beam viewer and a telescopic vacuum tube. The sample table has been optimized with respect to flexibility and load capacity; while retaining sub-micron resolution of motion and high stability performance. The nine metre long and one metre diameter evacuated flight tube contains a motorised detector trolley; enabling the sample-detector position for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to be easily adjusted under vacuum conditions. Finally; a two metre high and two metre wide granite gantry permits independent and easy movement of the tomography microscope and wide-angle X-ray (WAXS) detector in and out of the X-ray beam. To facilitate propagation-based phase-contrast imaging and mounting of bulky sample environments; the gantry is mounted on motorized floor rails. All these characteristics will allow to combine multiple complementary techniques sequentially in the same experiment with fast efficient switching between setups. The ForMAX endstation is presently in the design and construction phase; with commissioning expected to commence early 2022.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/wepb12_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/wepb12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/wepb12_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-WEPB12,289

It has been designed to allow for simultaneous multi-analytical X-ray techniques; including diffraction; spectroscopy; fluorescence and luminescence and imaging; both in 2D and 3D. Covering the energy range from 2.05 to 15 keV; the fully-coherent monochromatic beam size varies from 550 to 120 nm after the achromatic KB (Kirkpatrick-Baez) focusing optics; granting a flux of up to 1e11ph/s/100mA at the probe for high-throughput experiments with flyscans. In addition to the multiple techniques available at TARUMÃ; the large working distance of 440 mm after the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) KB system allows for another key aspect of this station; namely; a broad range of decoupled and independent sample environments. Indeed; exchangeable modular setups outside vacuum allow for in situ; in operando; cryogenic and/or in vivo experiments; covering research areas in biology; chemistry; physics; geophysics; agriculture; environment and energy; to name a few. An extensive systemic approach; heavily based on precision engineering concepts and predictive design; has been adopted for first-time-right development; effectively achieving altogether: the alignment and stability requirements of the large KB mirrors with respect to the beam and to the sample*; and the nanometer-level positioning; flyscan; tomographic and setup modularity requirements of the samples.

As part of this enhancement design; a new vacuum chamber geometry configuration has been implemented that balances the desired simultaneous x-ray measurement methods with accessibility and serviceability of the nanoprobe. The main enabling feature on the vacuum chamber is a slanted mid-level vacuum sealing plane. The new chamber design geometrically optimizes the ability to perform simultaneous diffraction; fluorescence and optical or laser pump probe measurements on the sample. A large diffraction door geometry is strategically placed near the sample for ease of access. The newly designed chamber can be readily serviced by removal of the upper chamber section; on which most larger instrument assemblies or beamline attachments are not interfaced.

An Investigation of Fluid Dynamics Effects on Cavitation Problems,ESEIAAT; Terrassa; Spain; J.J. Casas; C. Colldelram; M. Quispe; ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron; Cerdanyola del Vallès; Spain; Currently; the ALBA refrigeration system pumps present cavitation when operating at their nominal regime. To alleviate this phenomenon temporarily until a definitive solution was found; the water flow was reduced to 67% of its nominal value. As this flow exchanges heat with the cooling water produced in an external cogeneration plant; modifying the working point of the pumps resulted in a reduction of the Accelerator cooling capacity. However; even at such low flow conditions; the flow has an anomalous oscillatory behaviour in the distributor of the aspiration zone; implying that the cause may be in a bad dimensioning of the manifold. This paper presents a study of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applied to the aspiration zones of the pumps; to investigate the effects of fluid dynamics on cavitation problems and understand what may be happening in the system. The need for such research arises from the urge to recover the accelerator cooling capacity and the constant pursuit for the improvement of the system. The geometries for this study include the general manifold in the aspiration zone and a simplified model of the pump impeller. The simulations have been carried out with the ANSYS-FLUENT software. Studies performed include considering the total water flow in nominal and under current operating conditions. In addition; the cases in which the flow is distributed through the manifold tubes in uniform and non-uniform ways have been treated separately. Pressure and velocity fields are analysed for various turbulence models. Finally; conclusions and recommendations to the problem are presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/wepb16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/wepb16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/wepb16_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-WEPB16,299
medsi2020,,WEPB17,A Fast Simulation Tool to Calculate Spectral Power Density Emitted by Wigglers and Short Insertion Devices,J. Reyes-Herrera; M. Sanchez del Rio; ESRF; Grenoble; France; The analysis of thermal stress of beamline components requires a comprehensive determination of the absorbed power profile. Consequently; accurate calculations of beam power density and its dependency on the photon energy are required. There exist precise tools to perform these calculations for undulator sources; like several methods available in the OASYS toolbox* considering; for example; the contribution of the different harmonics of the undulator radiation or using ray-tracing algorithms**. This is not the case for wiggler sources; in particular for short insertion devices that are used as source for the bending magnet beamlines in some upgraded storage rings like the ESRF-EBS. Wiggler radiation is incoherent and although it is possible the use of undulator methods for calculating it; this is very inefficient. In this work; we describe a tool that performs fast calculations of spectral power density from a wiggler source. The emission is calculated starting from a tabulated magnetic field and computes the power spatial and spectral density. It uses concepts inspired from Tanaka’s work***. It is implemented in a user-friendly widget in OASYS and can be connected to widgets to calculate absorbed and transmitted power density along the beamline components. The accuracy of the method is verified by calculating three examples and comparing the results with ray-tracing. The three insertion devices simulated are: the EBS-ESRF-3PW; the ESRF W150 (a high power wiggler) and the 3PW for the BEATS project at the SESAME synchrotron source.; *L. Rebuffi; M.

medsi2020,,WEPC01,Robotic Sample Changer for Remote and Mail-In In Situ X-ray Scattering Experiments and Adjustable Beam Attenuation System,B.L. Monk; A.A. Yakovenko; ANL; Lemont; Illinois; USA; The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a highly increased need for remote beamline operations. Usually; in situ X-ray scattering experiments require significant onsite user and beamline staff presence; making them difficult and often impractical during limited operations. One of the major problems was the switching of capillary samples for in situ heating/cooling experiments. Therefore; we developed a specialized robotic system for changing samples utilizing easily accessible standardized parts and 3-D printing. The first version of this design is fully operational and has been installed at the 17-BM beamline. This system allows for changing between 14 capillary based samples by using three stepper motor based translational stages and pneumatic gripper. The destination can be intercrossed with hot or cold air blower stream; allowing users to remotely collect X-ray powder diffraction data from multiple samples at various temperatures. Currently; we are working on the development of a second robotic system; which will fit entirely onto one breadboard. This will allow us to move the system from one beamline to another if needed. The second piece of instrumentation we have developed is a remotely operated beam attenuation system with adjustable attenuation level. The system uses electric solenoids that push tantalum foils in and out of the beam. Five solenoids each hold different numbers of foils; and can be controlled independently; allowing for a total of 32 unique attenuation levels. A 6th solenoid holds a beamstop which can be used as a fast shutter. The control and communication is performed by an Arduino Yun microcontroller. All structural parts were 3-D printed; making for a cost-effective alternative to systems currently on the market.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/wepc01_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/wepc01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/wepc01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-WEPC01,

At the TARUMÃ station; the in-vacuum KB focusing system has been designed with a large working distance of 440 mm; allowing for a broad range of independent sample environments to be developed in open atmosphere to benefit from the spot size between 550 to 120 nm with a flux in the order of 1e11 ph/s/100mA.

The mini-XES uses cylindrical von Hamos geometry tuned for Fe K-edge and uses a Pilatus 100 K area detector from Dectris**. It is based on a general design implemented at the APS***. The mini-XES design was developed to be as simple to fabricate and as easy to operate as possible. We tried to minimize the number of components; so there are only two main parts that create a chamber. Those two components are joined and aligned by a NW-80 flange. From the beginning; the design was trying to achieve no tools assembly; alignment; and operation. For lower precision alignment we decided to use the centering ring of the NW-80 flange which; together with two posts integrated with the chamber; provides an adequate method for joining the two parts of the enclosure. We use level vials for horizontal adjustment of the holder for the 10 crystals. For high precision alignment of the holder of the crystal; we used the Thorlab KC1/M kinematic mount; which had the adjustment screws accessible from outside of the chamber. The fabrication was done in-house using uPrint SE Plus 3D Printer****. The first tests of the spectrometer were completed in the Brockhouse wiggler beamline and were successful. Future improvements will aim to reduce the background scatter and better position the detector; to improve the fill. Now that the relatively inexpensive design was tested and tried; there is an option to upgrade it to 3D printed tungsten or steel version that would intrinsically provide the required shielding.; * B.

The thermal deformation of these x-ray optics due to heat loads of the x-ray beam has been previously shown to be able to be partially mitigated by adding a groove or notch on the side of the optic and below the optical surface. This notch acts as a thermal break which allows for anti-clastic bending and the notch geometry can be optimized for various heat loads. By optimizing the notch height; depth; and distance from the optical surface the thermal deformation on the optic can be minimized.

Indeed; surface specifications for height errors of X-ray mirrors are often within a few nanometers. To deal with these thermal management challenges; thermo-mechanical designs based on cryogenic silicon have been developed; taking advantage of its high thermal conductance and low thermal expansion in temperatures of about 125 K. A liquid nitrogen (LN2) cryostat connected to the optics by copper braids has been used to handle moderate power loads; reducing costs when compared to closed-circuit LN2 cryocoolers and mechanically decoupling flow-induced vibrations from the optics. To guarantee the functionality of such systems; lumped mass thermal models were implemented together with auxiliary finite elements analyses. With the first systems in operation; it has been possible to compare and validate the developed models; and to carry out optimizations to improve them for future projects; by adjusting parameters such as emissivity; thermal contact resistance; and copper braid conductance.

The new instrument expands SMI’s beamline scientific capabilities via the addition of X-ray scattering techniques from liquid surfaces and interfaces. The design of this new instrument; located inside the 12-ID beamline shielding enclosure (hutch B); is based on a single Ge (111) crystal deflector; which bounces the incident x-ray beam downward towards a liquid sample which must be maintained in a horizontal orientation (gravity-driven consideration). The OPLS instrument has a variable deflector-to-sample distance ranging from 0.6 m to 1.5 m. X-ray detectors are mounted on a 2-theta scattering arm located downstream of the sample location. The 2-theta arm is designed to hold up to three X-ray detectors; with fixed 2-theta angular offsets; each dedicated to a different X-ray technique such as X-ray reflectivity; grazing-incidence X-ray scattering; and small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. Currently; the OPLS experimental station intercepts the SMI beam that otherwise propagates to the experimental endstation located in hutch C and can be retracted to a ’parking’ position laterally out of this beam to allow installation of a removable beam pipe that is needed to support operations in hutch C. The design of OPLS is flexible enough to quickly adapt to a planned future configuration of the SMI beamline in which a OPLS is illuminated separately from the main SMI branch via a second; canted undulator source and a separate photon delivery system.

A moveable flight path will be supported by the diffractometer arm and a mobile floor support to mini-mize air scattering while using the LDDP.

medsi2020,,THIO01,Design of Next Generation Beam Line Equipment by Applying Advanced Mechatronic Principles,MI-Partners; Eindhoven; The Netherlands; Next generation experiments clearly require beamline equipment with fast and accurate positioning of samples and ultra-stable positioning of optics. Going from the classical quasi-static positioning (point to point) to scanning applications requires a different kind of equipment. The approach to design quasi-static equipment versus scanning equipment with high dynamic performance is very different as well. The shift required in such design approach takes a significant amount of time as it involves new technologies and design experience; to fulfill the high-end requirements finally with sufficient reliability. A market segment; where ultra-precision manufacturing equipment is already required for several decades; is the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Starting with high-end mechatronic equipment in the 90’s; involvement of mechatronics in this area increased very rapidly over the last years. Extremely high precision; with ultra-fast and reliable equipment to fulfill the throughput demands pushes mechatronic developments. Nowadays this equipment requires stages moving at velocities of several m/s; with several tens of m/s2 of accelerations while reaching nm positioning accuracy. Besides extreme reliability to achieve the targets of 100% uptime during 24/7 production; throughput is a driving parameter. Over the years; design principles have been developed to reach these extreme performances. These strategies and principles can also be used for the design next generation beam line equipment. This paper will address some of the principles and how they are applied in a double crystal monochromator at Brazilian light source (LNLS).,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/thio01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/thio01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/thio01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-THIO01,

We investigate the effect of the EM heating due to the high repetition rate electron bunches traveling through a corrugated tube with 1-mm-inner-radius. The steady-state thermal analysis is coupled with computational fluid dynamics; and structural mechanics to determine the thermal effect on the operating conditions of CWA. It could carry a 10 nC drive bunch through the center of corrugated structure that generates a field gradient 100 Mv/m at 180 GHz; accelerating a trailing 0.3 nC witness bunch to 5 GeV. The wakefield produced by the traveling bunches can deposit about 600 W to 3000 W of energy on the inner wall of the device. Also; the instabilities in e-beam trajectories caused by thermal expansion; and the resulting stresses associated high-frequency repetition rate of 10 kHz to 50 kHz are the main concern for the waveguide. Tensile-yield failure due to moderate heating on the surface of the <200 micrometer wide trough regions of the corrugated tube may lead to arcing and loss of the wakefield.,"Funding: This work supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from Argonne, provided by the Director, Office of Science, of the U.S. DOE under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/thio02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/thio02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/thio02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-THIO02,336

As part of this upgrade a total of 15 beamlines were selected to be enhanced to take advantage of the new source ’ these are designated as ’Enhanced Beamlines’. Among these is the enhancement to 2-ID; which includes an upgrade and move of the existing Bionanoprobe (BNP) from 9-ID [1]. This instrument will become the second generation Bionanoprobe II (BNP-II) with intent of studying cryogenic samples with sub-10 nm resolution. This upgrade requires a high performing metrology configuration and design to achieve the desired spatial resolution while adapting to the various constraints of the instrument. The cryogenic sample environment and detection constraints offer significant challenges for implementing a metrology scheme.

During 2020; the first experimental stations were aligned and had the first beam successfully at the sample. The reference network of points used for the storage ring alignment was connected to an external network located in the experimental hall. Following this step; it was possible to extend these references to the hutches environment; where the beamlines components are installed. During the alignment of the first beamlines; a sequence of common tasks was performed; from the bluelining of the hutches footprints; to the components fine alignment. The position and orientation deviation of the main components will be presented for the Manacá; Cateretê; Ema; and Carnaúba beamlines. Two specific measurement strategies used for aligning special components will also be presented: (1) an indirect fiducialization procedure developed for most of the mirrors and their mechanisms using a mix of coordinate measuring machine and articulated measuring arm measurements; and (2) a multi-station setup arranged for the alignment of a 30 meters long detector carriage; using a mix of laser tracker; physical artifacts; and a rotary laser alignment system used as a straightness reference.,,Your browser cannot play the video.

medsi2020,,THOB01,Thermal Contact Conductance in a Typical Silicon Crystal Assembly Found in Particle Accelerators,DLS; Oxfordshire; United Kingdom; Every mirror at Diamond Light Source (the UK’s Particle Accelerator) has been installed with the premise of clamping the cooling copper manifolds as lightly as possible to minimize distortion. The problem with this approach is that the Thermal Contact Conductance (TCC) depends on the applied pressure among other factors*. The assembly is usually a symmetric stack of Copper - Indium Foil - Silicon Crystal - Indium Foil - Copper. Variables that interest the most are those that are easily adjustable in the set-up assembly (number of clamps; pressure applied and cooling water flow rate) PT100 temperature sensors have been used along the surface of the crystal and along the surface of the copper manifolds. Custom PCB units have been created for this project to act as a mean of collecting data and Matlab has been used to plot the temperature measurements vs. time. Another challenge is the creation of an accurate model in Ansys that matches reality up to a good compromise where the data that is being recorded from the sensors matches Ansys results within reason.; *Gilmore DG.

It is designed to provide users high intensity X-ray beam with 27000 pulses/s repetition rate in the photon energy range from 0.5 to 25 keV*. In the beam transport system; the optic components which have direct contact with the beam; e.g. mirror; absorber and beam shutter; etc.; could get up to 10 kW heat load on a sub-mm spot in 0.6 ms. Therefore; the thermo-mechanical performance of these optic components is playing an important role in the safety operation of the facility; restricting the maximum allowed beam power delivered to each experiment station. In this contribution; using finite element simulation tools; a parametric study about coupled thermo-mechanical behavior of some general used materials; e.g. CVD diamond; B4C; silicon; etc. is presented. Based on the design of several devices which are already in operation at European XFEL**; an initial damage threshold for these materials is established; with respect to the corresponding beam parameters. Furthermore; the relevant analytical and numerical solutions are discussed and compared; taking the material and geometrical nonlinearities into account.

This PETRA IV project involves an optimization of the girder magnet assemblies to reduce the impact of ambient vibrations on the particle beam. For this purpose; an innovative and biologically inspired girder structure has been developed. Beforehand; a large parametric study analyzed the impact of different loading and boundary conditions on the eigenfrequencies of a magnet-girder assembly. Subsequently; the girder design process was generated; which combined topology optimizations with biologically inspired structures (e.g.; complex Voronoi combs; hierarchical structures; and smooth connections) and cross section optimizations using genetic algorithms to obtain a girder magnet assembly with high eigenfrequencies; a high stiffness; and reduced weight. The girder was successfully manufactured from gray cast iron and first vibration experiments have been conducted to validate the simulations.,"Funding: Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), a research centre of the Helmholtz Association - Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/talks/thob03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/papers/thob03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/medsi2020/posters/thob03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-MEDSI2020-THOB03,360
