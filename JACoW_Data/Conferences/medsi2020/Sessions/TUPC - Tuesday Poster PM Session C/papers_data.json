        "Fabrication of the corrugated structure that generates a field gradient 100 m-1 at 180 GHz is challenging and required an unconventional method of production. The corrugated waveguide with 2 mm inner diameter will be produced by electroplating copper on the aluminum mandrel as proposed in the reference*. A thin seed layer is usually applied to achieve uniform wetting to plate copper on the aluminum mandrel. The copper waveguide is retrieved by removing aluminum and the seed layer. Therefore",
        "uniform copper plating and etching of the seed layer and the Aluminum mandrel is a crucial step to keep the surface free of impurities that are especially necessary for the RF application. Previous studies suggest that electroplated copper has variations in both electrical and mechanical properties compared with those of bulk copper from the batches of production. In this paper",
        "we discuss the copper microstructure produced by the electroforming method and literature study on the variations",
        "which can be attributed to the disparity of the crystallinity of grains structure in plated material.",

        "the floor vibrations were measured. The resulting frequency response function was then imported into a Finite Element Analysis software to generate a harmonic response analysis. The two different plinth schemes were modeled and the floor vibration was introduced as an excitation to the analysis. The relative pitch angle (THETA Y) between the mirrors was evaluated as well as the relative gap between the mirrors (XMAG). Results showed that a single plinth reduces the relative XMAG (RMS) compared to two plinths by approximately 25%. However",
        "the relative THETA Y (RMS)",

        "due to process limitations and the unknown material properties of AM parts",
        "there has been limited adoption of the technology in accelerator and light-source facilities. Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) is a hybrid additive-subtractive manufacturing process that uses a solid-state ultrasonic bonding mechanism attached to a CNC mill to join and machine metal parts in a layer-by-layer manner. The solid-state and hybrid nature of UAM ensures base material properties are retained and mitigates process limitations which traditionally inhibit integration of parts produced by other AM processes. This paper presents a review of the UAM process and its potential application to accelerator and beamline needs. Several specific areas are discussed including: replacement of traditional manufacturing approaches",
        "such as explosion bonding to join dissimilar metals; improved internal cooling channel fabrication for thermal management; and imbedding of electronics and materials for more accurate remote sensing and radiation shielding."

        "The low emittance and high photon flux beam present at the 4th-generation Sirius synchrotron light source beamlines result in high energy densities and high heat loads at some specific X-ray optics such as monochromators and white beam mirrors. This challenges the design of such systems since the introduction of thermal stresses may lead to optical surface deformation and beam degradation. Thus",
        "to keep the systems within acceptable deformations some of the optical elements are cryogenically cooled. However",
        "this poses the requirements of decoupling the thermal sinks (cryostats) from the optics and the mechanisms to maintain their desired degrees of freedom for alignment and dynamic operation. In this context we present the development of low-stiffness copper-braid-based heat conductors",
        "summarizing the motivation and main aspects regarding their fabrication and application at the beamlines."

        "A new nano-computed tomography projection microscope (n-CT) is being designed as part the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) beamline enhancement at sector 32-ID. The n-CT will take advantage of the APS-U source and provide new capabilities to the imaging program at 32-ID. A Kirkpatrick and Baez (KB) mirror-based nanofocusing optics [1",
        "2] will be implemented in this design. To meet the n-CT imaging goals",
        "it is the desire to have sub 10 nanometer vibrational and thermal drift stability over 10-minute measurement durations between the optic and the sample. In addition to the stability requirements",
        "it is desired to have a variable length sample projection axis of up to 450 mm. Such stability and motion requirements are challenging to accomplish simultaneously due to performance limitations of traditional motion mechanics and present a significant engineering challenge. To overcome these limitations",
        "the proposed n-CT design incorporates granite air bearing concepts initially used in the Velociprobe [3]. These types of granite stages have been incorporated into many designs at APS [4] and at other synchrotron facilities [5]. Utilizing the granite air bearing concept",
        "in tandem with other design aspects in the instrument",
        "the requirements become reachable. A novel multi-degree of freedom wedge configuration is also incorporated to overcome space limitations. The design of this instrument is described in this paper."

The results of the S-parameter measurements and the bead-pull test indicate reasonable agreement with the design by CST simulation",
