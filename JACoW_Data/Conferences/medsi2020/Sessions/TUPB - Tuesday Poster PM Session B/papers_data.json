In order to keep vibrations on a as low as possible level one must not only take extremely care in the design of all components but also have a profound knowledge of the sources of vibrations. We started a project to map the vibrations at PETRA III both locally and timely in order to get a better understanding of the influencing factors and possible consequences for the ongoing PETRA IV project. In this contribution we will report on our first results of this project.",

On the macro scale it has been harnessed to develop smart structures that use resonance and its subsequently high Q to accurately determine positioning and preloads on assemblies. These structures can be machined into support assemblies to ensure consistency in the results they produce as they are integral and never removed. This ensures the data they give is directly comparable pre and post service. The high Q they offer promises new levels of accuracy in assembly and a potential for an audit trail. The other application this work describes is the use of vibration to generate acoustic levitation for room temperature and time resolved sample delivery encompassing the micro",
        "nano and pico regimes. Our methodology moves away from traditional Langevin horn cavities used by previous workers for levitation experiments to low power tractor beam ones specifically designed for light source applications. This has been complimented with the exciting technology of Poly Pico who can use acoustics to eject sample droplets in the order of 10 picolitres and at a rate of 50 kHz and on demand. These two technologies compliment each other beautifully for mixing experiments facilitating ’watching’ reactions taking place within a protein. Finally work describing how TEM grids can be filled for CryoEM using the Polypico technology and electro-steering to remove the need for any moving parts delivering discrete sample aliquots and at kHz time scales with micron accuracy.",

        "corrugated wakefield accelerating (CWA) structure is being designed to facilitate sub-terahertz Cerenkov radiation produced by an electron bunch propagating in a waveguided structure comprising accelerating sections and transition sections*. The accelerating structure consists of several copper-based 50-cm long sections of internally corrugated tubes with 2-mm inner-diameter. These sections are coupled together using transition sections",
        "which are also copper-based. The transition section has a main body diameter ranging from 2mm to 3.2mm and its length is about 14mm. Two sets of four orthogonal waveguides radiate from the central body. Beside their mechanical coupling function",
        "these transition sections provide for periodic monitoring of the centering of the electron bunch",

The micro-fabrication of a prototype of the transition section is underway. Modelling of various fabrication errors was undertaken to understand their effect and to determine tolerances.
