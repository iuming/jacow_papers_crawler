cool2017,,MOA12,The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment,"Imperial College of Science and Technology; Department of Physics; London; United Kingdom; The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is designed to demonstrate a measurable reduction in muon beam emittance due to ionization cooling. This demonstration will be an important step in establishing the feasibility of muon accelerators for particle physics. The emittance of a variety of muon beams is measured before and after a ""cooling cell""; allowing the change in the phase-space distribution due to the presence of an absorber to be measured. Two solenoid spectrometers are instrumented with high-precision scintillating-fibre tracking detectors (Trackers) before and after the cooling cell which measure the normalized emittance reduction. Data has been taken since the end of 2015 to study several beams of varying momentum and input emittance as well as three absorber materials in the cooling cell; over a range of optics. The experiment and an overview of the analyses are described here.",,Slides MOA12 [23.988 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/talks/moa12_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/papers/moa12.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/posters/moa12_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2017-MOA12,1
cool2017,,MOA13,Measurement of Phase Space Density Evolution in MICE,DPNC; Genève; Switzerland; Belgrade Institute of Physics; Belgrade; Serbia; The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) collaboration will demonstrate the feasibility of ionization cooling; the technique proposed for a future muon storage ring or collider. The muon beam parameters are measured particle-by-particle; before and after a cooling cell; using high precision scintillating-fibre trackers in a solenoidal field. The position and momentum reconstruction of individual muons in MICE allows for the development of several alternative figures of merit in addition to beam emittance. Contraction of the phase-space volume occupied by the sample; or equivalently the increase in phase-space density at its core; is an unequivocal cooling signature. Single-particle amplitude; defined as a weighted distance to the sample centroid; can be used to probe the change in the density in the core of the beam. Alternatively; non-parametric statistics provides reliable methods to estimate the entire phase-space density distribution and reconstruct probability contours. The aforementioned techniques are robust to transmission losses and sample non-linearities; making them ideal candidates to perform a cooling measurement in MICE. Preliminary results are presented here.,,"D. M. Maleticpresenter Submitted by the MICE speakers bureau.

cool2017,,MOA21,Emittance Evolution in MICE,Imperial College of Science and Technology; Department of Physics; London; United Kingdom; The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) was designed to demonstrate a measurable reduction in beam emittance due to ionization cooling. The emittance of a variety of muon beams was reconstructed before and after a 'cooling cell'; allowing the change in the phase-space distribution due to the presence of an absorber to be measured. The core of the MICE experiment is a cooling cell that can contain a range of solid and cryogenic absorbers inside a focussing solenoid magnet. For the data described here; a single lithium hydride (LiH) absorber was installed and two different emittance beam have been analysed. Distributions that demonstrate emittance increase and equilibrium have been reconstructed; in agreement with theoretical predictions. Data taken during 2016 and 2017 is currently being analysed to evaluate the change in emittance with a range of absorber materials; different initial emittance beams and various magnetic lattice settings. The current status and the most recent results of these analyses is presented.,,"Submitted by the MICE speakers bureau.

Moreover; the fluorescence emitted from the ions due to deexcitation of the laser-excited cooling transition can serve as a powerful tool for atomic physics; e.g. for spectroscopy of fast transitions in highly charged ions; but also as a versatile diagnostic that can be seen as complimentary to standard; charge-based diagnostic techniques.

The planned luminosity in these experiments is 1027cm-2c{-1}. This value can be obtained with help of very short bunches with small transverse size. This beam quality can be realized with electron and stochastic cooling at energy of the physics experiment. The subject of the report is the problem of the technical feasibility of fast electron cooling for collider in the energy range between 0.2 and 2.5 MeV. For the realization of the cooler device BINP team proposes the design that is like to COSY cooler. The main features of this design are the accelerating tube immersed in the magnetic field along the whole length and the strong magnetic field in the cooling section. The physics of electron cooling is based on the idea of the fast magnetized cooling when the ion interacts with Larmour circle and the cooling decrements are improved significantly. The cooling force at strong magnet field was measured at many experiments and can be surely estimated.,,Slides TUM21 [50.456 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/talks/tum21_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/papers/tum21.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/posters/tum21_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2017-TUM21,25
cool2017,,TUM22,Model Development for the Automated Setup of the 2 MeV Electron Cooler Transport Channel,A.J. Halama; V. Kamerdzhiev; FZJ; Jülich; Germany; The 2 MeV electron cooler allows for cooling the proton and deuteron beams in the entire energy range of COSY and thereby study magnetized high energy electron cooling for the HESR and NICA. Manual electron beam adjustment in the high energy; high current regime proves a cumbersome and time consuming task. Special difficulties are presented by the particular geometry of the e-beam transport channel; limited beam diagnostics and general technical limitations. A model has been developed to track electrons through the transport channel of the cooler. This allows the offline study of response schemes around any particular setting of the cooler. It is envisaged to control linear; dipole and quadrupole behavior of the e-beam. Application of the model will result in optimized e-beam transport settings for a lossless and cool beam transport. This will improve cooling and recuperation efficiency and allow quick adjustment of the e-beam to the various operational modes of the machine. A good relative agreement of the model and the cooler could be shown. Main focus lies now in overhauling the software and finding suitable initial conditions to improve the agreement to an absolute degree.,,Slides TUM22 [3.784 MB] reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/talks/tum22_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/papers/tum22.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/posters/tum22_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2017-TUM22,28

cool2017,,WEM11,Status of Bunched Beam Electron Cooler LEReC,BNL; Upton; Long Island; New York; USA; The Low Energy RHIC electron Cooler (LEReC) system is presently under construction and commissioning at BNL. Although required energies of electron beam (few MeV) are not very high; an approach based on RF acceleration of electron beams was chosen. Required electron beam and its acceleration will be provided by the photoemission electron gun and the RF linear accelerator. As a result; cooling will be accomplished by using bunched electron beams produced by high-brightness high-current electron linear accelerator. Here; we describe design aspects and challenges of such an approach; as well as summarize status of the LEReC project.

This luminosity relies on ion cooling in both the booster and the storage ring of the accelerator complex. The cooling in the booster will use a conventional DC cooler similar to the one at COSY. The high-energy storage ring; operating at a momentum of up to 100 GeV/nucleon; requires the novel use of bunched-beam cooling. There are two designs for such a bunched beam cooler. The first uses a conventional Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) with a magnetized beam while the second uses a circulating ring to enhance both the peak and average current experienced by the ion beam.

Vacuum chambers and ion optics are cooled to well below 10 K by a closed-cycle He system. Rest gas densities down to a room-temperature equivalent pressure of <10-14 mbar and 1/e ion-beam lifetimes up to ~45 min were observed*. With rotationally cold diatomic ions; photodissociation Feshbach resonances of CH+ (J=0; 1; 2) were reported**. By time-dependent laser photodetachment; free-space radiative lifetimes of OH− ions (J=1; 2) up to ~190 s were measured***. An electron cooling device with a cryogenic (high-temperature superconducting) magnet and beam-merging system was taken into operation with an electron beam of ~40 eV from the TSR GaAs photocathode system****. It was applied to perform bunched-beam electron cooling of 1200 keV F(6+) ions. Future research will be devoted to interaction studies between stored atomic; molecular and cluster ions and laser; electron and neutral particle beams. Electron-beam studies (meV relative energies) will focus on dissociative recombination and state-changing collisions of molecular ions.; *R. von Hahn et al.; Rev. Sci. Instr. 87; 063115 (2016)  **A.

By taking a new approach of extracting the subtle modulation signal induced by an ion; the one turn start-to-end simulation is substantially improved. Consequently; the initial beam distribution as generated from up-stream beam dynamics simulation as well as realistic beam optics are used to generate cooling force for a single pass of the cooling section. The single-pass cooling force is then applied to a separate hadron beam simulation code to predict the evolution of the hadron beam under the influences of cooling and intra-beam scattering (IBS).

cool2017,,THM11,Systematic Measurements with Electron Cooled Bunched Heavy Ion Beams,R. Hess; C. Dimopoulou; M. Steck; GSI; Darmstadt; Germany; The results of systematic studies with electron-cooled bunched beams of highly charged ions at the Experimental Storage Ring ESR at GSI Helmholtzzentrum GmbH; Darmstadt are presented. The series of experiments were conducted during the beamtime block in 2016 for different ion species as well as ion beam energies. In these measurements; we recorded all three beam phase space planes simultaneously with high resolution; using a recently installed fast current transformer (to measure the bunch length; hence deduce the momentum spread) and ionization profile monitors (to measure horizontal and vertical emittances).

cool2017,,THM14,Overview of US Electron-ion Collider Project and its Beam Cooling Programs,JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; Electron-Ion collider (EIC) utilizes deep-inelastic scatterings to probe structures of nucleus. HERA; the only e-p collider ever built and operated; ended its science program in 2007. Over the past 15 years; 7 next generation EICs were envisioned worldwide for high energy and nuclear physics. In the US; two electron-ion colliders; eRHIC and JLEIC; have been proposed in BNL and JLab respectively. The US EIC designs were guided by the science program (EIC White Paper). The US NSAC Long Range Plan (2015) recommended EIC as the next major facility in US for QCD frontier. If approved by DOE; construction will likely be completed around 2025. Cooling of proton/ion beams is essential for eRHIC and JLEIC to reach luminosity above 1034/cm2/s. It enables emittance reduction up to an order of magnitude in all dimensions. eRHIC adopts the novel Coherent-electron-Cooling (CeC) concept. JLEIC has chosen magnetized electron cooling for the baseline; utilizing a multi-stage cooling scheme. Both CeC and high energy magnetized EC are under active development: BNL plans to conduct a proof-of-principle test of CeC at RHIC next year; JLab focuses on a technical design and technology development for a high energy bunched beam electron cooler based on ERL and circulator ring.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,Slides THM14 [35.872 MB] reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/talks/thm14_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/papers/thm14.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/posters/thm14_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2017-THM14,

The first and general goal of the project is experimental study of both hot and dense baryonic matter to search for so-called Mixed Phase formation in collisions of heavy relativistic ions. The second goal is spin physics (in collisions of polarized protons and deuterons). The project NICA is developed in three stages. 1st stage; ""The Baryonic Matter at Nuclotron""; is a fixed target experiment with ions accelerated in the linac and two SC synchrotrons - the Booster and the Nuclotron up to kinetic energy of 4.5 GeV/u (the Centre mass system energy ECMS up to 3.45 GeV/u). The Booster has an electron cooler of the electron energy up to 50 keV. The 2nd stage extends the ECMS from 4 to 11 GeV/u in colliding beams' mode. The Collider will be equipped with both stochastic cooling system and double electron one of electron energy of 0.5 - 2.5 MeV; which are being designed and manufactured at the Budker INP. Stage III - Polarized Beams Mode of The Collider is at the level of the conceptual design.

cool2017,,THM22,Status of the FAIR Project,GSI; Darmstadt; Germany; The FAIR international particle accelerator is set to be one of the largest research facilities in the world. Based in the German city of Darmstadt (in the state of Hesse); the complex will cover an area of 20 hectares and require 600; 000 cubic metres of concrete as well as 65; 000 tons of steel. Construction teams will be building a tunnel to house the heart of the complex; a ring accelerator with a circumference of 1.1 kilometres. The 24 buildings and tunnel sections provide 62; 000 square metres of usable space and sufficient room for a total of 3.5 kilometres of beam control tubes as well as huge detectors and a complex technical infrastructure. The construction project is split into several modules. The first module concentrates on constructing the large accelerator ring (SIS 100) along with two smaller accelerator and storage rings; as well as a linear accelerator for protons (p-Linac). Another large accelerator ring; SIS 300; will be installed in the tunnel at a later stage. Space has also been allocated on the site for three further experimental and storage rings; also to be installed at a later date.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,Slides THM22 [3.874 MB] reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/talks/thm22_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/papers/thm22.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/cool2017/posters/thm22_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-COOL2017-THM22,

Meanwhile two pickups (PU) and one kicker (KI) are fabricated. One PU and one KI are installed into the COSY ring for testing the new stochastic cooling system with real beam at various momenta. Small test-structures were already successfully operated at the Nuclotron in Dubna for longitudinal filter cooling but not for transverse cooling and as small PU in COSY. During the last COSY beam-time in 2017 additional transverse and ToF cooling were achieved. The first two series high power amplifiers were used for cooling and to test the temperature behavior of the combiner-boards at the KI. The system layout includes all components as planned for the HESR like low noise amplifier; switchable delay-lines and optical notch-filter. The HESR needs fast transmission-lines between PU and KI.

During four days of commissioning; three-dimensional cooling could be observed. Both the time-of-flight and the notch filter methods were used for longitudinal cooling. The measured cooling rates are presented. In the end of December 2015; the project HIAF'High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility was approved by the Chinese government. The project will be started to construct in 2018. Stochastic cooling will be built at the spectrometer ring (SRing) mainly for experiments with radioactive fragment beams with a large phase space; which is very similar to CSRe. After the stochastic pre-cooling; the subsequent electron cooling will further cool down the emittance and Dp/p to get extremely well-cooled beams.
