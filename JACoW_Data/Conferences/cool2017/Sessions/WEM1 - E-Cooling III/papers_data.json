        "The Low Energy RHIC electron Cooler (LEReC) system is presently under construction and commissioning at BNL. Although required energies of electron beam (few MeV) are not very high",
        "an approach based on RF acceleration of electron beams was chosen. Required electron beam and its acceleration will be provided by the photoemission electron gun and the RF linear accelerator. As a result",
        "cooling will be accomplished by using bunched electron beams produced by high-brightness high-current electron linear accelerator. Here",
        "we describe design aspects and challenges of such an approach",
        "as well as summarize status of the LEReC project. First commissioning results of the LEReC injector are also presented.",

This luminosity relies on ion cooling in both the booster and the storage ring of the accelerator complex. The cooling in the booster will use a conventional DC cooler similar to the one at COSY. The high-energy storage ring",

        "requires the novel use of bunched-beam cooling. There are two designs for such a bunched beam cooler. The first uses a conventional Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) with a magnetized beam while the second uses a circulating ring to enhance both the peak and average current experienced by the ion beam. This presentation will describe the design of both the Circulator Cooling Ring (CCR) design and that of the backup option using the stand-alone ERL operated at lower charge but higher repetition rate than the ERL injector required by the CCR-based design."
