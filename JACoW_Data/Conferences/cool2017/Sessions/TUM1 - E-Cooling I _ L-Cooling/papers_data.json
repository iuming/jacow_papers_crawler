        "Laser cooling has proven to be a viable technique for reducing the longitudinal phase space volume of bunched ion beams up to relativistic energies. Moreover",

In this presentation we will discuss how to design laser cooling setups for future high energy ion beam facilities such as FAIR and HIAF with special emphasis on the laser ion beam interaction and the resulting demands on laser systems used for reliable",
