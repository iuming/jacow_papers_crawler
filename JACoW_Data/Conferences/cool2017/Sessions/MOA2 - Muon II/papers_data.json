        "The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) was designed to demonstrate a measurable reduction in beam emittance due to ionization cooling. The emittance of a variety of muon beams was reconstructed before and after a 'cooling cell'",
        "allowing the change in the phase-space distribution due to the presence of an absorber to be measured. The core of the MICE experiment is a cooling cell that can contain a range of solid and cryogenic absorbers inside a focussing solenoid magnet. For the data described here",
        "a single lithium hydride (LiH) absorber was installed and two different emittance beam have been analysed. Distributions that demonstrate emittance increase and equilibrium have been reconstructed",
        "in agreement with theoretical predictions. Data taken during 2016 and 2017 is currently being analysed to evaluate the change in emittance with a range of absorber materials",
        "different initial emittance beams and various magnetic lattice settings. The current status and the most recent results of these analyses is presented."
