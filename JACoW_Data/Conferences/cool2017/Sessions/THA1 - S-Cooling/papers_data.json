        "The construction phase of the stochastic cooling tanks for the HESR has started. Meanwhile two pickups (PU) and one kicker (KI) are fabricated. One PU and one KI are installed into the COSY ring for testing the new stochastic cooling system with real beam at various momenta. Small test-structures were already successfully operated at the Nuclotron in Dubna for longitudinal filter cooling but not for transverse cooling and as small PU in COSY. During the last COSY beam-time in 2017 additional transverse and ToF cooling were achieved. The first two series high power amplifiers were used for cooling and to test the temperature behavior of the combiner-boards at the KI. The system layout includes all components as planned for the HESR like low noise amplifier",
        "switchable delay-lines and optical notch-filter. The HESR needs fast transmission-lines between PU and KI. Beside air-filled coax-lines",
        "optical hollow fiber-lines are very attractive. First results with such a fiber used for the transverse signal path will be presented."

        "In December 2015 stochastic cooling of heavy ions was successfully applied for the first time at the CSRe storage ring of IMP in Lanzhou",
        "China. During four days of commissioning",
        "three-dimensional cooling could be observed. Both the time-of-flight and the notch filter methods were used for longitudinal cooling. The measured cooling rates are presented. In the end of December 2015",
        "the project HIAF'High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility was approved by the Chinese government. The project will be started to construct in 2018. Stochastic cooling will be built at the spectrometer ring (SRing) mainly for experiments with radioactive fragment beams with a large phase space",
        "which is very similar to CSRe. After the stochastic pre-cooling",
        "the subsequent electron cooling will further cool down the emittance and Dp/p to get extremely well-cooled beams. The primary design and the simulation results will be presented at the conference.",
