        "Heating of diagnostics structures (striplines",
        "buttons",
        "screen vessels",
        "wire scanners etc) has been observed at many facilities with higher stored currents*. Simulations of wake losses using 3D EM codes are regularly used to estimate the amount of power lost from the bunched beam but on its own this does not tell how much is radiated back into the beam pipe or transmitted into external ports and how much is actually being dissipated in the structure and where. This talk should introduce into the matter",
        "summarise some of the observations at various facilities and illustrate what approaches of detailed simulations have been taken."
