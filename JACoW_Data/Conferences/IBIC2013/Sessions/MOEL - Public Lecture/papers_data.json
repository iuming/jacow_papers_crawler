        "ILC or CLIC as linear colliders and neutrino facilities are all be considered - as well as other facilities. The European Strategy for Particle Physics was updated and approved this year. First results from the LHC are available but by 2015-16 LHC running at 14 TeV can open more windows to new physics. What are the scenarios and the decision processes for construction of these new facilities? For this conference a central question is also; what will be their fundamental requirements for beam instrumentation ?"
