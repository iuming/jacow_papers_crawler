The Coupled Cyclotron Facility accelerates stable ion beams to ~100 MeV/A which are then fragmented and selected with the A1900 separator. A recent addition to NSCL is the gas stopping facility which thermalizes the high energy beam. The RIBs are extracted at <60keV and selected by A/Q for further transport to the low energy areas",

        "RIBs from a fragmentation facility were thermalized and post-accelerated for the first time. Preliminary results will be presented",
