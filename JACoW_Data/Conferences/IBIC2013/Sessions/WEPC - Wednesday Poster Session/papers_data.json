The rate of the calculation of the corrections is 10 KHz; we use a PI loop achieving a bandwidth of 150Hz completed with a narrow band pass filter with extra gain at 50Hz.

This article introduces the design and implementation of the BPM electronic system.

The analog circuit described in this paper",

Until 2012, thanks to the excellent performances of the injection system of the storage ring, the perturbation on the position of the stored beam was small enough to be accepted by the users. For some specific experiments, few beamlines expressed their wish to be able to stop their data acquisition during the injection. To fulfill this need, the diagnostics group of Synchrotron SOLEIL has designed the “TimEX3” board which was integrated into the timing system allowing the gating of the Top-up injection. This design was released as open hardware. Towards this aim, we decided to design it with the open source and free EDA software “KiCad”, and to make it available under the CERN’s Open Hardware Repository."

        "The currently installed Bunch Arrival time Monitors (BAMs) at the Free electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) achieved a time resolution of less than 10 fs for bunch charges higher than 500 pC. In order to achieve single spike FEL pulses at FLASH",
        "electron bunch charges down to 20 pC are of interest. With these BAMs the required time resolution is not reachable for bunch charges below 500 pC. Therefore new pickups with a bandwidth of up to 40 GHz are designed and manufactured*. The signal evaluation takes place with a time-stabilized reference laser pulse train which is modulated with an Electro-Optical intensity Modulator (EOM). The new BAM system also requires new EOMs for the electro-optical frontend. The available selection of commercial EOM candidates for the new frontend is very limited. In this paper we present a comparison between different EOM candidates for the new electro optical frontend."

A multimode fiber has been installed along the Test Beam Line at the CLIC test facility (CTF3) where the detection principle is based on the production of Cherenkov photons within the fiber resulting from beam loss and their subsequent transport along the fiber where they are then detected at the fiber ends using silicon photomultipliers. Several additional monitors including ACEMs",

In order to study beam loss pattern along the accelerator a coherent model of the whole machine is created for the purposes of Monte Carlo particle transport simulations.

The contents of the database will then be processed using custom neural network algorithms to optimize number and position of the loss monitors and to provide reference on the beam loss localization during operation of the machine."
