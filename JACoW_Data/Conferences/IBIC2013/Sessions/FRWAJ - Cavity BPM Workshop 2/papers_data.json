        "most used along the two undulator areas. As of limited manpower resources",
        "the 6.5GHz cavity BPM system builds as much as possible upon industrial components. The analog front-end solution is somewhat untypical",
        "and generated some interesting discussion. Instead of the usual heterodyne downconverter",
        "a hybrid based RF detector rectifies the signals in front of the μATCA-based digitizer. Phase shifters are used to zero calibrate the channels",
        "as well as a calibration tone feed through the reference channel. The measured resolution is ~1.4μm",
        "however",
        "efforts to improve the resolution <0.5μm are underway. These include adding a downconvertor section into the signal processing. The pros and cons of this improvement were discussed rather controversial."
