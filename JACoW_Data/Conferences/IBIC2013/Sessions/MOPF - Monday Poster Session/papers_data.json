The ongoing experimental work is trying to benchmark the theoretical models focusing on the physics of vacuum breakdown which is responsible for the discharges. The CLIC collaboration has commissioned a dedicated 12 GHz test-stand to validate the feasibility of accelerating structures and observe the characteristics of the RF discharges and their eroding effects on the structure. A versatile system for detection of the dark and breakdown currents and light emission is being developed for the test-stand. It consists of a collimation system with an external magnetic spectrometer for measurement of the spatial and energy distributions of the electrons emitted from the acceleration structure during a single RF pulse. These measurements can be correlated with e.g. the location of the breakdown inside the structure using information from the incident",
