        "A beam loss monitor using optical fibers has been developed to determine the turn-by-turn loss point of an injected beam at the Photon Factory (PF) 2.5-GeV electron storage ring. Large-core optical fibers were installed along the vacuum chamber of the storage ring that cover the entire storage ring continuously. There are many kinds of beam loss monitors for high energy accelerators",
        "such as PIN diode detector",
        "ionization chamber using coaxial cable",
        "Cherenkov light detector",
        "etc. Among these methods",
        "optical fibers are suitable to determine the beam loss point because of the ease of covering the entire ring with them",
        "they have better time and position resolution",
        "and they are cost effective. In this report",
        "review of beam loss monitors for electron storage rings and LINACs are reported at first",
        "then the result of the optical-fiber beam loss monitor at the KEK-PF are reported. Long-term deterioration by radiation is also reported."

        "fluorescence X-rays are emitted by the materials that intercept upstream dipole synchrotron radiation. The energy of the emitted X-ray is too high to be significantly attenuated by the aluminum of which the vacuum chamber is made. Diagnostics and means used to characterize this radiation are presented",
        "and measurements are compared to calculations."

        "from a single neutron up to thousands of interactions for each burst",

        "the design of LUPIN is presented in detail and its main characteristics are summarized. Its potential use as beam loss monitor and complementary detector for non-invasive beam monitoring purposes (e.g. to complement a monitor based on proton beam “halo” detection) in medical accelerators is then examined. In the context of its application as a beam loss monitor for hadrontherapy accelerators",
        "results of measurements performed at the Italian National Centre of Hadrontherapy (CNAO) are presented and analyzed."
