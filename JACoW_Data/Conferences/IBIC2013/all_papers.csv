IBIC2013,,MOAL2,The First Demonstration of EOS 3D-BCD Monitor to Maximize 3D-Overlapping for HHG-Seeded FEL,H. Tomizawa; T. Ishikawa; K. Ogawa; H. Tanaka; M. Yabashi; RIKEN SPring-8 Center; Sayo-cho; Sayo-gun; Hyogo; Japan; S. Matsubara; Y. Okayasu; T. Togashi; JASRI/SPring-8; Hyogo; Japan; In FEL seeding as a full-coherent light source; a high hit rate of successfully seeded FEL pulses is required. Precise measurements of the electron bunch charge distribution (BCD) and its arrival timing are crucial keys to maximize and keep 3D overlapping between the high-order harmonics (HH) laser pulse and electron bunch. We constructed a relative timing drift monitor based on EOS; which measured the timing differences between the seeding HH-laser pulse and the electron bunch; using a common external laser source of both HH-driving and EO-probing pulses. The feedback system of timing drift was realized with real-time data processing of EO-signal spectra. Our system realized stable seeded FEL operation with a hit rate of 30%. The 3D-BCD monitor enables non-destructive measurements of the longitudinal and transverse BCD at the same time. The transverse detection can be used to control the relative pointing between HH-pulse and electron bunch. We also verified this transverse detection with multiple EO crystals at the EUV-FEL accelerator. Our next target for temporal resolution is 30 fs; with an octave-band EO-probing for DAST crystals; aiming FEL seeding in the soft X-ray region.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/moal2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/moal2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/moal2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-MOAL2,1

Proving the high beam quality of the beam is an essential step for the success of the experiment; opening the doors of the high average power to brightness-hungry applications as X-Ray FELs; MHz ultrafast electron diffraction etc. As first step; a full 6D characterization of the beam is foreseen at the Gun beam energy of 750 keV. Diagnostics for low and high current measurements have been installed and tested; and measurements of cathode lifetime and thermal emittance in a RF environment are currently being commissioned. The recently installed double slit system will allow the measurements of beam emittance at full current (mA). Also a deflecting cavity and a high precision spectrometer are foreseen at low energy; allowing the exploration of the longitudinal phase space.

To achieve this ultimate goal; such a monitor based on a Mach-Zehnder electro-optical intensity modulator has been under development at the SwissFEL Test Injector. The high timing precision is derived by a stable pulsed optical reference system. The first BAM is located before the bunch compressor where the bunch energy is 230 MeV and the pulse length is approximately 3 ps. At this position; the bunch arrival time is sensitive to the laser- and gun timing. In this paper; we report on the commissioning of the RF- and optical front ends; the first arrival-time jitter and drift measurements with the entire system; as well as correlation of the arrival-time with different machine and environmental parameters.

The Coupled Cyclotron Facility accelerates stable ion beams to ~100 MeV/A which are then fragmented and selected with the A1900 separator. A recent addition to NSCL is the gas stopping facility which thermalizes the high energy beam. The RIBs are extracted at <60keV and selected by A/Q for further transport to the low energy areas; currently consisting of the BECOLA beam cooling and laser spectroscopy system; and LEBIT Penning trap. RIBs up to 6 MeV/A will be provided by the ReA post-accelerator; currently consisting of an EBIT; RFQ and superconducting RF cavities. Energies up to 1.5 MeV/A are presently available; and energy increases will be phased in with the addition of further cryomodules.

IBIC2013,,MOCL1,Beam Instrumentation at the Accelerator Test Facility 2,JAI; Egham; Surrey; United Kingdom; Royal Holloway; University of London; Surrey; United Kingdom; The Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) is a scaled demonstrator system for final focus beam lines of linear high energy colliders. Four OTR (Optical Transition Radiation) monitors have been installed at the ATF2. Major characteristics is the fast measurement of projected (2D) and intrinsic (4D) emittances and the coupling corrections with skew quadrupole magnets at the upstream. The high resolution cavity beam position monitor (BPM) system is a part of the ATF2 diagnostics. Two types of cavity BPMs are used; C-band operating at 6.426 GHz; and S-band at 2.888 GHz with an increased beam aperture. The resolution of the C-band system with attenuators was determined to be approximately 250 nm and 1 μm for the S-band system. Without attenuation the best recorded C-band cavity resolution was 27 nm. A laser-wire transverse electron beam size measurement system has been constructed and operated at the ATF2 beam line at KEK. A special set of electron beam optics was developed to generate an approximately 1μm vertical focus at the laser-wire location. Systematic measurements of a micron beam size have been successfully executed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/mocl1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/mocl1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/mocl1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-MOCL1,26

The suppression of the CMS cavern background originating from pp collision products and the 25 ns bunch spacing have set the requirements for the detector design. Each detector unit will be a radiation hard; cylindrical Cherenkov radiator optically coupled to an ultra-fast UV-sensitive photomultiplier tube; providing a prompt; directionally sensitive measurement. Simulation and test beam measurements have shown the achievability of the goals that have driven the baseline design. The system will consist of 20 azimuthally distributed detectors per end; installed at a radius of r ~ 180 cm and a distance 20.6 m away from the CMS interaction region. The detector units will enable a measurement of the transverse distribution of the bunch-by-bunch machine induced background flux. This will provide important feedback from the CMS on the beam conditions during the LHC machine setup and comparisons to expectations based on FLUKA simulations.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/mocl2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/mocl2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/mocl2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-MOCL2,33
IBIC2013,,MOCL3,Emittance and Momentum Diagnostics for Beams with Large Momentum Spread,M. Olvegård; V.G. Ziemann; Uppsala University; Uppsala; Sweden; In the drive beam complex of CLIC; but also in plasma wakefield accelerators; the momentum spread can be on the order of tens of percent while conventional diagnostic methods often assume a very small momentum spread. This leads to systematic misinterpretations of the measurements. Spectrometry and emittance measurements based on quadrupole scan rely on measuring the beam size; which depends on the beam envelope. This; in turn; depends on the momentum distribution. We have studied the systematic errors that arise and developed novel algorithms to correctly analyze these measurements for arbitrary momentum distributions. As an application we consider the CLIC drive beam decelerator; where extraction of up to 90% of the kinetic energy leads to a very large momentum spread. We study a measurement of the time-resolved momentum distribution; based on sweeping the beam in a circular pattern and recording the beam size on a screen using optical transition radiation. We present the algorithm to extract the time-resolved momentum distribution; together with simulation results to prove its applicability.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/mocl3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/mocl3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/mocl3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-MOCL3,37

Injection of the beam from the RFQ to the Drift Tube Linac (DTL) tank and acceleration up to 12 MeV is a sensitive operation in the accelerating chain. The output beam of the RFQ should be fully characterized and tuned to optimize this operation. To perform this characterization the MOTS is being designed with a set of diagnostics devices to measure also beam parameters after the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT); and with minor modifications after the first tank of the DTL. The most important beam parameters that will be measured with the test stand are the beam current; the beam energy and the energy spread.

Thus; it turns out to be a more compact and cheaper solution for electron slice diagnostics than commonly used radiofrequency deflecting cavities and having minimal impact on the machine design.

Finally; we provide an outlook on how the implementation of faster algorithms for the simulation of BPM characteristics could potentially help speed up such studies considerably.,"Funding: Work supported by the EU within the DITANET and oPAC projects under contracts 215080 and 289485, HGF and GSI under contract VH-NG-328 and STFC under the Cockcroft Institute core grant ST/G008248/1.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/mopc14_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/mopc14.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/mopc14_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-MOPC14,78

IBIC2013,,MOPC17,Calibration of a Non-Linear Beam Position Monitor Electronics by Switching Electrode Signals,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Button electrode signals from beam position monitors embedded into new LHC collimators will be individually processed with front-end electronics based on compensated diode detectors and digitized with 24-bit audio-range ADCs. This scheme allows sub-micrometre beam orbit resolution to be achieved with simple hardware and no external timing. As the diode detectors only operate in a linear regime with large amplitude signals; offset errors of the electronics cannot be calibrated in the classical way with no input. This paper describes the algorithms developed to calibrate the offset and gain asymmetry of these nonlinear electronic channels.

In high-brightness lepton and high-energy hadron accelerators the use of optical diagnostic techniques for this purpose is becoming more widespread as the required bandwidth; resolution and high RF beam power level involved limit the use of traditional electro-magnetic RF pick-up based methods.

It serves as a beam source for many quite different experiments. The recent ELBE upgrade allows electron beams with bunches in the range of single electrons to 1 nC. The maximum beam current is 1.6 mA CW and the repetition rates covering the range from one shot single bunch pulses to 26 MHz CW. The existing BPMs and especially the DCMs which are used for the Machine Protection System cannot handle this wide parameter range. To improve this situation the development of new BPMs / DCMs was necessary. The DCMs measure the difference of the beam current between two stripline sensors and produce an interlock for differences greater 10 microamps.

To cure these instabilities; additional active system must be used besides passive damping. For this purpose; we have developed a distributed low-latency Transverse Feedback System (TFS) using FPGAs. Data acquisition takes place on multiple BPMs with individual FPGAs and ADCs around the accelerator ring. Acquired data is compressed and sent over broadband fiber optic wires to a central unit. For synchronization; data is tagged using timestamps from a reference time; which is distributed by a specially constrained network time protocol to obtain cycle accuracy. The central unit provides an FIR filter for system bandwidth limitation; and an adaptive IIR filter for stable beam signal rejection. Feedback is given using a linear combination of the pre-processed BPM signals. The system provides substantial flexibility; due to the possibility to configure most parameters online. Filters; feedback sources and parameters; compression rate and more can be adapted via Ethernet interface; which also supplies analysis data.

For the LHC a beam-synchronous gated peak detector has been developed to allow individual bunches to be monitored without the influence of other bunches circulating in the machine. The requirement for the observation of both low intensity pilot bunches and high intensity bunches for physics requires a detector front-end with a high bandwidth and a large dynamic range while the usage for Schottky measurements requires low noise electronics.

Finally a MCP amplifies electrons and with a CCD camera the electron distribution is detected.

Measurement of the absolute spectral intensity of coherent radiation emitted by an electron bunch allows monitoring and reconstruction of the longitudinal bunch profile. To measure coherent radiation in the teraherz and infrared range a in-vacuum coherent radiation intensity spectrometer was developed for the free-electron laser in Hamburg(FLASH). The spectrometer is equipped with five consecutive dispersion gratings and 120 parallel readout channels: it can be operated either in short (5-44 um) or in long wavelength mode (45-430 um). Fast parallel readout permits the monitoring of coherent radiation from single electron bunches. Large wavelength coverage and superb absolute calibration of the device allows reconstruction of the longitudinal bunch profile using Kramers-Kronig based phase retrieval technique.

In order to characterize the longitudinal phase space of the beam in the SNS 1GeV proton LINAC the bunch profile needs to be measured with a few picosecond resolution. The original SNS set of diagnostics included only four interceptive Feschenko-style longitudinal profile monitors in the normal conducting part of the LINAC at 100MeV. Two recently added systems are: a non-interceptive laser scanner in the injector at 2.5MeV and a novel non-interceptive method for longitudinal Twiss parameters measurement using the beam position monitors in the Super Conducting LINAC (SCL) at 300MeV.

IBIC2013,,MOPC42,Novel Pickup for Bunch Arrival Time Monitor,STFC/DL/ASTeC; Daresbury; Warrington; Cheshire; United Kingdom; For an optical-modulator-based BAM; main parameter of the pickup output signal is slope steepness. We suggest a novel pickup with flat thin electrodes in a transverse gap. Increasing the electrode width makes the steepness greater in the same extent as the signal increases. For a given width; reducing the electrode thickness allows to reach ultimate steepness. Wave processes in the pickup were investigated on a large scale model; using the technique described in *. The DESY 40GHz button pickup was used as a reference. It is shown that steepness of the flat electrode pickup can be achieved two times greater. It is also shown that a BAM electrode pickup has a remarkable feature: the steepness does not depend on electrode sizes; if the ratio w/G (a flat electrode pickup; the width and gap length) or d/D (a button pickup; the diameters) is kept constant. This makes pickup bandwidth that is of the order of c over 2G or 2D; a free parameter. For flat electrode pickup; the steepness can be kept as high with transition to a more practical bandwidth 20GHz.

A time resolution in the nanosecond range allows to detect beam losses and luminosities of single bunches. The radiation hardness and negligible temperature dependence allow the usage of diamond sensors in high radiation fields without cooling. Two different diamond detector types are installed at LHC and CMS. One is based on pCVD diamonds and installed at different locations in the LHC tunnel for beam loss monitoring. Measurements of these detectors are used to perform a bunch-by-bunch beam loss analysis. They allow to disentangle the origin of beam losses. The second type uses sCVD diamonds and is located inside CMS for van-der-Meer scan; beam halo and online luminosity monitoring and around the LHC tunnel for beam loss observation. Results on the performance of these detectors will be presented and examples of the use for analyzing the beam conditions will be given.

This FPGA-based system provides on-line; real-time; and dead-time-free data processing. Several examples are presented: the Time Loss Histogram with 1.6 ns binning provides beam loss measurements that are synchronized with the revolution period throughout the full operational LHC cycle.

Despite a TBL beam energy (150-80 MeV) significantly lower than the minimum nominal energy of the CLIC DB (250 MeV); the pulse time structure of the TBL provides the opportunity to measure beam losses with CLIC-like DB timing conditions. In this contribution; a simulation study on the detection of beam losses along the TBL for the commissioning of the recently installed beam loss monitoring system is presented. The most likely loss locations during stable beam conditions are studied by considering the beam envelope defined by the FODO lattice as well as the emittance growth due to the deceleration process.

IBIC2013,,MOPF08,Design and Performance of the Upgraded LHC Synchrotron Light Monitor,A. Goldblatt; E. Bravin; F. Roncarolo; G. Trad; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The LHC is equipped with two synchrotron radiation systems; one per beam; used to measure the transverse bunch distributions. The light emitted by a superconducting undulator and/or by a dipole magnet (depending on beam energy) is intercepted by an extraction mirror in vacuum and sent through a viewport to the imaging Beam Synchrotron Radiation Telescope (BSRT). The first version of the telescope; used from 2009 to mid 2012; was based on spherical focusing mirrors in order to minimize chromatic aberrations. However; this required a very complicated delay line in order to switch the focus between the two different light sources as a function of beam energy. A new system based on optical lenses was designed and installed in mid 2012 in order to simplify the optical line and thus reduce misalignment and focusing errors. The first results with LHC beam using this new system showed a significant reduction in the correction factor required to match the emittance as measured by wire scanners.

Thus; new non-invasive profile measurements are being investigated. Profile monitors using gas ionisation or fluorescence have been used at a number of accelerators. Typically; extra gas must be injected at the monitor and the rise in pressure spreads some distance down the beampipe. In contrast; a gas jet can be fired across the beam into a receiving chamber; with little gas escaping into the rest of the beam pipe. In addition; a gas jet shaped into a thin plane can be used like a screen on which the beam cross-section is imaged. In this paper we present some arrangements for the generation of such a jet.

In the ion energy range between 4.8 and 11.4 MeV/u the imaging properties of the screens are compared with profiles obtained using standard techniques like SEM grids and scraper. Detailed investigations with e.g. Calcium and Argon ion beams on various radiation-hard materials show that the measured beam profiles can differ from those measured with standard methods and depend on several beam and material parameters *. For the practical usage of scintillators; it is necessary to have predictions for the response of the scintillator to a given ion beam. An existing model for the light output of scintillators for single particle irradiation has been extended to include the effect of overlapping excitation tracks. To validate the model; dedicated measurements with well-defined Carbon and Titanium ion beams at 11.4 MeV/u have been carried out. To understand the mechanisms; the beam flux and the pulse length has been varied. The measured light yield is compared to the model calculations.; * E.

Some part of the deposited energy will be emitted into the beam pipe; some part can be coupled out of signal ports and some part will be absorbed by the materials of the structures. With increasingly higher stored currents; we require a better understanding of where all the energy deposited by wake losses ends up in order to avoid damaging components.

Each type of transformer requires different magnetic characteristics regarding parameters such as permeability; coercivity and shape of the magnetization curve. Each transformer is built based on toroidal cores of a magnetic material which gives these characteristics. For example; DCCTs consist of three cores; two for the measurement of the DC component and one for the AC component. In order to study the effect of changes in these parameters on the current transformers; several interesting raw materials based on their as-cast properties were selected with the annealing process used to tune their properties for the individual needs of each transformer.

This is indispensable; especially for high intensity machines. Fortunately; the relationship between the recorded beam offset signals at the BPMs is a manifestation of the accelerator optics; and can therefore be exploited in the determination of the optics linear and non-linear components. We propose a novel method for estimating lattice non-linear components located in-between the positions of two BPMs by analyzing the beam offset signals of a BPMs triple containing these two BPMs. Depending on the non-linear components in-between the locations of the BPMs triple; the relationship between the beam offsets follows a multivariate polynomial. After calculating the covariance matrix of the polynomial terms; the Generalized Total Least Squares method is used to find the model parameters; and thus the non-linear components.

It is operated at the full 120 Hz beam rate without interfering with the normal FEL operation for the photon users. The deflected beam is observed on the electron beam dump profile monitor; which acts as an energy spectrometer in the vertical plane. We observe; on a pulse by pulse basis; the time resolved energy profile of the spent electron beam from the undulator. The structure is powered from a 50 MW X-band klystron; giving a 48 MV kick to the beam which yields a 1 fs rms time resolution on the screen. We have measured the longitudinal profile of the electron bunches both with the FEL operating and with the lasing suppressed; allowing reconstruction of both the longitudinal profile of the incoming electron beam and the time-resolved profile of the X-ray pulse generated in the FEL. We are immediately able to see whether the bunch is chirped and which parts of the bunch are lasing; giving us new insight into tuning the machine for peak performance.

Many devices and instrumentation have been developed to measure and control the electron bunch length. A very powerful class of diagnostic tools is based on the coherent radiation power emitted by the electron bunch; that allows a non-destructive shot by shot measurement; well suitable for bunch length control feedback implementation. However they usually provide measurements of the bunch length relative variation; and external instrumentation like a transverse RF deflecting cavity is usually needed to calibrate them and to obtain absolute bunch length estimations. In this paper we present a novel experimental methodology to self-calibrate a device based on diffraction radiation from a ceramic gap. We indeed demonstrate the possibility to use coherent radiation based diagnostic to provide absolute measurements of the electron bunch length. We present the theoretical basis of the proposed approach and validate it through a detailed campaign of measurements that have been carried on in the FERMI@Elettra FEL linac.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/tual3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/tual3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/tual3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-TUAL3,312

This is fundamentally limited by self-amplifying beam instabilities; intrinsic to unavoidable imperfections in accelerators. Traditionally; intra-bunch or head-tail particle motion is measured using fast digitizers; which even using state-of-the-art technology are limited in their effective intra-bunch position resolution to few tens of um in the multi-GHz regime. Oscillations at this scale cause partial or total loss of the beam due to the tight transverse constraints imposed by the LHC collimation system. To improve on the present signal processing; a prototype system has been designed; constructed and tested at the CERN Super-Proton-Synchrotron (SPS) and later on LHC. The system splits the signal into multiple equally-spaced narrow frequency bands that are processed and analysed in parallel. Working with narrow-band signals in frequency-domain permits the use of much higher resolution analogue-to-digital-converters that can be used to resolve nm-scale particle motion already during the onset of instabilities.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/tubl3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/tubl3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/tubl3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-TUBL3,327

The growth of these leakage currents has been found to be exacerbated by the application of a negative bias (-70V) to the tungsten blades; a bias suggested for optimum position sensitivity. This bias is applied in order to accelerate free electrons away from the surface of the blades and to prevent cross-talk; however; we have found that the operation of the XBPMs without bias has negligible impact on our measurements. Removal of the bias has been found to prevent the growth of leakage currents over time; and can also significantly reduce the cost of our signal acquisition by removing the need for a low-current amplifier with a bias supply.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/tupc10_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/tupc10.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/tupc10_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-TUPC10,376

The BPM system needs to measure the beam position; phase and intensity in all foreseen beam modes with a pulse rate of 14 Hz; duration of 2.86 ms and amplitude ranging form 5 mA to 62.5 mA. With respect to the BPM connection to the Machine Interlock System; the total response time must be less than 10 us. The signal level variations from one BPM to another along the Linac should be as small as possible to meet the requirements on the analog gain of the front-end electronics and the dynamic range of the digitizer card input. The other requirement is that the BPM system needs to give at least a rough estimation of the beam position and phase; even if the beam is significantly debouched; ex. during the Linac tuning phase. These requirements and their impact on the design of the BPM detector; the analog front-end electronics and the selection of the digitizer card are discussed in this paper along with a general description of the BPM system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/tupc13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/tupc13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/tupc13_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-TUPC13,388

From the first days of operation the new system successfully suppresses transverse and longitudinal beam instabilities in wide range of machine parameters. The system offers also many new diagnostics opportunities; these include the analysis of instability modes; measurement of the feedback loop gain; and determination of the transfer function. A method to systematically optimise the output amplifier response function with the help of shaper coefficients for the optimal bunch separation has been developed. In addition the analysis of the input data stream allows a passive determination of machine properties like betatron and synchrotron frequencies as well as the longitudinal phases for every bunch. The integration of external triggers permits the analysis of postmortem data; the characterisation of beam-loss events; and monitoring of the injection process.

There are two goals: firstly; to demonstrate focusing to 37 nm vertical beam size; secondly; to achieve a few nanometer level beam orbit stability at the focus point (the Interaction Point (IP)) in the vertical plane. High-resolution beam position monitors around the IP area (IPBPMs) have been developed in order to measure the electron beam position in that region with a resolution of a few nanometers in the vertical plane. Currently; the standard operation mode at ATF2 is single bunch; however; multiple bunch operation with a bunch spacing similar to the one foreseen for the ILC (around 300 ns) is also possible. IPBPMs have a low Q value resulting in a decay time of about 30 ns; and so should be able to measure the beam position of individual bunches without any significant performance degradation.

Operation with average current of several mA and sufficiently long cathode lifetime requires pressure in the gun region at least at the 10-11 Torr level or better. To achieve such low pressure the gun chamber and the adjacent beam line are baked for an extended period of time. This imposes an additional requirement of withstanding the bake on all diagnostic elements. Additionally; analyzing beam line temperature in a high current energy-recovering linac as ones considered for future light sources; it was found that due to the short bunch length the resistive wall losses can be very high; which can cause large thermal stress to the beam line elements. With these in mind we have designed a modified strip-line beam position monitor with a flexible connection between the stip-line electrode and the central pin of conflate mounted SMA feedthrough. The design is based on a BPM previously developed for radiation source ELBE. To make manufacturing of the BPM more precise and less costly; brazing is used in place of welding.

At the free-electron laser in Hamburg (FLASH); a longitudinal bunch profile monitor utilizing a TDS has been realized. In combined use with a fast kicker magnet and an off-axis imaging screen; selection and measurement of a single bunch out of the bunch train with bunch spacing down to 1us can be achieved without affecting the remaining bunches which continue to generate FEL radiation during user operation. Technical obstacles have been overcome such as suppression of coherent transition radiation from the imaging screen; the continuous image acquisition and processing with the bunch train repetition rate of 10Hz. The monitor; which provides the longitudinal bunch profile and length; has been used routinely at FLASH.

For this a clear understanding of the temporal and spatial modulation of the proton driver bunches after propagating the plasma channel is essential.

We suggest a bunch length method using the spectral analysis of incoherent Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) in the visible frequency domain. The frequency response of OTR is taken by inserting an aluminium coated silicon wafer into the electron beam. The OTR light is collected with mirror optics into an optical fibre; which is coupled to a spectrometer (334 THz to 1500 THz). The resolution of the spectrometer allows us to measure bunch length lower than 100 fs rms. Bunch length was varied from 100 femto-seconds down to a few femto-seconds. The spectral response of Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) showed an increase of the correlation between neighbouring frequencies as bunch length was reduced.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/tupc40_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/tupc40.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/tupc40_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-TUPC40,471

Exploiting the electro-optic effect; the bunch electric field 'pulse carves' an optical replica from a narrow bandwidth nanosecond duration laser probe. All-optical characterisation of the optical replica is via spectrally resolved auto-correlation; providing a sub-20fs resolution capability. An optical parametric amplification stage following the pulse carving; and driven by same nanosecond laser that provides the probe; enables sufficient intensity for single-shot measurement. In basing the optical system on nanosecond Q-switched lasers; bypassing complex femtosecond laser systems; the potential for robust instrumentation development is enhanced. The bandwidth limitations of the electro-optic materials are being addressed through investigations into multiple crystal detectors; and THz induced second harmonic generation on metal surfaces.

In the past; the AGS emittance has been measured by using an ion collecting IPM during the whole cycle and a multi-wire at injection. The beam profiles from this IPM are distorted by space charge forces at higher energy; which makes the emittance determination very hard. In addition; helical superconducting snake magnets and near integer vertical tune for polarized proton operation distort the lattice in the AGS and introduce large beta beating. For more precise measurements of the emittance; we need TBT measurements near injection and beta function measurements at the location of devices used to measure the emittance. A Polarimeter target has been used as flying wire for proton emittance measurement. A new type electron collecting IPM has been installed and tested in the AGS with proton beam. The Beta functions at the IPM locations have been measured with Orbit Response Matrix (ORM) methods and with a local corrector at IPM.

The diagnostics of high power particle beams is difficult due to the power deposition on diagnostics elements introduced in the beam so non-invasive instrumentation is highly desirable. The laser wire emittance scanner under construction is based on a photo-detachment process utilizing the neutralized particles produced in the interaction between Laser and H− beam for beam diagnostics purposes. The principle is appropriate to determine the transversal beam density distribution as well as the transversal and longitudinal beam emittance behind the RFQ. The instrument will be located at the end of the MEBT with the detachment taking place inside a dipole field.

The emission phases of the radiation pulse must be causality correlated with the temporal sequence of the N electron collisions onto the metallic screen.

The ERL group at the Cornell Lab for Accelerator-based ScienceS and Education (CLASSE) is currently testing an injector for an ERL based X-ray light source: a superconducting RF (SRF) accelerator coupled to a DC electron gun and high rep rate (1.3 GHz) photocathode drive laser; capable of producing a CW beam of 80 pC bunches (100 mA ave current). Traditional transverse diagnostics are incapable of operation with such high average currents; motivating the the use of a Laser Wire Scanner (LWS).

Due to the low energy of the injector output (5-15 MeV) and beam halo scraping; detection of laser-scattered photons is significantly more challenging than in previous LWS system.

The laser system that will be used for the photo-neutralization of the H− beam is a fiber laser emitting 110 ns pulses at λ=1064nm; with a repetition rate of 30 kHz and peak power of 8 kW. The laser will be conveyed to the interaction area over a distance of 70 m via an optical fiber. An assembly of two remotely controlled motorized translation stages will enable the system to scan across the H− beam along its vertical profile. A motorized beam expander will control the output size of the collimated laser beam in order to enable the system to operate with different spatial characteristics of the ions beam.

Laserwires have since been applied to larger beam-size; high power H− ion beams; where the non-invasive method can probe beam densities that would damage traditional diagnostics. While photo-detachment of H− ions is now routine to measure beam profiles; extending the technique to transverse and longitudinal emittance measurements is a key aim of the laserwire emittance scanner under construction at the Front End Test Stand (FETS) at the RAL. A pulsed; 30kHz; 8kW peak power laser is fibre-coupled to motorized collimating optics; which controls the position and thickness of the laserwire delivered to the H− interaction chamber. The laserwire slices out a beamlet of neutralized particles; which propagate to a downstream scintillator and camera.

Here we present strategies to improve the sensitivity to low vertical emittance beams. We move away from photon spectrum analysis to a statistical analysis of undulator radiation; showing the measured increase in signal-to-background. Reproducing simulations of previous work; we demonstrate that photon beam polarisation extends the linearity of the technique by several decades in emittance.

In the absence of external beam excitations the tune is visible in the spectra of the position data with the feedback loop as a dip; while with external excitation a peak is visible.

Thus; diagnostic tools are required to investigate e-beam properties; such as beam emittance; longitudinal space charge; energy spread and velocity spread. In this paper we present analysis of radiation measurements obtained from a pre-bunched e-beam FEL. The measurements were made for a wide range of frequencies and for beam currents from low currents to high currents; where space charge effects can not neglected. We apply a frequency domain formulation to analyze the measured radiation. The spectral signature of the radiation emission obtained from a pre-bunched e-beam can provide vital information on e-beam properties. We show that a rigorous analysis of the measured radiation; allows characterization of the e-beam parameters. This analysis can provide some insights to the development of e-beam accelerators and radiation sources devices and to help physicists interpreting radiated signals.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/tupf33_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/tupf33.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/tupf33_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-TUPF33,593

An alternative is to mix the drive and received signals to form a phase detector. Using this technique, the phase shift across the resonant section of beam-pipe can be observed directly on an oscilloscope. The growth and decay of the EC density has a time constant of roughly 100 ns, while the measured phase shift will include a convolution of the EC density with the impulse response of the resonant beam-pipe - typically about 500 ns. So any estimate of the growth/decay of the cloud requires deconvolution of the measured signal with the response time of the resonance. We have also used this technique to look for evidence of EC density with a lifetime that is long compare to the revolution period of the stored beam.

IBIC2013,,TUPF36,Analysis of Modulation Signals Generated in the TE Wave Detection Method For Electron Cloud Measurements,LBNL; Berkeley; California; USA; Cornell University (CLASSE); Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education; Ithaca; New York; USA; The evaluation of the electron cloud density in storage rings by measuring its effects on the transmission of electromagnetic signals across portions of the beampipe is a widely used technique and the most suited for measurements over extended regions. Recent results show that in a majority of cases the RF signal transmission takes place by coupling to standing waves excited in the vacuum chamber. In such a case the effect of a varying cloud density is a simultaneous amplitude; phase and frequency modulation of a fixed frequency drive signal. The characteristics of the modulation depend not only on the cloud density values and spatial distribution; but also on its temporal evolution and on the damping time of the standing waves. In this paper we evaluate the relationship between measured modulation sidebands amplitude and the electron cloud density when cloud and electromagnetic resonance rise and fall times are of the same order of magnitude; as it is the case in the accelerators where we have conducted our experiments.,"Funding: Work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and by the US National Science Foundation under Contracts No. DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-FC02-08ER41538, DE-SC0006505, PHY-0734867, PHY-1002467.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/tupf36_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/tupf36.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/tupf36_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-TUPF36,605

In particular; when the beam of particles is emitting an X-ray photon beam; a non perturbative way of measuring the particle beam profile is to image it using the emitted X-ray photon beam. Over the years; numerous X-ray imaging methods have been developed; fulfilling the requirements imposed by a particle beam becoming smaller; and approaching micron size for electron beam machine with vertical emittance of the order of 1pm-rad. In this paper; we will first recall the properties of the X-ray photon as function of source and its properties. From this we will derive some natural definition of a large aperture X-ray imaging system. We will then use this selection criterion to select a number of X-ray imaging devices used as a beam profile diagnostics in an attempt to give an overview of what has been achieved and what is possible to achieve with the selected devices.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/weal1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/weal1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/weal1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-WEAL1,608

The-state-of-the-art in transverse beam diagnostics is based on the laser-wire technology. However; it requires a high power laser significantly increases the cost of the laser-wire system. Therefore; a simpler and relatively inexpensive method is required. A beam profile monitor based on Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) is very promising. The resolution of conventional OTR monitor is defined by a root-mean-square of the so-called Point Spread Function (PSF). In optical wavelength range the resolution is diffraction limited down to a few micrometers. However; in * we demonstrated that the OTR PSF has a structure which visibility can be used to monitor vertical beam size with sub-micrometer resolution.

The electric field of the charged particle polarizes the target atoms which then oscillate; emitting radiation with a very broad spectrum. The spatial-spectral properties of DR are sensitive to a range of electron beam parameters. Furthermore; the energy loss due to DR is so small that the electron beam parameters are unchanged. DR can therefore be used to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools. To achieve the micron-scale resolution required to measure the transverse (vertical) beam size using incoherent DR in CLIC; DR in UV and X-ray spectral-range must be investigated.

The new system will improve both feedback and diagnostic capabilities. Bunch by bunch selectable control over feedback filters; gain and excitation will allow finer control over feedback; allowing for example the single bunch in a hybrid or camshaft fill pattern to be controlled independently from the bunch train. It will also be possible to excite all bunches at a single frequency while simultaneously sweeping the excitation for tune measurement of a few selected bunches. The single frequency excitation can be used for bunch cleaning or continuous measurement of the beta-function. A simple programmable event sequencer will provide support for up to 8 steps of programmable sweeps and changes to feedback and excitation; allowing a variety of complex and precisely timed beam characterisation experiments including grow-damp measurements in unstable conditions.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/wepc10_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/wepc10.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/wepc10_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-WEPC10,682

The orbit correction scheme relies classically on the calculation of a correction orbit based on the SVD analysis of the response matrix of our 224 BPMs to each of our 96 correctors. The rate of the calculation of the corrections is 10 KHz; we use a PI loop achieving a bandwidth of 150Hz completed with a narrow band pass filter with extra gain at 50Hz. In order to make the best use of the correctors dynamic range and of the resolution of the calculation; it can be useful to limit the bandwidth of loop for the highest order vectors of the SVD; or even to totally remove some of these vectors from the correction down to DC. Removing some of the eigen vectors while avoiding that the loop becomes unstable usually increases a lot the complexity of the matrix calculations: we have developed an algorithm which overcomes this problem; The test of this algorithm is presented. We present also the beneficial effect at high frequency of the limitation of the gain of the correction of the highest SVD eigen vectors on the demand of the peak strength of the correctors and on the resolution of the correction calculation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/wepc13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/wepc13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/wepc13_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-WEPC13,694

Hence; the KEKB Injector Linac is required to produce: electron: 20 mm mrad (7GeV; 5nC); positron: 10 mm mrad (4GeV; 4nC). To achieve this; the accelerator components have to be aligned within ± 0.1mm (1 σ). BPM is essential instrumentation for Beam Based Alignment; and is required one magnitude better position resolution to get better alignment results. Since current BPM readout system using oscilloscopes has ~50um position resolution; we decided to develop high precision BPM readout system with narrow bandpass filters. It handles two bunches with 96ns interval and has a dynamic range between 0.1nC (for photon factory) to 10nC (positron primary). To achieve these criteria; we adopt semiconductor attenuators and optimized two-stage Bessel filters at 300MHz center frequency to meet both time and frequency domain constraints. To correct position drift due to gain imbalance during operation; calibration pulses are output to the BPM between beam cycles (20ms).

This article introduces the design and implementation of the BPM electronic system. The challenge of designing the BPM electronics is to acquire and process the signal with large dynamic range (5.8mV~32V) and changing width (80ns to 500ns). The analog circuit described in this paper; which is constructed of a single-stage operational amplifier and an analog switch; can cover the input signal with large dynamic range. Because of the minimum bunch length (80ns) and the requirement of position resolution; a 14 bit 250MHz ADC is adopted to digitize the signal. Besides; for BPM system; the demand of an accurate real-time position monitoring is mandatory. The algorithm developed in an FPGA is able to make Bunch-by-Bunch position calculation and Closed Orbit position calculation in real time. Also; some preliminary test results will be presented and discussed; which show that the resolution of Bunch-by-Bunch position is 0.8mm when the input signal is 5.8mV and the resolution of Closed Orbit position is 50um.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/wepc16_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/wepc16.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/wepc16_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-WEPC16,706

The new monitor; which will be installed in the beam line to Target 1; is of a ‘split plate’ design which utilises two pairs of electrodes to allow the beam position to be measured simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical planes. Simulations carried out using the CST low frequency solver have highlighted the inaccuracies in the measured beam position caused by strong inter-electrode coupling in such a monitor. This coupling; along with imbalanced electrode capacitances; leads to reduced sensitivity to changes in beam position as well as producing a positional offset error. This paper describes how the problems associated with inter-electrode coupling have been removed with the addition of grounded rings placed between each of the four electrodes. The design and positioning of the rings also ensured that the four electrode capacitances were matched.

The probe signal was observed at 20GHz oscilloscope. In each of the front and rear transverse gaps between pickup electrode and wall (button pickup); a shorter-than-gap bunch excites a ‘plain-wave’ packet which length is of the order of gap length over c. Two packets are spaced by electrode length over c. The packets propagate along the electrode to a coaxial connector. At this low impedance common point each of the packets partially reflects back and partially passes into the opposite gap. The voltage appearing on the impedance excites two TEM-wave packets: one propagates backwards; another one propagates forward through connector. The connector output is sum of two such packets spaced the same as two incident packets. The packets propagating backwards reflect from the electrode open end; come back to the summing point and generate output in similar way. The same processes occur in a pickup with single gap electrodes (stripline pickup).

Treating simultaneously four signals; thus with a redundancy of two to measure the phase between two sources; allows to perform intrinsic shot-to-shot cross verifications on resolution and reproducibility. The long-term stability of this device has also been successfully assessed by independent verifications against time and temperature drifts. An identical unit has now been added for phase measurements between the Storage Ring beam and the RF cavity signals.

In the case of the multi-bunch measurement; the different bunch profile sit on same timing; thus; we can not distinguish the behavior of each bunch. We have developed a trigger circuit to measure the bunch-by-bunch longitudinal beam profile; which uses non integer sweep frequency for the acceleration frequency. The bunch profile of each bunch sit on different position in this measurement. We observed the increment of the synchrotron oscillation amplitude from the first bunch to the 20th bunch in the KEK-ATF Damping Ring by using this system.

Due to the high losses of the 40 GHz RF front-end the signal in the RF path is attenuated well below the optimal operation voltage of the EOM. To improve the overall performance; the signal strength of the induced pickup signal needs to be increased and at the same time the losses in the RF front-end significantly reduced.

In order to achieve single spike FEL pulses at FLASH; electron bunch charges down to 20 pC are of interest. With these BAMs the required time resolution is not reachable for bunch charges below 500 pC. Therefore new pickups with a bandwidth of up to 40 GHz are designed and manufactured*. The signal evaluation takes place with a time-stabilized reference laser pulse train which is modulated with an Electro-Optical intensity Modulator (EOM).

A diagnostic for measurements longitudinal phase space distribution with large dynamic range (LDR) is needed for proper setup of an injector and better understanding of beam halo formation. In addition; one of unsolved ERL’s diagnostic problems is the transverse beam size monitoring of a high average current; few MeV energy beam.

It is designed to be used with CW beam starting with an average current of about 150 μA; but can; as it is non-destructive and non-intercepting; be use at any average current. When implemented in a dispersive section it can be used for energy distribution measurements. Using a short pulse laser adds time resolution to the diagnostic.

Therefore; an optical fiber BLM system is currently under investigation which can cover large sections of beamline at a time. A multimode fiber has been installed along the Test Beam Line at the CLIC test facility (CTF3) where the detection principle is based on the production of Cherenkov photons within the fiber resulting from beam loss and their subsequent transport along the fiber where they are then detected at the fiber ends using silicon photomultipliers.

For future beams with higher energy and intensity; the expected increase in luminosity and associated increase of the debris from interaction products is expected to compete with any quench-provoking beam losses from the primary proton beams. In order to distinguish between the two; it is proposed to locate the detectors as close as possible to the superconducting coil. The detectors therefore have to be located inside the cold mass of the superconducting magnets in superfluid helium at 1.9 K.

Loss monitor electronics is designed to be able to measure currents as little as 1% of the expected current up to as much as 1% of the total beam loss; thus ~800 pA – few mA. In order to study beam loss pattern along the accelerator a coherent model of the whole machine is created for the purposes of Monte Carlo particle transport simulations.

The experience from modern LINAC based 4th generation light sources shows that OTR diagnostics might fail because of coherence effects in the OTR emission process. As a consequence; for the European XFEL which is currently under construction in Hamburg; transverse beam profile measurements are based on scintillating screen monitors. The LYSO:Ce screens are oriented such that coherent OTR generated at the screen boundaries will be geometrically suppressed. An additional advantage is that the imaging optics operate in Scheimpflug condition thus adjusting the plane of sharp focus with respect to the CCD chip and significantly increasing the apparent depth of field.

To ensure the operation stability of FLASH; monitoring of the beam is mandatory. Two Ionization Profile Monitors (IPM) detect the lateral x and y position changes. The functional principle of the IPM is based on the detection of particles; generated by interaction of the beam with the residual gas in the beam line. The newly designed IPM enables the combined determination of the horizontal and vertical position as well as the profile. This is made possible by a compact monitor; consisting of a cage in a vacuum chamber; two micro-channel plates (MCP) and two repeller plates with toggled electric fields at the opposite sides of the MCPs. The particles created by the FEL beam; drift in a homogenous electrical field towards the respective MCP; which produces an image of the beam profile on an attached phosphor screen. A camera for each MCP is used for evaluation. This indirect detection scheme operates over a wide dynamic range and allows the detection of the center of gravity and the shape of the beam.

At the experimental hall; the incoming FEL beam can be deflected towards five test sites by silicon mirrors mounted into vacuum vessels; of which one is operated in permanent switching mode; allowing the simultaneous use of the light at two different test sites. So far; the entire vacuum vessel with the mirror inside is moved into the beam by a linear motor. This results in high translatory inertia and; to compensate the vessel motion; requires vacuum bellows; which have a limited lifetime especially at higher switching frequencies. Therefore; in the recent design the mirror is shifted by piezo motors operated inside the vessel under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However; temperature measurements revealed that during continuous operation the motor reaches up to 90°C only when exposed to air; necessitating long breaks to allow it to cool.

Neustadt; Austria; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; MedAustron is an ion beam therapy center located in Wiener Neustadt; Austria. The design is based on CERN’s Proton-Ion Medical Machine Study and the project is currently in the installation and commissioning phase. This paper summarizes the design; production and commissioning of MedAustron’s beam profile grid monitor. This monitor measures the beam profile in the low and medium energy beam transfer line where the beam dimensions can be as large as 100 mm. Reasonable position resolution is achieved with a harp consisting of 64 wires per plane and a pitch of up to 1.7 mm. Special effort was needed to produce such harps and bring the signal cables out of the vacuum. As the readout electronics has to cope with DC as well as pulsed beam all 128 wires are acquired simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating the charge during the “flat-top” of the beam pulse and storing it for serial transmission to the back end electronics for conversion. The high accuracy requires calibration of offset and amplification errors for every single channel. A NI PXI FPGA card controls the readout chain.

The ion source; the 3 MeV RFQ and the medium energy transport (MEBT) hosting a chopper; have been commissioned in a dedicated test stand. Wire grids and wire scanners were used to measure the transverse beam profile and a slit/grid emittance meter was installed on a temporary test bench plugged at the RFQ and MEBT exit in different stages. The emittance meter slit was also used as a scanning scraper able to reconstruct the transverse profile by measuring the transmission with a downstream current transformer. On the same measurement bench; a spectrometer in conjunction with a wire grid allowed measuring the energy spread of the particles.

Following these tests it was decided to install a new bending magnet diagnostics beam port dedicated primarily to a permanent emittance measurement using X-ray lens imaging. The new beam port is equipped with a thin (0.6 mm) double CVD diamond window instead of 3 mm aluminium used at the pinhole beam ports. This increases the X-ray transmission; especially at low energies. The imaging and emittance measurement using aluminium lenses is discussed in comparison to the emittance measurement based on pinhole imaging. Although the principle works correctly; the setup presents different practical difficulties; such as low signal intensity and heat load.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/wepf11_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/wepf11.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/wepf11_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-WEPF11,833

X-rays are produced by colliding the 40 MeV electron beam from a pulsed S-band LINAC with infrared laser pulses from a mode-locked free-electron laser driven by the same electron beam. The electron and laser beams are focused to 60 micron diameters at the interaction point to achieve high scattering efficiency. This wire-scanner allows for high resolution measurements of the size and position of both the laser and electron beams at the interaction point to verify spatial coincidence. Time resolved measurements of secondary emission current allow us to monitor the transverse spatial evolution of the e-beam throughout the duration of a 4 microsecond macropulse while the laser is simultaneously profiled by pyrometer measurement of the occulted infrared beam.

The beam is first externally focused at the first bend and the OSR generated there is used to image the beam. Subsequently; any pair of bends produces interferences (OSRI) whose visibility can used to determine the beam divergence. The properties of different configuration of bends in the chicane have been analyzed to provide an optimum diagnostic design for a given set of beam parameters which: 1) provides a sufficient number of OSRI fringes to allow a measurement of the beam divergence; 2) minimizes the competing effect of energy spread on the fringe visibility; 3) minimizes the effect of coherent synchrotron radiation and space charge on the beam emittance; and 4) minimizes the effect of compression on the bunch length; as the beam passes through the chicane.

In order to produce and maintain such electron bunches; sophisticated single-shot diagnostics are desired e.g. emittance; energy; energy-spread and bunch-length measurement. There are three methods at REGAE for charge measurement. The most routine method is based on Faraday-cups that are distributed along machine and can provide charge reading down to ~50 fC. The second method; which is non-destructive; is a cavity based antenna that measures beam induced fields. A third method is based on beam-profile measurement diagnostics. By proper calibration of integral intensity that arrives at detector one can measure charges down to fC level.

Designed for longitudinal and transversal Schottky signals; the Sensor features a pillbox cavity with attached waveguide filters utilizing the Monopole mode at 200 MHz for longitudinal and the Dipole mode at around 330 MHz for transversal Schottky measurements. Separated coupling structures allow for mode-selective coupling to measure the different Schottky planes independently. A ceramic vacuum shielding inside the pillbox is implemented to enable non-hermetic adjustable coupling; tuning devices and waveguide structures. Simulations of the structure with focus on the impact of the coupling structures and the ceramic vacuum shielding on the R-over-Q values and the coupling are presented as well as measurements of a scaled demonstrator including comparisons with the simulations.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/wepf35_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/wepf35.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/wepf35_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-WEPF35,907

Cherenkov radiation (CR) in the X-ray region in the vicinity of the absorption edges is one of the promising sources for relativistic charged particle beam diagnostics. In this work we have demonstrated CR characteristics in the X-ray region significantly depend on the energy of the emitted photons; because the CR is only generated in the frequency region in the vicinity of the atomic absorption edges; where the well-known Cherenkov condition is work. This peculiarity can be explained by resonance behaviour of the permittivity in the frequency range. It will result in the fact that the CR will stand out of any other types of polarisation radiation both on intensity and shape of angular distribution giving a unique opportunity to apply this phenomenon for charged particle beam diagnostics.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/wepf36_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/wepf36.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/wepf36_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-WEPF36,910

At high intensity and low energies (i.e. γ≈1); space charge effects can significantly modify the tune spectra in comparison to the classical low intensity spectra. Systematic studies were performed at GSI SIS-18 to observe these characteristic modifications; mainly resulting from the shift of the head-tail modes in direct dependence of beam intensity and synchrotron tune frequency. In this contribution; an interpretation of the tune spectra modification based on quasi-analytical models and numerical simulations will be presented. Extraction of elusive beam parameters such as incoherent tune shift; machine impedances; chromaticity; etc. from the spectra will be demonstrated.

This new current monitor will abort the beam when the difference between two toroidal pickups exceeds a threshold. The MEBT DBCM will protect the MEBT chopper target while the SCL DBCM will abort beam to minimize fast beam losses in the SCL cavities. The new DBCM will also record instances of errant beam such as beam drop-outs to assist in further optimization of the SNS Accelerator. A software Errant Beam Monitor was implemented on the regular BCM hardware to study errant beam pulses. The new system will take over this functionality and will also be able to abort beam on pulse to pulse variations. as it is based on the FlexRIO hardware programmed in LabVIEW FPGA and can abort beam in 5 us.

IBIC2013,,FRWMJ1,SLAC LCLS Cavity BPM Upgrade Project,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Patrick summarized the experience of the SLAC LCLS X-Band (11.4 GHz) cavity BPM system; which has been in operation for several years. Even though the system meets the requirements; some of the original design ideas proved to be not optimal in practice; e.g. the ridged waveguide coupling between pickup and receiver; the pickup support structure; complex tuning of the BPM resonators; etc. Based on this experience Patrick presented a redesigned cavity-BPM pickup; with a loaded-Q ~2000. It now utilizes a waveguide-to coaxial transition; and semi-flexible coaxial cables to connect to the RF electronics. Detailed EM simulations; including an analysis of mechanical tolerances has been performed at SLAC; a prototype has been produced in collaboration with PAL (Pohang Accelerator Laboratory; South Korea). The new pickup design is also more relaxed on tolerances; thus the tight tuning requirements could be reduced. A prototype has been installed at LCLS; and the first beam tests are underway. There was a question addressed to the material; copper vs. Cu-plated stainless steel: SLAC has got years of experience brazing copper; so this is preferred material. The answer to another question; the x-y cross talk: 20dB before; 30dB after tuning.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/frwmj1_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/frwmj1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/frwmj1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-FRWMJ1,
IBIC2013,,FRWMJ2,LCLS-II Cavity BPMs Electronics,SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; Andrew presented the related read-out electronics for the new LCLS X-Band cavity BPM pickup. It turned out that the waveguide mixers in the current system suffer from a bias voltage degradation; which alters the overall gain. These components are not anymore available; and start to cause a serious issue. The new read-out system with coaxial inputs is based on the same classical heterodyne RF downconverter schema and a digitizer to convert the IF to baseband; which actually is used in most cavity BPM implementations. The 3-channel (X; Y; REF) RF section is located in the tunnel; and includes a commercial communication interface for remote operations on attenuators; etc. A 4th spare channel is also located on the PCB. The LO; based on a commercial PLL board (?); and is phase-locked to the accelerator RF system. The 14-bit digitizer from Struck rests in a μTCA crate; located outside the tunnel. The RF board is made from a multilayer PCB; made from FR4; with embedded Rogers Duroid layers for the high frequency sections. The RF front-end provides ~80dB dynamic range; plus attenuator settings; and a NF=3dB. The IF section provides 34dB gain. In the following we shortly mentioned the pros and cons of a downconverter schema versus a simple diode detector. The common opinion is that the direct diode baseband detection results in substantially higher noise floor. It also was mentioned that the limited return loss of diodes (or input filters in case of a downconverter) might cause an unwanted asymmetries between the two arms of the cavity BPM outputs. Other discussion points where on the PLL. Great care has to be taken on the loop filter design; particular in case of fractional PLLs. A high frequency for the PLL should be considered; this would result in a lower phase noise. Is phase-locking to the accelerator RF beneficial? It may result in a better resolution measurement; but the resolution stops reacting to some systematic effects; and it is beneficial to keep it sensitive to have an indicator of the system health. In addition; unlocked LO is beneficial for model-independent methods applied to waveforms as the whole phase space is covered in that case.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/talks/frwmj2_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/papers/frwmj2.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/IBIC2013/posters/frwmj2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2013-FRWMJ2,

As of limited manpower resources; the 6.5GHz cavity BPM system builds as much as possible upon industrial components. The analog front-end solution is somewhat untypical; and generated some interesting discussion. Instead of the usual heterodyne downconverter; a hybrid based RF detector rectifies the signals in front of the μATCA-based digitizer. Phase shifters are used to zero calibrate the channels; as well as a calibration tone feed through the reference channel.
